0,,108,0.311,1,2004-01-21,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I see there  are a few Democrats on the floor today;  they are busy preparing their ‘‘I hate  George Bush’’ speeches for the day. We  finished last night with a message from  the President of  the United States  about the hopeful optimism this country has and the things that we can do  together if we only stop bickering and  start working  towards our  common  goals.  The war on terrorism is his single  focus; and  since September  11, our  homeland has been safe. Liberating the  world has been his hallmark, and today  we can claim that Libya is now negotiating with the United States. North  Korea is finally talking about putting  aside their hatefulness. India and Pakistan are joining together for conversations that are hopeful and helpful for  solving the world’s problems.  This President has  led effectively,  honorably, and with distinction.  At the end of the State of the Union  speech, the minority leader went on to  describe how reckless, basically, this  President has been. I disagree vehemently and strongly.  I applaud our  President. I applaud the state of the  Union. The economy is growing stronger, unemployment  is  reducing  itself  and we are finding ourselves in a better  place, thanks to his leadership.  God bless this great Nation and, as  the chaplain said, God bless our President. f  HONORING MICHAEL GALE  (Mrs. CAPITO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

1,,108,0.259,1,2004-01-21,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to honor Michael Gale, an exceptional student in my district in West  Virginia, and one of my constituents.  Michael was recently awarded one of  12 George Mitchell Scholarships  for  postgraduate studies at universities in  Ireland and Northern Ireland. Michael  is the first West Virginia resident ever  to receive this prestigious award and  will study at the National University  of Ireland in Galway.  The Mitchell Scholarship was established by an endowment from the Irish  Government in 1998 and is administered  by  the  U.S.-Ireland  Alliance.  The  House has supported funding for the  Mitchell Scholarship both in 2003 and  2004. The British Government also provides support for this program.  I offer my congratulations to Michael  Gale, an exceptional young West Virginian, and the other 11 winners of the  Mitchell Scholarship and wish them all  the best in their studies in Ireland.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF HAROLD  J. ‘‘TEX’’ LEZAR, JUNIOR  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

3,House,108,-0.487,8,2004-01-21,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume as I prepare to close.  Listening to the discussion reminds  me of the fact that I spent some time  as a big brother, and I think I may  have gotten more out of the relationship than the young fellow who was my  little brother. I remember a few years  ago I got a call from a fellow who said  to me that Vice President Al Gore was  coming to town and did I want to meet  with him. I said, well, I would not  mind. He says, do you know who this  is? I said, well, no, I really do not. He  said, this is Courtney Miller, your little brother, and of course, Courtney  had grown up and at that particular  time was working for the Vice President of the United States.  I also served for about 12 years as the  commissioner of Boy Scouts  in my  community, and just day before yesterday I was at a Martin Luther King  celebration, and there was a young fellow there who had become a minister,  Jonathan Carter. As Jonathan participated in the services, he says, well, you  know, I used to be a Boy Scout when  you were the scouting commissioner  and I have now become what I am. He  said, I remember you coming to our  Eagle Scout celebration and talking  about how great it was.  So my point is that oftentimes those  who serve as mentors will get as much  from the relationship as the young people  that  they  associate  themselves  with.  I listened to the chairman talking  about the fact that everybody can be a  part of this. One does not really need  to have a degree. One does not need to  have a title. One does not need to be an  elected official. One does not have to  be anything special other than themselves.  We have just finished celebrating the  life of Dr. Martin Luther King, and one  of the things that Dr. King often would  say is that everybody can be great because everybody can serve. When  it  comes to mentoring young people, no  matter who we are and where we are,  we can serve. We can be a part of helping to grow and develop the  life of  someone else.  So, again, I commend the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. OSBORNE) for this  resolution and urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time. ",2004
4,House,108,0.299,8,2004-01-21,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for his comments and his commitment to mentoring. Ofttimes we hear the complaint  ‘‘too busy,’’ and yet I have found the  time over the last 4 years, sometimes  it is Saturday, sometimes it is a Monday, sometimes it is Friday, to meet  regularly with a mentoree. I mentor a  young person and also several members  from my office have been mentoring  here on Capitol Hill.  So, again, I would urge my colleagues  to encourage their office staff to do the  same. ",2004
5,House,108,0.458,8,2004-01-21,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  support the National Mentoring Month Resolution  introduced  by  Congressman  TOM  OSBORNE. This resolution recognizes and supports the efforts of mentoring programs across  our Nation. It embraces the notion that volunteer mentors can change the life of a troubled  teen. This resolution celebrates the month of  January as a month-long campaign  focused  on raising awareness of mentoring programs,  their impact on our youth, and information on  how to volunteer to become a mentor.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor to  Congressman  resolution.  Both  Coach OSBORNEand I worked as mentors before coming to Congress and both felt a need  OSBORNE’s  to raise awareness of the cause once we were  elected.  Last  Congress,  we  successfully  passed  the Mentoring  for Success program,  which provided money to start up new mentoring programs across the country. We also  fought for increased Federal funding for local  mentoring programs bringing that total to $100  million this year. In addition, we founded the  Congressional Mentoring Caucus, a bipartisan  organization designed to disseminate information about the positive impact mentoring programs have on our Nation’s children.  Mentoring programs offer many benefits to  children, particularly as it relates to educating  our children. These programs are proven  to  help prevent children  from dropping out of  high school. In the state of Florida, we had a  big problem. Only 53 percent of our children  were graduating from high school. So, in Central Florida, we decided to do something about  it by  creating  the Orlando/Orange County  Compact Program. The Compact Program is a  mentoring program that matches up students  at  risk of dropping out of high school with  mentors  from  the business community. The  mentors meet with the students 1 hour a week  to work on homework and projects.  The  results  from  this mentoring program  have been dramatic. Over a period of 10  years, 98 percent of the children in the Compact Program  have  graduated  from  high  school— the No. 1 graduation  rate  in  the  United States.  I would also like to discuss the crime prevention benefits of mentoring programs.  In  Florida, 70 percent of the inmates in our jails  and prisons are high school dropouts. It costs  taxpayers $25,000 a year  for each Federal  prisoner, compared with only $5,000 a year to  educate a student in our public schools. Clearly, making  the  investment  in mentoring programs now will save us literally hundreds of  millions of dollars down the road in terms of  reduced jail costs and reduced welfare costs.  In summary, mentoring programs make a  meaningful difference in the lives of our young  people;  they  improve  education,  prevent  crimes, and will save us money. I urge all of  my colleagues to support National Mentoring  Month by participating  in  local programs  in  their home districts— together we can make a  difference in the lives of our children.

6,House,108,-0.343,8,2004-01-21,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I am  honored to join my colleague from Nebraska,  TOMOSBORNE, in support of House Resolution  491, which recognizes the critical role of mentors in our children’s lives.  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ‘ It is one  of the most beautiful compensations of this life  that no man can sincerely try to help another  without helping himself.’ I can think of no better way to summarize  the true reward of mentoring than by recognizing the inherent truth in this statement.  The mentoring partnership  is unique, because it is one of the few relationships where  both sides stand to benefit immensely.  Both individuals bring their own— and oftentimes, very different— set of life experiences to  the  table, and  this has  the pleasantly surprising effect of forcing us outside of our own  comfort zones.  It is easy for us to relate to those with whom  we share obvious similarities, but venturing  outside of that comfort zone gives us the opportunity to view the world from an entirely different perspective.  While it may seem too difficult, or uncomfortable at  first, you will  find  that you are a  richer person for it in the end.

8,House,108,0.519,15,2004-01-21,Mr. DOOLITTLE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD).  (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
9,House,108,0.246,15,2004-01-21,Mr. LAHOOD.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  DOOLITTLE) for yielding me this time.  On December 9, 2003, the citizens of  Illinois lost one of the true giants in  the storied history of politics in our  State. Paul Simon was a leader who  transcended political or ideological labels.  To be sure, he was a staunch liberal  who  fought  for better housing,  fair  wages, a cleaner environment, and civil  justice. At  the  same  time, he also  leaned conservative when it came to  fiscal matters.  But it was the way he carried out the  job that made Paul a revered figure in  a State that is accustomed to largerthan-life  figures.  Paul  Simon  represented an approach to politics that is  becoming more and more rare in today’s world, an approach in which he  not only respected the people he represented but he respected the people  who were his peers and the institutions  in which he  served,  including  this  House and the other body.  When I was first elected to the House  in 1994, Paul was the senior Senator  from  Illinois, and he  took  time  to  reach out to me so we could become  better acquainted and work on issues  of mutual concern.  As a leading Member of the Senate, I  am  sure  that he had many better  things to do than getting to know a  first-term Member of the House, but  that was the way Paul did business. He  knew that good relationships were important in politics and legislating, and  I am a better Member of the House for  Paul Simon’s efforts to get to know  me.  When Paul retired from the Senate  following the 1996 election, he certainly  could have landed some lucrative lobbying contracts, but he chose instead  to continue influencing public policy  through a different arena, one that  could have a lasting impression on generations of future public servants, that  is, teaching. From his perch as director  of Public Policy Institute at Southern  Illinois University, he  continued  to  stay in the public eye, and he was able  to carry on his advocacy for many of  the issues he held so dear. He wrote  prolifically on many issues during his  time at SIU. He continued to travel the  world to talk about the issues in which  he so passionately believed. I would  imagine he was as busy in his role with  the institute as he was during his time  in the Senate.  And to this day I am sure Paul Simon’s approval numbers in Illinois are  higher  than  any  politician  in  our  State.  Paul is someone who should be used  as a benchmark, not only for future  generations of leaders but for today’s  politicians as well. Paul Simon taught  us  that  one  can  really  get  ahead  through  civility,  common  courtesy,  and a respect for those with opposing  viewpoints. That is a far cry from what  many of our citizens believe  today  about their elected representatives. All  of us could do this job a little better if  we follow in the footsteps and examples  of Paul Simon.  I might say that when I first got to  the House, Paul recommended that I  get involved in a program called Everybody Wins, which is a reading program  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:18 Jan 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K21JA7.027 H21PT1 ’ ",2004

Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, thanks  to what I consider extremist policies of  President Bush and  the Republican  leadership here in Congress, the priorities of the American people, priorities  of  good  jobs,  better  access  to  healthcare and the best education for  our children, are not being addressed,  either at the White House or here by  the House Republican majority, and  certainly the President’s speech  last  night did nothing to convince me that  any of these priorities will be addressed  in the forthcoming year.

14,House,108,-0.396,36,2004-01-21,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned throughout this Special Order  today, Michigan has lost so many manufacturing jobs, more than any other  State. We actually got together, the  congressional  delegation,  and  the  Democrats  in particular, along with  our governor, Governor Granholm, and  actually put  together a proposal, a  HELP proposal as we called it: Health  insurance, employment benefits, liabilities of the pension fund so they have a  pension when they retire, and then a  U.S. dollar policy. We laid out a very  thoughtful document and sent it up to  the White House and the President and  asked them to at least comment on it  and join with us because no economy in  this world can exist without at least a  strong manufacturing base; and we are  losing it so quickly in this country, especially the last few years.  So we put forth our proposal called  HELP. Unfortunately, we have not  heard anything back from the White  House.  I know  they have been on  break.  Now  we  have  the  budget  wrapped up, so maybe we will take a  look at  it. But there are, Governor  Granholm, some of us in the House and  at least on the Michigan Democratic  congressional delegation, trying to do  something because we  feel  strongly  that if you do not have a strong manufacturing base, service industry is fine,  high-tech, all that is fine, but you still  need a basic manufacturing base to  your country. So we put forth a proposal. Again, we are willing to work  with the President on that because we  do have to keep good-paying manufacturing jobs here in this country. They  cannot all go south, and we have to do  some  things  to help  out  pensions,  health care, employment benefits and  the value of the dollar as a big impact  on our goods overseas.  So we hope that we can work with  this administration and this President  in addressing those concerns we have  on manufacturing.  ",2004
15,House,108,0.435,36,2004-01-21,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker, the subject of this Special Order, and I hope to  be joined by several of my colleagues,  is going to be narcotics policy in the  United States and a number of success  stories we have had.  We often talk about the problems and  challenges as chairman of  the Subcommittee on Drug Policy, the committee that has oversight over all drug  issues but also authorizing over the Office of National Drug Control Policy,  so-called Drug Czar, Director John  Walters. We have authorizing and oversight on all drug issues.  Before I get directly into the subject  of this Special Order, I wanted to say a  few words about last night’s wonderful  address on this floor and to this assembly.  If the President had included every  single thing of importance and everything we have in our budget, we would  still be sitting here this morning. So I  first want to thank the President for  finishing his speech in 60 minutes.  My colleagues were  sharing many  concerns that I share as well. That is  why our budgets are this thick. That is  why we debate all year long on appropriations. But the goal of the State of  the Union address is to set a basic vision for where our country is headed;  and I thought President Bush did a remarkable job of outlining the major  challenges that we face. b1445  We are not a county or a city council. We are not mayors. We are not governors. First and foremost, this body  and the President of the United States  and the United States Senate have to  do  international  policy. States  and  local governments cannot do  things  like the challenges we faced after 9/11  in trying to root out terrorism in Afghanistan, root out terrorism in the  funding and the harboring of terrorists  in Iraq, to try to break up these networks worldwide, and  the President  definitely had his  focus on the one  thing that only the President can lead  in and that was our national security.  He said, very eloquently, after the first  World Trade Center attack and the  bombing occurred  there,  the people  were served with subpoenas, they went  through our court process, but then the  terrorist groups came back and hit us  even bigger. We cannot just issue subpoenas. We have to tackle the problem  head-on.  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:18 Jan 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K21JA7.083 H21PT1 ",2004
16,House,108,0.34,43,2004-01-21,Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I recently visited a prison in  my district, a Federal prison; and 80  percent of those there were addicted to  a drug. I believe the figure was 60 percent were there because they were selling drugs. That is a huge figure, $35,000  per person to incarcerate people. We  certainly can afford to invest in drug  treatment and in prevention.  But I wanted to mention the issue of  methamphetamine  again.  The  gentleman talked about the big labs in  California. I come from a very rural  area. There  is hardly a month that  goes by that in our local community, a  small town, the local paper talks of another meth bust, another lab found.  And I want to tell the Members the  story of Suzie. Her name is not Suzie,  but I want to protect the family. I remember vividly when Suzie moved to  our area. She married a person locally  who was very successful, a family. She  was pleasant. She was attractive. She  was smart. And as years rolled by, I  had heard that Suzie might have a cocaine problem. I did not know. But I do  know this: over a year ago, or maybe it  was 2 years ago now, there was a major  meth bust in our region, and it was  proven that she was one of the kingpins. She was the person who was buying the material, a lot of the material  to make methamphetamines, at  the  hardware store: lye, paint thinners, a  lot of chemicals that one would not  think have anything to do with ingesting in one’s body. In fact, in my region  the drug stores have all the Sudafedtype health medicines behind the pharmacy because they do not allow them  out there because they are being purchased by people who come in time and  time again and get them because that  is a main ingredient to make meth. So  it shows us the problem is rampant. It  took 4 years to get the kingpin. DEA,  the State drug team, the local police  worked 4 years to get the person. And  Suzie was the person who helped them  nail him because before  they never  could get the kingpin. And he is now in  prison, I think, for 40 or 45 years. But  residue is he has taught so many people how to make high-quality meth  that we  remain a meth production  area. And the police tell me they just  do not know how to get their arms  around it because every time they turn  around, they hear another lead, they go  check, they find another meth lab. I  mean, they are everywhere.  So that is a story of a destroyed life.  The final page on Suzie is I got to  know her pretty well because she was  volunteering in the nursing homes and  the personal care homes and my mother was there, and she was always very  nice to my mother and we talked a bit.  And I always wanted to sit down with  her and talk with her about how it happened because she was going out also  speaking  to  school  groups. Several  months ago on a Sunday morning,  after friends had talked to her on Saturday night and she was in good spirits, she was found hanging in an old  pump house in the woods, dead. Suzie  lost her  life because we heard,  the  kingpin said, and I do not know if they  can ever prove it, but the kingpin said  she will not live long. Suzie did not live  long. She was a person in her late 40s.  She was a mature woman. She was attractive. She was smart. But she got  hooked on drugs. And if a person her  age can get hooked, how vulnerable are  our eighth, ninth and tenth graders as  they are still growing and working to  become adults? And that is why drug  testing is so important. It is about protecting kids, not about penalizing kids.  ",2004
17,House,108,0.627,43,2004-01-21,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker, I  do have some disagreements with the  gentleman as to the best way to attack  this problem, but I certainly agree that  we should make sure that young people  understand just how serious the problem is for them and that there would  be no greater method of telling them  and putting a stamp of disapproval on  it than making sure they have to have  a drug test.  But the gentleman referred to on the  chart there some of the decrease  in  drug use that we have had over the last  2 years, and I think that a lot of that  can be attributed also to a stamp of  disapproval that the young people understand that our society has given  just in the last few years. In the last  administration, I think that it could be  accurately said that people who were  out fighting this problem were faced by  an administration that trivialized the  use of drugs as to what kind of threat  it was when the President talked about  not inhaling and such. And some of us  who have had pretty wild youths in our  time looked at that and said this man  is not being serious, and the young people looked at the President and said  this is not being serious, and our administration’s seriousness on this has  had a lot to do with the reduction in  the use of drugs.

22,Senate,108,-0.443,99,2004-01-21,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President, I  welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the impressive work of Michael  Manganiello of the Coalition for the  Advancement of Medical Research, who  is working skillfully on behalf of patients  across America  to  turn  the  promise of medical research into the  reality of new cures and better treatments. As the president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical  Research for the past 2 years and Vice  President of the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, he has provided extraordinary leadership to community  advocates for medical research. As the  leader of an effective coalition to prevent restrictions on stem cell research,  he is working to enable future generations  to benefit  from  scientific advances that can barely be imagined.  Mr. Manganiello is effectively teaching both Congress and the public about  the complex topic and the immense potential of stem cell research. His outreach to local communities has raised  awareness for these issues to those it  will help the most, millions of men,  women and children in families across  the country who bear the burden of debilitating diseases. He works diligently  with the scientific and policy communities to realize the full benefits of current research and expand our ability to  pursue promising new lines of research.  His skill in working toward consensus  has benefited us all.  Through his many contributions to  the advancement of medical research,  Michael Manganiello has made a daily  difference  in our nation’s well-being  that will become more and more obvious in the years to come. I commend  him for his outstanding public service  to our country.  f  MURKOWSKI SMALL STATE HOME PROGRAM  EQUITY ACT  ",2004
23,Senate,108,-0.267,99,2004-01-21,Mr. DORGAN.," Madam President,  I  rise to support legislation that Senator  introduced last November  that would  bring  some  fairness  to  States such as North Dakota and Alaska with low populations. I am proud to  cosponsor S.  1851,  the Small State  HOME Program Equity Act.  This legislation would increase the  minimum  funding  level provided  to  low-population States for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program. The HOME Investment  Partnership Program distributes funds  to State and local governments to expand housing for low-income families.  It is one of the most important tools  that States,  local governments, and  nonprofits have to respond to affordable housing needs. The program helps  both renters and homebuyers across  the  country  by  rehabilitating  substandard housing and funding new construction.  The HOME Investment Partnership  Program has been enormously successful in providing housing for those in  need, and I have been a strong supporter of annual appropriations for this  important program. For the last several years, I have joined many of my  colleagues in sending a letter to Senators BOND and MIKULSKI, the chairman and ranking member of the VA–  HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations  Subcommittee,  supporting  robust funding for the HOME program.  Since 1992, the first year in which  funds were appropriated for this program, HOME funds have been dispersed  by a statutory formula, which is based  in part on a State’s population. At the  time the program was created, a minimum funding level of $3 million was  established for States which would receive a small amount of HOME funds  under the allocation formula.  Over the last 10 years, inflation has  significantly eroded the value of this  minimum allocation and it is very difficult for States to meet their housing  needs on only the minimum allocation  of HOME funds. In Grand Forks County  in North Dakota, for example, the wait  list for HOME rehabilitation funding is  estimated to be 11 years. I would imagine that the situation is similar in the  10 States that are not currently receiving a level of funding that allows them  to run effective programs with their  HOME dollars.  This is unacceptable. States with low  populations deserve to have adequate  funding to meet the unique housing  needs of rural areas where construction  and rehabilitation costs are often very  high. The congressionally appointed,  bipartisan Millennium Housing Commission also recognized this problem.  It recommended  increasing the minimum State  funding  level  for  the  HOME program to $5 million in their  May 30, 2002, report to Congress.  I look forward to working with Senator MURKOWSKIon this important legislation to meet the housing needs of  low-income families in rural America.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO MARSHA GOODWIN-  BECK  ∑",2004
24,Senate,108,-0.231,99,2004-01-21,Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.," Madam  President, I am saddened to report that  on December 18, 2003, our Nation lost  one of  its  leading advocates  for the  care of older veterans, Marsha Goodwin-Beck. The Director of Geriatrics  for the Veterans Health Administration from 1989 until her death, she dedicated her career to serving veterans in  many capacities.  Ms. Goodwin-Beck was instrumental  in the growth and development of VA’s  nationally  prominent Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Centers,  as well as its multidisciplinary geriatric training programs. She also had a  key role in coordinating the implementation  of  the Veterans Millennium  Health Act of 1999, a bill that made an  impact on a countless number of our  Nation’s veterans. Ms. Goodwin-Beck  began her career at VA in 1983 as an  education specialist, later moving into  various positions with the Office of  Geriatrics and Extended Care. In 2003,  VA recognized her long-time service on  behalf of older veterans by awarding  her the VA Undersecretary for Health  Commendation.  As a testament to her expertise, Ms.  Goodwin-Beck authored  several articles on geriatric and  long-term care  issues. She also was active in local and  national nursing organizations, including as a founding member of the National Alliance for Caregiving, and she  served on the Education Committee of  the Gerontological Society of America.  Shortly before her death, Ms. Goodwin-  Beck was elected to the national board  of directors of the American Geriatrics  Society.  Prior to her Government service, Ms.  Goodwin-Beck had a distinguished career in clinical care as a certified adult  nurse practitioner and nurse educator.  Between 1981 and 1982, she was awarded  a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation  fellowship as a primary care nurse  practitioner at the University of Maryland. Ms. Goodwin-Beck was also an assistant professor at Catholic University’s School of Nursing and was on  faculty for the university’s Teaching  Nursing Home project. In addition, she  was  a  consultant  to  the American  Health Care Association, coauthored  the book ‘‘How to Be a Nursing Aide in  a Nursing Home,’’ and conducted workshops on quality assurance for staff in  nursing homes throughout the country.  On behalf of the members and staff of  the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, our hearts and thoughts are with  Ms. Goodwin-Beck’s husband, Jeffrey  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:17 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S21JA4.REC S21JA4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004
25,,108,-0.338,120,2004-01-21,Mr. BISHOP of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  to express my deep admiration and respect for the brave soldiers of the New York  Air National Guard’s 106th Air Rescue Wing  who recently returned home  from service  in  Operation Enduring Freedom. The brave men  and women of the 106th Air Rescue Wing are  among the most talented and best-trained rescue specialists in the world.  Of course, while I am pleased these heroes  are out of the line of fire, the 106th is never  out of harm’s way. Most Americans first heard  about the 106th because of a heroic rescue  effort, which was recounted in the book and  movie ‘ ‘The Perfect Storm.’  They deserve our  deepest gratitude  for putting  themselves on  the front lines in war and peace.  The 106th Air Rescue Wing’s extraordinary  service in Iraq is the latest chapter in the storied history of this unit. During its time overseas, the unit was involved in numerous rescues,  including  from  the October 12, 2003  bombing of  the Baghdad Hotel and after a  Chinook helicopter went down on November  2, 2003, a deplorable terrorist act that took the  lives of 16 American soldiers. After this incident, members of the 106th Rescue Wing recovered  two soldiers  from  the downed helicopter and brought them to safety where they  received  treatment. There  is no more noble  service than risking one’s own life to save the  life of a fellow soldier.  Mr.  Speaker,  as  the  representative  of  Gabreski Airport in Westhampton, Long Island,  home of the 106th Air Rescue Wing, I could  not be more proud of our soldiers returning  home. I am truly privileged to represent this  distinguished unit, which is not only a blessing  to the people of Long Island, but to all Americans who benefit from its service. f  A PROCLAMATION HONORING MR.

She was born on January 16, 1924 in Los Angeles  to  Robert  F.  &  Bessie  (Duarte)  Palomares. A  fifth generation native Californian, Theresa is a direct descendent of Don  Ygnacio Palomares,  original Spanish  land  grantee of the historic Rancho San Jose located furthest from San Gabriel Mission and  encompassing  the area  that  today  includes  Pomona, San Dimas, La Verne and adjacent  areas.

The Ohio-based Smucker Company was recently ranked number one on Fortune Magazine ’s annual  ‘Top 100 Companies  to Work  For’  list.  Founded in 1897 in Orrville, Ohio, Smucker  sold  its  first product— apple butter— from  the  back of a horse drawn wagon. Today,  the  company is the market leader for an array of  fruit spreads, toppings, beverages and natural  foods. Smucker employs some 2,430 people  in  the U.S. and maintains 12 manufacturing  plants worldwide.  Since  its  inception  in 1897,  the Smucker  Company has grown to earn a national reputation as a premier and model employer. Sustaining job security and stability for employees  even  through difficult economic  times has  been a recurring theme in the company’s success. In fact, Smucker has never resorted to  layoffs to cope with a lagging economy. Still,  Smucker continues  to enjoy great success.  Sales for the company are up 91 percent from  last year alone.  I applaud  the J.M. Smucker Company  for  this recognition as an exemplary employer and  I wish it continued growth and prosperity. TRIBUTE TO DIANA POULTON  HON.

28,,108,0.348,134,2004-01-21,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and honor an  individual who has  been a tireless supporter of education in my  congressional district. My congressional district has been fortunate to have dynamic and  dedicated  community  leaders who willingly  and unselfishly give their time and talent and  make their communities a better place to live.  Diana Poulton is one of these individuals.  Over  the  last  four years, Diana has been  actively involved with the Science and Technology Education Partnership (STEP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring students  to pursue science and  technology careers. As the Honorary Chairman of STEP, I  have witnessed first-hand Diana’s deep commitment and dedication to building a brighter  future for students in the Inland Empire.  The flagship program for STEP is the annual STEP Conference, which hosts  thousands of 4th through 8th grade students at a  fun-filled learning event dedicated to the exciting world of science and technology. This conference puts thousands of students in contact  with some of the top science and technology  companies  and  organizations, which  they  might otherwise never experience  in  their  school career. With  the  increasing demands  for science and  technology workers and  the  diminished supply  in our  region,  the STEP  Conference is one of the largest in California  and serves as a spark to ignite the imagination of young minds.  This successful conference  takes a great  amount of time and energy to plan and Diana  is an integral part in the planning and execution of the event. It is not uncommon for her  to work after-hours to ensure the conference  will be a success. Not only is she an inspiration to the students but also to the volunteers  who know they can count on her to answer  their questions or help them in any way. Diana  serves a vital role to the STEP organization  and I commend her commitment to STEP, students and education. As a member of  the  Science Committee, I am thankful for people  like Diana Poulton because she sets an example that will serve as a guiding light for others  in the future.  Diana’s tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire in Southern California. She  is part of  the heart and soul of  STEP and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. f  HONORING  THE  RUTHERFORD  COUNTY  CHAMBER  OF  COMMERCE’S 75TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

33,House,108,-0.272,5,2004-02-11,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker, as we take  up H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act, for a third time in the 108th  Congress, I cannot help but feel we still  find ourselves with a flawed piece of  legislation.  Mr. Speaker, the original intent of  this bill was a worthy one, to reimburse Social Security benefits if people  representing  the  recipient  misuse  them. That is not controversial. But  the provision reducing the spousal Social Security benefits  for  countless  teachers, school support personnel, police officers, firefighters and other public  servants  is most  certainly  controversial; and I intend to oppose the  entire bill since it contains this provision and will adversely affect teachers  and others across our State.  Let me say one thing, when teachers  work one day, that does not mean that  they are going to qualify to get a Social Security benefit for 30 years. What  it means is that their spouses who have  paid in 30 or 40 or 50 years into the Social Security system and then they die,  that is money that they have earned,  the family has put into Social Security. That is the money that you will  get.  Now we need to understand that targeting pensions of teachers and other  school employees will discourage qualified  individuals  from  entering  the  classroom at exactly the same time the  Nation is experiencing a shortage of  teachers.  We say we are committed to education, yet  in this bill we are profoundly uncommitted to educators.  I am also a co-sponsor of H.R. 594, a  bill introduced in the 108th Congress  that will eliminate  the Government  Pension Offset  and windfall  elimination  provisions  that  target  our  teachers and other public servants by  denying them the opportunity to retain their full Social Security benefits.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  deeply  disappointed that this provision was included in an otherwise good bill because the rest of the bill is a good bill,  and I compliment my friends.  ",2004
34,House,108,-0.404,26,2004-02-11,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). ",2004
35,House,108,-0.185,26,2004-02-11,Mr. TURNER of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  it does not happen very often on the  floor of this House where a bill comes  forward that has many good provisions  in it, but there is one provision that is  so damaging and so harmful and so unfair that it causes us to oppose an otherwise good bill. But as my colleagues  have heard over and over again today  in this debate, public school teachers  in places like my State of Texas and  other government employees feel very  strongly that the government pension  offset is wrong, that it must be corrected, the law must be changed; and  this bill provided an opportunity to  correct that injustice.  I know from personal experience how  deeply  this  issue  is  felt by public  school teachers.  It was a couple of  years ago in my office that I had a lady  come to see me, and I really did not  know why it was she really wanted to  come see me, but my staff had said this  lady really wants to talk to you, she  needs to see you. So I said, well, let her  come on, I would be glad to visit with  her. I had no idea what it would be  about.  She came and she began to tell me a  story that quickly turned to tears in  her eyes when she told me about how  her husband had passed away just a few  months before. After his death, she  learned that she would not be able to  collect any of the survivor benefits  that she believed, rightfully, her husband had earned by a lifetime of contributions to the Social Security system. She explained to me that the law  apparently said that because she was a  public  school  teacher, an honorable  profession, that somehow the law said  that she could not qualify for survivor  benefits that her husband had contributed for years to ensure that she would  get. She told me, she said, if I had done  anything else, if I had just worked in a  private company, they tell me that I  could get the survivor benefit; but because I am a teacher and receiving a  benefit  from the teacher retirement  system,  that  I am disqualified. Her  tears turned to anger as she said to me,  this is wrong. And as I have learned  over  the  years  since,  teachers  all  across my State of Texas  feel very  strongly about the unfairness of this  provision of the Social Security law.  So I think with an overwhelming majority of this House having signed on to  a bill to eliminate this offset, that we  should have, in good conscience, taken  the opportunity in this legislation to  have corrected that unfair provision of  the Social Security law.  I recognize that there are some who  have logical arguments as to why this  should not be changed, but I will tell  my colleagues that after listening to  this widow with tears in her eyes, I became convinced that she had the better  side of the argument. Oh, I know it is  going to have a cost to the Social Security trust fund to provide this benefit  to all of these public school teachers  who have had spouses who have passed  away before them, but the reality is  that getting it fixed is the right thing  to do.  I would urge my colleagues today to  take what will be perhaps somewhat of  a difficult step and join with those of  us who have stood on this floor arguing  about this point for this entire hour of  debate and vote against a bill that is  otherwise a good bill, to give us the opportunity to correct what we believe,  and many, many public employees believe, is a very unfair provision of the  Social Security law.  I want to commend the gentleman  from Florida for his leadership on Social Security.

37,House,108,0.379,33,2004-02-11,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the bill H.R. 3783, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of  2004.  Although a lot of work has been done  on the reauthorization bill, there are  challenges remaining, including identifying the needed resources to support  funding levels over the next 6 years and  addressing  the  concerns  of  donor  States who want to get a better return  on their contribution to the Highway  Trust Fund.  This short-term extension is a mustpass bill and so, frankly, is the six-year  reauthorization at some point. This is  not, as some try to characterize  it,  pork. This is needed investment in our  Nation’s productive infrastructure.  If we fail to invest in our Nation’s  productive infrastructure, we will become less competitive as an economy,  we will have a less productive economy, higher prices in the stores, less  safe driving on our highways. It is estimated that one out of three deaths on  our highways, some 40,000 a year, could  be  prevented  if we had well-maintained, well-designed, modern  transportation infrastructure.  This is an investment which, if we  fail to make, we are going to pay anyway. The fact is we are not going to  save any money by underinvesting in  our transportation infrastructure as a  country. We will pay in terms of blowing gas out of people’s tailpipes,  in  terms of delay, in terms of inefficiencies in our economy or we can invest  and have something to show for it: a  first-rate transportation system linking our country together, making us  competitive as an economy.  Today, we worry a lot in America  about the growing economic competition we face from across the Pacific in  China. Let me tell you what China is  doing. They are taking a leaf out of our  book. Back 60 years ago, Dwight Eisenhower, who knew something about war  and about competitiveness and about  our country, he stood back, put a cap  as best he could on defense spending  and pulled the lid full speed ahead on  investing in our productive domestic  transportation infrastructure. We built  the interstate highway system.  What did the Soviet Union do? No  roads to speak of. They relied on their  railroads. Forty years later, who had  the better  investment  strategy? We  had something to save for. We were  more competitive as a country, and  they collapsed.  What  is  happening  today  in  the  world? We are talking and debating  about whether we are going to maintain our commitment to a first-rate infrastructure, grow it to accommodate  growth in our economy, grow it to accommodate on the public sector side  the tremendous investment the private  sector has made in communication and  computer technology, to manage data,  which at the end of the day squeeze inventory out of the system, go to justin-time delivery, wonderful things that  make us much more productive. But if  the goods cannot be moved efficiently,  none of that pays off the way it otherwise can.  What is China planning to do today?  They are planning over the next 15  years to replicate our interstate transportation system, four-lane highways  linking that continent. They are planning on doing in 15 years what it took  us 60 years to do. If we fail to meet this  challenge, where will we be? What will  we have to show for all this supposed  savings that we make as a country by  underinvesting  in our  infrastructure?  We will  leave our children and our  grandchildren disarmed in the face of  that challenge.  So I ask my colleagues to put aside  the rhetoric, recognize that there are  different kinds of  spending  in  this  world. Everyone says their spending is  investment. This  is real  investment.  You have got something to show for it.  We will leave a legacy to our children  and our grandchildren that we can be  proud of and that they can benefit  from. This is must-pass legislation, and  we are going to have to pay for it if we  are going to want to get something for  it.  I urge my colleagues to support the  passage of the continuing resolution  before us today. It is vitally important  that this bill be passed by both the  House and the Senate and delivered to  the President before February 29. Our  economy cannot withstand the shutdown of the national surface transportation programs, and it cannot withstand a kind of gnawing away and erosion of our commitment in this area  otherwise, either. If we do that, we will  regret it in years to come. ",2004

Now we need to shift to force  backed by diplomacy.’’  And listen to what she says less than  a month later: ‘‘Month after month we  have given Iraq chance after chance to  move from confrontation to cooperation, and we have explored and exhausted every diplomatic action. We  will see now whether  force can persuade Iraq’s misguided leaders to reverse course and to accept at long last  the need to abide by the rule of law and  the will of the world.’’ These were remarks made by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on  the night of the air strikes, the very  limited air strikes, against strategic  targets  in Iraq, her comments made  December 16, 1998.  What happened over the next 2 years?  Nothing. These limited air strikes did  nothing, and Saddam continued with  his weapons of mass destruction, his  terrorism on his own people, his refusal  to  let the weapons  inspectors come  back into the country and make sure  he was complying with the U.N. resolutions.  ",2004
43,House,108,0.516,54,2004-02-11,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Speaker, there  are those who say that this administration was the first to try to create a  link between al Qaeda and Iraq. That is  absolutely wrong.  In 1998, again with the attack on the  plant in Sudan: ‘‘U.S. officials who declined to be identified told reporters  that there were contacts as the Sudanese company was being developed between Al Shifa officials and  Iraqis  working on their country’s VX program. ‘Iraq is the only country we are  aware  of  that had  planned  to use  WMD,’ the officials said. The officials  also  said  there  is  evidence  linking  Osama bin Laden. Defense Secretary  Cohen has publicly  stated  that bin  Laden had some financial interest in  contributing to this particular facility  in Khartoum.’’ Where is that? How do we know if  Secretary of Defense William Cohen  said  that?  ‘‘We know  that he, bin  Laden, had contributed to this particular facility,’’ Secretary of Defense  William Cohen, New York Times, August 29, 1998.  Another quote: ‘‘And indeed we have  information that Iraq has assisted in  the  chemical  weapons  activity  in  Sudan.’’ That is an op-ed by Samuel  Berger, the national security advisor,  the Washington Times, October  16,  1998.  He goes on in that activity: ‘‘And, indeed, we have information that Iraq  has assisted in the chemical weapons  activity in Sudan . . . We had information linking bin Laden to the Sudanese  regime and the Al Shifa plant.’’ National security advisor, Samuel Berger,  op-ed, October 16  in the Washington  Times.  It is interesting. This link between  Saddam Hussein, Iraq, terrorist organizations, and the threat that they combine to depose the United States and  the rest of the world is not new. It has  been outlined through the 1990s.  I yield to my colleague.  ",2004

I am proud to stand here tonight as  an American, indeed, an African American. I am proud to live in America, the  land of the free and the home of the  brave, the  land of opportunity. But  there is a problem. There are some for  whom the promise of America is not  being  realized. They are  the unemployed, the laid off, the jobless, those  whose unemployment has run out, and  those who have been looking for a job  so long that they have given up.  America can do better. Why are we  not doing better? I submit it is because  we have the wrong priorities, and I submit that the budget that our President  presented  to us  last week has  the  wrong priorities.  I want to talk just briefly about a  section of the country, North Carolina,  a  section of North Carolina,  rural,  poor, eastern, that I represent. It is  called the First Congressional District.  It  is  largely  rural,  largely African  Americans, Native Americans,  facing  devastating  job  losses and obviously  sweeping  economic  concerns.  I  am  deeply concerned about the well-being  of thousands of families, thousands of  unemployed, thousands of laid off who  live in my district.  During the President’s State of the  Union address in January, I listened  carefully and  I heard nothing  that  would tend to address the needs, the  hopes and desires of those of whom I  speak. Yes, after reviewing the proposed budget, my concerns continue to  grow. With a staggering 31,767 people  unemployed in the First District as of  December 1, 2003, additional plant closings and layoffs threaten to raise that  number even higher and to stress and  distress an already unstable economy.  In fact, just last week Rubbermaid of  Greenville, North Carolina, announced  plans to lay off another 315 workers  this  coming month. They  join  the  ranks of other plant closings, dozens in  my area, since the summer of 2003.  During his State of the Union address, the President promised more tax  cuts, more permanent tax cuts. He had  already promised that those would generate jobs. We have heard that pitch  before. It has not materialized, and we  do not believe it is going to materialize  this time around, so that is why we are  here tonight. We have to continue to  speak out and cry out and make a plea  that we will change our policies and  provide opportunities for families, for  jobless,  for people who are hurting,  people who are losing hope.  Since 2001, this Nation has lost 2.9  million jobs. Locally, in Vance County,  one of the counties I represent, they  suffer an unemployment rate of 12.5  percent, more than double the national  unemployment  rate. The President’s  priorities do not appear to match those  of working families in eastern North  Carolina. We have a few millionaires in  eastern North Carolina, but they are  very few.  With  jobs continuing to disappear,  despite 3 years of promises through tax  cuts, our families want to enjoy the  same quality of  life afforded every  other  family throughout the Nation.  They want to live in a sound economy,  free of the fear of losing their jobs.  They want to raise their families, have  good health care, and to continue to  express their patriotic values as Americans.  This budget relies on tax cuts which  sacrifice priorities for funding at home  for those items that I just mentioned.  On last year’s tax cuts, the poorest 20  percent of North Carolinians received a  mere $69. We know about the theory, if  you give it to the rich, it will trickle  down, but it is not working. We are losing jobs.  I sent the President a  letter  last  week  inviting him as he travels to  please  come  to northeastern North  Carolina, please visit Roanoke Rapids,  Henderson,  and  Rutherford,  North  Carolina,  to  see what  is happening  when people lose their jobs, lose their  hope, are standing in the unemployment line, and finding that their unemployment has run out. b1930  As I said earlier, America can do better. We have the ability. We have the  technology. We simply have to get our  priorities  straight  in order  to help  those who are most in need. I thank  the gentlewoman  from California so  very much for this opportunity.  ",2004

So that is  the full story. That is the full story.  Again, today, Secretary Powell continued to talk about intent.

48,House,108,-0.33,75,2004-02-11,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield,  because he  is  bringing up moral authority, which is  very important; and we were talking  about the families we have been working with who have lost their sons and  daughters in Iraq, and there is a moral  obligation by the United States Government to come forward and answer  some of these questions that we have  been asking  tonight. And  the gentleman mentioned  something  about  reading and some folks may find some  reading material of interest. I want to  refer to people about a moral question  that  our  government  owes  to  the  American people, and that is the question of how this war was started based  on what, according to Mr. Kay, was a  false premise.  The people of this country, the families who have servicepeople serving in  Iraq, those who have lost members of  their families, they deserve a clear, cogent, and complete answer of how a  war was  started  based  on  a  false  premise about what the status of weapons was in Iraq. And the gentleman  mentioned things he was reading.  I  read something extremely disturbing  to me this weekend. It was printed in  the Knight Ridder newspapers. I read it  in the Seattle Times February 10, an  article entitled  ‘‘Doubts and Dissent  Removed from Public Report on Iraq.  Secret version President Bush received  was more cautious about threat.’’ We know at this point, according to  Mr. Kay, our expert in the field and  now even according to the President  apparently, that the premise that gave  rise to this war was false about the status of weapons of mass destruction in  Iraq. And that is disturbing enough. It  is  it disturbing  for our soldiers and  sailors. It is disturbing of our standing  in the world, starting a war on a false  premise. But this article was more disturbing to me because the conclusion  and premise of this article was not  only was this premise false but that  the Government of the United States of  America in a sense distorted in significant ways the nature of intelligence  that it had available to it before the  war started. For instance, and again  this is in the newspaper, and I cannot  vouch for its authenticity. It makes  reference to some intelligence reports.  This is not coming from myself. It is  coming from the Seattle Times and the  Knight Ridder newspaper. But  they  made reference to a statement essentially by the President that there is no  doubt, and that is a quote from this  President, that the President of the  United States looked at the American  people and said there is no doubt, no  doubt, that Iraq had some of the most  lethal weapons systems devised by man  before this war started.  But this article disclosed that the intelligence reports given to the President of the United States showed there  was tremendous doubt about this situation. And I will quote from this article:  ‘‘Whereas the President of the United  States was essentially saying there is  no doubt that Iraq had reconstituted,  in the words of the Vice President, a  nuclear program.’’ Listen to what the  intelligence report said, according to  this article,  that was given  to  the  President of the United States. This  was an intelligence report prepared by  the State Department’s  intelligence  arm, which is called the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, known as the  INR.  This is a quote. That report said ‘‘the  activities we have detected do not,  however, add up to a compelling case  that Iraq is currently pursuing what  INR would consider to be an integrated  and comprehensive approach to acquire  nuclear weapons. Iraq may be doing so,  but INR considers the available evidence  inadequate to support such a  judgment.’’ The report goes on to say,  ‘‘INR is unwilling to project a timeline  for the completion of activities it does  not now see happening.’’ So while the President of the United  States, the leader of the free world,  was telling the world and American  soldiers and sailors and citizens that  there was no doubt that this country  had a meaningful, real, and contemporaneous nuclear program, our own  intelligence services, at least one of  them, was telling him they did not  think so. This was not told to the  American people. And even if one believes today that this war was totally  justified based on the civil rights of the  Iraqi citizens, and I respect people who  have that view, even if one believes  that, it is a moral wrong not to share  this  information with the American  people and the U.S. Congress when this  debate is going on.  ",2004
49,Senate,108,-0.303,82,2004-02-11,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, 2 days  ago President Bush sent to Congress  his annual  report on  the State of  America’s economy. Contained in that  report is a statement that was quite remarkable. After presiding over the loss  of 2.6 million jobs, after claiming for 3  years that stopping the job hemorrhage  was one of their top priorities, the  Bush administration now says that exporting American  jobs to China and  India and other  low-wage nations  is  good for the American economy.  I read that, and I must have read it  two or three times thinking there had  to be a catch, thinking there had to be  some caveat, there had to be some condition. But there is no condition. The  statement from the report could not be  more clear. This administration believes that exporting jobs to China and  India and other  low-wage nations  is  good  for America’s  economy. They  seem to want to turn a jobless recovery  into a hopeless recovery.  The President’s report is proof that  there are those in this administration  who simply do not understand what is  happening to this economy and how  deeply  concerned  people  are  about  their economic future.  People who think shipping American  jobs overseas is good for the economy  need to talk to people such as Myra  Bronstein. She is not a statistic. She is  not an abstract concept on computer  models.  Sometimes we focus so much on corporate stock earnings or the Dow Jones  Industrial Average, we lose sight of the  challenges that real Americans are actually facing. Myra Bronstein knows  all about outsourcing. She has a degree  in electronic engineering and 15 years  of experience in the information technology industry.  Four years ago, she left a good job  with AT&T in New Jersey to take a  new job with a software development  company called Watchmark Corporation in Bellevue, WA. She was one of  about  20  software  testers  at  Watchmark.  One Friday last April, Myra came to  work. She and other software testers  were called into a meeting. They were  told that they were being replaced by  workers in India, that their jobs would  be gone as they finished training their  replacements, and that if they refused  to train the new workers they would be  ineligible for severance pay, unemployment  insurance, or health  insurance  through COBRA.  Then they were told that the new  workers were flying in over the weekend and would be there on Monday.  Most of her coworkers just had to train  one  new  person.  Because  Myra  Bronstein was working on the highest  priority projects, she actually had to  train  two  replacements. The whole  while she was trying frantically to figure out where she was going to find a  new job in the midst of the ‘‘dot-com’’  bust and a jobless recovery.  Myra Bronstein is not alone. According to a new national survey that is  just being released today, nearly one in  four  information technology workers  said his or her company has offshored  jobs. Incredibly, almost one in five reported they themselves had lost a job  after training a foreign worker. Ninety-three percent—nearly all—expressed  concerns  about  the  impact  of  offshoring jobs on the IT industry and  how  it would  impact  their communities, the economy, and this country.  One-third of the workers surveyed said  the  trend  toward  outsourcing  and  offshoring jobs is contributing to layoffs. And more than half said it was  pushing down wages and benefits.  When  textile manufacturing  jobs  started to move offshore in the 1980s,  workers in those industries were told  that the change was good for America’s  economy. They were told that all they  had to do was to learn some new skills,  train  for some  ‘‘new economy,’’ and  they could get better paying jobs in the  technology and service industries.  Workers held up their end of the deal.  They got the training. Many did get  jobs in the computer and IT industries,  in health care and financial services,  and  other  so-called new  industries.  Now these new jobs are being shipped  overseas.  We are offshoring America’s future.  We are exporting some of our Nation’s  most promising research and development jobs. These are the jobs that support middle-class  families. They are  the  jobs that enable people to own  their own homes and put their kids  through college.  Sixty-eight percent of  IT workers  have a college degree or higher. Half  have annual salaries between $75,000  and  $125,000. Their  jobs  are  being  offshored to people who will earn less  than $10,000.  This is not just happening in Seattle  or Silicon Valley. It is happening in  Sioux Falls and St. Louis and cities  and towns all across America. Now the  Bush administration tells us that exporting American jobs is actually good  for the economy.  Shipping  good  jobs  overseas may  boost the quarterly earnings of some  companies. It may make some CEOs  look smart and make some quick profit  for some investors. But how can it be  good for the economy to export America’s best jobs? How can it be good for  the economy to offshore the jobs that  support middle-class families and sustain strong communities? How can exporting  jobs create opportunities  for  Americans?  It  is not  just  the  jobs  that get  outsourced. When American companies  ship jobs offshore, they also send tax  returns, medical records, credit card  numbers, financial statements, and all  kinds of other sensitive and confidential consumer information.  America has lost 2.6 million jobs on  this administration’s watch. That  is  more jobs than the last 11 administrations put together. Nine million Americans are now out of work. Long-term  unemployment is at a 20-year high.  Eighty-thousand  workers  are  exhausting their unemployment benefits  every week because Republican leaders  refuse to support extending the Federal  emergency unemployment benefits.  The Economic Policy  Institute recently found that in 48 States jobs are  shifting from higher paying to lower  paying industries.  In his State of the Union Message,  President Bush said he understood, finally, that we have a jobs problem in  America. He promised his administration would do more to help people find  and train for jobs of the future.  A few days later, a professor from the  University of Texas wrote an op-ed in  the Washington Post about what she  said was a model job training program  in Austin. Many of the students at the  center do not have the advantages that  Myra Bronstein and many other  IT  workers have. They do not have graduate degrees. What they do have is a  fierce desire to make a better life for  themselves and their children. Many of  them have two jobs. They catch a bus  to their classes, where they learn about  computer  programming  and  spreadsheets and other supposedly marketable skills.  The professor wrote that one woman  who showed her proudly how she ‘‘uses  MapQuest.com to get directions to the  houses that she cleans on her hands  and knees, 7 days a week, 12 hours a  day, for a pittance,’’ was just lucky to  have a job at all.  She wrote:  Before they learned these skills, the trainees thought that it was their lack of computer skills that prevented them from getting  good  information-age  jobs.  They  thought something was wrong with them.  Now they know something is wrong with our  job market.  There is something wrong with the  job market, and the Bush administration’s cavalier endorsement of shipping  American jobs overseas can only make  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:53 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S11FE4.REC S11FE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

52,Senate,108,-0.276,117,2004-02-11,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, before the  distinguished Senator from New Jersey  leaves the floor, I want to make this  comment. I am sure we all wonder,  having  served  in  legislative  bodies,  what has been accomplished, what have  we been able to point to that we have  done that changes the lives of people in  our country. Let me say to my friend  from New Jersey, he need not worry  about that because his legacy has already been established.  I owe so much to the Senator from  New Jersey, as does my whole family,  and I speak for most families—I should  say the vast majority of families in  America, many of whom don’t realize  what the Senator from New Jersey has  done to make their lives more pleasant.  When we used to travel back and  forth  from Las Vegas and Reno  to  Washington with my family—they were  little children at the time—my daughter and my boys, especially two of  them, could not stand cigarette smoking in an airplane. It really made them  physically ill. We would pacify them  and say, well, that is in a different section; do not worry about  it. As we  know, when one person smoked on an  airplane, we all smoked on an airplane.  The Senator from New Jersey is more  responsible, by far, than any other one  person, or group of people, for being  persistent  and  pushing  that  there  would be no smoking on airplanes. The  Senator from New Jersey did that.  When he started out on this issue,  people thought he was tilting windmills. No one believed with the very  powerful interests that favored smoking on airplanes, including the airplane  owners and, of course, the cigarette  manufacturers, that the Senator from  New Jersey could accomplish what he  did. But he did.  In addition to that, we all owe a debt  of gratitude to the Senator from New  Jersey for pushing to make sure all  States had a .08 standard for blood alcohol. The Senator from New Jersey  did this.  The  reason  I mention  these  two  things that are the legacy—and I have  only mentioned a couple of things because they stick out in my mind that  the Senator from New Jersey has done,  that I know. With the tireless efforts of  the Senator from New Jersey on the  things that he believes in, that he is  talking about, this will get done. This  will be accomplished for a number of  reasons, not the least of which it is the  right issue but, No. 2, because the Senator from New Jersey is the one who is  pushing this.  I want the Senator from New Jersey  to know how much I—and I speak for  millions of Americans—recognize his  great  contributions  to making  our  lives healthier, better, and  safer  in  America.  ",2004
53,Senate,108,0.548,117,2004-02-11,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak  about  the highway  transportation bill which we are on right now.  I will discuss basically  two general  points. The first has to do with the  amount of funding in the bill and the  administration position on that matter. Then secondly, I will talk a little  bit about the funding formula in the  bill.  As everyone knows, we are talking  about a bill that would authorize and  pay for the highway transportation and  mass transit needs of the country over  the next 6 years, financed historically  by the gas tax. The 6-year bill that has  been offered intends to be more generous than that by taking in some additional revenues, providing a lot more  funding, and extending the authorization that currently exists for a period  of 6 years.  I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of my remarks this Statement  of Administration Policy  be  printed in the RECORD.  ",2004
54,Senate,108,-0.326,131,2004-02-11,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I  rise today in strong support of Senators CANTWELLand KENNEDY’s amendment to reinstate and extend the Federal unemployment insurance program.  This measure would provide 6 additional months of financial assistance  to thousands of West Virginians and  millions of Americans who have exhausted their regular state-funded benefits. This support is desperately needed and deserves immediate attention.  The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation, TEUC, program  expired on December 31, 2003. In response to a slowdown in the American  economy, Congress created this program in March 2002 to provide federally-funded unemployment benefits to  the long-term unemployed who want to  work, and who are looking for work,  but are unable to find employment in  the current economic climate. As all of  my colleagues are aware, Congress extended the program twice, in January  and May of 2003 respectively, because  jobs  remained  scarce and new ones  were not being created. Now, with millions of our constituents still looking  for work and with 90,000 workers exhausting  their State-funded benefits  each week millions of Americans need  our help once again.  Over the past two years our economy  has suffered through a difficult recession. Recently, however, according to  some economic indicators, it does appear to be turning the corner. At least  the data indicates we are poised to return to better and improved economic  output from years past. This is some  encouraging news, but it is long overdue. Despite strong economic growth  over the last two quarters of 2003 and a  surge  in the  financial markets,  jobs  continue to be hard to find. At this  time, there is merely one job opening  for every three out of work Americans.  This is totally unacceptable. We cannot merely continue to muddle through  a ‘‘jobless recovery’’—we must get the  unemployed the relief they need.  Those who oppose extending emergency unemployment  insurance have  also argued that recent improvements  in the economy and the labor market  demonstrate that the program  is no  longer needed. How can the administration tout upward trends as a major economic  turnaround  when  so many  Americans are still struggling so hard  just to make ends meet? The White  House claims that jobs are one of the  administration’s  primary  concerns.  Yet,  I am  troubled  that  the White  House has been conspicuously silent  about unemployment insurance, which  has been proven to boost economic output.  It has been reported that continuing the Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation, TEUC, program would be the single best mechanism to boost the economy, giving the  economy a $1.73 jolt for each $1 of Federal benefits. Unemployment insurance  benefits are excellent stimulus because  they aid people who are likely to spend  additional resources immediately.  Opponents to the extension cite a  drop  in  the national unemployment  rate, among other improvements in the  economy, to justify phasing out this  program that serves as the final safety  net for workers across the country. It  is true that the Nation’s unemployment rate has dropped, albeit minimally, over the past few months. But it  is clear that these numbers are misleading. A closer look at the numbers  reveals that thousands of Americans  are so frustrated they actually gave up  looking  for  work  altogether  and  dropped out of the labor market. Nearly 15 million Americans are out of  work and the number of long-term unemployed remains enormously high, at  almost 2 million. Constituents in my  home State of West Virginia have been  particularly vocal about the seriousness of  this  situation.  In January,  nearly 1,200 West Virginians exhausted  their State-funded benefits. That number will jump to nearly 7,000 over the  next 6 months. If we pass this amendment, more than 8,000 of my constituents would get the help they need and  deserve.  My offices are taking calls from West  Virginians who need such help. One example is a woman who lost her job due  to company layoffs. She decided to return to school so that she could learn  new skills and reenter the workforce  better prepared  for an uncertain  future. My constituent was depending on  the TUEC benefit to help finance her  education. Without  extending  these  benefits, how will she make ends meet  until she finishes her training? I believe that it’s a matter of this administration’s priorities. And I very much  worry we do not have our priorities  straight.  Lack of jobs is the primary culprit.  But what is equally troubling is that  there is a clear shift of jobs from high-  paying industries to lower-paying sectors. This fundamental change in the  job market was precipitated by a variety of factors. But simply replacing a  good, secure, and well-paying position  that includes health insurance and pension benefits with a minimum wage job  just doesn’t cut it. And sadly, it appears as if this administration is content to tout the creation of new low-  paying jobs as stimulus, comparable to  the 2.6 million manufacturing jobs that  were lost since this President took office. West Virginia alone has lost about  9,800 manufacturing jobs over the last  few years.  Congress must recognize the urgency  of this problem. We must move quickly  to reinstate this program, not only to  assist the unemployed, but also because in doing so we will provide our  home states with additional resources  that will  immediately  infuse economies across  the country with more  spending power.  We can afford  to help our  fellow  Americans.

55,Senate,108,0.068,145,2004-02-11,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I rise  to honor one of our most dedicated and  patriotic  colleagues—and  a  fellow  Pennsylvanian—Congressman  MURTHA, on the 30th anniversary of his  service in the United States House of  Representatives.  JACKMURTHA, during five decades of  service to our Nation, has been an exemplar of dedication, drive, sacrifice  and patriotism. He left Washington and  Jefferson College after only one year of  study to join the Marine Corps during  the Korean War. Returning home, he  ran a  small business  in Johnstown  while starting a family with his wife,  Joyce, and attending the University of  Pittsburgh on  the GI Bill. But his  country called again and JACKMURTHA  volunteered in Vietnam in 1966–67, already in his mid-30s.  In 1974, he became the first combat  Vietnam veteran elected to Congress,  representing  the  12th Congressional  District of Pennsylvania.  JACKMURTHAhas worked tirelessly  to attract and keep jobs in and around  his District and to develop essential  sewer, water and transportation infrastructure. As a senior member of the  House Appropriations Committee, he  has established himself as a national  leader on defense, health-care and social issues. He founded the House Steel  Caucus and regularly defends our steel  industry from unfair imports, and has  been one of the strongest advocates in  Congress for children, seniors and veterans.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  honoring JACKMURTHA for his lifelong  commitment to the ideals of our Nation; for his exceptional dedication to  his constituents, to the State of Pennsylvania and to our country; and for 30  years of superior service in the United  States Congress.

57,House,108,-0.531,15,2004-02-24,Ms. WATSON.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  deep sadness and regret that I rise to  inform my colleagues of the death of  Los Angeles Police Department Officer  Ricardo Lizarraga, who was killed in  the line of duty on Friday, February 20,  2004, while answering a domestic violence dispute in the area of Western  and Vernon Avenue in my district. Officer Lizarraga became the first LAPD  officer since 1998 to be shot and killed  in the line of duty.  Mr. Speaker, as many of us know, domestic violence calls can be the most  volatile and unpredictable situations  to which police officers respond. After  a  woman  flagged  down  Officer  Lizarraga’s police car and asked  for  help, the officer and his partner went  to remove an abusive boyfriend from  her apartment. According to official  accounts, the suspect emerged with a  gun and shot the 30-year-old officer  just below his bulletproof vest.  Officer Lizarraga had only recently  joined the police force 2 years ago.

58,House,108,-0.438,29,2004-02-24,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman. We think about  this. He mentioned when he introduced  his idea to better monitor and study  and pay attention to, if you will, focus,  on the trade deficit, how it has gone up  since 1997. The trade deficit for the entire year of 1992 was smaller than the  trade deficit, or was about equivalent  in 1992 to the trade deficit for 1 month  last month. We had a trade deficit of  about $40 billion a dozen years ago. We  have a trade deficit in excess of $40 billion a month now. I mean, that is what  that means.  But more importantly, as the gentleman from Oregon pointed out, what  that really means is that we are continuing to get further and further in  debt as a Nation to foreign investors,  to investors in other countries. That  means that the Chinese, with their $100  billion a year  in U.S. currency, the  trade surplus they have with our country, the fact that they sell us so much  more than we buy from them, the Chinese take that $100 billion and are beginning to buy up a lot of scrap steel in  the United States, driving up prices of  steel, of scrap for U.S. manufacturers,  making it harder for them to compete.  They are also buying energy companies in the United States, again driving  up the cost of natural gas for American  manufacturers and putting them more  and more behind the eightball.  And, as the gentleman from Oregon  said, when the worm turns, as economists like to say in their ivory and  their  traditional  economic  theory,  when the worm turns, and our trade  deficit gets so overwhelming that eventually the value of the dollar drops, we  begin to produce more to sell to them,  our factories are hollowed out. Our factories are not manufacturing things,  because so many of them are closed.  They are not going to be able to retool  just because all of a sudden prices are  a bit higher.  But what is disturbing about the economic report that the gentleman mentioned, and then I want to yield to the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr. STRICKLAND), who absolutely gets it on these  job issues, partly because we live in a  State where we have seen our economy  devastated by  these Bush  economic  policies, but what is disturbing about  the economic report that Mr. Mankiw  put out, the President’s chief economic  adviser,  and  that  President  Bush  signed, is that they really see nothing  wrong with the direction we are going.  So what, we have a huge trade deficit.  So what, we have a huge budget deficit.  Let us keep doing tax cuts that overwhelmingly go to the most privileged;  let us keep doing trade agreements  that ship jobs overseas, in large part  because profits right now are up for  major corporations. So if the companies are making money, as the Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao said, if the  stock market is going up, then there is  really nothing wrong.  What is wrong, as Mr. Mankiw said,  outsourcing is a good thing when bluecollar jobs; white-collar jobs, phone operators, computer engineers, computer  programmers, when those jobs go overseas, I think there is something wrong  with that, and  it  is mostly because  George Bush and Mr. Mankiw have  never looked an Akron rubber worker  in the eyes, or never looked a paper  worker in Oregon in the eye, or never  looked a Silicon Valley in California, a  computer programmer in the eye and  say, yes, outsourcing is a good thing.  Sorry about your job. Maybe you can  get a job at Wal-Mart, or maybe you  can get a job at McDonald’s.  Speaking of McDonald’s, and then I  will yield to my friend, the gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr. STRICKLAND),  in this  economic report, something the media  have not paid much attention to, and  that is these economists, and these are  not exactly people who know a lot of  people who work  in America’s  factories, but these economists are having  a debate inside the Bush administration on how to classify manufacturing.

61,Senate,108,-0.362,64,2004-02-24,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator  from South Dakota because I think he has raised an important issue of concern in this debate and  that is one I have initiated in my opening remarks. We need to have a constructive  bipartisan  conversation  about a serious national problem. Instead, this bill, S. 2061, was introduced  just a few days ago without a committee  hearing,  reference  to  committee, without any attempt to find  common ground and find a solution. In  fact, it is being called today so there  will be a vote on record and nothing  else. It is anticipated the bill will not  go forward.  I spoke to doctors in Illinois over the  weekend, doctors who share my concern about  the medical malpractice  premium situation in our State. I have  told them what we are doing today is  frankly a political exercise. It is an exercise to come up with a roll call vote  so those on one side of the issue can go  to their supporters and say, we have  worked hard. We brought this bill to  the floor, we have been stopped, and we  cannot get back to it because we are so  busy. Frankly, that is no solution. In  State after State, including my State,  there are areas where there are serious  medical malpractice  premium  problems. They arise for a variety of reasons. Memorial Hospital in Belleville,  IL, has  lost numerous obstetricians  and gynecologists in the last year due  to rising malpractice premiums. Community leaders in that town, which I  am familiar with—it is an area I grew  up in—have come to me and said, this  is a real source of concern. We are losing doctors. They are doctors who are  leaving the practice to retire early, and  I met one doctor in that circumstance.  There are some who are moving to  rural counties where the malpractice  premiums are lower and they are further away, of course, from the people  they originally served. Some are moving across the river to Missouri where  they are finding malpractice premiums  are a fraction of what they are in Illinois.  There is no doubt in my mind there  is a serious problem that needs to be  addressed. It is not just in the obstetrical/gynecological area. The OB/GYN  issue is an important one, but there are  other areas of need relative to trauma  care, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery. The list is long and we need to  address it in a serious and responsible  way.  This bill, however, is being brought  to us on a moment’s notice. This bill is  being brought to us in an effort to really check off the box that says, yes, we  considered medical malpractice  and  now we are going to move on. That is  unfair and it is unfortunate, and we  can do better.  I will  tell my colleagues a  story  about some of the situations I know of  in my State. Eduardo Barriuso, who is  a physician in the Humboldt Park area  of Chicago, pays $104,000 a year for malpractice  insurance. He  earns  about  $175,000 because the patients he sees  are poor patients, Medicaid and Medicare patients. Doctors who depend on  Medicaid and Medicare are not wealthy  individuals, but they perform a valuable function because if they are not  there to serve the poorest of the poor,  then who will?  This doctor  says  that  faced with  $104,000  in annual premiums and a  $175,000 annual income, he cannot continue his practice, and he certainly  cannot pass on the higher costs of medical malpractice insurance to his patients who are poor people.  Another Chicago area OB/GYN has  announced he is going to study to obtain his pharmacist license. Right now  he is paying $115,000 a year for liability  insurance.  Let’s go to the root cause of the  issue. Why are we even debating this  issue of medical malpractice? There  are several reasons. First, the men and  women who are engaged in the medical  profession are some of the most important people in our lives, some of the  most  important people  in America.  These are men and women who at great  personal sacrifice go to medical school  so that they are trained and skilled to  be there when we need them, when our  families need them. Time and again,  my family and most who are following  this debate have turned to a doctor in  the hopes that he or she can cure an  illness, provide some hope, give people  some reason to believe they can overcome a disease, disability, or an injury.  Doctors are so critically important  to all of us and yet when one takes a  look at a doctor’s practice, at a doctor’s skills, there is a human side to  the equation. They are human beings.  They do make mistakes. Some are simple negligence. Some are  far worse.  When these mistakes occur, when a patient is in a hospital or a doctor’s office and the wrong thing is done and  that patient  is  injured, what should  happen? In most walks of life in America, we are held accountable for our actions.  If I decide this evening to take my  car and go out speeding on a highway,  strike another car and injure someone,  I will be held accountable. I was negligent. I did not reach the standard of  safety that is expected of me as a driver and I must pay the price. That is  true for businesspeople, for individuals,  for virtually everyone in America. It is  certainly  true  for medical  professionals. When they make a mistake by  negligence or intentional misconduct,  they can and should be held accountable. I think that is part of our system  of  justice. Very  few,  if any, people  argue that is not a reasonable thing to  do.  How serious then are the number of  medical  errors  and medical malpractice cases that occur across the  United States? Well,  the most  farreaching study of the extended cost of  medical errors in hospitals and doctors’  offices was published by the Journal of  the American Medical Association last  October. This is a dispassionate, objective analysis of the likelihood of medical errors and medical negligence in  America. The authors of the study analyzed 7.4 million patient records from  994 hospitals in 28 States, representing  some 20 percent of all the hospitals in  America.  This  was  an  exhaustive  study.  They concluded medical injuries in  hospitals ‘‘pose a significant threat to  patients and incur substantial costs to  society,’’ and ‘‘are a serious epidemic  confronting our health care system.’’  A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has told us as  we go into this debate the first thing  we can acknowledge is we have an epidemic of medical negligence in America. Now this was not the Journal of  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:15 Feb 25, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24FE6.008 S24PT1 ",2004
62,Senate,108,0.429,78,2004-02-24,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, what is  the present situation relative to time?  ",2004
63,Senate,108,-0.173,85,2004-02-24,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, before  Senator FEINSTEINleaves the Chamber,  she has laid out what may well be a  very  reasonable alternative  for  this  body and our colleagues in the House  to consider with respect to medical  malpractice. She has played a vital  role as we have worked over the last  several years to craft a compromise on  class action reform and offered maybe  the critical amendment to the bill.  What I would like to do in the 10  minutes I am going to speak is compare and contrast,  if I can, the approach in bringing this medical malpractice bill to the Senate today with  the approach that has been followed as  we have tried to bring class action reform legislation to the Senate floor. Let me step back for a moment. For  those who may be listening to this discussion, class action reform seeks to  address the issue of when a class of  people are harmed what kind of redress  do they have to seek compensation? I  think most of us would agree that if a  person were harmed by a product, good,  or service that they had come in contact with or acquired that that person  should be made whole.  I  think we  would also agree if a whole class of people were somehow damaged by a product, good, or service that they came in  contact with that the class of people  should be made whole.  The  question  is,  In what  forum  should  those  damaged  persons,  the  damaged  class,  the plaintiff  class— where do they turn to for redress to  gain compensation for their injury or  for their harm?  In my view, and I think it is a view  probably shared by a majority of my  colleagues, we believe that if the plaintiff class happens to be in a State different from the State that the defendant  is  from, our Constitution would  suggest that maybe in those cases that  rather than the case being litigated in  the State where all of the plaintiffs are  located, if the defendant is from another State, that the fair thing to do to  both the defendant and the plaintiff is  to  litigate  that matter  in Federal  court. That has been a subject of some  debate.  It is not an issue that involves limits  on punitive damages, economic, noneconomic damages, pain and suffering.  The debate does not lie there. Rather,  the debate lies in the area of in what  court,  in what  jurisdiction  should  those kinds of questions be resolved.  I have been in the Senate for a bit  more than 3 years. During that course  of time, there have been any number of  hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee and  in  the House Judiciary  Committee to bring before the respective panels in both bodies those who  believe that we need to change the status quo with respect to class action  litigation and those who think that  what we have is just fine.  Proponents and advocates have had  the opportunity to speak their points  of view and to testify repeatedly in the  Senate and in the House. In fact, over  the last couple of years, this is what  has happened in the Senate: Legislation has been developed in committee,  it has been debated in committee, it  has been amended in committee, and it  has been brought to the floor in an effort to try to have it debated, amended,  and voted on.  Last fall, we were able to get 59 votes  to proceed to the bill, to take it up and  offer amendments on the floor, but on  class action we fell just short of the 60  that we needed to invoke cloture. So  we went back and we did some more  work. Those of us who think changes  are necessary worked with some of our  Democrat colleagues, three of them especially, and others as well, to come up  with changes that would make the bill  better,  fairer,  and more  defensible.  Hopefully, within  the  next  several  weeks we will have the opportunity to  debate that on the floor and to offer  further amendments to class action reform legislation.  It has been a  long process,  some  would say too long. What happens is we  start off with a reasonable proposal,  debate it in committee, improve it in  committee, report it out of committee,  and then we are going to have the opportunity to bring the bill to the floor  and  it will be altered,  I think  improved, when that same bill comes to  the floor.  Once the bill is on the floor, we will  have the opportunity for full and open  debate to consider what people  like  about it and do not like about it. They  can offer their changes and we will  have an up-or-down vote at the end of  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:15 Feb 25, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24FE6.045 S24PT1 ",2004
64,Senate,108,-0.342,92,2004-02-24,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, today  the Senate is voting on a political gimmick that will punish women and children and do nothing to address the real  medical malpractice crisis that is crippling healthcare throughout our State.  Doctors are facing escalating costs  that are unsustainable, but instead of  addressing this problem with a common-sense and immediate fix, the majority is engaging in a blame game. We  don’t have time for the blame game.  Instead, we should be debating the bipartisan bill I support to provide immediate relief to doctors, stop frivolous lawsuits, and fix the broken insurance market.  But this bill doesn’t just fail to address the real crisis in malpractice insurance;  it actually undermines  the  rights of women and children in the  name of helping them.  As a woman, a mother, and a Senator  who has fought for the safety and welfare of mothers and infants, I am disturbed that the U.S. Senate would single out women and babies for different  treatment than everyone else in America if they are injured through no fault  of their own. This bill tells women that  if we are injured, we don’t deserve the  same legal protections as men.  The sponsors of this bill have spoken  about  the health and well-being of  women  and  babies  in  hypothetical  terms. But I have to tell you, the injuries and crimes that continue to plague  female patients are all too real.  Currently,  in my State of Washington, we are following a high-profile  case in which an OB/GYN has been accused of raping or molesting dozens of  female patients under his care. This  doctor is also accused of providing substandard care, ranging from performing  unnecessary medical procedures to failing to prescribe prenatal vitamins to a  pregnant patient with low iron levels.  In one case, this doctor even performed a surgery despite the fact that  his office was not licensed for surgery  and did not have a supply of blood  available in case of complications.  I ask my colleagues to consider this  case. If your wife or daughter or sister  had been hurt, molested or worse by  this doctor, would a $250,000 cap seem  like a reasonable solution?  These  cases are not hypothetical.  They are not frivolous. And this bill  will not protect the health or increase  the wellbeing of any of these patients.  I find some sad irony in being told by  this bill’s sponsors that if I want to  help women and babies, I should strip  away their rights. I take a backseat to  no one when it comes to standing up  for women and children.  I wish that the people who are pushing this bill today had shown the same  interest when I was fighting to ensure  women could get direct access to an  OB/GYN during the Patients Bill of  Rights debate, but instead, they killed  that effort. I wish they had shown the  same interest in 1999 when I offered an  amendment  to  end  drive-through  mastectomies, but they killed that effort as well. I wish this bill’s sponsors  had showed the same concern when I  was fighting to improve drug labeling  for pregnant women, but instead, they  killed  that  proposal  as well. They  weren’t on the side of women during all  those fights, but here they are today,  using the real shortage of OB/GYNs and  the real malpractice crisis as an excuse  for punishing women and babies without giving doctors or patients the help  they desperately need.  If the sponsors of this bill are now serious  about helping  ensure healthy  women and babies, I say  ‘‘Come on  over!’’ I’ve got a long list of legislation  that they can sign onto today to really  help women—like  extending Family  and Medical Leave, boosting the federal Medicaid match for OB/GYNs, and  expanding Medicaid and the Children’s  Health Insurance Program, CHIP, for  low-income pregnant women. The single most important step to ensure a  healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby  is prenatal care. Fully-funding and expanding CHIP would provide this care  to low-income women who would otherwise go without.  The saddest part of this exercise is  that we should be spending this time  discussing a real solution, like the bipartisan bill I am cosponsoring with  Senators GRAHAMand DURBIN, the Better HEALTH Act, S. 1374. If the Senate  leadership really wants to help doctors  and patients, they will bring up the  widely-supported Graham-Durbin bill  for a vote and stop playing games at  the  expense  of women  and  babies.  Every day they deny a vote on this bipartisan  bill  speaks  volumes  about  their interest in a real solution.  The Graham-Durbin bill would give  doctors an immediate 20 percent tax rebate on their malpractice premiums,  provide federal help for a broken insurance market, and block frivolous lawsuits. That’s the type of comprehensive, immediate and effective solution  our doctors, patients and communities  deserve.  My action plan to fix the malpractice  crisis has four steps. The first thing we  have to do is get doctors and hospitals  some  immediate  relief—because  the  clock is ticking. Even if proposals to  cap non-economic and punitive damages were passed this year, it is impossible to predict when—if ever—doctors  and hospitals would see relief. That is  not good enough for me, and it is not  good enough  for the doctors  in my  community. I want doctors and hospitals to get immediate relief.  Under the Graham-Durbin bill, doctors in high-risk specialties would be  eligible for a tax credit that’s 20 percent of  their malpractice premium.  Doctors in lower-risk specialties would  get a 10 percent tax-credit. For-profit  hospitals would get a 15 percent tax  credit, and non-profit hospitals would  get new grants. Immediate  financial  relief directly to doctors and hospitals  must be part of any solution to the  malpractice crisis.  Second, we have to cut down on frivolous lawsuits. Under the Graham-Durbin bill, every plaintiff attorney that  files a medical malpractice case would  be required to include an affidavit by a  qualified  health  care  professional  verifying  that malpractice  has  occurred. No more  launching  lawsuits  that don’t have merit. And anyone who  violates this affidavit is going to be  punished with strict, and increasingly  harsh, civil penalties. We are not going  to  tolerate  frivolous  lawsuits,  and  that’s the second part of the GrahamDurbin bill.  Third, we need to provide additional  protections for doctors who are doing  the right thing and serving patients  through Medicare, Medicaid and S– CHIP. Doctors with a 25 percent caseload of Medicare, Medicaid, and State  Children’s Health Insurance Program,  SCHIP, patients would be protected  from  punitive  damages  under  the  Graham-Durbin bill. Exemptions would  only be allowed for cases involving sexual abuse, assault and battery, and falsification of records. Other than that  there will be no punitive damages for  doctors who are doing the right thing  and  serving Medicare, Medicaid and  SCHIP patients.  Finally, the Graham-Durbin bill says  the Federal Government should underwrite some of the risk in malpractice  insurance—just as we have with terrorism and  flood  insurance. Doctors  and hospitals should not have to shoulder the burden of a broken insurance  market.  If the Senate  leadership  is serious  about helping doctors and patients, it  will bring up the bipartisan GrahamDurbin bill. It provides immediate and  direct financial relief to doctors and  hospitals.  It cuts down on  frivolous  lawsuits. It limits liability for doctors  with high Medicaid caseloads, and it  provides Federal help for a broken insurance system.  As I have done for the past 10 years,  I will continue to advocate for the policies that truly help women and infants  and I will continue to stand up for my  doctors, patients and communities who  deserve an immediate, comprehensive  solution to the malpractice insurance  crisis. I welcome the support of any  Senator who wishes to sign onto the  legislation I have outlined today. ",2004

Last July we debated  this  issue in the Senate, and unfortunately  did not reach cloture on this important  issue. Today we are limiting our debate  on the issue to care for mothers and  babies. We must protect a woman’s access  to  obstetric  and  gynecological  care to ensure healthy mothers and babies. The increasing cost of medical liability insurance is creating a patient  access crisis because doctors are leaving the practice of medicine.

67,,108,-0.402,127,2004-02-24,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great honor and pleasure that I stand before  you today to recognize the many accomplishments of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest  Indiana throughout its 50 years of service to  the Northwest Indiana community. As the citizens of Lake County,  Indiana celebrate  the  50th Year Jubilee of the Boys & Girls Clubs of  Northwest  Indiana, we are  reminded of  the  dedication and valiant efforts that have been  made to incorporate education and community  leadership in the region.  Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest  Indiana  began  in  the early 1950’s when Mr. Paul  Guist, Mr. Sid Holub, Mr. Robert Salvaggi and  several other Gary businessmen decided that  the children of Gary needed a place  to go,  complete with worthwhile activities,  to help  keep kids from spending time on street corners. Their efforts led to the incorporation of  the Steel City Boys Club of Gary, Indiana on  August 17, 1954.  The Boys Club was  incorporated  in 1954  when it operated in the hallways, auditorium,  gymnasium  and  one  room  in  the  old  Beveridge School  in Tolleston.  Its  official  name became Steel City Boys Club. In 1956,  another club opened  in  the Webster School  Gym located in Glen Park. This was the year  that  the organization also became a United  Way Agency. An additional club eventually  moved  into  the basement of  the Assyrian  Church where it remained until a permanent  location at 7th and Adams was established  through the efforts of Mr. John Will Anderson  of the Anderson Company. Through Mr. Anderson’s gift, the Old Moose Lodge building at  7th and Adams was purchased in 1965. Mr.  Anderson and  the Anderson Company donated the money and manpower to see that  the building was completely  renovated and  ready for operation in October, 1967. The New  Boys Club facility officially opened on October  23, 1967, appropriately dedicated as the John  Will Anderson Boys Club.  Another Boys Club was opened in 1969 in  the Salesian Prep School in Cedar Lake, and  in November, 1976 that club moved to West  133rd Avenue. In 1982, the new Cedar Lake  Club was built on Fairbanks Street where it remains  today.  In 1973, Katherine House and  the East Chicago Boys Club merged to form  the East Chicago-Katherine House Boys Club  and became a unit of the Steel City Boys Club  organization. In 1976, the John Will Anderson  Club moved to the former Young Men’s Christian Association building on 5th Avenue  in  Gary where  it  remains  today.  In 1977,  the  Steel City Boys Club corporate name was  changed to the Boys Clubs of Northwest Indiana. In March of 1979, the Hammond Boys  Club was established in the Miller School of  Hessville, and  today a new building built  in  1994 proudly stands on Calumet Avenue. The  Lake Station Club was opened in July of 2001.  In 1988, Boys Clubs of Northwest Indiana  officially changed  its name  to Boys & Girls  Clubs of Northwest Indiana— as girls were recognized as official club members. In spite of  the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana’s  growth and  changes,  their philosophy has  never  changed— to  inspire  and  enable  all  young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and  my other distinguished colleagues join me in  honoring and congratulating the Boys & Girls  Clubs of Northwest Indiana, as well as its staff  and community leaders on their 50th anniversary. Their many great accomplishments and  service to Lake County, Indiana will forever be  cherished and commended. f  COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY  MONTH  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 24, 2004 ",2004
68,,108,-0.348,127,2004-02-24,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate  Black History Month, I rise to pay tribute to the  extraordinary  African-American  men  and  women, past and present, who have shaped  the rich history of our Nation.  The month of February has been designated as Black History Month  to celebrate  the  remarkable accomplishments of AfricanAmericans throughout history. This year’s national theme, ‘ ‘Brown v. Board of Education:  50th Anniversary,’  commemorates the historic  Supreme Court decision declaring  that segregation had no place in the laws of a free republic.  Over 50 years ago, in the Midwest town of  Topeka, KS, a little girl named Linda Brown  rode a bus 5 miles to school each day even  though a public school was located only four  blocks from her house. The school was not full  and the little girl met all of the requirements to  attend — except for the color of her skin. It is  hard  to  imagine  that merely 50 years ago,  public schools across our country were deeply  segregated.  A team of brave lawyers from the NAACP  would later appear before the Supreme Court  to demand  the  justice contained within our  founding principles— to demand equality  for  young Linda Brown and for all who had been  denied the basic right of equality for far too  long.  On May 17, 1954,  the United States Supreme Court  spoke unanimously and with  great clarity when  it declared  that  ‘separate  educational  facilities are  inherently unequal.’ This decision continues to have an impact on  our country today. Just last year, the Supreme  Court upheld the core principles of Brown v.  Board when it ruled that maintaining diversity  in higher education  is a compelling governmental  interest.  I was pleased  to  join other  Members of Congress in filing an amicus brief  with  the Court  expressing  our  belief  that  democratic values are enhanced by the interaction  between  students  of  diverse  backgrounds and indicating our full support for the  efforts of universities to create a more vibrant  and enriching learning environment.  The decision in Brown v. Board would also  forever change the landscape of the struggle  for  racial  justice and equality  in  the United  States and demonstrate the ability of individuals to effect true change. The congressional  district that I represent can certainly recognize  the ability of individuals to break through color  barriers. Growing up in Pasadena in the early  to mid – 1900s, a young man named Jackie  Robinson was an all-around athlete that would  later change the sports world. Robinson won  letters  in  football, baseball, basketball, and  track  at Pasadena’s Muir  Technical High  School and Pasadena Junior College. Soon  after, he would become  the  first athlete at  UCLA to play on four varsity teams.  On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson would  take the field to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers— a pioneer as the first African-American to  play major league baseball. Robinson not only  opened the door to pro sports for other African-American athletes, but his remarkable accomplishment would help chip away at prejudices in the minds of Americans and jumpstart  the process of dismantling existing barriers  throughout our society.  In this month of February, let us not only  celebrate the accomplishments of those brave  Americans who fought for racial justice, but let  us work to keep their vision alive by continuing  to break down barriers that exist and working  to ensure equality of opportunity for all Americans. f  GAYLORD ENTERTAINMENT  HON.

Under  the direction of Ray Cardwell,  the  students placed first for middle-sized schools  in the field competition, parade and jazz band  categories.

70,,108,0.339,134,2004-02-24,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to the girls of Brownie Troop 139  of South Haven, Michigan, who have over the  last few months sent numerous care packages  to our troops serving in Iraq. These young ladies have shown remarkable dedication and  devotion to our troops, and I am confident that  this great project has been received with gratitude and appreciation from those overseas.  Since  the  troop began  their project,  they  have collected more  than $1,200 worth of  items totaling 345 pounds. Some of the items  these generous girls have sent include granola  bars, playing cards, batteries, hand  lotion,  boot laces, and of course Girl Scout cookies.  Over the holidays, the girls put together special packages to give our troops a sense of  home.  Brownie Troop 139 is comprised of Jeanne  Lyon,  leader of Troop 139; Marilyn Shaefer,  co-leader; Stephanie Balke; Maggie Filbrandt;  Jessica Overholser; Hannah  Lyon; Shelby  Murphy; Erin Cooper;  and  Lauren Montgomery. The magnificent work this troop has  done to encourage morale and give support to  our troops has been inspiring. It greatly pleases me to honor the great charity these girls  have done, and I find their patriotism and selflessness to be deeply moving. f  PROTESTING THE U.N.

Jean will have completed 38 years of  loyal  and productive work  for  the United States  Postal Service on February 29, 2004.  Jean Sawitzky began her outstanding career  at the West Sacramento post office soon after  graduating from high school. She worked her  way up through the administrative ranks and  has served as  the Postmaster  for Courtland  and Clarksburg, California. In addition to running an efficient office, Jean’s smile and superior customer service have marked her tenure.  She will be missed.  Jean has also been a very active member  of  the West Sacramento and Delta communities, serving as a member and leader of numerous civic, church and community-service  organizations.  In  recent years she has become widely  known  for  the quality and originality of her  handmade quilts, and has been honored at  the Yolo County and California State Fairs.  Jean now teaches this craft to others in northern California.  We are confident  that  in her  retirement  years, Jean will  find more  time  to  invest  in  community service and her artistic endeavors.  I want to thank Jean for her years of excellent  service and wish her well in the active retirement years ahead.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is appropriate at  this  time  that we recognize Jean E. Sawitzky  for her  contributions to her community and her service to our Nation. f  RECOGNIZING SUE HOLMAN AND  SUSAN WEEKS  HON.

72,,108,-0.519,141,2004-02-24,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, on January 26,  India celebrated its Republic Day, the anniversary of the adoption of its Constitution. Now if  it would only live by that constitution.  The Council of Khalistan organized a successful protest outside  the  Indian Embassy  here  in Washington. While  India celebrated,  minorities are being killed. India has murdered  over 250,000 Sikhs since 1984, over 300,000  Christians in Nagaland, over 85,000 Kashmiri  Muslims, and tens of thousands of other minorities. There are tens of thousands of political prisoners, according  to Amnesty  International. These include over 52,000 Sikhs, a  study from the Movement Against State Repression showed. That doesn’t sound  like a  republic to me.  People came to the protest from all over the  East  Coast.  They  chanted  slogans  like  ‘Khalistan Zindabad,’ ‘Long  live Khalistan,’ and many others. They educated  the public  about  the  repression of minorities  in  India  while the attendees at the Ambassador’s party  celebrated India’s freedom.  We salute India’s freedom, but it is time that  these benefits extended to everyone within its  borders, not just the Brahmin elites and their  friends. It is time for the repression to end and  for the minorities to live in freedom too.  Mr. Speaker, this kind of repression is unacceptable in any country, but especially in one  that proclaims itself democratic.  Perhaps  they  feel  that  this  repression  is  necessary to hold the country together, since  India is not a single nation but many nations  thrown together under one banner, much like  the Soviet Union or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. History shows that such nations cannot  long survive.  Now I know you’re wondering what America  can do to help. We should uphold and support  the principle of self-determination for all people. The right to self-determination is the cornerstone of democracy.  The time has come to end our aid to India  so that all the people there can enjoy the glow  of freedom. The best way to secure the blessings of liberty for everyone within India’s artificial borders is to stop aiding the tyrants who  oppress them with U.S. taxpayer dollars. The  other thing that we must do, Mr. Speaker, perhaps equally important, is to take a stand for  the essential right of self-determination by putting this Congress on record in support of a  free and fair plebiscite with international monitoring on the question of independence for all  the minority nations of the subcontinent. This  will ensure them the opportunity to enjoy the  full rights of free people.  Mr. Speaker, the Council of Khalistan issued  an outstanding press release on its Republic  Day protest. I would like to insert it into the  RECORDat this time for the information of my  colleagues and the public. COUNCILOFKHALISTAN,  Washington, DC, January 26, 2004.  SIKHSPROTESTINDIANGENOCIDEONREPUBLIC  DAY  DEMAND FREEDOM FOR SIKH KHALISTAN.  NO DEMOCRACY CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS, OTHERS  NATION OF  SIKHS,  FOR Sikhs from around the East Coast demonstrated in Washington, D.C. today to protest the ongoing genocide against the Sikh  Nation and other minorities by the Hindu  fundamentalist,  terrorist Government  of  India. They  raised  slogans of  ‘‘Khalistan  Zindabad’’, ‘‘India out of Khalistan,’’ ‘‘2–4–6– 8, India is a Fascist state,’’ and other slogans.  India’s Republic Day celebrates the day in  1950 when India adopted its Constitution. But  what India calls ‘‘Republic Day’’ is Genocide  Day for the minority peoples and nations of  South Asia. The Indian government has murdered over 250,000 Sikhs since 1984, more than  300,000 Christians since 1948, over 85,000 Muslims in Kashmir since 1988, and tens of thousands  of  Tamils,  Assamese, Manipuris,  Dalits,  and  others. The  Indian Supreme  Court called the Indian government’s murders of Sikhs ‘‘worse than a genocide.’’ According to a study by the Movement Against  State Repression, 52,268 Sikhs are being held  in  illegal detention as political prisoners  without charge or trial. Some of them have  been held since 1984!  ‘‘India is not a democracy for Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, and other minorities,’’ said  Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh, President of the  Council of Khalistan, which leads the Sikh  Nation’s  struggle  for  independence.  ‘‘The  rights guaranteed in the Indian constitution  are not enjoyed by non-Hindus,’’ he said.  ‘‘While India celebrates, Sikhs and others  are dying,’’ he said. ‘‘Is that something to  celebrate?’’  Christian missionary Joseph Cooper was  expelled from India after a mob of militant  Hindu nationalists allied with the Rashtriya  Swayamsewak Sangh  (RSS), a pro-Fascist  organization that is the parent organization  of the ruling BJP, beat him so severely he  had to spend a week in the hospital. In 2002,  2,000 to 5,000 Muslims were attacked in Gujarat while police were ordered to stand aside,  reminiscent of the 1984 Delhi massacres of  Sikhs. Indian newspapers reported that the  government planned the Gujarat massacre in  advance.  Indian police arrested human-rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra after he exposed  their policy of mass cremation of Sikhs, in  which over 50,000 Sikhs have been arrested,  tortured, and murdered, then their bodies  were declared unidentified and secretly cremated. He was murdered in police custody.  His body was not given to his family. The police  never  released  the  body  of  former  Jathedar of the Akal Takht Gurdev Singh  Kaunke after SSP Swaran Singh Ghotna  murdered  him. Ghotna  has  never  been  brought to trial for the Jathedar Kaunke  murder. No one has been brought to justice  for the kidnapping and murder of Jaswant  Singh Khalra.  ‘‘It  is good that American pressure has  forced  India and Pakistan to talk about  Kashmir,’’ said Dr. Aulakh. ‘‘But the atrocities still continue. Khalistan, Kashmir, and  all the nations of South Asia have the right  to self-determination,’’ he said. ‘‘In a democracy, you cannot rule the people against  their will.’’ On October 7, 1987, the Sikh Nation declared its independence from India,  naming its new country Khalistan. On December 5, Dr. Aulakh met President Bush. ‘‘I  am aware of the Sikh and Kashmiri problem,’’ President Bush told him.  History shows that multinational states  such as India are doomed to failure. Countries like Austria-Hungary, India’s longtime  friend the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and others prove this point. India  is not one country; it is a polyglot like those  countries, thrown together for the convenience of the British colonialists. It is doomed  to break up as they did. India is ruled by  Hindu theocrats whose agenda  is  ‘‘Hindu,  Hindi, Hindutva, Hindu Rashtra,’’ or total  Hindu domination of every facet of Indian  life. An Indian Cabinet minister said that everyone who lives in India must be a Hindu or  subservient to Hindus.  Sikhs ruled Punjab until 1849 when the  British conquered the subcontinent. Sikhs  were equal partners during the transfer of  power from the British. The Muslim leader  Jinnah got Pakistan, the Hindu leaders got  India, but the Sikh leadership was fooled by  the Hindu leadership promising that Sikhs  would have ‘‘the glow of freedom’’ in Northwest India. The Sikhs took their share with  India on that promise.  ‘‘Democracies don’t commit genocide,’’ Dr.  Aulakh said. ‘‘Only in a free and sovereign  Khalistan will the Sikh Nation prosper. In a  democracy, the right to self-determination is  the sine qua non and India should allow a  VerDate jul 14 2003  05:53 Feb 25, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24FE8.050 E24PT1 ‘ ’   ‘ ’   ",2004
73,,108,-0.353,148,2004-02-24,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, the  Supreme Court has agreed to hear two important cases regarding the balance between national security and the rights of American citizens. And  in a February 24th editorial,  the  Rocky Mountain News clearly explains why we  all have a stake in the outcome of the cases  involving Yasr Hamdi and Jose Portillo.  While both evidently are American citizens  now being held as unlawful combatants, their  cases are not  identical. As  the editorial explains:  Both men are citizens, but the incarceration of Hamdi seems less convincingly a  civil-rights incursion than the incarceration  of Padilla. While Hamdi deserves his day in  court, grabbing a prisoner at the site of  armed hostilities in a foreign country is a  different matter from picking someone up at  a domestic airport. And, in the words of the editorial, here is the  bottom line: The obvious issue with Padilla is that if  the administration can stick him away as  long as it likes without an indictment or  court proceedings of any kind, why can’t it  do the same thing with any of us? Mr. Speaker, that is exactly the point, and  exactly why the Portillo case is so important.  For the benefit of our colleagues, I am attaching the full text of the editorial. [From the Rocky Mountain News, Feb. 24,  2004]  PADILLADESERVESDUEPROCESS—STILL  Some argue the Bush administration was  justified in arresting a U.S. citizen and holding him for two years without due process  because, after all, he was in league with terrorists. The logical fallacy here is known as  begging the question—you assume the conclusion in the proposition.  How can the administration know Jose  Padilla was  a  terrorist  intent  on mass  killings through use of a ‘‘dirty’’ bomb without due process? And if this can be proven,  why doesn’t the government initiate a trial?  The Supreme Court is now going to take  on the question of whether the administration violated the Constitution  in holding  Padilla, arrested  in Chicago after a  trip  abroad, and Yaser Hamdi, captured in a battlefield in Afghanistan. Both men are citizens, but the incarceration of Hamdi seems  less  convincingly a  civil-rights  incursion  than  the  incarceration of Padilla. While  Hamdi deserves his day in court, grabbing a  prisoner at the site of armed hostilities in a  foreign country is a different matter from  picking someone up at a domestic airport.  The obvious issue with Padilla is that if  the administration can stick him away as  long as it likes without an indictment or  court proceedings of any kind, why can’t it  do the same thing with any of us?  It’s hard to see how the Supreme Court  could side with the administration in the  Padilla case, even if a few other presidents,  most notably Abraham Lincoln during the  Civil War, have gotten away with the suspension of due process. Moreover, there is language both in Article I of the Constitution  and the Fifth Amendment that allows exceptions to due process protections when there  is a public danger. We simply don’t believe  that language would be correctly applied to  the Padilla situation. SPEECH OF DR. ARCH BARRETT  HON. JOHN M. SPRATT, JR.  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 24, 2004 ",2004
74,,108,-0.256,148,2004-02-24,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to enter  into the RECORDa speech given by a former  staffer of  the House Armed Services Committee, Arch Barrett. Arch is one of the most  unassuming people I know, but was one of the  most  remarkable and able staffers  I’ve met  during my 20 years on Capitol Hill.  Arch had an undergraduate degree  from  both  the West Point and Harvard, and  later  got his Ph.D. in political economy and government from Harvard. He entered the Air Force  as a second lieutenant in 1957, saw plenty of  action in Vietnam, and retired as a colonel in  1981. While in the Air Force, he received the  Distinguished Flying Cross, Legion of Merit,  Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal with 12  oak  leaf clusters,  the Joint Service and Air  Force Commendation Medals, and  the Vietnam Service Medal.  As distinguished as his military record is, his  greatest effect on the military came after he  became a staffer for the House Armed Services Committee. If it were not for Arch Barrett,  I do not believe Congress would have enacted  the Goldwater-Nichols Act. Goldwater-Nichols  forced  the separate branches of  the Armed  Services to work cooperatively, and our forces  would not be nearly as effective today had it  not been for the Goldwater-Nichols Act. The  Pentagon fought Goldwater-Nichols tooth and  nail, and it took us about 4 years to actually  pass the legislation. Whenever the Pentagon  raised an objection, we sent Arch Barrett over  and he’d argue with the naysayers until they  ran out of objections and had to relent. It was  a virtuoso performance by someone who had  mastered the subject matter.  Arch Barrett is now a professor at the Navy  Post-Graduate School in Monterrey, still serving his country. He gave the graduation address  to  the Naval Postgraduate School’s  Joint Professional Military Education Course in  June 2003.  In  that speech, Arch of course  downplayed his own role in establishing Goldwater-Nichols,  but  did  recognize  important  contributions  from several Members of Congress. One of those is a man I, like Arch Barrett, admire— my good  friend and colleague  from Missouri, the Ranking Democrat on the  House Armed Services Committee, Ike Skelton.  I commend Arch’s speech to all those with  an interest in the founding of the GoldwaterNichols legislation, and I am proud to enter it  into the RECORD.

77,Senate,108,-0.194,10,2004-03-01,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, moment by moment things are  unfolding  down  in  the  poverty-  wracked, AIDS-infected, politically unstable island nation of Haiti. I have  had quite a bit of commentary on this  subject since I had sent a letter of February 10 to the President suggesting  what should be done. Given the events  that have unfolded over the weekend—  the fact that Aristide has fled, the fact  that the U.S. military is located there  as a first wave of an international security force to try to establish order—  I want to talk about the future of that  island nation.  Clearly, it is a nation that has been  troubled  for  stability, political and  economic. I think what is in the interests of Haiti, as well as the interests of  the United States, is to stabilize that  nation. It is a nation that has not been  comfortable because of the scores of  coups d’etat that have occurred over  the 200-year history of that little country. It is a country where we only need  to look 10 years back to see that.  When Aristide was elected President,  a coup went  in, removed him  from  power, and it took the U.S. military to  come back in to put him back into  power. The problem is that we didn’t  stay for the long haul. We didn’t help  Haiti pull  itself up by  its economic  bootstraps. We didn’t continue to help  them understand if they had no history  of democratic institutions that functioned well—to help them continue to  improve their institutions so it would  foster free and fair elections and people  would respect the rule of law.  That is why we are at this place.  That is why I have taken this occasion  to come and talk to my colleagues  about what ought to happen in the future in Haiti.  First, the Haitian people are an industrious people, and they are a proud  people.  I visited the city slum called Cite  Soleil in the capital city of Port-au-  Prince amidst enormous poverty and  the most meager of material possessions. There is a huge drainage ditch  running through this section of Port-  au-Prince. It is an open garbage sewer.  Yet as I walked into those little homes  which many times only had a piece of  corrugated tin across the top not even  sealing the roof, I found those little  homes so neatly kept with such pride.  I found in the middle of that slum a little area no larger than half the size of  a basketball court neatly swept and  used as a soccer field. I found there  were lots of Americans there trying to  assist with education.  One of our colleagues from this body,  Senator DEWINEof Ohio, has been to  Haiti some 12 or 13 times. He contributes from his own pocket each year to  some  of  the missions  there  and  a  Catholic priest who has a school—not  only  for  the children but a  school  afterhours for the parents to come and  learn what their children are learning  so they will be in a position of encouraging their own children to have a  chance to escape poverty by opening up  their minds through education.  I saw an extraordinary medical clinic, much of which is assisted by the  United States, in the midst of all of  that poverty and disease—indeed AIDS  as well. This medical clinic was like a  beacon of light in the midst of darkness. It was well respected—even by  the hooligans who are there. They respect that medical clinic as well.  Our delegation talked to a Dr. Pap  who has had tremendous success  in  bringing under  control  the  surging  numbers of AIDS infections. But when  you start with a huge percentage of the  population  already  infected  with  AIDS—indeed the highest degree of infection  in the Western Hemisphere—  then you have to start from a base that  is already out of control.  I saw industries that were once thriving suddenly, because those private enterprises could not get loans—by the  way, what bank was to give loans to an  area where it was so wracked with political and economic chaos? I saw the  fact that our Government had basically  not gone to bat  for Haiti on  international loans from the development  banks; and that we were insisting that  Haiti pay off arrears before it would  get another loan. How was Haiti going  to pay off any arrears? As a result,  there were not the loans coming in to  build the roads or, more importantly,  to improve the existing roads and just  to maintain them.  As I went 50 miles north from Port-  au-Prince on a road that only had a  hard surface for 16 or maybe 17 miles,  then there was nothing but potholes,  and all the commerce running north  and south in the island was attempting  to go on that road.  What can we learn about what to do  for the future of Haiti? It is very clear  to me. The United States had better be  involved. We had better not have a  hands-off policy as we have had over  the course of the past 5 or 6 years. We  had better be involved, because it not  only affects Haitians but it affects the  United States. Let me tell you how.  In the midst of the Western Hemisphere with a country to be as poverty  stricken as Haiti is, it is going to be  ripe for insurrection and tumult. What  happens when there is insurrection and  tumult? It is ripe to attract the drug  trade—which it already has in big-time  numbers—and it is ripe to attract terrorists.  When we start talking about what is  in the interest of the United States, it  had better be one conclusion: to help  Haiti in the future. If there is hopelessness and despair with no way out and  no jobs, what is going to happen? There  is going to be a mass exodus from that  island nation just as there was in the  beginning of all of this political strife  that occurred over the past few weeks.  The Coast Guard has picked up over  700 people at sea. What is in the interest of the United States? The Coast  Guard doesn’t have to do that. But if  people start fleeing in such huge numbers that they start overwhelming the  coast of Florida, what does that do to  our social system  in Florida? What  does that do to Immigration and Customs? What does that do in our ability  to protect the homeland by securing  our borders?  Need I remind you that in a mass migration to the United States, is there  not the opportunity for terrorists to  slip into the country under the cover of  that mass migration, not even to speak  of the drug trade that would be entering our country?  I appreciate the time in the midst of  this gun debate. I thank the two Senators who are leading this debate for  allowing me to come and pour out my  heart. I am not looking to the past  now. The past is past. Let us go forward.

80,Senate,108,-0.351,45,2004-03-01,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, I am  rising in support of the amendment we  will vote on tomorrow on continuing  the assault weapons ban. I am carrying  this amendment along with Senator  FEINSTEIN, who passed the bill in the  Senate in 1993. I was the lead sponsor  in the House as well as the two of our  colleagues from the other side of the  aisle, Senator WARNER and Senator  DEWINE, and many others.  When we passed the assault weapons  ban in 1993, there was a great deal of  concern. The arguments against the  ban were two: One, that the bill would  cause to be confiscated weapons far beyond the 19 banned weapons, the Uzis  and the AK–47s; and, two, that it would  not be effective.  We now have 10 years of evidence and  the evidence is clear that neither of  those worries about this bill have proven to be true. We cannot report a single  instance where a nonassault weapon  was confiscated, an overreaching Government, ATF, or whomever went in  and  confiscated  hunting  rifles  or,  frankly, other than the 19, weapons  that were not on the list. We were careful in the bill. We named 670 different  guns used for hunting, protection, and  sports  shooting  that  could  not  be  touched. But it is even new guns that  have come out since then. There has  not been a single complaint of which I  am aware.  Second, the bill has been effective. In  all gun crimes, the percent of assault  weapons that are used has gone down  to one-third of what it was. A little  more than 3.5 percent—I think it is 3.75  percent of crime guns were assault  weapons back before 1993. In the last 10  years, it has gone down to 1.2 percent.  Law enforcement is strongly for our  bill for the simple reason they don’t  want to be outgunned on the streets.  They don’t want one of our  latest  criminal problems, gangs, to have Uzis  and AK–47s while they are shooting  back with their 9 mms. The bill has  worked.  As a result, the American people are  overwhelmingly in favor of the assault  weapons ban. Mr. President, 77 percent  of the voters are  for  it; 21 percent  against; even among gun owners, 66  percent for, 30 percent against. So the  bill has overwhelming support.  You would think it would be renewed  and renewed rather quickly, but  instead it is hanging by a hair. If I had to  bet—and I have been whipping this bill  for the last week—there will either be  a tie or it will pass by one vote or it  will fail by one vote. This bill is neck  and neck. All it does is renew this controversial but successful piece of legislation for another 10 years. In fact, it is  an exact replica of the previous bill.  Many of us would have liked the bill  to go further, to cover weapons that  are semiautomatic assault weapons but  are not covered by the bill. Manufacturers have come out and created new  weapons around the 19. But  in deference to those who worry that the  Government will expand unreasonably  search and confiscation, so to speak, of  these weapons, we didn’t do it. So we  are simply asking to renew the 19 different types of assault weapons.  Just to show, these weapons that  were banned can never be used  for  hunting. They can never be used for  target practice. They can’t be used,  really, in self-defense unless you are  reckless and wild, because they were  designed by armies for use in military  combat. In other words, they didn’t  have to be terribly accurate. They had  to have strong firepower and be able to  fire a whole lot of bullets in a very  short time. Names such as AK–47, Uzi,  TEC–9, and Streetsweeper—these are  weapons of mass devastation. They are  very efficient killing machines. They  are appropriate on the field of battle  but not in a reasonable country where  there is a right to bear arms—which I  believe in but not an unlimited right to  bear any arm whatsoever.  I would say to my colleagues, my adversaries, because that is what they  are really, in the NRA, no amendment  is  absolute.  I  believe  in  the  first  amendment. I cherish it. But there are  a  lot of  limits on  first amendment  rights. Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes  said you can’t wrongly scream ‘‘fire’’  in a crowded theater. That is an imposition on my complete rights of free  speech but it is a reasonable limitation.  The same on the second amendment.  I tell you I resent those on the left who  want the first amendment to be expanded as broadly as possible and then  say the second amendment has to fit  through a pinhole. There is a right to  bear arms but it is not an unlimited  right to bear arms. Should anyone be  able to buy a tank or a bazooka? Of  course not.  Here is an AK–47. It is the most widely used assault weapon in the world. It  is a very good military machine. It  comes with a 30-round ammunition clip  capable of being fired as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. The faster  you can move your finger, the more  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:40 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S01MR4.REC S01MR4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

One of the  people who has helped me understand  the  role of credit unions is Daniel Egan, who plays  a  leadership role not  just  in Massachusetts,  but through cooperative arrangements with our  neighboring States of New Hampshire and  Rhode Island.  Recently,  the Neighborhood Reinvestment  Corporation, a very important national organization fighting for economic fairness, passed a  resolution congratulating Dan Egan in his capacity as president of  the New Hampshire  Credit Union League— which he holds in addition to his Massachusetts work— for his efforts  to promote credit union activity.  Mr. Egan very much deserves this recognition and as a tribute both to him and to the important work of the credit unions of New England, I ask that the resolution from the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation be printed  here.

82,,108,0.366,5,2004-03-08,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, today the  Senate will begin debate on the first  concurrent budget resolution for fiscal  year 2005. Chairman NICKLESand Senator CONRADare prepared to begin the  debate under  the  statutory  50-hour  time limitation. Given the nature of  the budget resolution and the lengthy  debate, on Friday I announced that no  rollcall votes would occur today. This  afternoon Senators will come to the  floor to speak in relation to the budget  or the two managers may have amendments to consider over the course of  the day. However, any votes ordered  today will be delayed until tomorrow.  As we begin the week, I do want to  put all of our Members on notice that  this week will include lengthy sessions  each day and into the evening. We have  the 50-hour time limit. There will be  references made to that time limit during the course of this afternoon and,  indeed, every day. It is my hope we will  be able to yield back some of the 50hour time limit. I will be talking to the  two managers to see if that will be possible.  In any event,  the debate will be  lengthy; it will be throughout the day  and likely, as I mentioned, go into the  evening.  We have a recess next week. We will  finish this bill this week. I have already heard about a number of scheduling conflicts over the course of the  week, into Saturday and Friday, and I  will do everything possible to accommodate the request, but I need to make  it absolutely clear, as I did last week,  that we are going to finish the budget  resolution this week. Therefore, I ask  for all Members to adjust their schedules accordingly, especially on Friday.  I do want to comment on the process,  the so-called vote-arama, that we come  to at this point each and every year. As  Members are aware, even after the 50  hours  expire,  Senators  can  offer  amendments with no debate and they  can demand votes, but I think if we  look back at past experience almost all  Senators will agree  that  this votearama, which in more recent times has  come to characterize what follows the  50 hours,  is absolutely not the best  process  for  consideration  of  their  amendments.  Thus, I encourage, in fact plead, with  Members to approach the two managers of the resolution and see if they  can limit the excessive number of votes  needed at the end of the process.  I  thank  Senators  and  CONRAD for their hard work in getting  this budget resolution ready for floor  action. NICKLES f  CAMPBELL ator BENNIGHTHORSE SENATOR BEN NIGHTHORSE  CAMPBELL  ",2004

That is the reality we confront.  Interestingly enough, they say, you  have the shortfall in Social Security  which is $3.8 trillion over the next 75  years. That is absolutely true. We have  a shortfall in Social Security of $3.8  trillion over  75 years.

85,Senate,108,-0.325,33,2004-03-08,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President,  I  rise to speak about the budget. I first  commend my  ranking member,  the  Senator from North Dakota, for his incredible  leadership and  the way  in  which he has presented all of these  issues and the challenges  facing our  country. There is no question that a  huge hole has been dug with deficits as  far as the eye can see.  I remember coming onto the Budget  Committee as a new Member of the  Senate in 2001, when the debate was  what to do with the largest surplus in  the history of the country. I remember  when the Senator from North Dakota  was talking about the baby boomers retiring and the need to put money aside  to meet our obligations under Social  Security and Medicare, and the need to  look to the future.  Unfortunately, instead, what we saw  were very  short-term decisions  that  turned the largest budget surplus in  the history of the country  into the  largest budget deficit in the history of  the country, in only 3 years. It is astounding to see what has happened in  the last 3 years.  But I thank him for his courage and  his willingness to fight for what is important to my family and the people of  Michigan and the people of North Dakota and people all across the country,  for fighting for the right priorities for  the future of our country.  I also want to take a moment to  thank our chairman, who convened his  last budget hearing and budget resolution markup this year. I appreciate the  fact that he conducted a fair markup,  as he has done since being chairman.  We came to the conclusion and voted  on a budget resolution that now is in  front of us. He did it in a very fair way.  I also commend him for a couple of  tough decisions he made that the administration was not willing to make.  Chairman NICKLES, unlike the administration, put funding in the budget for  ongoing activities in Iraq. He put in a  reserve fund of $30 billion. While I am  concerned that is not enough to meet  the request that will come back to us,  I commend him for his leadership in  understanding the number certainly is  not zero, that there needs to be an  VerDate jul 14 2003  00:57 Mar 09, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G08MR6.072 S08PT1 ",2004
86,Senate,108,-0.296,40,2004-03-08,Mr. CONRAD.," I might say  for my  part I always enjoy visiting with the  Senator from Utah and his questions.  He thinks about these subjects in a  very careful and disciplined way. I always enjoy these chances to have a serious discussion and a serious debate  that is all too lacking in the Senate.  Just momentarily, because I know  the Senator from Nevada has a presentation he would like to make, and I  know  the Senator  from Washington  also has something, for the record I  will provide the other side of the story  with respect to something Senator ALLARDpresented.  Senator ALLARDwas making the argument that those at the highest income levels are actually going to bear  a greater proportion of the total tax  bill going forward than they did before  the tax cuts. The analysis we have seen  by others reaches a different conclusion. Let me share that with my colleagues.  This is done by the Tax Policy Center  which is run jointly by the Urban Institute and  the Brookings  Institution.  Their conclusion  is those with very  high incomes will be paying a smaller  share of total taxes as a result of the  Bush tax cuts.  Let me give three examples. Those  with taxable incomes above $1 million  who constitute 0.2 of a percent of taxpayers would pay 12 percent of total  taxes in 2006 without the Bush tax cuts.  With the tax cuts, these same pairs  will pay 11.2 percent of total taxes in  that year. This includes not only income taxes but payroll taxes.  Second example. Those with taxable  incomes above $500,000, who constitute  one half of  1 percent of  taxpayers,  would pay 17.4 percent of total taxes in  2006 without the Bush tax cuts. With  the tax cuts, these same taxpayers will  pay 16.4 percent of total taxes in that  year.  Finally, those with taxable incomes  above $200,000, who constitute 2.4 percent of taxpayers, would pay 30.7 percent of total taxes in 2006 without the  Bush tax cuts. However, with the tax  cuts, these same taxpayers will pay 30.1  percent of total taxes in that year.  The Senator from Colorado was arguing that those who are at the high incomes will pay more of total taxes as a  result of the Bush tax cuts. This independent analysis by the Tax Policy  Center reaches just the opposite conclusion. When you  look at  income  taxes and payroll taxes, higher income  people, those at $1 million, those at  $500,000, those at $200,000, all will pay  less than they would have paid without  the tax cuts.  Finally, looking at it in a different  way, under the Bush income tax cuts,  the top 20 percent of income earners  got 68.7 percent of the benefit. More  striking, the top 1 percent of income  earners,  those  earning more  than  $337,000, got 33 percent of the benefit of  the Bush tax cut. That is much more  than any other income class.  Finally, looking at 2006, how the tax  benefits stack up, in that year, middle(Mr.  income taxpayers, those who are right  in the middle of the income stream, the  20 percent right in the middle, will receive an average tax cut of $566. Those  with incomes over $1 million in 2006  will get an average tax cut of $140,369. If  these bars were actually proportionate, the bar representing the tax  cuts received by those with over $1 million of income would have to be 35 feet  tall. It would have to be 35 feet tall in  order to compare proportionately with  what the middle-income taxpayers will  receive in that year.  I thank my colleagues and yield the  floor so the Senator from Nevada can  speak.  I ask the Senator, will you give us an  idea how long you intend to speak?  ",2004
87,Senate,108,-0.25,47,2004-03-08,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I wish  to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of a dedicated  journalist serving readers in my State of  South Dakota. For years, Dottie Potter has served as a reporter covering  important news impacting South Dakota’s Native American population. As  a writer for the Indian Country Today  and the Lakota Nation Journal, Dottie  is truly a credit to her profession.  She has worked hard over the years  to educate the general population of  the  talents,  accomplishments  and  skills of Native Americans  in South  Dakota. Dottie has helped educate and  inform thousands of readers. I have always respected her professionalism and  skill as a  journalist, and her sensitivity to the issues affecting her readers.  Her tireless efforts to dig for details  and to explore all sides of particular  issues symbolizes her dedication to the  field of journalism. She is a well-respected reporter in South Dakota. But  she is also well-known for her empathy  and care when writing human interest  stories. Dottie has delivered stories to  her readers on almost every topic, from  those that involved the road to success  for a favorite son or daughter to words  of wisdom from a tribal elder to the  plight of South Dakota Indian families.  Among the many awards she has received over the years, she received the  South Dakota Education Association  Golden Apple Award in October of 2002,  in recognition of outstanding media  coverage of public education issues and  events in South Dakota.  Dottie now works  on  a  personal  story, a fight to overcome cancer. A reporter to the core, Dottie continues to  make an  impact on her community.  With remarkable spirit and bravery,  she  still works as a  reporter with  Lakota Nation Journal as  she educates, entertains and informs readers.  Her fight against cancer serves as an  inspiration to others.  I congratulate and commend Dottie  Potter on her many years as a journalist. Her body of work serves as a  long-standing tribute to her commitment to the Native American populations of South Dakota and the Nation.∑ LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT  OF 2003  ∑",2004

On May 1, 2003, Senator KENNEDY and  I  introduced  the  Local Law Enforcement Enhancement  Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes  law,  sending a signal that violence of any  kind is unacceptable in our society.  On May 6, 1999, in Santa Clarita, CA,  two men were charged with suspicion  of committing a hate crime after they  allegedly burglarized a residence and  beat three gay men.  I  believe  that Government’s  first  duty is to defend its citizens, to defend  them against the harms that come out  of hate.

89,Senate,108,0.23,54,2004-03-08,Mr. CAMPBELL.,"  Mr.  President,  today I take great pride in introducing  the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Trust Act of 2004, a bill to establish the Sand Creek National Historic Site in Kiowa County, CO.  The bill I am introducing today follows the Sand Creek National Historic  Site Establishment Act of 2000, Public  Law 106–465, which recognized the tragic events of November  28,  1868 and  made  it clear that America has the  strength and resolve to face its past  and learn the painful lessons that come  with intolerance.  Much has been written about the horrors visited upon the plains Indians in  the territories of the Western United  States in the latter half of the 19th  century. However, what has been lost  for more than a century  is a comprehensive understanding of the events  of that day in a grove of cottonwood  trees along Sand Creek.  This bill  I am  introducing  today  builds upon the Act of 2000 and authorizes the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes  of Oklahoma to take the land on which  these  tragic events  took place  into  trust for traditional, cultural, and historical purposes only.  The indisputable facts are these: 700  members of the Colorado Militia, commanded by Colonel John Chivington  struck at dawn that November day, attacking an encampment of Cheyenne  and Arapho Indians settled under the  U.S. flag and a white flag which the Indian Chiefs Black Kettle and White Antelope were told by the U.S. would protect them from military attack.  By day’s end, almost  150  Indians,  many of them women, children and the  elderly, lay dead. Chivington’s men reportedly desecrated the bodies of the  dead after the massacre, and newspaper  reports from Denver at the time told of  the troops displaying Indian body parts  in a gruesome display as they rode  through the streets of Colorado’s largest city following the attack.  The 2000  legislation authorized the  National Park Service to enter into negotiations with willing sellers only in  an attempt to secure property inside a  boundary which encompasses approximately 12,470 acres as identified by the  National Park Service for a lasting memorial to events of that fateful day.  The Sand Creek Massacre National  Historic Site has come into being because all of those involved have exhibited an extraordinary ability to put  aside their differences, look with equal  measure at the scientific evidence and  the oral traditions of the Tribes, and  come up with a plan that equally honors the memory of those killed and the  rights of the private property owners  who have been faithful and responsible  stewards of this site.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows: S. 2173 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

THE OF By Mr. BUNNING  (for himself  and Ms. MIKULSKI):  S. 2174. A bill to amend title XIX of  the Social Security Act to include podiatrists as physicians for purposes of  covering physicians services under the  medicaid program; to the Committee  on Finance.  ",2004
90,Senate,108,0.521,54,2004-03-08,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce a very important  piece of legislation with Senator MIKULSKIfrom Maryland. Our bill will ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries in all  States have access to the services of  top-quality podiatric physicians.  Podiatrists play a vital roll in keeping feet and ankles healthy. This is  critical to keeping people mobile and  productive, which  is a key to good  long-term health.  Proper foot care is particularly important for individuals with diabetes,  which is a severe problem in my State.  According to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), 18.2 million people—or 6.3 percent of the population—have diabetes in this country,  and  it  is the sixth  leading cause of  death. If not managed properly, diabetes can cause  several  severe health  problems, including blindness, kidney  disease and heart disease. Too often,  diabetes can  lead  to  foot complications, including foot ulcers and even  amputations.  In fact, the CDC estimate that ‘‘more  than 60 percent of nontraumatic lowerlimb amputations occur among people  with diabetes,’’ which  equals about  82,000 amputations a year.  These numbers are startling.  Podiatrists, however, can play a vital  role in recognizing and correcting foot  problems among diabetics to help avoid  amputations and other complications.  Our bill is fairly simple. It amends  the Medicaid’s definition of  ‘‘physicians’’ to include podiatric physicians.  This will ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have access to foot care from  those most qualified to provide it.  Under Medicaid, podiatry is considered an optional benefit. However, just  because  it  is optional, doesn’t mean  that  the need  for  these  services  is  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:32 Mar 09, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A08MR6.028 S08PT1 ",2004
91,,108,0.554,1,2004-03-16,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I am  here this morning to talk about the recent tragedy in Spain. The real winner  TUESDAY, MARCH16, 2004 in the Spanish general elections was  not  the Socialist Party or  its new  Prime Minister or the Spanish people.  The real winners were the terrorists  who murdered 201 and wounded over  1,500 Spaniards.  The results in Spain’s general elections,  in which Prime Minister Jose  Maria Aznar’s party was defeated while  the antiwar Socialist Party came to  power after 8 years out of office, can be  almost entirely attributed to the devastating terrorist attacks just 3 days  before.  Is it a stretch to credit these terrorists with winning the election? Consider this: The day before the train  bombings, Aznar’s party was predicted  to win comfortably. A mere 3 days and  a changed nation later, the Socialist  Party, whose main election year promise was to pull the Spanish troops out  of Iraq, won by 5 percentage points.  It was an incredible change in just 72  hours. All it took was a note from people claiming to be al Qaeda saying they  were  responsible  for  the  bombing.  Prime Minister Aznar was blamed by  his  countrymen  for  the  bombings,  which they linked to his strong support  of the war  in  Iraq. Now the newly  elected  Spanish Prime Minister  is  poised to withdraw Spain’s 1,300 soldiers in Iraq.  Spain is not the only country under  retribution for fighting against terror.  Pakistan’s  President  General  Musharraf confirmed yesterday that al  Qaeda was behind two assassination attempts against him in December.  Mr. Speaker, we have reached a critical moment in the international war  on terror. Al Qaeda has long threatened to attack any country that dares  to help us. But now a true and valued  ally has been hit, and they have chosen  to withdraw from the coalition of the  willing.  We extend our sympathies and hand  in friendship to the people in Spain,  but we must realize that the surest  way to encourage terrorism is to let  terrorists think that their bombs will  make us do their bidding. Retreat will  result in more terrorism, not less. Appeasement begets more appeasement,  which leads to war. We can either abdicate our responsibilities or face these  terrorists with steely resolve.  The Spaniards have their reasons for  voting  out  the Aznar  government.  They have experienced a shocking ordeal and they responded the only way  they knew how in the short time they  were given. But the people of America  also had to vote against terrorist attacks with a threat of war approaching. In November 2003, the American  people stood up to thugs like Osama  bin Laden and Saddam Hussein and defied off-year election history by choosing Members of Congress  from  the  President’s party who supported our  war against terrorism.  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is  that al Qaeda is an enemy of us and  Western civilization, not just against  our allies in the war who are fighting  terror. In the international alignment  of us versus them, the opponents are  not the coalition of the willing or,  quote, Old Europe, not warriors or  pacifists. The two sides are tyranny  and democracy. Al Qaeda’s mission is  b This symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

93,House,108,-0.538,15,2004-03-16,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, as  many people know, there is an effort  underway by some of our colleagues to  diminish FDR’s legacy by taking his  profile off the dime and replacing it  with President Ronald Reagan’s profile.  I am not opposed  to honoring  President Reagan, who  served  our  country with great distinction, but  why  in  order  to  honor  President  Reagan must we dishonor President  Roosevelt?  I would like to explain to my colleagues the reasons why FDR is on the  dime. Having been paralyzed by infantile paralysis, polio, FDR was a longtime supporter of efforts to eradicate  the disease. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, a national organization which  raised funds to find a cure for polio.  The following year, comedian Eddie  Cantor asked the Nation to mail dimes  to the White House to help the foundation; and  in one month,  the White  House received $85,000 in dimes. Cantor  declared it a March of Dimes, and the  name became the lasting moniker for  the foundation.  The new FDR dime was  issued on  January 30, 1946, the date that would  have been FDR’s 64th birthday. In a  broadcast kicking off the annual March  of Dimes campaign on the same day,  President Harry S. Truman declared:  ‘‘The fight to conquer infantile paralysis is an unfinished task of Franklin  Delano Roosevelt. It must and shall be  carried to complete victory.’’  Madam Speaker, at this point, I include  the March of Dimes statement against  removing FDR’s profile from the dime. in the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  MARCHOFDIMESSTRONGLYOPPOSES  REMOVALOFFDR FROMTHEDIME  The profile of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was placed on the dime in 1946 to memorialize his 4 term Presidency, his fight to  find a vaccine to prevent polio, and the volunteer movement epitomized by the March  of Dimes. For all these reasons, the March of  Dimes strongly opposes efforts to remove  FDR from the dime.  The Franklin D. Roosevelt dime  commemorates a national movement that resulted in the eradication of polio from the  United States and in the near future from  the entire world. The efforts funded through  the ‘‘March of Dimes’’ campaign initiated by  Roosevelt provided care for the victims of  polio while aggressively working to develop  vaccines against it. This represented one of  the first large-scale, nationwide biomedical  initiatives, led by a charitable organization.  It also helped make the volunteer movement  an integral part of the fabric of American  life.  In January 1938, alarmed by decades of  worsening polio epidemics and the terrible  toll  the virus was  taking on America’s  young, President Roosevelt established the  National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.  The National Foundation emphasized the nationwide significance and non-partisan character of the polio crusade. FDR believed that  people  could  solve any problem  if  they  worked  together. Comedian Eddie Cantor  coined the phrase ‘‘March of Dimes’’ (playing  on the popular newsreel feature ‘‘The March  of Time’’), appealing to radio listeners all  over the country to send their dimes directly  to the White House. The campaign proved to  be hugely successful with over 2.5 million  dimes sent to the White House the first year.  The National Foundation officially changed  its name to the March of Dimes in 1979.  The FDR dime not only commemorates his  presidency,  but  represents  the American  spirit of working together to help one another. The coin is symbolic of the struggle to  end polio through the  ‘‘March of Dimes’’  campaign and the worldwide eradication of  polio is expected in 2005. The dime is a vehicle in which to explain what the volunteer  spirit in America means, it would be a shame  to lose that. In response to the Reagan dime bill,  I introduced H. Con.

95,,108,0.231,43,2004-03-16,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, this Member  commends to his colleagues the following article from the March 10, 2004, Lincoln Journal  Star. According to the article, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce conducted a national survey  of 1,402 senior corporate attorneys on  the  business litigation environment in the different  states. This article indicates that Nebraska is  ranked second out of the 50 states in this survey which took into account factors such as  the treatment of liability and class action lawsuits; punitive damages,  fairness and competence of juries, and judge impartiality.  This U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey illustrates  that Nebraska  is a great state  for  businesses to grow and flourish. Businesses  should want to locate in a state like Nebraska  which has a  fair  judicial system, among  the  many positive attributes of this great state. As  a  result of  the  findings of  this survey,  this  Member  hopes  that more  businesses will  move to Nebraska which will create additional  jobs. [From the Lincoln Journal Star, Mar. 10,  2004]  STATE’SCOURTSRANKSECONDINFAIRNESS  OMAHA.—Nebraska’s court  system  ranks  second in fairness when it comes to liability  suits, according to a survey of corporate attorneys by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  It is the second year in a row Nebraska has  been listed in the top five of the pro-business  group’s survey.  Nebraska’s good liability reputation can  help the state business-wise, the group said.  ‘‘Businesses go where they are wanted and  they bring  jobs and economic growth to  states with the best legal systems,’’ Thomas  Donahue, the U.S. Chamber president, said  in a statement.  The chamber’s study says 80 percent of the  1,402  senior corporate attorneys  surveyed  said the ‘‘litigation environment’’ in a state  could affect such decisions at their companies as where to locate or do business.  The Chamber of Commerce’s survey took  such factors into consideration as treatment  of  liability  and  class-action  suits,  the  issuance of punitive damages, judge impartiality and competence, and  the predictability and fairness of juries.  Delaware was rated the best, followed by  Nebraska, Virginia, Iowa and Idaho. Last  year, the top  five  list was Delaware, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota and Indiana.  From best to worst, the bottom five in this  year’s Chamber of Commerce survey were  California, Louisiana, Alabama, West Virginia and Mississippi.  The survey is done by the Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for Legal Reform and is in  its third year.  The group says the wide gap the survey  shows between the best and worst states underscores the need for federal and state reforms on class-action, asbestos litigation and  medical malpractice suits.

So I will start  with a brief explanation. Chemical manufacturing  is  the source of many products upon  which we depend such as medicines, plastics,  fuels, and fabrics. However, chemical manufacturing has also resulted in harm to the environment and human health. The goal of green  chemistry is to minimize or, ideally, to eliminate this harm. It is defined as the design of  chemical products and processes that reduce  or eliminate  the use or generation of hazardous substances. By factoring hazard in to  the design of products and processes, chemists can design chemicals to be safe, just as  they can design them to have other properties,  such as color or texture.  Many private sector industries have recognized the potential of green chemistry.

98,,108,0.375,50,2004-03-16,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor a friend and distinguished constituent,  John E. Pepper, retired Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer of  the Procter & Gamble  Company, who will have the honor of being inducted into the American Advertising Federation’s Advertising Hall of Fame in New York  City today.  The Advertising Hall of Fame  is  the most  prestigious honor bestowed in the advertising  industry. It is awarded to individuals who have  set the standard for lifetime advertising excellence, and who have made volunteer efforts  outside the workplace. With this honor, John  joins a notable group of  industry  luminaries,  including William S. Paley, David Ogilvy, Leo  Burnett, Ray Kroc, William Bernbach, and  David Sarnoff.  An  influential  leader  throughout his career  with Procter & Gamble, one of  the world’s  leading advertisers, John was selected for the  honor because he led some of the company’s  most powerful advertising  initiatives. His expertise  led  to revolutionary advertising campaigns  for  Dash  detergent  and  a  groundbreaking new advertising agency compensation system. John had a profound effect  on Procter & Gamble and on advertising.  John served as the ninth chairman of the  board and chief executive officer at Procter &  Gamble,  retiring  in 2002 after 38 years of  service. After  joining Procter & Gamble  in  1963, he served as a brand manager for Cascade detergent, where his leadership built an  entire category. He developed  landmark advertising  that contributed  to Procter & Gamble’s dominance.  In 1974, John became general manager of  Procter & Gamble Italia, returned in 1978, and  was elected a group vice president in 1980. In  1984, he was elected to the board of directors  and was named president in 1986. That year,  he  implemented P&G’s Advertising Awards  (now called Global Brand Building Awards), to  showcase brands  that grew primarily due  to  advertising. John was also an early advocate  of Procter & Gambles’s global expansion, and  led the company’s entry into Central and Eastern Europe, especially Russia and China. He  serves on many company boards,  including  Xerox Corporation, Motorola Inc., and the Boston Scientific Corporation.  John is deeply committed to his community.  In 1978, in response to an escalating public  high school dropout rate, he founded the Cincinnati Youth Collaborative, a non-profit organization  that assists graduating high school  students with mentoring and tutoring and employment. John is a member of the boards of  the Partnership for a Drug Free America and  the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.  I have been privileged  to work with  John on  the National Underground Railroad  Freedom Center, where he serves as co-chairman of  the development campaign and a  member of  its executive committee.

101,Senate,108,0.31,26,2004-03-22,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, it is my  distinct privilege to rise today to pay  special tribute to the one of the world’s  foremost  physiologists, Dr. Norman  Borlaug. Dr. Borlaug is widely credited  as the father of the 1960s Green Revolution, a movement that has continued  to cure hundreds of millions of people  around the globe from starvation. It is  very likely that Dr. Borlaug is directly  responsible for saving more lives than  anyone else in the twentieth century.  Born in Cresco, IA on March 25, 1914,  Dr. Borlaug was raised on  livestock  farm before attending the University of  Minnesota as a biology student and a  member of the University’s wrestling  team. After graduation, in addition to  being inducted to the University’s Hall  of Fame for his wrestling record, Dr.  Borlaug  carefully balanced  teaching  while successfully working on the development of several new strains of disease-resistant wheat. The new strand  of wheat went on to be widely utilized  in Mexico, Pakistan, and India and led  to dramatic increases in food production, in turn earning Dr. Borlaug the  Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. The Dallas  Morning News attests his lifelong dedication to physiology to growing up  among the food shortages of the Great  Depression: ‘‘The sight of farm failures,  sheriff’s  sales  and  hungry  children  would stay with him and influence his  choices for the rest of his life.’’ Dr.  Borlaug added in his own words, ‘‘I saw  all that unfold. And I think that had  something  to  do with  how  things  turned out.’’  Dr. Borlaug has certainly earned the  right  to  slow down after his many  years of hard work, but he continues,  even at age 90, to a be a leader in the  development  and  implementation  of  new technologies,  in effect, ensuring  the world’s most needy adequate food  supplies. He often travels to Asia and  Africa, Europe and Latin America to  help the public understand the value  and potential of new biotechnology,  while respecting and preserving the environment. In addition to his efforts  globally, Dr. Borlaug is helping farmers make a living by leading the fight  against wealthy and well-fed anti-technology protectionists in Europe.  Some would rest after a Nobel Peace  Prize and many others would certainly  take the opportunity to reward themselves and their family—deservedly—by  answering lucrative offers from the private sector. In a world where 800 million children are hungry and even more  live on less than one dollar a day, Dr.  Borlaug has never  stopped  fighting,  teaching,  inventing, or caring.  It  is  clear that Dr. Borlaug is inspired by  the rewards his efforts yield for others.  Missouri’s renowned plant scientist,  George Washington Carver words are  appropriate when used to describe Dr.  Borlaug: ‘‘No individual has any right  to come into the world and go out of it  without  leaving behind him distinct  and  legitimate  reasons  for  having  passed through it.’’ So very few of a  talented world, billions strong, have  met this test to the extent that Dr.  Borlaug has. He has selflessly and tirelessly developed his gifts from God on  behalf of millions and billions of desperate people he does not know, and  who will never know whom to thank.  I also thank Mrs. Borlaug and the  rest of the Borlaug family, on the behalf of the people of the State of Missouri, America, and  throughout  the  world, for sharing Norman’s attention  for all these years.  Dr. Borlaug will soon gain status as  the world’s youngest 90 year old.  I  speak for all in thanking him for his  lifelong dedication to agriculture and I  sincerely wish him a happy birthday.  The world owes Dr. Borlaug endless  amounts of gratitude and we will look  forward  to  celebrating his  achievements again on his 100th birthday.∑  f  NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK  ∑",2004

A community activist  in El Sereno, California, Marina Martinez promoted parental involvement and advocated for parental rights to  ensure that every child receives a quality education. She began her lifelong commitment to  children by volunteering both as a Girl Scout  leader and Boy Scout den mother  in 1959.  Since that time, Marina chaired numerous organizations and provided leadership to many  local, State, and Federal organizations. These  organizations and positions included the Compensatory Education Advisory in 1972 and the  Bilingual Teacher Training Center  in 1976.  Most notably, she was appointed by the dean  of the School of Education to serve as a member of the Advisory Committee of the Bilingual  Teacher Training Center.  Marina Martinez also served as the council  appointee to the Citizens Unit for Participation  in Housing and Community Development  in  1978 and was a proud member of other longstanding community-based organizations in El  Sereno.  These  organizations  included  the  Mexican-American  Education  Commission,  National Clients Council  for  the Legal Aid  Foundation, the Community Alliance for Education, and the El Sereno Community Coordinating Council.  Even with the tragic death of her son Ismael  Martinez on December 7, 1980, Marina and  her husband, Joe, did not move away  from  their El Sereno community. On the contrary,  they turned their pain into strength and vowed  to help other families with similar tragedies by  establishing the Victims of Crime in El Sereno  (VOCES). Several years ago, Marina’s beloved husband, Joe, passed away.  Marina was a loving and caring community  leader. Every Christmas, she made sure that  victims of senseless violence would not be forgotten. Her message was shared throughout  the community every December by organizing  tree lighting ceremonies in Huntington Drive,  with each tree decorated with red ribbons honoring the deceased victims.  I have known and supported Marina since  my  years as a California State Assembly  member. She leaves behind three grown children and a beautiful community she helped  build. She will always be remembered for her  stewardship and hard work  to  improve her  community and the citizens who lived in it. We  will miss her greatly, and may she  rest  in  peace. HON. ROGER F.

104,,108,-0.517,117,2004-03-22,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. Speaker,  I am saddened by the degree to which the Republican  Leadership has  turned  this resolution  into a  partisan political defense of President Bush’s  view of  the war  in  Iraq.  Instead of commending and thanking the men and women in  our Armed Forces who are serving so bravely  in Iraq, a resolution that would have probably  been passed unanimously, this resolution rewrites history and justifies a war that need not  have been fought. Yes. Saddam was a terrible  dictator, but getting rid of him was not the reason why President Bush told us we had to go  to war. The American people were told that  we had to invade Iraq because Saddam had  weapons of mass destruction  that could be  used against us, something which turned out  not  to be  true.  It  is particularly outrageous  that,  in order  to spin  the war  in as positive  light as possible, this resolution does not say  one word about our gratitude to the over 560  families who have lost a loved one in Iraq— including six Vermont  families—or  the over  2,800 soldiers who have been injured. What  must these families be thinking when the sacrifice of  their  loved ones are not even acknowledged  in  this  resolution?  If Congressional Republicans really want to say thanks  to the troops they should adequately fund veterans’ benefits, increase military pay and provide  the money  to buy  the body armor and  other equipment our  troops need. But using  the sacrifice of our troops for partisan political  advantage is something that I cannot support. f RELATING TO THE LIBERATION OF  THE  IRAQI  PEOPLE  AND  THE  VALIANT  SERVICE  OF  THE  UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES  AND COALITION FORCES  SPEECHOF  HON.

It is that commitment  that creates a strong presumption in my own  mind on any resolution that recognizes their  honorable goals, their services to country and  their need for best support possible.  Along with my Democratic colleagues, we  would also rush to sponsor and support a resolution that highlighted the crimes of Saddam  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

106,House,108,-0.362,3,2004-03-31,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution (H. Res.  590) and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  H. RES. 590  Resolved, That the following named Member be and is hereby elected to the following  standing committees of the House of Representatives:  (1) COMMITTEEONAGRICULTURE: Mr. Chandler (to rank immediately after Mr. Marshall).  (2) COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: Mr. Chandler.  The resolution was agreed to.

",2004
107,House,108,-0.372,3,2004-03-31,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, before  the House voted on the Medicare bill,  the public was told it would cost $400  billion. Later, we found out that the  administration knew all along it would  cost $550 billion.  Congress was misled by an administration that hid the numbers from the  public and Members of Congress because of the perceived political benefits  of the new law, saying that the end  would justify the means.  But according  to  today’s Chicago  Tribune,  ‘‘Instead of a political bonanza, the Medicare drug benefit is fast  becoming an albatross around the administration’s neck. Not a single new  benefit has gone to a senior citizen,  and the taxpayers got stuck with another $150 billion bill.  Now  the administration wants  to  talk about the benefit that comes with  a discount card. With the way prescription drug costs have skyrocketed over  the past several years, this discount  card will not accomplish anything. It is  like a sale at Nieman Marcus. They  jack up the prices right before the sale.  In 2001, drug costs increased by 16.9  percent; in 2002, 18.4 percent; in 2003, a  projected 19.5 percent, and going on to  another 15 percent.  Instead of depending on a  flawed  Medicare bill, we must literally drive  prices down by allowing reimportation,  allowing us to get our drugs in Canada  and in Europe where prices are cheaper.  f  MANUFACTURING JOBS  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
108,House,108,0.371,3,2004-03-31,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to bring attention to the current  status of manufacturing jobs in this  country.  Last week, there was an article in  the Boston Globe entitled, ‘‘What the  Jobless Statistics Do Not Reveal,’’  written by Paul E. Harrington and Andrew Sum. The article focused on the  debate of when job creation will begin  and why there is a huge difference in  the report of job growth between two  surveys, the payroll survey and the  household survey.  The payroll survey is the corporate  survey, which  indicates a decreased  loss of 620,000 jobs. However, the household survey says there is a 2.3 million  increase  in employment during  this  same period of  time. Why  the disparity?  Well, the household survey counts  self-employed and contractors. If you  are self-employed like a farmer in my  district, you are not counted as being  an employee under the payroll survey  reports. The authors point out that the  disparity is due to the fact that it has  become so expensive to add new workers  to payroll due  to high cost of  health insurance, unemployment insurance, worker  compensation,  payroll  taxes, and it is easier and cheaper to  hire and pay overtime.  If we want to stem the loss of manufacturing in the corporate sector, our  legislative response  is clear. We are  going to have to address these issues of  high cost.  f  b1015  REAUTHORIZATION OF THE  SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2004
109,House,108,-0.428,3,2004-03-31,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  this House over the next 2 days is going  to be debating the single most important environmental and jobs bill of the  session, the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Act. It is unfortunate that we are not going to have the  opportunity to deal with a bill that is  right-sized for America’s needs.  The  administration’s  own Department of Transportation has concluded  that we need $375 billion to meet America’s needs over the next 6 years; yet  the administration has threatened to  use its first veto of any bill if we have  the temerity to approve anything over  $256 billion, which will be a 10 percent  cut in transportation funding over the  next 6 years.  Nobody in this Chamber feels that we  should be cutting our investment in  the future. It is time for Members on  both sides of the aisle to support the  bipartisan committee leadership to at  least approve the $275 billion bill, keep  the basic structure in place, and make  sure that we are giving America the  transportation infrastructure it needs  for the future.  MEDICARE DISCOUNT DRUG CARDS  (Mr. CHOCOLA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2004
110,House,108,0.573,3,2004-03-31,Mr. CHOCOLA.," Mr. Speaker, during  the next  3 months, Medicare beneficiaries will begin to see real savings  on the cost of their prescription drugs  with the help of voluntary Medicare-  approved discount drug cards.  Starting  in April, Medicare beneficiaries will be notified by mail of  their discount card eligibility, discount  card offerings, and enrollment procedures. By June, all Medicare beneficiaries,  except  those who  already  have Medicaid drug coverage, will be  able to buy a card for about $30 and  take it to their local pharmacy and receive 10 to 25 percent off of the regular  cost of their drugs.  People with incomes below 135 percent of poverty who sign up for the  card will be eligible for an additional  $600 of additional assistance per year to  help further reduce the cost of their  prescription drugs in 2004 and 2005. This  low-income assistance will benefit over  12,000 Indiana Hoosiers in my district,  the second district of Indiana, and almost 200,000 Hoosiers statewide.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues  who voted to support the bipartisan  Medicare bill and the creation of a discount drug card program that will reduce the cost of prescriptions for our  seniors and provide additional relief to  low-income Medicare beneficiaries.  f  HONORING CESAR CHAVEZ’S  BIRTHDAY  (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2004
111,House,108,-0.401,3,2004-03-31,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Speaker, today  on his birthday, we recognize the courageous leadership of Cesar Chavez, a  man who  inspired hope, pride, and  strength and provided a voice for thousands of farm workers across California  and the entire country.  My district encompasses San Jose,  home to Cesar Chavez for many years.  It is in San Jose that Chavez began to  fulfill his dream of empowering farm  workers to demand basic human rights  and protections  from  the abuses of  farm owners.  Chavez experienced employer abuses  firsthand and saw it happen to thousands of farm workers from childhood  through his adult years. And it was he  who courageously organized his fellow  workers to believe in their own dignity  and power to gain equal rights, fair  pay, and decent working conditions.  So on this day, I honor the memory  of Cesar Chavez.  I congratulate his  wonderful family who still lives in San  Jose. We all know that he is the symbol of inspiration to many, especially  the children. May the legacy of this  great leader, Cesar Chavez, live on; and  may we always remember his phrase to  all of us, ‘‘Si se puede.’’  VerDate mar 24 2004  00:20 Apr 01, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31MR7.004 H31PT1 ",2004
112,House,108,0.492,10,2004-03-31,Mr. ISTOOK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this resolution. Certainly everybody always wants to be better paid. I do not  know anybody that is an exception to  that particular rule. So there is always  tension between what people would  like to be paid and what an employer  can afford to be able to pay. The employer in this case is the taxpayers of  the United States of America.  This is not necessary to give what  this resolution proposes, that would be  supersized raises, jumbo COLAs, to the  Federal workforce. We have been very  generous with the Federal workforce.  In the last 7 years, for every $1 increase  in the cost of living index, or for that  matter  in the cost of  living adjustments to Social Security, for every $1  that the cost of living has gone up,  Federal workers have gotten a raise of  $1.66. They have gotten  raises  two-  thirds higher than the actual inflation  rate. In fact, in the past 4 years, Federal workers have gotten  raises at  twice the rate of inflation.  The President’s budget proposes that  the across-the-board raise for the Federal civil service should be 1.5 percent,  consistent with the actual cost-of-living adjustment. This resolution, however, says that they should get 3.5 percent.  Why? Well, they say it is because we  are going to give the military a larger  raise and therefore we have to give the  Federal civil service a larger raise, too.  I do not think that is accurate. People  that work at civil service jobs are not  taking the same risks on behalf of  their country as people that are working in our Armed Forces. We do not  have  the  retention problems  in  the  civil service sector as we do  in the  Armed Forces.  There is a letter that has been submitted by the administration, by the  Office of Management and Budget, opposing this resolution and points out  that we are almost at a record low on  the turnover in the Federal civil service. About 1.5 percent a year, that is  the whole turnover of people in Federal  civil service jobs.  This is not a matter of retaining people. This is a matter of giving extra  raises to people that, frankly, the taxpayers do not have the money to afford. This would cost us $2.2 billion this  year and a similar amount next year  and the year after and in perpetuity to  give these extra  large raises rather  than holding the line as we should.  For State workers, the average pay  raises in the last 4 years have been  only about a third of what the pay  raises have been for the Federal workers. The private sector is significantly  behind what we have already done for  Federal workers. This is not the time  when we have record deficits to be giving more than a cost-of-living adjustment to the Federal civil service.  Mr. Speaker, we have been overly  generous. It  is not needed to retain  people; and, frankly, the taxpayers are  the ones that are being asked to foot  this multi-billion dollars of expenses.  This is the taxpayers’ money. We are  being fair. We should stay that way.  The supposed pay gap, people say  Federal workers are 32 percent underpaid. Actually, that particular survey  does not calculate all the factors. It  does not calculate the locality pay that  boosts Federal civil service workers,  VerDate mar 24 2004  00:20 Apr 01, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31MR7.039 H31PT1 ",2004
113,House,108,-0.454,17,2004-03-31,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of  H. Res. 581, which urges this administration to  provide pay parity to civilian government workers and uniformed government workers.  I was greatly disappointed at the President’s  meager pay raise for Federal workers and feel  it should be closer in line to the raise our uniformed service members received. I represent  the Rock Island Arsenal, which employs about  6,000 civilian Department of Defense workers.  Many of  these employees are directly supporting our uniformed personnel in the war on  terror. This includes many working around the  clock to produce an urgent order of armored  kits for our Humvees and trucks being sent to  Iraq. Hundreds of other workers are either deployed or recently deployed  from service  in  the Middle East to support our service members. Yet, unlike their uniformed counterparts,  they only received modest pay increases.  Not only are Defense Department civilian  workers serving in the war on terror, but Federal fire fighters, police, marshals, and armed  agents of the FBI, DEA, ATF, Amtrak, Postal  Service, and numerous other agents.  This administration wants to outsource our  Federal employees, rewrite  their  labor rules,  and ask them to do more with less. And then  they hit them in their pocket book. We need to  support our Federal workers and this resolution sends a strong message.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and  let  the President know our Federal workers  deserve his respect.

117,Senate,108,0.52,52,2004-03-31,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, for the  information of our colleagues, I believe  we are going to have debate that will  last about an hour and a half. My colleague from North Dakota will be in  control of an hour and myself or Senator GREGGwill be in control of 30 minutes. At the conclusion of that debate  time, we expect to appoint conferees.  The House has already appointed conferees. They appointed conferees on  Monday. We expect to appoint conferees at the conclusion of our debate  time. And for the information of our  colleagues,  and  especially  the  conferees—hopefully they have been notified—we will have a conference this  afternoon beginning at 2:30. We will go  as  long  as  necessary  to  hear  everybody’s viewpoints on both  the  House and Senate budget proposals and  any  constructive  suggestions  they  might have to improve them. I look  forward to that discussion.  I would love to see us come out of  conference with a bipartisan budget.  That usually has not happened in the  recent past, but I would love for it to  happen in this case.  Again, we look forward to going to  conference  and  resolving  the  differences between the House and the  Senate. There are not a  lot of differences. The numbers are pretty close  on the outlay side, and the numbers  are pretty close on the revenue side.  There are some differences, and we will  have to work those out. There are some  differences in enforcement provisions.  We will work those out. That is what  conferences are  for. They are compromises between the House and the  Senate.  I compliment our colleagues in the  House for passing a budget. We actually passed a budget the week before  last. I thank all of our colleagues. We  actually ended up passing the budget  after 4 days. The last day was a fairly  long day. It lasted into Friday morning, about 1:30 in the morning. We did  it with 25 votes. That was half the  number of votes we had the previous  year. The previous year we had  51  votes. Those votes dealt with a lot of  different issues. Hundreds of billions of  dollars in new taxes were proposed, and  hundreds of billions of dollars in new  spending were proposed, most of which  were  defeated. We  accepted  some  amendments, and we will work through  those amendments.  We have other issues, I will tell my  colleague, and he is well aware of it.  My colleague  from North Dakota  is  very familiar with the budget. There is  a reserve fund, and there are a lot of  different issues. The House has some,  and we have some. We have to work  those out. That is what budgets are for.  The House intends to pass this bill  this week. That means we have to do a  lot of work. Some work has already  happened behind the scenes. Chairman  NUSSLEand I have been trying to resolve issues and lay the groundwork,  but a lot of major decisions have yet to  be made. Again,  that  is what conferences are for.  So I look forward to working with all  of our colleagues in the Senate, especially the conferees, to come up with a  budget  resolution  that will  significantly reduce the deficit. I say significantly reduce the deficit, the budget  we passed in the Senate would reduce  the deficit, which is far too high, by  half in 3 years.  I hope we can meet that goal coming  out of the conference committee. That  is not easy. It is not easy in any way,  shape, or form. So I want to make sure  everyone is aware of that.  Again,  I thank our colleagues  for  their  cooperation.  I  thank my  colleague from North Dakota for his cooperation today because we will get  conferees appointed, we will go to conference, and, frankly, we will meet as  long as necessary to get this job done.  That certainly is our intention.  I had hoped that possibly the Senate  could pass the budget resolution on  Friday.  I believe  it  is the majority  leader’s  intention,  if  the conference  agreement is reached and the House  passes it this week, that we would take  it up on the Senate floor next Thursday. That is certainly acceptable with  this Senator, and I will be happy to  work with all of our colleagues  to  make that happen.  For  the  information  of  our  colleagues, once a conference agreement  is reached, the rules of the Senate provide for 10 hours of debate and a vote  on the budget resolution. Unless things  change, I expect that would be sometime next Thursday.  I yield the floor.  ",2004
118,Senate,108,0.342,66,2004-03-31,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Madam President,  we are hopefully at a position today  where there is going to be some decision made by leadership—meaning the  Democrat leader and Republican leader—on proceeding on this legislation.  In the meantime, we will proceed with  amendments and hopefully move along  as best we can without having a certain finality.  I had a chance to listen to my colleagues’ statements. I will make this  commentary. We have already said to  the minority, the Democratic leadership, that we are prepared to vote on  amendments that are before the Senate. So  the  issue  is not voting on  amendments before the Senate. There  is some feeling that we are going to get  this bill to finality. That doesn’t mean  not voting on a lot of amendments.  That can be worked in as well. All we  want  is some certainty that we are  going to get to finality. Finality means  getting to conference.  We have a couple pieces of legislation  that have been  sitting around  this  body, after the body has finished work  on them, not being able to go to conference. One is the CARE Act, an acronym  for  legislation  that encourages  charitable giving. Another one is the  Workforce Investment Act. These are  two pieces of legislation that have been  before the Senate, and the minority,  the Democrats, will not let us go to  conference on these pieces of legislation.  So, in a sense, the Senate has worked  its will, but the legislative process has  been shut down. It seems to me if this  legislation includes so much of what  the Democrats want to accomplish in  the way of reform of welfare—particularly the vote we had yesterday, very  dramatically increasing by $6 billion  the amount to be spent on childcare—  that they would want this legislation  to become law. So we need some assurance from the other side that if we  agree to voting on some amendments  that they want to vote on—that is no  longer  an  issue—we want  to move  ahead with germane amendments.  There is not an argument about the  number at this point. We can get to a  vote on this, but most important is not  have it stalled in the Senate as those  other  two  pieces  of  legislation.  It  seems to me the issue isn’t a whole lot  different now than it was 2 years ago.  The only difference is the Republicans  were  in the minority, then and the  Democrats were  in the majority. At  that particular time, we saw an Energy  bill taken away from the Energy Committee and brought to the floor. That  bill never became law. We saw a prescription drug bill taken over by the  leadership on the floor of the Senate,  with the committee effectively cut out.  There were 2 weeks of debate on an Energy bill but nothing happened. There  was not a budget adopted that year.  We Republicans referred to the leadership at that time as having a graveyard in the Senate because they wanted issues for that election as opposed  to products. We Republicans said to the  electorate at that time that we want  products, not issues. So when we took  over in the majority in 2003, the committee system was allowed to work, developing bipartisanship. Nothing gets  done in the Senate without bipartisanship. We could bring the issues to the  floor and work the will of the Senate  and get things through the Senate.  That is what we are elected to do—get  things through the Senate and let the  process work.  So there  is nothing that my colleague from Montana said that I disagree with, except we ought to see  light at the end of the tunnel. Is there  anything wrong with saying: Are you  guys—meaning  the Democrats—going  to do what you did on the Workforce  Investment Act and the CARE Act and  let  the Senate become a graveyard  again just because something is happening that you don’t like?  It seems to me there would be a lesson  learned  from  the  last election.  When the Senate became a graveyard,  the people of this country sent a message that they don’t want the Senate  to be a graveyard. They gave the majority to the Republicans. We show  that we can produce. Yet look what we  are running into—the CARE Act, after  a year of not going to conference. I  don’t know how long the Workforce Investment Act has been waiting to go to  conference. We were stalled last week  on a bill the Democrats agreed ought  to become law, the FSC/ETI bill. That  stalled.  I would not say the Welfare Act is  stalled. But what do we know is down  the road? What is wrong with a little  bit of transparency. The transparency  is that they present an amendment on  minimum wage and they want a vote.  So we present a plan to get to a vote on  that very important issue, but we cannot get some assurance that we may  not be in the same boat as with the  CARE Act and the Workforce Investment Act.  When it comes to the minimum wage  being important for welfare, I suggest  to the other leaders that, as chairman  of the committee, in a letter I received  from  them  last year, which  is not  dated—I received this letter, and it was  signed by 41 Democrats—telling us the  things they wanted in this legislation  that the Finance Committee was going  to be working on at that particular  time. They were setting out priorities  they believed we had not adequately  dealt with. In this letter, there was  never any mention of minimum wage  being an important part of welfare reform legislation.  I did take what they said in this letter very seriously, and they dealt with  issues such as universal engagement,  ending the caseload reduction credit,  strengthening child support, extending  TMA, providing additional State flexibility,  issues  dealing with  postsecondary education, no superwaiver, no  increase in work without State flexibility. Of all of those provisions they  raised concern about, none dealt with  minimum wage.  I and the majority  tried  to accommodate  the minority  members who signed this letter and put  these things in this legislation. These  provisions are all in this bill.  Other priorities, as  stated by  the  Democrats,  included some additional  funding for childcare, and we passed  that  overwhelmingly  yesterday.  It  wasn’t something I could get done in  committee. I, obviously, agreed with  that approach because I voted for it  yesterday.  We also had a  request  from  the  Democrats in this letter to increase vocational education eligibility for legal  immigrants. We have not dealt with  that, but that is going to be an amendment before the Senate.  What we have tried to do  in this  whole process of Republicans gaining  control of the Senate and letting the  committee system work, as opposed to  2002 when very major legislation, such  as prescription drugs and the Energy  bill, was taken away from the committees and brought to the floor—we do  not develop bipartisanship on the floor,  and they never became law—we have  tried to make the committee system  work. When specific requests are made,  such as 41 Democrats sending us a letter raising concerns about their issues,  we try to put them in the legislation  and accommodate  them  so  that we  have a product instead of an issue.  The other side ought to tell us if we  are going down the same road we went  down in 2002 to have the Senate become  a graveyard for important legislation  because they need  issues  instead of  product. Did they learn a lesson from  the last election? Do they want to lose  more seats in the Senate? I don’t think  they do. But I think they have to get a  better game plan than shutting down  the Senate because we are in the majority to make this place work.  I know there are a lot of Democrats  who are intent upon making this place  work, and I know Senator BAUCUS, my  ranking Democrat,  is committed  to  making this place work. There should  not be any reason we have to have a  cloture  vote,  particularly when we  made overtures to the other side to  vote on a lot of important issues on  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:29 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S31MR4.REC S31MR4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

Joining the United States Capitol Police  on February 12th, 1979, Sergeant Reynolds  served our  country honorably  for over 25  years. During  these 25 years of dedicated  service, her duties entailed a variety of assignments, which included the United States Capitol Police’s Senate Division, Communications  Division, Capitol Division and Criminal Investigations  Division.  Additionally,  Sergeant  Lavern Johnson-Reynolds served as an  instructor in the Training Academy for 10 years.  She earned her promotion to Sergeant in December of 1995.  On a personal note, Laverne married Dr.  Gary Reynolds and gave birth to their daughter Destiny Johnson-Reynolds during her tenure on the force.  Mr. Speaker, as  family,  friends and colleagues gather to celebrate Sergeant Lavern  Johnson-Reynolds’ many accomplishments, it  is with great admiration and pride that I ask  my colleagues to join me today in saluting this  exceptional officer whose dedicated service  will be sorely missed. She served our country  proudly with the United States Capitol Police  for over 25 years, training future officers, and  protecting  this  institution, Members of Congress, and staff.

121,Senate,108,0.289,19,2004-04-19,Mr. DEWINE.," Madam President, yesterday was Yom HaShoah, Holocaust  Remembrance Day. Holocaust Remembrance Day is the day that has been set  aside for remembering the victims of  the Holocaust and for contemplating  what can happen to civilized people  when bigotry, hatred, and indifference  reign.  Between 1938 and 1945, the Nazis murdered over 11 million people throughout Europe, 6 million of them Jewish.  On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we  remember those who gave their lives  because of  their heritage,  tradition,  and beliefs. While the Jews of Europe  were defenseless against the Nazi regime, many held on to their faith up  until the last moments of their lives.  Every year, on the Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember those who  sanctified the name of God in the death  camps, the ghettos, and elsewhere.  Holocaust Remembrance Day occurs  on the 27th day of the Jewish calendar’s month of Nissan. This year,  that was yesterday. When it falls on a  weekend, it is commemorated on the  following Monday. The date also marks  the anniversary of the heroic Warsaw  Ghetto uprising of 1943, which occurred  61 years ago to the day—April 19, 1943.  The Holocaust is not merely a story  of destruction and loss. It is a remarkable story of the human spirit—of the  life that  flourished before the Holocaust,  struggled  during  its  darkest  hours, and ultimately prevailed as the  survivors and their progeny struggled  to rebuild. Indeed, Holocaust Remembrance Day occurs just eight days before Israel’s Independence Day. Today,  in Israel, a morning siren sounds, stopping all activity—and people stand in  honor of those who died. Indeed, people  of all faiths around the world hold memorials and vigils, often lighting candles in honor of the Holocaust victims.  Many hold name-reading ceremonies to  memorialize those who perished.  It has been over 50 years since the  last concentration camp was liberated  and many of the Holocaust survivors  are now succumbing to natural causes.  It is our obligation to share their stories to ensure that this horrible tragedy never repeats itself. We must honor  the lives of those who lived on and  those who did not survive the Nazis and  their murderous cohorts.  There are literally hundreds of excellent movies and documentaries on the  events before, during, and after the  Holocaust. They cover every possible  topic from deepest tragedies to the pinnacle of one of the greatest forces of  all—the human spirit. These films vary  from Hollywood to amateur documentaries, and include the Shoah Foundation’s valiant efforts to record living  survivors. All should bear witness, so  that this kind of inhumanity will never  happen again. I also recommend visiting the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum here  in Washington.  It  is  a  unique treasure that serves as a soulful  reminder of the events of World War II.  Finally, seek out those with personal  or family knowledge of this enormous  tragedy. Nothing can replace the power  of the first person accounts from a survivor, child of a survivor, liberator of  the camps, or member of the resistance. Their stories teach us all.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  RECOGNITION  OF  CALIFORNIA  PHYSICIAN PHILIP C. HOPEWELL,  M.D.  ∑",2004
122,Senate,108,-0.266,19,2004-04-19,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Madam President,  I  rise  today  to  recognize Philip C.  Hopewell, M.D., of San Francisco, CA.  A pioneer in pulmonary medicine, Dr.  Hopewell is being awarded the Edward  Livingston Trudeau Medal in recognition of his lifelong contributions to the  prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of  lung disease. Dr. Hopewell has dedicated over  30 years  researching national and  international tuberculosis  control.  Dr. Hopewell’s commitment to pulmonary disease serves as an example  for all working to preserve the health  of this Nation and the world. From the  early 1970s, Dr. Hopewell has been concerned with those living with tuberculosis. Dr. Hopewell began his career  as a consultant in tuberculosis control  to the Nigerian government in the war-  affected  areas  of  eastern  Nigeria.  Later, his interest in tuberculosis control in developing countries was fostered by his work in the Pan-American  Health Organization  in 1980–1981 and  with the Stop TB Partnership, based at  the World Health Organization in Geneva in 2003.  Not only has Dr. Hopewell helped  countless tuberculosis patients around  the globe, he has been instrumental in  addressing the problem here at home.  Dr. Hopewell has been on the faculty at  UCSF, based at San Francisco General,  since 1973, where he served as chief of  the Division of Pulmonary and Critical  Care Medicine from 1989 to 1998 and Associate Dean 1998 to 2004. Today, Dr.  Hopewell continues to practice clinical  pulmonary and critical care medicine  at San Francisco General Hospital,  serving as an attending physician on  the  pulmonary  consultation  service  and in the medical intensive care unit.  In addition to his clinical work, Dr.  Hopewell spends a great deal of his  time as a researcher. Dr. Hopewell’s research has enabled more specific targeting of control interventions and has  helped contribute to a nearly 60 percent reduction in the number of new  cases of tuberculosis in San Francisco  in the past decade. In 1981, Dr Hopewell  became involved in the San Francisco  tuberculosis control program through  the Department of Public Health. From  this association, the Frances J. Curry  National Tuberculosis Center, directed  by Dr. Hopewell was formed. The Curry  Center  is one of  three CDC-funded  model centers in the country and provides  important  opportunities  for  training and research in many aspects  of tuberculosis and tuberculosis control.  Today, I acknowledge Dr. Hopewell  for his lifelong accomplishments in tuberculosis  research and  tuberculosis  control. I also acknowledge Dr. Hopewell’s numerous leadership positions in  pulmonary medicine.

123,Senate,108,0.423,26,2004-04-19,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Madam President,  as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following  treaty transmitted to the Senate on  April 19, 2004, by the President of the  United States: Extradition Treaty with  Great Britain and Northern  Ireland,  Treaty Document No. 108–23. I further  ask consent that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time;  that it be referred, with accompanying  papers, to the Committee on Foreign  Relations and ordered to be printed;  and that the President’s message be  printed in the RECORD.  ",2004
124,,108,0.258,1,2004-04-29,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Speaker, the Iraq  Oil-for-Food Program was established  in 1996 to ensure adequate food, medicine, and supplies were available for  the Iraqi people despite U.N.-imposed  sanctions. It was meant to keep food  on  the  table of  the oppressed, not  money in the hands of the oppressors.  We are now finding out the program  was filled with corruption and the Iraqi  people were not  in  fact  the  beneficiaries.  The very leader that kept them in  utter poverty was using the program to  line his own pockets and enrich his  friends. This corruption was made possible by U.N.-member countries and  senior U.N. officials.  Saddam Hussein  stole  $10  billion;  and, in exchange for their help, several  members of the U.N. Security Council  secretly received billions of barrels of  Iraqi crude at cut-rate prices. These  nations publicly supported the goals of  the Oil-for-Food Program while privately undermining it.  For the United Nations to allow this  to go on for 7 years is unconscionable.  The U.N. was responsible for overseeing  a program designed to provide aid to  Iraqi  citizens; and,  instead, on  the  U.N.’s watch, the program strengthened the Hussein regime.  Now some are calling for increased  reliance on the United Nations to determine our foreign policy? I do not  think so.  f  U.S. FARM PROGRAMS  (Mr.  STENHOLM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2004
125,,108,0.019,1,2004-04-29,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Speaker, this  week a ruling by a committee of the  WTO seems to have been interpreted by  too many in the press that this was the  end of farm programs in the United  States. Furthest from the truth.  Let me encourage everyone to be patient until the 400-something-page report  is  read and deciphered by  the  House Committee on Agriculture and  the Department of Agriculture, and  then let us see exactly what they have  said. Do not panic.  And let me remind everyone in the  United States that we are truly blessed  to live in a country that has the most  abundant food supply, the best quality  of food, the safest food supply, at the  lowest cost to our people of any other  country in the world. And to those who  are critical of our farm programs that  feed the American people in this way,  take a good hard look and realize when  you sit down at the dinner table tonight  it  is because of the American  farmer and rancher.  f  APPOINTMENT  OF  HON.

129,Senate,108,0.381,22,2004-04-29,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, I urge  my colleagues to vote against cloture  on the Domenici amendment. It has  really no business on an Internet tax  bill. We all know that. I read again  from  the Washington Post  of  this  morning:  It would make far more sense for Senators  who are interested in some aspect of this legislation, whether ethanol or electricity regulation or renewable  fuels, to design bills  around those issues and vote on them separately, judging each by its own merits. But  that would be too rational for this Senate  which seems almost to prefer doing things  sideways.  There is no need for this legislation  on the bill. It has no place on it. I can  assure my  colleagues  it would  be  dropped in conference if it were adopted.  ",2004
130,Senate,108,-0.277,22,2004-04-29,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, as  the ranking member of the Senate Environment  and Public Works Committee, I want to express my serious  concern with the content of the amendment  offered  by Senator DOMENICI.  This amendment differs even from the  surprise energy bill that was  introduced on February 12, 2004, and placed  directly on the Senate’s calendar.  Senators should make no mistake,  this legislation is not the product of bipartisan consensus in the Senate committees of  jurisdiction.  In most  respects, this amendment is the energy  bill conference report we have already  defeated. And most importantly, it is  not the right energy policy for America.  I agree with Senator DASCHLE that  we should try to reach consensus on  targeted pieces of energy legislation.  We could pass  legislation on  issues  such as renewable motor fuels, as Senator DASCHLE has proposed with his  amendment. We could enact fiscally responsible extensions of needed energy  tax provisions, such as the wind energy  tax credit. National electricity reliability standards are another area in  which Senator CANTWELLand I believe  there could be agreement and we could  pass a bill.  But there should be no agreement on  the poor environment policy that  is  contained in this amendment. The Senate should reject this amendment, and  oppose cloture.  As with the energy bill conference report, nearly a hundred sections of this  amendment are in the jurisdiction of  the Environment and Public Works  Committee. We were not consulted on  any of these provisions, and I have repeatedly raised concerns about them  on the Senate floor.  This amendment does not represent  the kind of forward-looking balanced  energy policy that our Nation needs.  The Senate should be able to ensure  that  our  constituents have  reliable  electric power without polluting their  drinking water. Our constituents deserve cleaner gasoline without requiring  them  to breath dirtier air. We  should be able to promote renewable  energy without waiving environmental  laws.  This amendment seriously harms the  environment. The supporters have said  that a waiver of liability for MTBE  producers  is not  contained  in  this  amendment. That does not make the  motor fuels provisions good or workable public policy. Though we know  MTBE is environmentally harmful, the  amendment would allow this product  to be used for 10 more years before we  pull it off of the market. In addition,  the amendment allows the President to  overturn the MTBE ban prior to June  30, 2014, and continue its use indefinitely.  The amendment unravels the ozone  designation process in the Clean Air  Act by delaying compliance with the  national health-based air quality ozone  standards until the air in the dirtiest  city is cleaned up. Neither the Senate  nor the House of Representatives has  ever considered this damaging provision. It is a leftover from the failed energy bill conference report.  Changing  cities’ ozone  compliance  deadlines under  the Clean Air Act  doesn’t  increase our Nation’s energy  supplies. Exposing the public to continued  levels of harmful dangerous air  pollution emissions for far more time  than allowed under existing law guarantees thousands of more asthma attacks, more hospital visits and more  cases of respiratory distress, disease  and  illness. Recently,  the EPA announced that there are record numbers  of Americans, more than 165 million,  who are breathing unhealthy air.  The change is also unfair to States  that have worked hard to achieve compliance with  the  Clean Air Act’s  health-based national standards. Why  should areas that have done little or  nothing to reduce emissions be given a  free pass from halting local pollution?  This amendment also provides unprecedented relief for a single region of the  country from application of the entire  Clean Air Act, without a hearing in the  Environment and Public Works Committee or Senate consideration.  The amendment continues the administration’s drive to greater dependency on old technologies and fuel systems. This focus will increase greenhouse gas emissions and keep us on the  wrong path that  increases the risks  from  global warming  and  climate  change.  This amendment also continues to  include language from the failed energy bill that exempts oil and gas exploration  and  production  activities  from the Clean Water Act stormwater  program. The Clean Water Act requires  permits for stormwater discharges associated with  construction  activity.  The amendment changes the Act to  provide a special exemption for oil and  gas  construction  activities  from  stormwater pollution control requirements. The scope of the provision is extremely broad. Stormwater runoff typically contains pollutants such as oil  and grease, chemicals, nutrients, metals, bacteria, and particulates.  I have told colleagues this before but  EPA estimates that this change would  exempt at least 30,000 small oil and gas  sites from clean water requirements. In  addition, every construction site in the  oil and gas industry larger than 5 acres  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:29 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S29AP4.REC S29AP4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004
131,Senate,108,-0.318,36,2004-04-29,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, I share  the view of the chairman of the Commerce Committee and Senator DORGAN.  I think the end is now in sight. I see  the distinguished Senator  from Virginia on the floor right now, and I commend him for all the effort and the relentless pursuit of a cause that he and  I have shared for many years, going  back to when he was Governor and  when I was the original Senate sponsor.  We have held steadfast to the proposition that the Internet, this extraordinary national and global treasure,  should not be subject to multiple and  discriminatory taxes. I think the earlier Senate vote indicates that a majority of the Senate is prepared to support policies which will ensure that the  Internet is healthy and vibrant for the  future.  I see the chairman of the Commerce  Committee on the  floor. People  felt  strongly about the question of telephone  calls over  the  Internet. The  chairman of the Commerce Committee  came, had a very constructive definition which made clear or clearer what  Senator ALLEN and  I have  felt all  along, and that is that there should not  be a change in the status quo. That is  very constructive.  My guess is that the big challenge  over the course of the afternoon will be  on the issue of definitions. Certainly  there are definitions with respect to  how what is called the backbone of the  system, the architecture, is handled.  Depending on how it is written, that  definition could provide for taxes on  BlackBerrys and e-mails and the kind  of thing that the Senator from Virginia  and I have opposed strongly. We will  have to oppose that once again, but I  want to make it clear, as I did earlier  in the afternoon, that we are anxious  to deal with the remaining issues in a  collegial fashion with the Senator from  Tennessee. The Senator  from Tennessee has made it clear he wants to  move this bill along.  I join my colleagues in saying that  after 8 years of being at this, literally  since the time I came to the Senate  early in 1996, I suspect in a few hours  the Senate will have acted once more  in a bipartisan fashion.  I want to wrap up by commending  the Senator from Virginia. He has been  willing to compromise with respect to  issues but he has never compromised  on principle, and I appreciate that.  I yield the floor.  ",2004

The Senate will reconvene on Monday. At that time we  will resume consideration of the JOBS  bill, the FSC/ETI bill.

135,Senate,108,0.146,64,2004-04-29,Mr. MILLER.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor the Commanding General, United States Army Forces Command, General Larry R. Ellis. General  Ellis has served as the Commanding  General of U.S. Army Forces Command  from November 19, 2001, to May 7, 2004.  General Ellis, an outstanding American Soldier from the great State of  Maryland, will soon complete over 35  years of selfless service to this great  Nation  in  the United States Army.  General Ellis’ dedication to our Soldiers, commitment to excellence, and  performance of duty has been extraordinary throughout his career, a lifetime of service culminating in an assignment as the Commanding General  of the largest major command in the  United States Army. He will retire on  July 1, 2004.  During more than 35 years in uniform, General Ellis served in a succession of command and staff positions  worldwide. As  a  junior  officer,  he  served in combat in the Republic of  Vietnam, and subsequently with troop  units in positions of increasing responsibility  throughout  the  continental  United States, Europe, and the Republic of Korea.  While the Deputy Director for Strategic Planning and Policy at U.S. Pacific Command, and as the Assistant  Chief of Staff, J3, for United States  Forces Korea, General Ellis supervised  the training and performance of American military  forces  throughout  the  Far East.  He commanded units at every echelon of the Army, including the First  Armored Division  in Germany  and  when deployed as the Multinational Division  (North),  in  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina, a combined  task  force  that included units from 13 nations. In  this capacity General Ellis coordinated  European military and civil efforts to  implement an extensive array of operations and programs to provide stability and restore favorable economic  and political conditions in that war-  torn region.  As the Army’s Deputy Chief of Staff  for Operations, General Ellis oversaw  multi-year, multi-billion  dollar  programs supporting United States Army  budget strategic objectives, and executed  annual  operating  budgets  of  more than $15 billion across 16 major  subordinate organizations. He directed  the  development  of  comprehensive  strategic plans supporting the Army’s  continued success across the next three  decades by resourcing plans through  decisive application of deliberate management  systems,  strategic planning  processes, environmental assessments,  and periodic situational appraisals to  ensure full integration and compliance  with strictly defined performance objectives. He spearheaded the Army’s effort to translate the senior leadership’s  Strategic Vision  into an executable  Transformation Campaign Plan.  Soon after the United States went to  war in 2001, General Ellis assumed command of U.S. Army Forces Command,  the Army’s largest major command. He  aggressively orchestrated the training,  mobilization, and deployment of more  than 500,000 Soldiers and more than a  million tons of equipment to locations  worldwide which represents the largest  mobilization since the Korean War. In  addition to providing resources and directing  long-range planning to move  Army forces, he maintained close operational control of ongoing events to ensure his subordinate units could respond  to  emerging  trends  and  circumstances. The strategic communications plan he instigated to engage disparate and complex audiences to include academia, Congress, local public  officials, industry, and members of the  Department of Defense, ensured that  his commands’ operations were understood and supported.  General Ellis  holds  degrees  from  Morgan State University, B.S., 1969,  and Indiana University, M.S., 1975. His  honors  include the NAACP National  Service Award, 1999; Honorary Doctor  of Law, Morgan State University, 2000;  Honorary Master of Strategic Studies,  U.S. Army War College, 2001; Distinguished Alumni Service Award, Indiana  University, 2003. His military awards  include  the  Defense  Distinguished  Service Medal, the Army Distinguished  Service Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.  His three and a half decades of service earned for General Ellis a reputation as one of the Department of Defense’s most forward thinking and insightful  leaders.

136,Senate,108,-0.446,78,2004-04-29,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, today I  am proud  to be  introducing a bill,  along with Senator COLLINSand Senator LAUTENBERG, to grant a Federal  Charter to the Irish American Cultural  Institute, an organization  that promotes appreciation and recognition of  the  important  contributions  Irish-  Americans have played throughout the  history of the United States. A longstanding goal of the Irish American  Cultural Institute has been to establish  a museum of Irish American history  and culture in Washington, DC, and I  am pleased  to  introduce  legislation  that could represent a positive step towards achieving that goal.  The Irish American Cultural Institute is a national organization founded  in  1962, with  local  chapters  in  17  States. The Institute has spent the last  40 years fighting to promote, preserve  and interpret Irish and Irish-American  culture. Those involved with the Institute do  this,  in part, by  fostering  strong cultural and educational ties between the United States and Ireland:  sending American high school students  to Ireland, and bringing Irish scholars,  musicians, craftsmen, actors, and artists to the Untied States. They also  fund academic research projects that  provide  insights  into  Irish-American  history, and provide  fellowships  for  American professors to spend a year as  a visiting scholar at the National University of Ireland. In short, the Irish  American Cultural Institute serves as  an  important  educational,  informational, and financial resource for key  initiatives important to the Irish and  the Irish-American community in the  United States.  Irish-Americans comprise more than  17 percent of the population of the  United States, and have made enormous contributions to our Nation in  countless ways. A Federal charter will  help the Irish American Cultural Institute continue and expand activities  that recognize and celebrate the heritage of Irish-Americans.

137,Senate,108,0.091,99,2004-04-29,Mr. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I rise to  support S. 2267, the ‘‘Women’s Sustainability Recovery Act of 2004’’ which I  recently introduced. There is today a  critical need to preserve the operations  of existing the Women’s Business Centers currently serving women entrepreneurs in almost every State and territory. I am pleased to be joined in this  effort by Senators DOMENICI, CHAFEE,  BONDand others. Buy adopting this bill  today, the Senate is signaling its intention to preserve much-needed funding for the business centers currently  in operation.  Todaay, more  than  10.6 million  women-owned  small  businesses  are  helping to fuel our economic recovery:  they employ over 19 million Americans  and contribute $2.46 trillion in revenues. In my home State of Maine, there  are more  than  63,000 women-owned  firms, generating more than $9 billion  in sales. Numbers like these speak for  themselves, clear evidence of the success of the Women’s Business Centers  Program, which helps women achieve  their dreams of owning a small business, and other programs like it. As  chair  of  the Small Business Committee,  I am committed  to a wide  range  of  efforts  designed  to  assist  women business owners, so that they,  in turn, can continue to make a significant contribution to our economy.  The Women’s Business Center program was  introduced  through  the  Women’s Business Ownership Act of  1988,and it was made permanent in 1997.  Congress has demonstrated its support  for this program time and time again;  its appropriations have grown from $2  million in 1989 to $12.5 million in 2004,  and the results of this investment have  been  impressive.  In  fiscal year 2002,  centers reported clients realized a return of $161 in gross receipts for every  dollar invested in the program.  Even more remarkable  is the  fact  that the SBA’s Women’s Business Center have helped to create or retain almost 7,000 jobs in the United States, a  success  attributable  to  the  centers  unique  training and counseling programs. In fiscal year 2003, the Women’s  Business Center program increased its  expected level of delivered services by  17 percent, providing counseling and  assistance to more than 106,600 clients  and thereby exceeding its initial goal  of 88,540 clients. To a large degree, this  increased productivity has been triggered by the success of sustainability  grants, which extend funding to eligible women’s business centers.  This year,  insufficient  funding  for  the sustainability grant program may  force 53 Women’s Business Centers to  close their doors. While current legislation reserves 30.2 percent of the Women’s Business Center appropriation for  the sustainability grant program, this  amount is not enough to support the 53  centers in jeopardy. By supporting this  bill, S. 2267, which increases the reserve  forth sustainability grant program by 48 percent, Congress will ensure that each of the 53 Women’s Business Centers eligible for sustainability  has the opportunity to compete for a  sufficient pool of  funding  for  fiscal  year 2004, and that centers will be able  to effectively provide valuable technical  assistance  to  women  entrepreneurs.  Without this legislation, many of the  center may be in jeopardy of closing  their doors. This would be a significant  loss given that some of these centers  have been part of the program for as  long as 9 years and, during that time,  have proven themselves powerful engines of economic development in communities and States across the Nation.  These  centers have  been  extraordinarily successful in providing assistance to women  in all walks of  life.  Women who once received public assistance are now operating businesses  and creating  jobs. Other women are  transitioning from employee to small  business  employer,  and  established  business owners are creating and manufacturing products for sale at home  and  abroad.  The  centers  nurture  women entrepreneurs through business  and  financial  planning  and  assist  women business owners who need help  securing funding for startup and expansion. Furthermore, this legislation requires no additional appropriation, just  a reallocation of current funds.  I am committed  to  resolving  the  women’s sustainability funding crisis  through this bill, and I will continue to  work with my colleagues to ensure the  continued  success  of  women-owned  businesses.

138,Senate,108,-0.352,99,2004-04-29,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, today I  join my  colleague, Senator SNOWE,  chair of  the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship,  in  passing  legislation  to  safeguard  Women’s  Business  Centers  funded  through the Small Business Administration. This legislation is identical to  the Women’s Business Center provision  I introduced as part of S. 2186, the SBA  Emergency Authorization  Extension  Act of 2004, on March 9, 2004, and it  fixes a funding gap that exists for meritorious Women’s Business Centers that  are graduating from the first stage of  the program and entering the sustainability portion.  I would  first  like to thank Chair  for working very closely with  me on this issue, as we have for the  past year and a half. Senator SNOWE  has long been an advocate of the Women’s Business Centers and was a cosponsor of the original legislation that  created the sustainability pilot program in 1999. Now, her support for continuing  the  nationwide  network  of  Women’s Business Centers has been the  catalyst for success in the Senate. I  commend Chair SNOWE for her strong  leadership  for  women  in  business  across this country. I would also like  to thank all of the cosponsors of this  legislation and of S. 2266, all of whom  have  shown  resounding  support  for  women entrepreneurs and recognize the  positive impact the Women’s Business  Centers have on promoting and supporting women  in  business  and  on  strengthening our national economy.  Second, I want to comment on the  Bush  administration’s  proposals  to  eliminate experienced, efficient, and  effective Women’s Business Centers in  favor of new and untested centers. Unless  this  legislation can be enacted  quickly, the administration will move  forward with its proposal, which places  in jeopardy experienced Women’s Business Centers in 39 States and eliminates  assistance  for  thousands  of  women in business. While, as this bill  demonstrates, I support opening new  centers to help women entrepreneurs  who do not currently have access to  this important assistance, this should  SNOWE VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:29 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S29AP4.REC S29AP4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004
139,,108,-0.363,113,2004-04-29,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that the following newspaper articles from the  Miami Herald and the South Florida Sun-Sentinel appear  in  immediately following my statement:  the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  [From the Miami Herald, April 29, 2004] U.S. HOUSEOKSBILLNAMINGNEWFEDERAL  COURTHOUSEFORLATEJUDGEWILKIEFERGUSON  (By Larry Lebowitz)  The U.S. House  of Representatives  on  Wednesday unanimously passed a bill that  would name the new federal courthouse in  downtown Miami after the late U.S. District  Judge Wilkie D. Ferguson Jr. and sent it to  the President for his signature.  ‘‘His career is an inspiration to hundreds of  young attorneys, and his honor and integrity  make him a symbol of fairness on the federal  bench,’’ said Rep. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami.  ‘‘. . . Naming the new  federal courthouse  after Judge Ferguson is an honor that will  reinforce his legacy for decades to come.’’  Only seven U.S. courthouses nationwide have  been named for black jurists, none of them  in Florida. The Senate version, introduced  and  co-sponsored  by Florida Democratic  Sens. Bob Graham and Bill Nelson, passed on  March 12.  The $163 million courthouse, which will  feature two 14–story towers connected by a  mammoth atrium, is located at 400 N. Miami  Ave. It is slated to open in late summer 2005.  [From the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Apr.  29, 2004]  MIAMIFEDERALCOURTBUILDINGTOBEFIRST  INSTATENAMEDAFTERAFRICAN-AMERICAN (By Ann W. O’Neill)  Congress unanimously approved legislation  naming Miami’s newest courthouse after the  late U.S. District Judge Wilkie D. Ferguson  Jr., making it the first federal court building  in Florida to bear the name of an AfricanAmerican.  The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Kendrick  B. Meek, was approved Wednesday by a 406– 0 vote.  ‘‘Now, that’s consensus,’’ Meek said of the  unanimous roll call vote. ‘‘People in South  Florida seeking justice can see an example of  a man who stood tall.’’  Meek, D-Miami, and other backers said  naming the building after Ferguson shows  how South Florida has evolved from a segregated  society where, a generation ago,  some courthouses housed blacks and whites  in separate holding cells.  The $137 million Wilkie D. Ferguson Jr.  United States Courthouse, going up at 400 N.  Miami Ave., will be completed next year.  Only seven federal courthouses across the  country are named after African-Americans.  Ferguson, who was 65 when he died last  year of leukemia, earned a reputation as an  even-handed jurist who championed the underdog. His friend, Miami civil rights attorney H.T. Smith, eulogized Ferguson as ‘‘the  judge for the least, the last, the lost, the  looked-over and the left out.’’  In his most resonant federal court ruling,  Ferguson was credited with improving the  lives of thousands of disabled Florida residents. In 1999, he held the state in contempt  of court, forcing it to increase funding for  home nursing care and other services. The  move allowed thousands of disabled people to  live at home rather than in institutions.  Ferguson was born in May 1938 in Miami,  where his father, Wilkie Sr., was founding  pastor of St. Andrew’s Missionary Baptist  Church  in Opa-locka. The elder Ferguson  died last year at age 94.  His first landmark case came as a MiamiDade Circuit Court  judge, when he ruled  blacks had  been  systematically  excluded  from a jury. He served on the state’s Third  District Court of Appeal in Miami from 1980  to 1993, when President Clinton appointed  him to the federal bench.  Ferguson heard most of his cases in Fort  Lauderdale.  The new courthouse bearing his name is  taking  shape  as  one  of  the  most  architecturally distinctive buildings to appear on Miami’s skyline in years. It consists  of two 15–story glass towers connected by an  atrium. When completed and landscaped, it  will resemble a ship afloat on a wavy sea of  grass.  The bill was backed by 19 South Florida  Congress members; U.S. Sens. Bob Graham  and Bill Nelson; the Dade County Bar Association; the former Black Lawyers Association, now known as the Wilkie D. Ferguson  Bar Association; the Caribbean Bar Association; the Haitian Lawyers Association; the  Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners  and the city of Miami. f  TRIBUTE  TO  DR.  TOMAS  A.

141,Senate,108,0.509,26,2004-05-10,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, it is my  tremendous honor to rise today to recognize a very special birthday. Over  the last 100 years, the American Lung  Association has distinguished itself in  numerous and meaningful ways. It has  made significant contributions to modern health science and has been a force  for  successful political action. Most  importantly, the American Lung Association is responsible for saving millions of lives through its constant and  dedicated efforts to educate the public  to the dangers of lung disease and to  promote  both  preventive  care  and  treatment for this terrible illness.  The American Lung Association has  been especially active over the past 40  years in bringing the health concerns  of smoking to the national policy agenda  and  aggressively  promoting  the  principles behind the Clean Air Act in  relation to pollution’s effect on the  human body and to those individuals  with existing lung illnesses.  Its work in the field of asthma is  equally exemplary. The American Lung  Association has pioneered research efforts  to  determine  the  causes  and  treatment of childhood and adult asthma, calling for needed funding and government support.  It has also spearheaded efforts to teach children with  asthma how to better manage their disease so as to reduce complications, hospitalizations,  and  in  some  cases,  deaths.  With the knowledge that lung disease  is responsible for one in seven deaths  annually, there is no doubt of the critical nature of the efforts of the American Lung Association. It is certainly  appropriate that this body recognize  this dedicated organization for a century of remarkable efforts to improve  the health and lives of all Americans,  and wish its members many more years  of continued success. When they succeed, we all do indeed breathe easier.  ",2004
142,Senate,108,0.382,33,2004-05-10,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  from  time to time the Judicial Conference  and the Administrative Office of the  U.S. Courts recommend legislative proposals to improve the efficiency and  enhance the operations of the Federal  courts. I believe that, out of comity to  the judicial branch, the Senate should  have the judiciary’s specific proposals  on record so that we can give those  suggestions proper consideration.  Today,  joined by Senators LEAHY,  CHAMBLISS, CLINTON, DURBIN, and SCHUMER,  I am  introducing  the Federal  Courts Improvement Act of 2004. This  bill contains both technical and substantive changes in the law. These recommendations made by  the  judicial  branch will improve the judicial process and enhance judiciary personnel administration, benefits, and protections.  Some proposals have been carried over  from previous Congresses, but the legislation also contains some new proposals which the Federal judiciary believes will improve its operation. I appreciate the support of my cosponsors,  and encourage the entire Senate to  support this legislation.  Many provisions contained  in this  bill streamline the operation of the  Federal court system or otherwise facilitate  judicial operations. The bill  authorizes some realignments  in the  composition or the place of holding  court of specified district courts. For  example, section 120 would grant emergency authority  for circuit, district  and bankruptcy courts, as well as magistrate judges, to conduct court proceedings outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court. The need for this  legislation has become apparent  following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the impact of that  disaster on court operations, in particular  in New York City. In emergency conditions, a Federal court facility in an adjoining district (or circuit)  might be more readily and safely available to court personnel, litigants, jurors and the public than a facility at a  place of holding court within the district. This is particularly true in major  metropolitan areas such as New York,  Washington, DC, Dallas and Kansas  City, where the metropolitan area includes parts of more than one judicial  district.  Other sections of the bill contain provisions that would  improve resource  management within the judiciary. The  bill would improve the procedures for  recouping technology costs and also  would broaden the courts’ investment  options and offer an improved procedure for investing court registry funds  in Treasury  securities. Other provisions increase the approval thresholds  for payment vouchers or expand the  delegation authority of respect to approving vouchers. These improvements  will reduce the amount of time judges  must devote to non-judicial matters.  Provisions in this bill also clarify existing law to better fulfill Congress’s  original intent or to make technical  corrections. For example, sections 113  and 114 clarify diversity  jurisdiction  rules as applied to resident aliens and  foreign corporations. Section 117 repeals references to obsolete sections of  the U.S. Code.  In addition, the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2004 also contains  provisions designed  to  improve personnel  administration,  benefits  and  protections for employees working for  the Federal  judiciary. These  provisions, in some cases, bring the Federal  judicial system in line with the executive branch and other governmental  bodies. Other provisions are designed  to improve the ability of the judiciary  to recruit and retain personnel.  Several sections improve the judicial  system in other ways. The bill offers  protection of certain information contained in bankruptcy case files, such as  Social Security account numbers, from  public disclosure. The proposed legislation provides protection against malicious  recording  of  fictitious  liens  against Federal judges. The bill provides for improving the process for determining Federal court security requirements.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of the legislation, along with a  section-by-section analysis of the bill,  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill and  additional material were ordered to be  printed in the RECORD, as follows:  S. 2396  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

143,,108,-0.565,124,2004-05-10,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, according to the Autism Society of America, autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the country. Growing at a rate of 10–  17 percent every year, it is estimated that aufour million  tism could affect a staggering  Americans in the coming decade.  Despite these alarming figures, autism is an  issue that is simply not getting enough attention. For whatever reason, society appears to  be all too quick to overlook the matter. It is the  duty of this House to ensure not only that autism research is intensified, but also that autism awareness is increased. H. Res. 605 addresses both of these key endeavors.  The cost of autism-related services such as  evaluations, home programs, and therapies is  expensive. Many  families across  the nation  are having  to bare  the  financial burden of  these services with limited assistance. According to the Autism Society of America, the cost  of lifelong care can be reduced by two thirds  with early diagnosis and intervention. Therefore, in the long run, increased spending on  early detection would, in fact, ease the financial burden of treating individuals with autism.  Autism is a so-called ‘‘spectrum disorder.’’  Thus, it effects individuals to varying degrees  of severity. Accordingly, early detection of autism would enable individuals with autism to  receive the necessary attention and treatment  to meet their respective needs. This, in turn,  increases his or her chances of  living with  minimal disability related difficulties. Later  in  life, worker-training programs provide an additional and invaluable opportunity for individuals  to get the necessary training to help them participate effectively in the workforce.  In conclusion, I reiterate my support for H.  Res. 605, and urge all of my colleagues  to  support this important bill. We must all work  together to curb the increase in autism and to  raise awareness about the nature of the disability.  f  TRIBUTE TO KAITLIN ASHLEY  KAZANJIAN  HON. MARTIN T.

144,,108,-0.39,124,2004-05-10,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  remember a young woman, Kaitlin Kazanjian,  whose life was tragically ended on November  5, 2003, at the age of 16.  Kaitlin Ashley Kazanjian, a resident of Palm  Beach Gardens, FL, with close ties to a prominent Greater Lowell family in my district, died  as a result of  injuries sustained  in an automobile accident. Kaitlin Kazanjian was riding  in the passenger seat of a classmate’s automobile when control of  the vehicle was  lost  and it crashed.  Kaitlin was born in Palm Beach Gardens, on  April 22, 1987. Her parents, John and Joanne  Natsios Kazanjian were proud of their daughter, not just for the cheerful girl she was, but  also for the happiness she brought to them, as  well as everyone who knew her. in addition to  her parents, she is survived by a sister, Kristin  Kazanjian, and a brother, John S.

For decades the Kazanjian family name has  been synonymous with that of a hard-working  family that has dedicated itself to the betterment of the Lowell, Massachusetts community.

146,House,108,-0.438,10,2004-05-17,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  voice my support for H. Con. Res. 420, a bill  that designates May 16–22, 2004 as National  Transportation Week. Sponsored by the U.S.  Department of Transportation, and more than  30 other transportation industry organizations,  National Transportation Week  is an opportunity  to highlight  the  functions and accomplishments of the transportation industry.  There are nearly 4 million miles of roads in  the United States. That’s enough to circle the  globe 16 times, travel round trip to the moon  8 times, or take 800 round trips between New  York and Los Angeles. Since 1982 our population has grown almost 19 percent, the number of registered motor vehicles has increased  36 percent, and vehicle miles  traveled has  ballooned 72 percent. In spite of this growth,  we have failed to keep pace with the increasing demands on highways and  transit systems. Over the last 20 years we have added  less  than  five percent  to road capacity and  even less to public transit.  Transportation  is about people, and about  providing  them with  the opportunity  to  lead  safer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives. Moreover, our country’s economic strength, our  ability to improve productivity, and our capacity to create jobs are all dependent—to a great  extent—on the health and vitality of our transportation system and its infrastructure. In 2003  the value of imported goods and goods designated for export that were carried on our Nation’s transportation system amounted to nearly $2  trillion—that’s $1,259 billion  in  imports  and $724 billion in exports.  According  to  the Census Bureau and  the  U.S. Department of Transportation forecasts,  by the year 2020: Annual vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. will increase 51 percent—from  2.8 trillion in 2000 to 4.2 trillion in 2020; the  driving age population in the United States will  increase 21 percent by 2020; and truck freight  volumes will nearly double from 9 billion tons  in 2000, to almost 17 billion tons in 2020.  I am stating these statistics because I am  very concerned about the inadequate funding  of our Nation’s transportation system and this  Committee’s  transportation bill. Without  increased investment we will suffer both socially  and economically. For every $1 billion  invested in Federal highway and transit spending, 47,500 jobs are created or sustained. Our  Nation’s deteriorating  infrastructure and congestion, along with safety and economic problems warrant our strong and  immediate  response.

148,House,108,0.351,17,2004-05-17,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman from California for yielding me this time, and I rise in opposition to H.R. 3722.  Mr. Speaker, if enacted, The Undocumented  Alien Emergency Medical Assistance Amendments will turn our hospital caregivers into ‘‘de  facto’’ border patrol agents  for  the Federal  government. The measure would require hospitals  to  take biometric  ‘‘identifiers’’—fingerprints or digital photographs—of any patient  whom they suspect of being an illegal immigrant and send that information to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in order to  receive funding for the uncompensated costs  of providing emergency care to undocumented  immigrants. Hospitals are already understaffed  and they do not have the resources needed to  collect this information while trying to administer emergency care.  This bill would discourage illegal aliens from  seeking treatment for possibly contagious diseases for fear of being deported. In close-knit  communities, such as many border areas, disease can spread quickly. This would lead to a  potential health crisis in areas throughout the  country—especially the southwest.  Illegal immigrants are in the United States  as a direct result of the government’s inability  to control our borders, and our hospitals are  bearing  the brunt by not being  reimbursed.  Controlling immigration is a Federal responsibility—not  the  responsibility of doctors and  nurses trying to administer care. Border Patrol  agents are not  taking  illegal  immigrants  into  custody who need medical treatment to avoid  paying for the care. Federal agencies should  be responsible for what is a Federal problem.  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to  provide  emergency  care  to  anyone who  comes to their emergency rooms, without regard to race, creed, color, financial ability to  pay, citizenship, or  immigration status. H.R.  3722 goes directly against EMTALA by forcing  hospitals to guess which patients they believe  are illegal immigrants, take down information  about their immigration status, employer and  address, and  report  to  the Department of  Homeland Security.  It would burden hospital  workers with a staggering amount of administrative work and subject them to charges of  discrimination for singling out certain individuals for identification.  The Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid  Services is creating regulations to keep hospitals accountable  for how  they are  reimbursed for treating illegal aliens. Those regulations are due in September. Passing this legislation would directly preclude CMS—the agency that knows best how to handle this situation. If it is deemed these regulations are not  adequate, we should revisit this debate.  Do not turn doctors and nurses into police  officers. Oppose H.R. 3722.  ",2004
149,House,108,-0.631,24,2004-05-17,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition  to H.R. 3722,  the Undocumented Alien  Emergency Medical Assistance Amendments  Act. This draconian bill would convert our nation’s hospitals from health care providers to  border patrol officers.  If enacted, it would seriously endanger the  health and  lives of  immigrants who need  emergency care—and jeopardize our nation’s  entire public health system  in  the process.  This bill would deny critical federal reimbursement to hospitals for the emergency care of  undocumented immigrants unless the hospital  determined patients’  immigration status and  obtained employer information for transmission  to  the Department of Homeland Security  for  purposes of beginning deportation procedures  for undocumented workers.  Today, the House Republicans are proving  that President George Bush’s promise to reform America’s immigration system is not real  and is nothing more than an election year ploy  to gain votes  from  immigrants.  If President  Bush were concerned about the well-being of  immigrants, he would publicly denounce  this  bill and would have made clear to the House  Republican leadership that it did not deserve  to see  the  light of day. He’s done no such  thing.  This bill also clearly demonstrates the Republican Leadership’s willingness  to sacrifice  the health needs and safety of America’s immigrants  to ensure  their  large donors—the  pharmaceutical companies and health  insurance  industry—get  their billions of dollars  in  subsidies from the Medicare bill. HR 3722 is  on the floor today because of a commitment  the House Republican leadership made to the  bill’s author in exchange for his vote for the  Republican Medicare bill when  it narrowly  passed the House last November. Its yet another example of the dirty dealing it took to get  their Medicare bill through Congress.  If enacted, this policy would create a chilling  effect in which both documented and undocumented workers would fear coming into hospitals for critical medical services. The result  would be immigrants suffering from more serious health complications and eventually leading to the unnecessary deaths of many immigrants.  This bill would also  threaten  the public  health of this nation. Since this bill would surely drive a significant proportion of this country’s population away  from seeking needed  medical care,  it would undermine our public  health system’s ability to track and prevent the  spread of contagious disease. Clearly, such a  change would impact health care beyond the  immigrant community.  Instead of limiting health care, this Congress  should be finding ways to expand health care  to the 44 million Americans without health insurance. This bill would take us in the exact  opposite direction.  I urge my colleagues  to  vote against this bill and to protect our hospitals’ abilities to continue to provide medical  care to those who need it. To do otherwise is  to endanger the health of us all.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in opposition to H.R. 3722, the ‘‘Undocumented Alien Emergency Medical Assistance  Amendments of 2004.’’ This bill would amend  Section 1011 of  the Medicare Prescription  Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 MMA. The purpose of Section 1011 of  the MMA is to provide funds for reimbursing  physicians and hospitals for treating undocumented individuals who cannot afford to pay  their medical bills. H.R. 3722 would  impose  conditions on  the Federal  reimbursement of  emergency health services furnished to these  individuals, and  it would  require physicians  and other health care providers to report the  undocumented patients to the Department of  Homeland Security so that they could be deported.  H.R. 3722 would  require physicians and  other health care providers  to be part  time  border patrol agents. According to the American Medical Association AMA, by  requiring  physicians to report patients and perhaps withhold necessary care, this bill would in effect  require physicians to violate their Hippocratic  Oath. The AMA also has expressed concern  over  the  fact  that by discouraging undocumented individuals from seeking medical care  for problems that might cause harm to others,  such as communicable diseases, H.R. 3722  could have very negative effects on existing  public health efforts.  I share the concerns of the AMA. The fear  of deportation  inevitably would preclude undocumented immigrants from seeking care for  communicable diseases until  they are extremely ill.  It is important to remember that community  hospitals must provide care  to anyone who  walks through their doors, regardless of race,  ethnicity or citizenship status, and they must  do  this  twenty-four hours each day, seven  days a week. In order to qualify for Section  1011  funding,  the Rohrabacher  legislation  would require  the hospitals also  to demand  and upload personal data. This would include  the uploading of fingerprints and digital photographs  for undocumented aliens  to an electronic database set up by the Department of  Homeland Security DHS for deportation purposes. Furthermore, the bill would require hospitals to retain original documents and data for  a period of at least 5 years, thus imposing additional paperwork on an already overburdened system.  Today’s health care delivery system is very  fast-paced, and,  in an emergency situation,  the urgency of providing life-saving care takes  precedence over anything else. Requiring hospitals to collect immigration data would divert  time and attention  from caring  for patients.  Hospitals do not have the expertise or the resources to interrogate and investigate patients  in the pressured environment of an emergency  room.  It also would divert funds that could be used  to provide health care services  for some of  America’s estimated 44 million uninsured patients. A substantial portion of  these  funds  would have to be used to establish and implement an expensive new immigration enforcement program  for our already underfunded,  overburdened community hospitals.  More than 200 organizations are opposed to  this bill, including the American Hospital Association, Federation of American Hospitals, National Association of Children’s Hospitals, National Association of Public Hospitals and  Health Systems, Catholic Health Association,  Association of American Medical Colleges,  National Immigration Forum, National Immigration Law Center, Leadership Conference on  Civil Rights, National Council of La Raza,  League of United Latin American Citizens,  MALDEF, National Asian Pacific American  Legal Consortium, Asian and Pacific Islander  American Health Forum, Families USA, AFL-  CIO and Catholic Charities.  This legislation would weaken federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor  Act EMTALA obligations by redefining the circumstances under which hospitals are  required to treat patients who are undocumented  immigrants. Such a policy would create a dangerous situation for all patients because physicians would be required  to  impose differing  standards of care based on whether they determine a patient to be in the country legally  or not. By necessity, emergency department  professionals must be afforded  the  latitude  necessary  to provide  treatment based solely  on which treatment is medically appropriate for  the patient and without regard for immigration  status.  It is in the best interests of all patients, documented and undocumented alike, that medical staff be permitted to focus their attention  on caring for patients and providing necessary  medical treatment rather than on assisting the  federal government in enforcing the immigration laws of this country. I urge you therefore  to  vote against H.R. 3722,  the  ‘‘Undocumented Alien Emergency Medical Assistance  Amendments of 2004.’’  ",2004
150,House,108,-0.577,31,2004-05-17,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Speaker,  support of H. Con. Res. 403.  Sudan, geographically the largest country in  Africa, has been ravaged by civil war for four  decades. An estimated  two million people  have died over the past two decades due to  war-related causes and  famine, and millions  have been displaced  from  their homes. According  to  the United Nations, an estimated  three million people are in need of emergency  food aid. Recently, violence has escalated in  the Darfur  region of  the Western Sudan,  where  government-sponsored militias  have  been  ruthlessly  targeting  various  ethnic  groups. Approximately one million  civilians  have been forced to flee their homes and are  now either internally displaced or seeking refuge in neighboring Chad.  Sudanese government  forces have overseen and directly participated  in massacres,  summary executions of civilians, burning of  towns and villages, and the forcible depopulation of wide swathes of land long inhabited by  the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups.  For months, the Sudanese government has  restricted international media access to Darfur  and has limited reporting about the conflict in  the national press. Recently, the government  has allowed minimal access to the region for  international humanitarian agencies but has  still failed to provide the necessary protection  and assistance to prevent a full-blown humanitarian crisis.  There can be no doubt about the Sudanese  government’s culpability in crimes against humanity  in Darfur. With  this  resolution, Congress demands  that  the Sudanese government take immediate steps to reverse ethnic  cleansing in Darfur before the situation there  worsens and engulfs the entire region in conflict.  The gentleman  from Virginia, Mr. WOLF,  should be commended for keeping the events  in Sudan on Congress’ agenda and  I urge  Members to support his resolution.  ",2004

As the Million Mom March begins its Halt the Assault tour beginning tomorrow, I think it is important  to remember the support the assault  weapons ban has across this country.  I want to remind people that in California, KSBW television said recently,  ‘‘We call on the Congress to keep assault weapons where they belong, with  our military and with our police.’’ On  the other  side of  the country,  the  Worcester Telegraph and Herald says,  ‘‘Banning assault weapons in no way  limits individuals’ ability to buy, own,  or sell legitimate sporting firearms.’’  In the South, the New Orleans editorialized,  ‘‘There’s no justification for  legalizing the 19 military-style weapons covered by the ban.’’ In the Midwest,  the Springfield  Illinois State  Journal-Register wrote,  ‘‘No  reasonable gun owner should oppose the Federal assault weapons ban.’’  All across the country, the Nation’s  leading newspapers are reflecting the  opinion of the American people. They  want the assault weapons ban renewed.  Strip away the rhetoric and the polls  and the focus groups, and gun violence  is about destroying lives. How many  more lives will we destroy by putting  assault weapons back on our streets?  Each week, I get up and I say to the  American people, you can make a difference. Each week, I get up and remind people that we need to have the  assault weapons  ban  renewed. September 13 is coming up soon.  When you start talking to our police  officers across the country and how involved they are in this issue, people  have to remember why we passed the  assault weapons ban in the first place,  because our police officers were being  mowed down. Assault weapons were  used in killings in our schools.  We can stop this, but we need the  American people’s help. You can make  a difference. You  can make a difference. I have always said one person  can make a difference, because first it  is one, and then two, and it multiplies  across this Nation. But we need to hear  your voices. We need to have you contact your Members of Congress, the  Members of the Senate.  We need to hear your voices. That is  the only way we are going to get that  bill up here on the House floor. The  President has promised to sign the bill  if it gets on his desk. We have to make  sure  that  the  bill  is  passed  here  through the House. We know we can  pass it in the Senate and have it put on  the President’s desk.  I  personally  believe  it  should  be  made permanent. I also believe that  copycats of the guns that were used,  say in the D.C. sniper shooting, which  was the Bushmaster, should not be allowed to be copycat. I saw in the paper  the other day that one of our gun manufacturers just got a very large contract for the military so that the people in Iraq, their soldiers, will have our  guns. So I think we can see where the  guns are going for war.  Let me remind people: AK–47s and  Uzis, these are the guns you see every  night on TV; these are the guns we see  our young men and women use to go  fight the war in Iraq. And that is where  they belong,  in a war, not on our  streets. They should not be allowed on  our streets. They should not be allowed  in our communities. They certainly  should not be allowed to be bought and  sold  by  the  drug  gangs we  have  throughout this country today.  This is what we need to do. I am asking the American people for help. I will  do my part here in Washington, but I  need your voices across the country to  make sure we have the bill come up for  a vote. That will be your job: contact  your representatives. Do your part. Do  not always say, let them do it; you  have to get involved in this issue.  f  ",2004

156,Senate,108,-0.37,80,2004-05-17,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, today  I rise to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Today, we celebrate the historic and unanimous Supreme Court  decision that called for an end to racial  segregation in schools throughout the  nation. And as we honor those individuals who risked so much to challenge  discrimination and  establish a  constitutional right to an equal education,  I am filled with both hope and promise.  Hope that the legacy of Brown will endure. Hope that equality and opportunity will soon be the reality for millions of school children who today still  face segregation and inequality in their  schools. And the promise that today we  will renew our commitment to achieving the goal of equality that began 50  years ago with the Brown decision.  I am so proud to honor today the important role that the great state of  Maryland played  in  this history of  Brown. Maryland is the birthplace of  Thurgood Marshall, the architect of  the blueprint to end racial segregation  in education. Thurgood Marshall grew  up and attended  racially  segregated  schools in Baltimore, he knew the impact of segregation first hand, and he  took the fight for racial justice all the  way  to  the  Supreme  Court.  His  thoughtful and strategic  legal arguments were instrumental in knocking  down racial segregation in our country.  Maryland is also the home of the National Association  for  the Advancement of Colored People. Founded  in  1909, the NAACP successfully fought to  integrate the University of Maryland  in 1935 and its leaders painstakingly  planned and organized the challenge to  racial segregation in public schools.  Brown marks a momentous beginning in American history. For the first  time, the Supreme Court recognized a  constitutional right to an equal public  education for all students. And for the  first time, the Supreme Court recognized that separate can never be equal.  Brown is the foundation on the road to  dismantling segregation in our society.  The fight for equality started with the  schools and progressed  through  the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting  Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing  Act of 1968—all critical steps to rid the  nation of segregation and disparities it  fostered. Yet 50 years later we’re still a  long way from the promise of Brown v.  Board of Education—equality in public  education and opportunity for all students.  Why was the Brown decision so important? Because the Supreme Court  said  that  regardless of  race,  color,  creed or ethnicity education ‘‘is a right  which must be made available to all  students.’’ The Brown Court took the  unprecedented step of examining how  African-American children were being  educated and the environments that  they were learning in. And for the first  time the Court used social science research to show that learning is compromised by segregation—and as a result Black students were receiving inferior educations.  It was clear  that  poor schools, which invariably lacked  resources, resulted in a lower quality  of education for Black students than  their white counterparts. Most importantly,  the Brown decision, with a  mighty hand, challenged Americans to  confront the discrimination, segregation and  inequality  that existed  in  schools and in their communities.  Today, I urge Americans to renew  that challenge. We must address the  growing disparities in our schools and  the re-segregation of students of color  in our classrooms. Even a quick glance  at  our Nation’s  schools,  including  schools in Maryland, shows that the  promise of Brown has not been realized. We know that students are still  segregated—and that schools still are  not equal. Students of color and poor  students are more likely to be in overcrowded schools, without enough books  and computers, in buildings that are  often literally falling apart. They are  often sidelined into special education  classes—when what they really need is  special attention.  I don’t want the quality of education  to depend on a family’s income or the  location they  live  in. As the Brown  Court understood, having adequate resources and decent facilities matters.  We need to make sure we have a public  school system that works. That means  smaller classes, a good teacher in every  classroom, and making  sure  schools  have resources to meet special needs—  like bilingual education and  special  education. We need to keep  fighting  against the soft bigotry of low expectation.  Today,  as we  commemorate  the  Brown decision and the progress that  has been made in the past 50 years, we  renew our commitment to increase diversity and provide educational opportunities for all children regardless of  race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status.  We must stand up for what America  stands for: opportunity, equality, and  empowerment. We must make  sure  there is no discrimination of any kind,  anywhere  in  the United States  of  America—whether it is the old fashioned kind or the new fashioned kind.  That means saying no to continued racial discrimination in education, and  saying no to racial sidelining: pushing  children  of  color  into  special  education. Brown established education as  a right to all students. We must continue to fight to protect that right, to  make sure that the promise of an equal  education is, in fact, a reality for all  school children.  ",2004
157,Senate,108,-0.328,115,2004-05-17,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today with Senators KENNEDY, REED,  BINGAMAN, CLINTON, SARBANES, REID,  AKAKA, JOHNSON, STABENOW, CORZINE,  LAUTENBERG and DURBIN to introduce  the ‘‘Student Bill of Rights.’’ This bill  is critical to ensuring that every child  in America receives the educational  opportunity that is the foundation of  America’s  promise  of  equal  opportunity for all.  The Student Bill of Rights attempts  to ensure that every American child  has an equal opportunity to receive a  good  education—including,  highly  qualified  teachers,  challenging  curricula,  small  classes,  current  textbooks, quality libraries, and up-to-date  technology—to  all  students  in  all  schools  in a State. Current  law requires that schools within the same  district  provide  comparable  educational services. This bill would extend that basic protection to the State  level by requiring comparability across  school districts. And, this bill would  help ensure that States comply with  State or Federal  court orders  concerning  the  fairness of  their public  school systems.  Fifty years ago, Brown vs. Board of  Education struck down segregation in  law. Fifty years later, we know that  just because there is no segregation in  law does not mean that it does not persist in fact. Fifty years after Brown v.  Board of Education, our education system remains largely separate and unequal.  All too often, whether an American  child is taught by a high quality teacher in a small class, has access to the  best courses and  instructional materials, goes to school in a new, modern  building, and otherwise benefits from  educational resources that have been  shown to be essential to a quality education,  still  depends  on where  the  child’s  family can afford to  live. In  fact,  the United States  ranks  last  among developed countries in the difference in the quality of schools available to wealthy and low-income children. This is simply unacceptable, and  it is why the Student Bill of Rights is  so important to our children’s ability  to achieve academically, to gain the  skills they need to be responsible, participating citizens in our diverse democracy, and to compete and succeed  in the global economy.  Of course, factors besides resources  are  also  important  to  academic  achievement—supportive parents, motivated peers, and positive role models  in the community, just to name a few.  But at the same time, we also know  that adequate resources are vital to  providing  students with  the  opportunity to receive a solid education.  This bill does not represent a radical  notion. Last Congress, 42 Senators and  183 Representatives voted for similar  legislation that Mr. FATTAHoffered in  the other body and I offered here in the  Senate. A radical notion is the idea  that a country founded on the principle  of equal opportunity for all can continue to accept an educational system  that provides real educational opportunity for just a select few.  When he signed the No Child Left Behind Act two years ago, President Bush  promised that the Federal Government  would make sure schools have the resources necessary  to meet  the new  law’s requirements. This year alone,  the  President’s  budget  resolution  underfunds the law by $9.4 billion. The  President’s budget also fails to fully  funding  the  Federal  Government’s  commitment  to  special  education—  leaving families and local communities  struggling to make up the difference.  We will never close the achievement  gap as long as our nation’s most disadvantaged students  in the neediest  schools are forced to make do with far  less than other students. The Federal  Government needs to become a more  equal partner in funding education.  States need to do more, too. At the  federal level we have created programs  to help ensure that students from low-  income  communities  start  school  healthy and ready to learn and to succeed in school once they get there. Programs such as Head Start, the School  Lunch Program, The Children’s Health  Insurance Program and Title I, all assist in meeting the needs of low-income  kids from their very first days.  In the end, this bill is about the simple fact that the quality of a child’s  education should not be determined by  their zip code. The Student Bill of  Rights will help ensure that each and  every child’s school has the resources  to provide them with a decent education, and in turn, an equal opportunity for a successful future.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Student Bill of Rights,  and I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 2428  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Since 1904, the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun  Club has never lost sight of its original purpose: to preserve Spruce Creek as a fishery.  While maintaining  its honorable  traditions of  conservation, the club in Huntingdon County  has conquered numerous obstacles and  received high acclaim for its perseverance.  Throughout the past century, the club has  undergone a complete restoration, upon conclusion of which the building was placed on  the National Registry of Historic Places  in  1991. With the extraordinary vision of its past  leaders, the club has been able to merge the  old with the new by upholding its age-old traditions while improving the services available to  members.  Due to its reputation for excellence, Spruce  Creek has attracted such renowned leaders as  Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jimmy  Carter, Senator John Heinz, Vice President  DICKCHENEY, and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, to name a few.  The success of the club over the past one  hundred years is a testament to the integrity  with which  the  institution has been  run.  I  would like to congratulate the Spruce Creek  Rod and Gun Club on its 100th Anniversary.

159,,108,0.56,143,2004-05-17,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today on  behalf of  the members of  the Republican  Study Committee (RSC)  to express our sincere gratitude and best wishes to Neil Bradley.  Neil, who has served as Executive Director of  the RSC since January 2000, was  recently  asked by the House Majority Whip to serve as  his Policy Director. As the members and staff  of the RSC prepare to wish Neil well in his  new position, we wanted to take a moment to  reflect upon his outstanding service to our organization and to thank him for it.  For those who may be unaware, the Republican Study Committee is a group of Republicans organized for the purpose of advancing  a conservative economic and social agenda in  the House of Representatives. The group  is  dedicated  to a  limited government, a strong  national defense,  the protection of  individual  and property rights, and  the preservation of  traditional  family values. Although  these values are shared in the abstract by a majority of  my colleagues, it is necessary that we measure what is produced through the deal-making  and political give-and-take that permeates this  institution against the ideals we were elected  to uphold. The RSC plays an invaluable role  in seeking  to ensure  that all  legislation  that  moves through this body reflects and respects  these fundamental values.  Over  the past  four and a half years,  the  RSC’s efforts have been  tremendously  improved because of the service of Neil Bradley  as  the group’s Executive Director. Neil  is a  committed and principled conservative. He is a  tireless and effective advocate for the RSC’s  objectives. And, as anyone who has worked  with or against him will readily acknowledge,  Neil  is a master of House procedure, especially the federal budget process. Mr. Speaker,  Neil has served  the RSC with  integrity and  distinction. We will miss him greatly, but are  glad that he will be working for our shared values in a position of influence within the House  Leadership.  As his friends and colleagues know, Neil’s  emails always conclude with some quotation  from a famous conservative political thinker or  office holder that is relevant to the policy fight  of  the day. Many of  the quotes come  from  Neil’s political hero, former President Ronald  Reagan. I thought it would be fitting to close  with some words from the great leader.  In 1989, in his farewell address to the Nation, Reagan said the following to the officials  and staff that served in his Administration:  [A]s I walk off into the city streets, a final  word to the men and women of the Reagan  revolution, the men and women across America who for 8 years did the work that brought  America back. My friends: We did it. We  weren’t just marking time. We made a difference.  Mr. Speaker, Neil Bradley has spent 4 and  a half years working passionately for the Republican Study Committee, for the House of  Representatives, and for America. He was not  just marking time. He made a difference.  On behalf of the RSC, I thank him for his  service and wish him well in his new endeavor.  HONORING BROWN V. BOARD OF  EDUCATION  HON. PETER DEUTSCH  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 17, 2004  ",2004
160,,108,-0.324,143,2004-05-17,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Brown  v. Board of Education. This landmark victory in  the effort to rid this nation of segregation continues to product national repercussions, and  on this day I believe we must rededicate ourselves to the ideals that it proposes.  Mr. Speaker, many people consider Brown  a failure. It is not universally accepted or practiced, and the victories of the civil rights movement have been overturned or forgotten in the  subsequent years. Minority populations including black and Latino children continue to find  themselves as this nation’s lowest academic  performers. Indeed, if Thurgood Marshall surveyed  the  racial  landscape  today, he may  wonder if Brown had been overturned.  But these very real challenges must not let  us  forget  the  lasting  lesson of Brown. For  many black parents,  integration was not  the  key issue as it was the recognition of the fact  that unless their children went to school with  the children of the whites who controlled the  purse strings, their children’s educational opportunities would likely be shortchanged.  Brown ultimately decrees that all children—  black, white, Latino; Asian, Native American—  are all equally deserving of a high quality education, and  that we cannot allow superficial  differences to dissuade us from this fact. We  must provide our children the presumption of  competence and the expectation of success.  Our children must have an environment that  nurtures aspiration, guardians who provide direction, and peers who provide support. If we  are serious about  realizing  the promise of  Brown, then we must challenge ourselves to  deliver  those  things which  they most desperately need.

161,Senate,108,-0.203,34,2004-05-21,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, there  are 542,000 reasons that we should all be  involved  in recognizing May as National Foster Care Month. These reasons represent the number of children  currently  in the  foster care system,  roughly 126,000 of whom are waiting to  be adopted. Over 70 percent of these  children entered foster care because of  abuse or neglect. And,  the average  length of time that these children stay  in foster care is almost 3 years.  For many of these children, the wait  for a loving family where they are nurtured, comforted, and protected is endless. Every year, 25,000 children ‘‘age  out’’ of foster care because they reach  adulthood without ever being found a  permanent home. These children are  more likely to drop out of school and  are more likely to be unemployed, welfare dependent, and homeless. In fact,  roughly  30 percent of  the Nation’s  homeless are former foster children.  As Senators, we cannot allow over  half a million children to continue languishing in the foster care system, vulnerable to facing these negative outcomes. During  this National Foster  Care Month or at any other appropriate time throughout the year, I ask  that you focus attention on the need to  find secure and supportive families for  these children.  Nurturing and stable environments  can allow these children to achieve  great success by helping them to overcome the challenges posed by involvement in the foster care system. One  such example of the effect that a nurturing  and  stable  environment  can  have on a foster child exists right in  Congress’s own backyard—the Mayor  of Washington, DC, Anthony Williams.  Mayor Williams’ mother once told the  story that when she visited the orphanage where she first met her son, she  was told by the workers that he was  not as advanced developmentally and  intellectually as he should be  for a  child his age. These workers even indicated that little Anthony might have  to be sent to an institution. And, they  were right. His mother sent him off to  two of the most prestigious  institutions in our country—Yale University  for college and Harvard University for  law school.  I invite all Members to come to the  Senate floor to speak about former foster children such as Mayor Williams,  about foster children currently waiting  for loving families, or about the significance of foster care in your own  life, in your State, or in the life of a  child. But, I want to ask more of you  than simply sharing these stories. I  would like to urge my colleagues to  commit their efforts to ensuring that  we institute legislative reforms for the  child welfare system that will emphasize permanency  for  foster children,  whether  that  be  reunification with  families, adoption, or teaching youth  skills to be able to live self-sufficiently  after emancipation. The time is now  for us to reform a foster care system  that does not adequately address the  needs of our most vulnerable children  and families.  One of the areas that will require the  greatest reform is the Federal financing structure of child welfare services.  Currently, the Federal financing system is structured in a way that provides the greatest financial support for  a child by  the Federal Government  when that child is in the foster care  system. In other words, it creates a  funding incentive to keep children in  foster care, rather than moving them  towards re-unification or adoption. We  must revise this system so that funding matches  the Federal  priorities.  This means that Government should  fund the programs and approaches that  are actually working to provide safety  and permanency to children. Decisions  regarding  the placement of a child  should not be influenced by the type of  placement that would offer the greatest resources for the child, but instead  be based on the best interests of the  child. Adequate  resources  should be  available for children involved in any  area  of  the  child welfare  system.  Therefore,  the money and  resources  should follow the child, whether that is  in foster care, in an adoptive home, or  after re-unification with the biological  family. The current financing system  includes  a  patchwork  of  programs,  many of which are funded through discretionary spending that is vulnerable  to cuts in the appropriations process.  Reforms must be instituted that allow  the child welfare system to encompass  a more comprehensive approach that  includes  prevention,  re-unification  services, adequate foster care services,  adoption  resources, and post-permanency support.  The time has come to fix these problems, to focus on the solutions in order  to help our most vulnerable children.  The Pew Commission on Children in  Foster Care released a report this week  that summarizes a 1-year study of the  foster care system. This study includes  the feedback of advocates, State service providers, lawmakers, judges, and  former foster youth around the country. I respectfully ask my colleagues to  carefully look at the recommendations  of not only the Pew Commission but of  the  hundreds  of  other  individuals,  groups, and States that have studied  this system and have provided valuable  ideas for reform.  Further, I hope that the leadership in  the Finance Committee will hold hearings on the topic of Federal financing  of the child welfare system to fully explore the problems in this system and  the proposals for reform that will help  to resolve these problems. I also ask all  Members of Congress to make these reforms a priority during the remainder  of this session and during the next session of Congress. I am personally committed to seeing reform done within  VerDate May 04 2004  03:20 May 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A21MY6.026 S21PT1 ",2004
162,Senate,108,0.109,55,2004-05-21,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, today, I  am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators AKAKA, FITZGERALD,  in  introducing the Thrift Savings Plan Open  Elections Act of 2004. This legislation  would provide Federal employees with  maximum flexibility to tailor their investment decisions by eliminating the  current restrictions on when employee  contributions  to  the Thrift Savings  Plan can begin or be modified.  Since its inception in 1987, the Thrift  Savings Plan has provided Federal employees with the opportunity to participate in a retirement savings plan  similar to the 401(k) plans offered by  many private companies. The open seasons were created to encourage Federal  employees to contribute money toward  their retirement. Open seasons were  practical during the early years when  the Thrift Savings Plan was just getting started and lacked the administrative capability to quickly enroll participants and to implement investment  elections on a real-time basis. With the  introduction of the automatic record-  keeping system, however, the program  has outgrown its existing framework.  Under current law, newly hired employees can sign up to contribute to  the Thrift Savings Plan during an initial 60-day eligibility period. If an employee chooses not to make an election, he or she must wait until an open  season to do so. Further,  if an employee stops contributing to the Thrift  Savings Plan outside of an open season,  he or she must wait until the second  open season after contributions stop  before contributions can resume.

163,,108,-0.488,209,2004-05-21,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  oppose  the Republican Majority’s proposed  rule that would limit debate on a matter as important as the Department of Defense Authorization bill, which purports to provide spending  in excess of $400 billion for Fiscal Year 2005.  At a time when Members of the United States  House of Representatives claim  to be supporting the extension of democracy in Afghanistan and  Iraq,  it  is unconscionable  for  the  leadership to limit debate in the House.  There were times in the not too distant past,  where a bill of  this magnitude would have  been debated for at least two weeks. Members would have had the opportunity to voice  their position on hundreds of amendments important to their constituents and the nation. It  appears that keeping with the Republican Majority’s  fear  that reasonable Republicans will  join Democrats in actually improving the underlying bill,  the Rules Committee has acceded  to  the Majority Leadership’s pressure  and only allowed 28 of 127 amendments for  debate and vote. This institution—the People’s  House—deserves better, and  the American  people deserve better. Had  the Rules Committee and the Leadership followed a practice  from a time before the current Majority was in  power, most if not all of the proposed amendments would have been made in order, including  two amendments which  I proposed and  which, I firmly believe are in our common interest.  We should be able to agree that American  defense workers are 100 percent committed to  our armed forces and to ensuring that America  has the best trained, best equipped, best led  forces in the world. Unfortunately, these workers have seen their jobs vanish at an alarming  rate without explanation or justification. Over  the past 15 years, defense-related employment is said to have fallen by some 67 percent. This  translates  into over a million  lost  jobs. We need to do more to reverse this disturbing trend.  The Amendment  I sought would place us  standing firmly in solidarity with these workers.  First, we would find out where the jobs have  gone, and second, fight to keep them in this  country.  We made a similar fight last year. We were  partially  successful.  The  House-passed  version of the Defense Department Authorization bill established a ‘‘Defense Industrial Base  Assessment Program’’ to collect new information about where defense contracts are being  performed;  to determine what percentage of  the contract is being completed overseas; and  to learn the business rationale for why contractors are sending contract work out of the  United States. The bill then called for the Secretary of Defense  to recommend a plan  for  getting back as much of the off-shored work  as possible in future years. Unfortunately, that  program was significantly weakened when the  Senate version of last year’s authorization bill  failed to include the language, and the conference report only required the Department to  VerDate May 04 2004  04:36 May 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A20MY8.041 E21PT1 ",2004

165,,108,-0.267,216,2004-05-21,Mr. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker,  I recently had  the honor of working with the Architect of the  Capitol to replant on the east Capitol grounds  a pin oak memorializing  the  late U.S. Representative Joe Taggart of Kansas City, Kansas.  Representative  Joe Taggart was elected  three times to Congress from a House district  including Kansas City, Kansas—in a 1911  special election, and then in regular elections  in 1912 and 1914. Born in rural Iowa in 1867,  Joe Taggart moved to Kansas during his childhood and graduated from Salina Normal University in 1890; after teaching school for two  years in Bavaria, Kansas, he was admitted to  the practice of law in 1893 in Salina, moving  shortly  thereafter  to Kansas City. Taggart  served as Kansas City’s prosecuting attorney  from 1907–1911, when he was elected as a  Democrat  to  fill  the vacancy caused by  the  death of Alexander Mitchell. Twice re-elected,  he was defeated  in 1916. During  the First  World War, Taggart served  in  the quartermaster corps of the United States Army. After  the war, he resumed private  law practice  in  Kansas City and was appointed judge of the  Kansas Court of Industrial Relations in 1924.  Joe Taggart died  in Wadsworth, Kansas,  in  1938 and is buried in Atchison.  In  approximately  1916,  Representative  Taggart and his family planted a pin oak in his  honor on the east lawn of the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol has generously provided  me with several prints of photos of that event.  This tree survived, although in declining condition, until the area was leveled in order to construct the Capitol Visitors’ Center. The staff of  the Architect of  the Capitol,  led by Senior  Landscape Architect and Horticulturist Matthew Evans, recently planted here on the Capitol  grounds,  near  Independence  Avenue,  Southeast, a young pin oak to replace the earlier Taggart memorial tree. I also want to acknowledge the generous support of the Kansas Society of Washington, D.C.; thanks to the  support  of  the Society’s  current  president  Heather Wingate and past presidents David  Kensinger and Alan Sobba, the Kansas Society donated the cost of the new tree.  The replanting of the Joseph Taggart memorial tree serves as a small reminder of the  state of Kansas on the grounds of our U.S.  Capitol and I am pleased to have been a part  of this event.  f  IN  HONOR  OF  HIGH  SCHOOL  BALL TEAM  SAINT  BOYS’  ANTHONY  BASKETHON.

166,,108,-0.362,216,2004-05-21,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to call the attention of the Congress and the  nation to a story of excellence so rare that it  deserves the attention of all who believe the  human spirit  is capable of overcoming even  the greatest of odds.  This story is being written at Saint Anthony  High School, a small school in downtown Jersey City whose motto is ‘‘to be all that you can  be.’’ While neither the school nor its students  possess great  financial  resources,  they are  both blessed with the heart of champions.  The latest chapter of this story culminated  when  the Saint Anthony High School boys’  basketball team won this year’s New Jersey  state championship with a stunning 67–55 win  over Bloomfield Tech  to cap a  remarkable  undefeated (30–0) season. With  this victory,  Saint Anthony High School  tied a national  record by winning its 24th state championship.  The  team’s  legendary coach, Bob Hurley,  has now produced an undefeated  team  in  each of his four decades of coaching (1974,  1989, 1996, 2004).  Since Saint Anthony High School does not  have a gym,  the boys’ basketball  team has  been  forced  to practice at a  rented  facility.  Nevertheless, in 32 years of coaching, Hurley  has  compiled  an  amazing  826–92  record  against high-caliber competition—winning an  incredible 90 percent of his games.  Hurley has coached dozens of players who  went on to become NCAA All-Americans and  NBA stars. More  importantly, he has  taken  thousands of boys and turned them into champions, both on and off the court. In 32 years,  all but one of his players went to college.  Coach Hurley has gone on record about this  undefeated 2004 team—calling them the best  defensive team he’s ever coached. That, I assure you Mr. Speaker, is saying something.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Coach Bob Hurley and  the State  Champion 2004 Saint Anthony High School  boys’ basketball  team  in recognition of  their  commitment to excellence both on and off the  court and for their continuing inspiration to us  all.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

He helped to create  the House Select Committee on Hunger, and  was a founding member of the steering committee of the Congressional Friends of Human  Rights Monitors.  The Center  for Public Justice  is a distinguished nationwide civic organization striving  to better the world through the active involvement of its citizens in the service of God. The  Center  for Public Justice’s goal  is  the advancement of justice for all people in the community.

169,,108,0.247,223,2004-05-21,Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico.," Mr. Speaker,  today I commend the great athletic achievements of some of my constituents. This past  March,  the University of New Mexico’s Ski  Team became the first UNM team to ever win  any NCAA championship.  They are all to be congratulated, but there  are few people in particular that I would like to  especially recognize. Firstly the team’s coach,  George Brooks. Mr. Brooks created  the ski  team at UNM and has been working with them  since 1970. This landmark win can be attributed to Mr. Brook’s hard work and great faith  in the ability of his team.  A special recognition  is due  to  the senior  team captain, Jennifer Delch. Her leadership  throughout  the season as well as her  individual gold medal, which she received for the  giant slalom, greatly contributed to the team’s  success.  The team is furthermore to be congratulated  as a whole. Most of its members came from  other nations to ski for the UNM team. It was  their willingness to take a risk in leaving their  homelands that lead to both their personal victories and to the team’s NCAA win.  Not only have these UNM students excelled  in athletics, but have also remembered academics.  In  fact,  the entire  team’s average  GPA is an A¥. This is a great achievement  and speaks very well of the over-all ability of  those who are on the team.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you join me and all the  residents of New Mexico in honoring the UNM  ski team on their success. I would also like to  wish them luck in future seasons.  f  IN HONOR OF SUSAN T.

Kennedy, who passed away on April 17, 2004.  Susie was a great woman and an exceptional  public servant. We will miss her terribly.  Susie’s life was one of service and political  and community activism. Beginning with her  work with the Service Employees Union, Susie  was a tireless advocate of labor. At the age of  21, she was elected  to  the San Francisco  Democratic County Central Committee—the  youngest ever to serve—and was reelected for  the next 25 years.  In 1962, Susie joined the staff of Democratic  Assemblyman Phillip Burton. Upon his election  to Congress, she became his Administrative  Assistant, supervising his District Office in San  Francisco. She was his trusted advisor, and  he depended on her great political  instincts,  judgment, and understanding of the people of  San Francisco.  Susie was absolutely committed to the constituents and elected officials she served. After  working for both Phil and Sala Burton for 25  years, she graciously and expertly helped with  my transition to Congress after I won a special  election in 1987 to succeed Sala Burton. I will  never forget her support and friendship. Susie  later  joined with  the Golden Gate National  Recreation Area to help create a lasting memorial to Congressman Phil Burton.  Susan Kennedy was a devoted wife, mother, sister, and friend. To her sons, Marc and  Frank, and to her sisters and brothers, Dolores, Bernie, Mary, Walter, Kathleen and Tom,  thank you for sharing your beloved Susie with  us. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of  her family at this sad time.  f  A  TRIBUTE  IN  HONOR  OF  2004  LEGRAND  SMITH  SCHOLARSHIP  WINNER, HEATHER  LUCEY,  OF  BLISSFIELD, MICHIGAN  HON.

173,,108,0.616,230,2004-05-21,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, many of  our immigration laws are no longer consistent  with our national security and other vital interests.  The diversity visa or visa lottery system is  one such example. The visa lottery was established by the Immigration Act of 1990 to offer  the opportunity of immigration to individuals in  countries  that had been sending  few  immigrants to the United States.  Usually, immigrant visas are issued to foreign nationals that have an existing connection with a family member lawfully residing in  the United States or with a U.S. employer.  These types of relationships help ensure that  immigrants entering the country have a stake  in continuing America’s success, and have the  advanced skills necessary to contribute to the  nation’s economy. However, under  the visa  lottery program, visas are awarded  to  immigrants at  random with no such safety precautions.  I have heard from immigrants who have legally come  to  the country, and  they believe  the visa lottery program is unfair to immigrants  who comply with the United States’ immigration laws. Also, the visa lottery program does  not prohibit illegal aliens from applying to receive a visa through the program.  The program has many flaws. A recent report released by  the Center  for  Immigration  Studies shows that it is commonplace for foreign nationals to apply for the lottery program  multiple times using different aliases and false  personal information.  I  support Congressman Goodlatte’s  bill,  H.R. 775, The Security and Fairness Enhancement for America Act, which would terminate the visa lottery. This piece of legislation is an important and positive step in immigration  reform and  it  is my hope  that  the  House considers it in the near future.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE GIRLS  SOFTBALL  TEAM  OF ALEXANDRIA HIGH SCHOOL  HON.

MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2004  ",2004
175,,108,-0.386,230,2004-05-21,Ms. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  mark  the 63rd anniversary of  the Battle of  Crete. Last year,  I  introduced H. Res. 244  which recognizes and appreciates the historical significance of the people of Crete during  World War II.  This  is a historic event with direct significance to the Allies’ victory of World War II. On  May 20, 1941,  thousands of German paratroopers and gliders began landing on Crete.  Both the Allies and Nazis wanted Crete because of its strategic location. At that time the  British controlled  the  island.  It was a very  strong point on the lifeline to India and protected both Palestine and Egypt.  The Nazi  invasion  force  included  the elite  German paratroopers and glider troops. Hitler  felt this was to be an easy victory, yet he is  quoted to have said shortly after the invasion,  ‘‘France fell in 8 days. Why is Crete free?’’  The invasion of Crete took 11 days. It resulted  in more  than 6,000 German  troopers  listed as killed, wounded or missing in action.  The losses to the elite 7th parachute division  were felt so hard by the German Military it signified  the end of  large-scale airborne operations.  This  valiant  fight by  the Cretan people  began in the first hour of the Nazi airborne invasion,  in contrast  to  the European underground movements that took a year or more  after being invaded to activate.  Young boys, old men and women displayed  breathtaking bravery in defending their Crete.  German soldiers never got used  to Cretan  women  fighting  them. They would  tear  the  dress from the shoulders of suspected women  to find bruises from the recoil of the rifle. The  penalty was death.  The Times (London) July 28, 1941, reported  that ‘‘five hundred Cretan women have been  deported to Germany for taking part in the defense of their native island.’’  Another surprise  for  the German soldiers  who invaded Crete was the heroic resistance  of the clergy. A priest leading his parishioners  into battle was not what the Germans anticipated.  At  Paleochora,  Father  Stylianos  Frantzeskis, hearing of the German airborne  invasion, rushed  to his church, sounded  the  bell, took his rifle and marched his volunteers  toward Maleme to write history.  This struggle became an example for all Europe to follow in defying German occupation  and aggression.  The price paid by the Cretans for their valiant resistance to Nazi forces was high. Thousands of civilians died  from  random executions,  starvation,  and  imprisonment. Entire  communities were burned and destroyed by  the Germans as a reprisal for the Cretan resistance movement. Yet this resistance lasted  for four years.  The battle of Crete was to change the final  outcome of World War II.

176,,108,0.703,237,2004-05-21,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Speaker,  the success of American companies is usually measured by market share, the strength of the balance sheet and the quality of goods and services that they produce. But many times, we  can also look to the quality of a company’s  employees to find the true secret to their success.  Nucor Steel-Texas, which  is  located  in  Jewett, Texas, in the Fifth Congressional District, is a major economic driver in Leon County and  the state of Texas. For almost 24  years, Lynda Minter has served Nucor Steel-  Texas  and will  soon  retire  as Controller.  Lynda’s colleagues have told me that Nucor  Steel-Texas’ success is inseparable from her  legacy of careful  financial management and  her superb  relations with employees, Nucor  leadership and with state and local community  leaders.  Lynda has been characterized by her co-  workers as a pillar of the mill’s success, and  those who know her best have testified that  her  kind manner,  deep  understanding  of  Nucor’s business and fair dealing have been  instrumental in Nucor Steel-Texas’ continued  growth and achievement. Her colleagues tell  me that Lynda has offered Nucor Steel-Texas  a steady hand, a keen intellect and a long-  term devotion to service for over two decades.  I want to take this opportunity to recognize  the contributions of Lynda Minter, and I want  to wish Lynda all the best as she embarks on  this new phase of her life.  f  NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS  WEEK  HON. JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2004  Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Mr. Speaker,  I rise to recognize the Small Business Administration, its employees all over the nation and  its resource partners during  ‘‘National Small  Business Week.’’  Mr. Speaker, small businesses play a vital  role  in our nation’s economy. Many people  have heard the phrase that small business is  ‘‘the engine of our nation’s economy,’’ and  perhaps no truer words have ever been used  to describe how important the entrepreneurial  spirit and dedication of the approximately 23  million small businesses are to the continued  health and welfare of America.  Small businesses represent 99.7 percent of  all employers, employ half of all private sector  employees, generate 60 to 80 percent of net  new jobs annually, and make up 97 percent of  all exporting firms.  American small businesses are extremely  diverse, and despite the current economic climate, some are thriving. In particular, female  participation in business ownership has been  climbing  in  recent years. Women now own  around 40 percent of all small businesses and  are growing at twice the rate of other small  firms.  In  fact,  the 9.1 million women-owned  small businesses in this country employ 27.5  million people and add $3.6  trillion  to  the  economy.  About 5.8 percent of small businesses are  owned by Hispanic Americans, 4.4 percent by  Asian Americans, and 4 percent by African  Americans.  As  the Ranking Member  of  the  Subcommittee on Tax, Finance and Exports,  I  have long been an advocate for a level playing field for small businesses.  I  have  introduced  legislation, HR  2374,  which would allow minority small business  owners participating in the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) minority  contracting program into teaming, leader-follow arrangements  and joint ventures.  I have also authored legislation, HR 2375,  that would change  the  IRS Code  to allow  small business owners to offer their employees greater savings opportunities under SIMPLE (Savings  Incentive Match Plan  for Employees) IRAs.  Finally, I have introduced HR 3099, legislation that would give the SBA authority to make  loans to nonprofit day-care centers. This bipartisan measure helps not only non-profit small  businesses,  but  gives  parents  a  viable  daycare option as they work during the day.  Mr. Speaker, small businesses are indeed  the  engine  that makes  our  economy  run  smoothly, and I urge all my colleagues to take  a moment this week and reflect on the hard  work of our nation’s entrepreneurs, the financial and regulatory hurdles they face everyday,  and the measures I have proposed to make  the full-time job of running a small business  easier.  f  HONORING GUAM’S MANAMKO’  DURING SENIOR CITIZENS MONTH  HON.

177,,108,-0.297,237,2004-05-21,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  celebration  of  the  centenary  of  Haddon  Heights, New Jersey. My family and I are privileged to live in Haddon Heights, a small town  located  in southern New Jersey  just outside  Camden and 7 short miles  from downtown  Philadelphia. While its proximity to one of the  largest and most vibrant metropolitan centers  in the country makes Haddon Heights a culturally diverse and enriched community,  the  town is also a world removed from the bustle  of the city, reflecting values and a sense of  community characteristic of small towns far removed from our urban centers.  Haddon Heights was  first settled  in 1699  when John Hinchman built a one-room brick  house. However, the borough was developed  primarily as farmland, divided between crops  and orchards for nearly 200 years. The borough was named Haddon Heights because of  its proximity to Haddonfield and its high elevation.  During  the  late  1890s,  the  town’s  first  homes, church,  rail station, and a general  store were constructed, and by 1904, Haddon  Heights had become  large enough  to  incorporate as a borough. The  town’s  residents  elected Benjamin A. Lippincott as the town’s  first mayor.  Viewed as a resort town because of a direct  rail connection to Philadelphia, its proximity to  the lake, and the warmth and friendliness of  its small town atmosphere, the population of  Haddon Heights swelled during  the summer  months as vacationers escaped the cities. The  rail station served as the hub of the town, and  a  small downtown began  to emerge  surrounding the railroad that brought the town’s  visitors.  Rail passenger service ended in 1965, but  Haddon Heights retains to this day a character  reflective of its roots as a rail town at the turn  of  the 20th century. Haddon Heights has a  proud, rich heritage, which we continue to embrace and celebrate as we look to our shared  future. I feel privileged to be a part of the Haddon Heights community, and I can think of no  better place today, to raise a family or to be  a child growing up. So in celebration of the  past 100 years, and  in anticipation of  the  many great things to come from our town in  the next 100 years, please join me in honoring  Haddon Heights, New Jersey, on the celebration of its centenary.

179,House,108,-0.268,8,2004-06-01,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  House Concurrent Resolution 417, introduced by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. PORTER). This resolution recognizes and honors the Tuskegee Airmen  for their contribution  in World  War II that led to the creation of an integrated United States Air Force.  The Tuskegee Airmen not only faced  the dangers of war but they did so in  the face of prejudice and discrimination back home. Prior to 1940, African  Americans were denied the opportunity  to fly military aircraft. However, after  pressure from civil rights organizations  and others, the Army Air Force began  a program to train African Americans  as  military  pilots.  The  so-called  ‘‘Tuskegee Experiment’’ began on July  19, 1941, at the Tuskegee Institute in  Alabama. The  institute,  founded by  Booker T. Washington in 1881, provided  the primary flight training for the first  fighter pilots and became the center of  African  American  aviation  during  World War II.  The Tuskegee Airmen included not  only fighter pilots but also navigators,  bombardiers, maintenance and support  personnel that provided support for the  famed 99th Fighter Squadron and the  332nd Fighter Group.  I think of one of my constituents,  Mr. Milton Crenshaw from Arkansas,  who was one of the pilot instructors. In  1939, he took a bus from Little Rock to  Tuskegee, a young, African American  man seeking a career in car engineering at the Tuskegee Institute only to  be drawn into the excitement of flight.  He became one of  the  few African  American pilot instructors in America  and taught numerous Tuskegee Airmen  of the 99th Fighter Wing how to fly.  The 99th Fighter Squadron, led by the  late General Ben Davis, was originally  sent to North Africa but moved to the  European  continent  and  flew  over  Anzio in 1944. The 99th held the record  of 200 combat missions without losing a  single bomber to enemy fire.  The men and women who were part of  the Tuskegee experience proved that  service, duty, and country were not  limited by the color of a person’s skin,  but that all Americans regardless of  race could succeed through hard work,  dedication,  and  commitment. While  their training occurred under a segregated condition, their focus was on  the goal of all pilots regardless of race:  avoidance of abrupt and surprising contact with Mother Earth.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
180,House,108,0.335,8,2004-06-01,Mr. COLE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for  me to request consideration of H. Con.  Res. 417 because this resolution honors  a remarkable group of African Americans who played a pivotal role in the  military history of our country. They  are not the only segregated unit to do  so, of course. The 54th Massachusetts  during the Civil War, the 9th and 10th  Buffalo Calvary, which were honored  with  the name Buffalo Soldiers by  their native American adversaries in  the latter part of the 19th century, a  group which constructed Fort Sill in  my own district and won lasting fame  there. And of course more recently, the  761st Tank Battalion whose exploits  have been chronicled in a fine volume  by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  But today, we are here to honor the  Tuskegee Airmen who with their professionalism, their skill, and courage  not only made an important contribution to  fighting tyranny during the  Second World War but also helped to  forge the United States Air Force into  the world’s dominant air and space  team.  On July 19, 1941, the Army Air Force  began a program in Alabama at the  Tuskegee  Institute  to  train African  Americans as military pilots. The primary flight training was conducted by  the Division of Aeronautics at the institute  founded by Booker T. Washington, and the transition to combat  aircraft  was  conducted  at  nearby  Tuskegee Army Airfield.  The first group of pilots completed  training 9 months later in March 1942.  Among that vanguard group was then-  Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., a future living legend in the Air Force who  went on to become one of its greatest  leaders. In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999, the  Congress authorized the President to  advance Lieutenant General Davis to  the grade of General on the retired list  of the United States Air Force.  That initial group of Tuskegee pilots  was assigned to the famous 99th Fighter Squadron, which was eventually deployed on May 31, 1943, to  fly P–40  Warhawks in combat missions in North  Africa, Sicily, and throughout Italy.  Later Tuskegee  graduates were  assigned to the 332nd Fighter Group and  began overseas combat operations in  Italy  flying  the  P–40  and  P–39  Airacobra.  Before the war ended, the Tuskegee  program had graduated 992 pilots and  450 Tuskegee Airmen had flown over  15,000  combat  sorties  overseas. Approximately 150 men had been killed  over the course of the program, with 66  killed in action. The combat record of  these  segregated  units was  superb.  They destroyed or damaged 136 enemy  aircraft in air-to-air combat and another 273 on the ground. They were  highly decorated with over 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses being awarded  to African American pilots.  The most impressive achievement of  the 332nd Fighter Group was  flying  over 200 bomber escort missions over  Central and Southern Europe without  losing a single bomber to enemy aircraft. This unprecedented record was  not lost on enemy fighter pilots who  often elected to avoid attacking bomber formations when they realized that  the  fighter escort was the Red Tail  fighters of the 332nd.  The  challenges  confronted by  the  Tuskegee Airmen were not limited to  the wartime skies over Europe. Each of  these men proudly met all challenges  with skill and determination when racism and bigotry had caused lesser men  to harass them and to seek their failure. There are a number of ways for  men to display courage in their lives,  but seldom are men confronted with as  many  tests of courage as were  the  Tuskegee Airmen; and very few men  can claim as successful and enduring a  legacy as they.  These combat pioneers distinguished  themselves throughout their service in  war and peace and over time redefined  America’s  understanding  of African  Americans as warriors and leaders and  set the stage for the racially integrated  Air Force that achieved so much in the  years to follow.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. PORTER) for  introducing this resolution. I feel very  fortunate to have had the opportunity  to address the House on this issue and  recognize  the  contributions  of  Tuskegee Airmen to America.

184,House,108,-0.514,22,2004-06-01,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the National Great Black Americans Commemoration Act, an  important measure put  forth by Hon. ELIJAHCUMMINGSwhich gives  long overdue commemoration  to  the many  Black Americans who have served honorably  in this Nation.  By expanding the Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland, to establish the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum  and Justice Learning Center, Congress is acknowledging the monumental contributions of  African Americans who have served  in  the  Senate and House of Representatives; the judiciary and the field of law; various military engagements, including the Buffalo Soldiers and  Tuskegee Airmen; senior executive branch positions;  and  numerous  other  occupations  which have advanced the goals and causes of  the United States over the more than 400 year  history of people of African descent in America. The museum, which is currently visited by  more than 300,000 people annually, will employ the most skilled artisans in the wax medium  to  accurately  and  honorably  portray  those Black Americans who, with ability and  perseverance, have worked tirelessly for justice, equal rights, peace, and rule of law in our  great Nation.  The National Great Black Americans Commemoration Act is certainly worthy of support  by this body, particularly as it is a key complement  to  the National Museum of African  American History  and Culture Act,  championed by Hon. JOHNLEWISand signed into  law December 16, 2003. However, these gestures are but first steps in the directions of endowing esteemed Black Americans with  the  veneration that they deserve. More efforts like  this Act are needed if proper homage is to be  paid to those great Black pioneers who truly  laid the foundation upon which this Nation has  been built.  ",2004
185,House,108,0.122,36,2004-06-01,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise with pride and pleasure  to recognize this June 1 as the first  time  in history that the seniors of  America have had the opportunity to  purchase a Medicare drug discount card  as the first step, but only the first step,  in reducing the cost of their prescription drugs.  My colleagues have heard a lot here  tonight. We have heard  some very  sharp things from the speaker who just  preceded me. But listen to this: this is  a widow in my hometown of New Britain who takes Zithromax; and because  of this discount card at a local pharmacy in New Britain, instead of paying  $46.50 for her Zithromax, she will now  pay $39.44. She takes Nystatin. Instead  of paying $35 for Nystatin, she will now  pay $15 for Nystatin. And so it goes.  One of the other drugs she takes costs  $40 and now will cost $11.50.  Mr. Speaker, this widow for whom  every dollar is precious will save $730  on her prescription drugs every year,  including this year. Now, that may not  be a lot to my colleagues, but for someone spending $2,000 on drugs a year, a  little over $2,000 on drugs a year, that  is a lot. That is 29 percent, almost 30  percent, of her drug costs.  So this is a good day for seniors, and  I and my colleagues are going to talk  about a lot of the things we have been  told  tonight about  this prescription  drug program. But we are here to say,  you be the judge. We are here to say,  do not let nay-sayers, do not let others  rob you of the hundreds of dollars of  savings on the prescription drugs on  which your health and well-being depend. You be the judge. You find out  the facts. You be the judge. It is real  simple.  But to start off tonight, let me turn  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. ENGLISH), a very good friend of  mine on the Committee on Ways and  Means.  ",2004
186,House,108,0.251,36,2004-06-01,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the gentlewoman. I want to  rise today not only to mark this historic day for Medicare beneficiaries because today, for the first time since the  program’s inception, Medicare, through  a discount card, will be providing real  relief to seniors who struggle to pay for  their prescription medicines.  I want to acknowledge that, but I  also want to especially acknowledge  the  efforts  of  the  gentlewoman  as  chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on  Health for making this legislation possible. I am very proud to have been  part of the team that helped put this  legislation together and see it through  to the end; and I am also glad to be on  the floor tonight, having heard some of  the extraordinary claims from a number of Members who consistently voted  against prescription drug benefits for  seniors. They are now trying to run  down  the program  that we put  together, we fit into a budget, and we got  passed in the House. The record shows  that they did not offer a credible alternative, they did not offer a budget that  they could fit it into, and they were  talking a lot about seniors, but not delivering.  The discount card program that was  created under the Medicare reform bill  that we passed will also ultimately create a prescription drug program that  will be available by  2006  for every  Medicare  beneficiary. But what we  have done, which is so important, is  offer an  interim program to provide  immediate relief for seniors. Because I  know, as the gentlewoman found in her  district in Connecticut, in my district  in Pennsylvania, what seniors wanted  was some help that would be available  quickly. And when I brought the head  of CMS into my district for a town  meeting and he said it would take a  couple of years to ramp up a prescription drug program, they made it very  clear, that group of seniors in Mercer  County, Pennsylvania, they wanted to  see  something quicker, and  that  is  what we have been able to do.  These discount cards are meant to  provide a transitional program, especially for the approximately 10 million  Medicare beneficiaries who have no  drug coverage. Seniors have been enrolling in the numerous discount cards  in their area since May 3; and today,  many seniors will begin to enjoy savings on their medicines. CMS, the Center For Medicare and Medicaid Services which administers the Medicare  program, estimates that seniors will  save between $3.8 billion and $5.1 billion over the 2-year duration of the  program. This is a substantial amount  of money.  For an annual enrollment fee of no  more than $30, seniors will enjoy savings on drugs of up to 30 to 60 percent  on generic drugs, 16 to 30 percent or  more on usual retail prices, and 11.5 to  17 percent off average retail prices with  significantly larger discounts available  on mail order drugs. This is in real contrast with the message we have heard  from some of the critics. These are real  savings.  Even better, beneficiaries can choose  the card that gets them the  lowest  prices; and if they wish, they can also  get help finding low or no-fee cards,  cards that  include specific neighborhood pharmacies and/or cards from specific sponsors. But the important thing  is,  this  drug  card,  I  think  appropriately, provides additional assistance  to low-income seniors through a direct  subsidy. This is a big benefit to seniors  in my district.  Today, seniors with  limited means  are eligible  for a $600 annual credit  that goes a long way toward paying for  their medication. In my home State of  Pennsylvania, we have had a great program for low-income seniors called the  PACE program, which provides a prescription drug benefit for low-income  seniors who do not otherwise have such  a benefit. This has been, I think, the  hallmark of Pennsylvania State government  for many years and an extraordinary success for those who are  eligible.  With this new Medicare legislation,  the $600 credit will go directly to PACE  and allow them to automatically enroll  about 150,000 low-income seniors, lower  PACE’s costs, and allow PACE to waive  some $6 co-pays which low-income seniors would otherwise have had to pay  to get their medicines.  PACE beneficiaries will continue to  use the card PACE issues them to receive the benefits of the new program,  and seniors enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan like Security Blue in my  district will receive a drug discount  card from that plan.  Other eligible Pennsylvania seniors  can choose between 43 drug cards to  find the benefit that is best for them.  And as  I think the gentlewoman  is  about to point out, they have one number that they can call to get the information that they need.  Mr. Speaker, signing up for the drug  discount card and getting information  on the plans offered in their area could  not be easier. Seniors who want help in  selecting  a  card  should  call  1–800–  MEDICARE or visit the Medicare Web  site at www.medicare.gov; and there it  is, right there. There are 3,000 customer service representatives available  24 hours a day, 7 days a week to answer  these questions. To enroll  in a particular card, beneficiaries should contact that card and receive an application. There is a standard enrollment  form that will be accepted by all cards.  Mr. Speaker, what is interesting to  me is some politicians and special interest groups with their own narrow  agendas have run down the prescription drug benefit as ineffective.

She has served the Commerce Committee for 5 years, and all of us will  miss her presence. We all wish her the  best in her new position and know that  she will serve with honor and integrity.  I ask unanimous consent that the following statements that are part of the  hearing record on her nomination be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  STATEMENTOFSENATORERNESTHOLLINGSON  THENOMINATIONOFDEBBIEHERSMAN  Mr. Chairman, I know Senator Hutchison  would agree that the most important character a member of the National Transportation Safety Board can have is independent  thinking. I don’t want someone going to an  accident, mind already made up, sharp elbows telling everybody what they are supposed to find, and everything like that.  What I want is someone who can look at  all sides of the issue. Someone who can challenge people to make the right decisions.  Someone who can manage the non-partisan  professionals doing the work. And someone,  who at the end of the day, will give a fair  and unvarnished response on what happened.  I pick NTSB members like George Bush  picks vice presidents. You can search the  country, far and wide, but the best of the  best in transportation safety, is right here in  the  room,  everyday  with  us,  Debbie  Hersman.  She has worked for the committee for almost 5 years. I’ve had her focus on rail, because of the tremendous needs we have to  modernize Amtrak and  improve passenger  and safety issues.  But she also has taken on oversight of  truck and bus safety, pipeline safety, hazardous materials transportation safety. And  post 9–11, I’ve asked her to oversee transportation security issues, insofar as air, rail,  ports, and trucking. In other words, she is  well-rounded in all aspects of transportation.  Her experience belies her youthful appearance.  Prior to joining our staff, Debbie was the  staff director for Congressman Bob Wise of  West Virginia, who served on key transportation and infrastructure committees. She  holds a bachelor’s degree from Virginia Tech  and a master’s degree from George Mason.  We still have much work to do on this  committee on transportation issues, and I  hate to lose my right arm. She is as hard a  worker, as smart as any, as competent a professional as any Senator could ask for. But I  know the country is better off, if Debbie is at  NTSB, and I proudly endorse her nomination.  ",2004

For his Eagle  Scout project, James organized a project  to  teach tree pruning techniques to other Scouts  and  Leaders  and  then  pruned  the  trees  around the four mile walking trail in Kearney,  Missouri.  James will be serving the United States of  America by enlisting in the Marine Corps and  will be leaving by the end of this month for his  induction.

211,House,108,0.547,3,2004-06-14,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, thanks to President Bush’s  historic  tax  relief, our  economy  is  surging and 1.4 million jobs have been  created since August. However, if we do  not act, one of the hardest and most  unjust  penalties  on Americans,  the  death tax, will return in full force in  2011.  The death tax essentially is a double  tax that forces families to pay taxes on  estates that are passed on from generation to generation. According to Citizens For a Sound Economy, nearly 70  percent of  small businesses do not  make it past the first generation because of this tax. Additionally, American  Farm  Bureau  President  Bob  Stallman has pointed out that many of  our Nation’s farmers must sell parts or  all of their land to simply pay taxes.  This is also catastrophic for family-  owned auto dealerships, funeral homes,  and beverage distributors.  The American people know it is fundamentally wrong to be taxed twice  and know the importance of passing  something of value on to their own  children. I urge Congress to act quickly  and kill the death tax once and for all.  In conclusion, may God bless our  troops, and we will never forget September 11.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2004

214,House,108,-0.365,24,2004-06-14,Mr. LARSEN of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.  Mr.  Speaker,  the Department  of  Homeland Security has understandably  operated without a consolidated headquarters since its inception. The bill  before us will convey property from the  Navy to the GSA to help consolidate  headquarters for the Department.  Given the critical nature of the Department’s mission, we must  allow  Secretary Ridge to operate the Department as efficiently as possible. This  bill is a significant step in the growth  of this new agency; and that is why the  Committee on Armed Services, in a bipartisan way, supports relocating the  Navy from its Nebraska Avenue Complex in northwest Washington, D.C., to  accommodate  the  Department  of  Homeland Security.  We should be under no illusion, however, that the headquarters provided  under this bill is a permanent or ideal  solution. In fact, some have even questioned whether this is truly a headquarters at all. We are consolidating  some of the leadership elements of the  departments on one site, but workers  will still be spread among more than a  dozen buildings. It is not yet clear that  the site can fully accommodate the Department’s headquarters,  in part because the Department is still evolving  and is itself a patchwork of agencies.  Several of the Department’s key agencies  will maintain  separate  headquarters  elsewhere.  These  concerns  have led some in Congress to question  whether we should even designate the  Nebraska Avenue Complex as the headquarters of the Department at all.

216,House,108,0.382,31,2004-06-14,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Tampa Bay Lighting for winning  the 2004 Stanley Cup.  The Lighting is a remarkable success story.  Many people, including me, wondered whether  this expansion  team could compete against  traditional hockey powerhouses when  they  joined the league 12 years ago. We wondered  whether a sport played primarily  in Canada  and  the northern-most  regions of America  could survive in an area where sand and sun  are  the  two  top attractions. We wondered  whether  the  community would embrace a  team dominated by foreign players playing a  sport with rules unfamiliar to many of us.  The answer  to  these questions  is a  resounding yes. The Lighting has shown what  can be accomplished when you combine skill  with  hard  work,  determination,  and  an  unyielding will  to win. Tampa Bay won  the  Eastern Conference championship  this year,  posting a stellar 46–22–8–6 record along the  way. Then  they defeated perennial hockey  powers New York Islanders, Montreal Canadians, and Philadelphia Flyers  to  reach  the  Stanley Cup finals.  The  Lightning  then  endured  a  grueling  seven game final against a talented Calgary  team which used its physical-style of play to  batter and bruise the boys from Tampa Bay.  Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin posted one strong  game in goal after another. The under-sized  but over-achieving Right Winger, Martin St.  Louis—once a Flame—rifled shot after shot by  and around Calgary defenders. His  remarkable season ended with being named league  MVP. Center Vincent Lecavalier played with a  toughness which inspired his teammates, as  did Left Winger Ruslan Fedotenko, who despite being slammed head-first into the boards  in game five, returned to score both of Tampa  Bay’s goals in game seven.  I want to congratulate Tampa Bay’s coach,  John Tortorella, for devising a winning strategy  and keeping his charges together during the  season’s many  tough  times.  I also want  to  commend Brad Richards, winner of the Conn  Smythe Trophy  for  finals MVP, and Dave  Andreychuk,  the  team’s captain, who  finally  hoisted the Cup after an exemplary 22 year  career.  I am proud that Tampa Bay’s players won  with class and its fans celebrated with sportsmanship. The Lightning refused to engage in  the thuggery and cheap shots which contributed to Calgary’s demise. Their fans showed  that you can celebrate victory and  revel  in  championship without the rioting, looting, and  lawlessness in which fans in other so-called  big-time sports cities engage. Let there be no  doubt; Tampa  is a big-time sports city, one  whose teams and fans set a standard which  others would do well to follow.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the  hard-working men and women of the Tampa  Bay area in Congress. I am especially gratified  that two of its professional sports teams, the  Buccaneers  and  now  the  Lightning,  have  reached the pinnacle of their professions and  shown  the spirit, determination, and sportsmanship that have come to exemplify Tampa  Bay, or as others should call  it, Titletown.  I  commend the Lightning on winning the 2004  Stanley Cup and for capturing the imagination  and hearts of a city along  the way.  I wish  them well in next season’s title defense.  Ms. GINNY BROWN–WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise  the  Tampa  Bay  Lightning  hockey  team, coaches and staff as 2003–2004  champions  of  the National Hockey  League.  One week ago  today,  the  ‘‘Ning’’  skated to a game seven victory and  won the coveted, 112-year-old championship trophy: ‘‘Lord Stanley’s Cup.’’  I’d also  like to recognize the outstanding, devoted fans of the Tampa  Bay area.  This year’s team showed the spirit,  work ethic, tenacity and sportsmanship that is illustrative of the Central  Florida community they live in.  The players, coaches and staff not  only provide  the  fans with a great  sense of community by uniting them  and providing entertainment, many of  them give back to the community by  volunteering in schools, hospitals and  other community centers.  On behalf of the thousands of loyal  Lightning fans I represent in the suburbs north of Tampa, I am delighted to  recognize the Tampa Bay Lightning for  winning the Stanley Cup last week.  ",2004

Res.  643  introduced by  the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CANNON), a resolution congratulating Brigham Young  University for winning the Division I-II  volleyball national championship.  The regular season and the championship tournament truly gave BYU  an exciting run to the national championship. I want to extend my hardy  congratulations to the head coach Tom  Peterson and all of the BYU athletes.  BYU won a school record 21 consecutive matches during the regular season  showcasing  their  true  championship  spirit.

As you may know, Brigham Young University is located in the 3rd district of Utah, and  it has been my pleasure to represent the University and  its student body  for  the past 8  years. This is the third national championship  in men’s volleyball  that BYU has won  in 6  years by overcoming a 10–6 deficit in game 5  to defeat Long Beach State University.  The team achieved a 29–4 overall record for  the season, marking the second highest single  season win  total  in BYU volleyball history.

222,House,108,-0.379,45,2004-06-14,Mr. HOYER.," Madam Speaker,  technology  has become tremendously important in everyone’s daily  lives, but  there are perhaps  few  places where technology plays as important a  role in an individual’s daily life than for individuals with disabilities.  That is why I am pleased to be a cosponsor  and strong supporter of the Improving Access  to Assistive Technology  for  Individuals with  Disabilities Act of 2004, considered  in  the  House of Representatives today.  Assistive  technology devices and adaptations are critical  to ensuring  that  individuals  with disabilities can  live with  independence  and pursue work, education, communication  and other aspects of daily living.  Since the Assistive Technology Act was enacted  in  1998,  assistive  technology  state  grants have provided funds to states to start-  up and establish systems for distributing assistive  technology  devices  and  services.  States have since made significant progress in  building and  improving  these systems. The  Maryland Technology Assistance Program, for  example, provides a low-interest loan program  to help people gain access to and afford critical technologies.  The  previous  authorization  originally  included a sunset provision  to phase out  the  state assistance grants. However, as  it has  become clear that technology was increasingly  important and that this program provided crucial assistance, support has grown  to make  this program permanent.  I am pleased  that over  the past several  years, we have been able to include language  in the Labor-HHS-Education bill to waive the  sunset provision and adequate  funding, so  that states would not have to eliminate their  programs.  With  this  important reauthorization bill, we  will no longer have to include this language on  an annual basis, and individuals with disabilities can be confident  that  this program will  continue to provide states with needed assistance.  I am also pleased  that  this bill has been  written  to  revise  the program with greater  focus on providing direct benefits to individuals  with disabilities.  I hope all of my colleagues will support this  bipartisan legislation.  ",2004

At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman  from West  Virginia  (Mrs.  CAPITO), one of the great pro-growth  leaders in the Congress, somebody who  has made a real difference  for West  Virginia.

224,House,108,-0.521,73,2004-06-14,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, it  is so wonderful to be on the floor of the  House again with my colleagues as we  talk about the issues that are impacting our State. Right now in the Committee on Ways and Means we are  marking up FSC–ETI bill, which has to  do with giving corporations who take  jobs over to foreign countries greater  tax benefits.  Since I am the only Democratic Ohio  member on the Committee on Ways  and Means, I want to get back over  there, because I have a piece of legislation where I am offering an amendment  that if the tax provisions provide benefits  for manufacturing workers who  lost their jobs, we ought to be able to  provide benefits to service workers who  lost their jobs, because in Ohio it appears we have lost some 133,000 service  worker jobs since this administration  took over.  I rise with my colleagues as a supporter, a voice for the middle-class and  a voice for the lower-class people in our  country who make up the backbone of  our  country,  those Americans who  since George Bush took office are finding themselves overlooked, under-appreciated and kicked to the curb.  I could go on with my statement, but  what I am going to do is submit my  statement  for the record, because  I  know Ohio is in good hands with the  three of you on the floor of the House  to talk about what is going on in Ohio.  I need to go back over to the Committee on Ways and Means and make  sure the voice of Ohio workers is heard  in that hearing. If we get done before  the hour is up, I will be back to engage  in a conversation with each and every  one of you.  You know if unemployment is high in  the majority communities in Ohio, in  the minority communities it is even  higher. I just got some statistics saying in the City of East Cleveland, the  unemployment rate is 12.7 percent, 12.7  percent. We need to be a loud voice on  behalf of the workers of Ohio.  Let me say to my colleagues here,  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. BROWN),  I have been calling him ‘‘senior.’’ He  does not like to be called senior colleague, but my colleague with greater  seniority than me, and my colleague  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STRICKLAND), with greater seniority than me.  At least I am more senior to somebody,  my colleague with less seniority than  me,  the gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr.  RYAN). Keep it up, brothers. I am glad  to be here with you.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a voice for the  middle class. Those Americans who make up  the working class, the backbone of this country. Those Americans, who since President  Bush took office are finding themselves overlooked, underappreciated and kicked  to  the  curb.  My home state of Ohio, has seen the worst  of  this economy. Since President Bush  took  office the state of Ohio has lost 214,500 jobs.  Of those lost jobs, 167,800 of them were manufacturing  jobs; 1,300 of  those  lost  just  recently in April.  My colleagues across the aisle would argue  that the economy is improving; however, the  Republicans have much to do to erase the job  deficit that they have created through their tax  cuts for the wealthy.  The growing industry that the Republicans  have been talking about is significantly weaker  than the shrinking industry. In Ohio there is a  ¥29 percent wage differences between industries gaining  jobs and  the  industries  losing  jobs. Additionally,  the health  insurance coverage for the growing industries is only 53.1  percent  compared  to 70.2 percent of  the  shrinking industries—a difference of 17.1 percent.  The economic outlook  is even worse  for  many living in my district. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Ohio Dept. of  Job and Family Services, the unemployment  rate in Cuyahoga County is at 6.5 percent with  over 43,500 workers unemployed. The cities  of Cleveland and East Cleveland have been  hit the hardest with Cleveland’s unemployment  rate at 12.2 percent with 25,000 unemployed  workers and East Cleveland with a 14 percent  unemployment rate and 2,346 workers unemployed.  This economy has had a disproportionate  affect on minorities in this country, particularly  African Americans. According  to  the U.S.  Courts, Administrative Office’s Bankruptcy Statistics, 1,625,208 households  filed  for bankruptcy  in 2003, a 33 percent  increase  from  2000. That  is nearly 1 bankruptcy every 19  seconds.  For minorities the statistics are even worse.  According  to an article by Elizabeth Warren  and Amelia Warren Tyagi, entitled the Two Income Trap, 2003, African Americans and Hispanics are much more likely to go bankrupt.  Hispanic homeowners are nearly three times  more likely than white homeowners to file for  bankruptcy, and black homeowners are nearly  six times more likely than white homeowners.  African Americans are also twice as likely to  lose  their homes due  to  foreclosures, often  falling victim to the unscrupulous practices of  predatory lenders.  Additionally, African Americans have higher  levels of debt. The  typical African American  families had debt of 30 percent of their assets,  while the debt of typical white families was 11  percent of their assets.  Homeownership and credit are not the only  place where the minorities of this country are  feeling the economic squeeze. It is affecting  their education where they are seeing an increase in tuition of $1,207 at 4-year public universities. It is affecting their health care, where  here in the United States the total family premium for health insurance has increased by  $2,630 to $9,068. Even child care costs have  increased by $2,050. A Census study showed  that African Americans and Hispanics spend  more on child care than whites. The average  black family spends 10.4 percent of household  income on childcare, and  the average Hispanic family spends 10.7 percent, compared  with 8.1 percent for white families. This along  with  skyrocketing  gas  prices  and  the  outsourcing of Americans  jobs, our middle  class citizenry is suffering.  It is time for us to provide real legislation  and initiative to strengthen middle class Americans. Democrats have a plan to jump-start our  economy  through  tax breaks  to encourage  businesses to keep jobs here in America, invest  in our small- and medium-sized businesses and work to secure universal access  to college and expand job training.  The American people deserve better  than  what they are receiving from this administration and we move  forward  to address  the  needs of the American people.  ",2004
225,Senate,108,0.338,129,2004-06-14,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  rise today in great sadness, to speak on  the passing of President Ronald Wilson  Reagan. It is a sad time for our Nation;  a monumental figure in the history of  the United States has gone to his rest.  The response to his passing in our Nation’s capital and across this country  has been overwhelming and a fitting  tribute to this giant of 20th century  politics.  First, I would like to offer my heartfelt  condolences  to Nancy and  the  Reagan family in this difficult time.  Mrs. Reagan was not only an incredible  role model  for  faithfulness  to  her  spouse, but was always the rock that  he  leaned on when the entire world  leaned on him.  In speeches on this floor, we have  heard much about President Reagan’s  vision and leadership on foreign and  economic policy, which  indeed  continue to bear fruit. Yet, I come to the  floor to speak about an aspect of the  Reagan Presidency that is less commented upon: President Reagan’s legacy on social policy, which stands still  as a moral compass for our Nation’s future.  As has  been  remarked, President  Reagan was a  fabulous optimist. He  worked to create a society where good  and evil, life and death, are recognized  for what they are, and are not obscured  by the gray tones of moral relativism.  After years of lingering malaise following Vietnam and Watergate, Ronald  Reagan came forward and proclaimed  that America was ‘‘in the midst of a  spiritual awakening and a moral renewal.’’ That was a message of hope  that America sorely needed to hear.  He believed that America’s strength  came not just from military might, but  also  from  its moral  superiority. As  much of a priority as he made foreign  and military policy, he strived just as  hard to ensure that our Nation’s roots  as a people of faith, who value life and  each other, was not diminished. It was  that social foundation that made us  different from the godless Soviet state  that oppressed the Russian people.  President Reagan  spoke  forcefully  and brilliantly about the importance of  family,  the  religious  foundations of  American democracy, and the tragedy  of Roe v. Wade. He knew that strong  families were a key to America’s continued success as the land of opportunity. This conviction is clear in a  proclamation he  issued one Father’s  Day, where he asserted:  There is no institution more vital to our  Nation’s survival than the American family.  Here the seeds of personal character are  planted, the roots of public virtue first nourished. Through  love and  instruction, discipline, guidance and example, we learn from  our mothers and fathers the values that will  shape our private lives and our public citizenship.  His  political  beliefs were  greatly  shaped by the sensible religion he grew  up with in small-town Illinois, which  permeated all aspects of daily life. He  found the attempts of some to excise  religion from the public square wrong-  headed. He knew that Founding Fathers barred not only the government  establishment of religion, but also any  law  ‘‘prohibiting  the  free  exercise  thereof.’’  As President Reagan told those gathered at the Ecumenical Prayer Breakfast during the Republican National  Convention in Dallas, TX:  Without God, there is no virtue, because  there’s no  prompting  of  the  conscience.  Without God, we’re mired in the material,  that flat world that tells us only what the  senses perceive. Without God, there  is a  coarsening of the society. And without God,  democracy will not and cannot long endure.  If we ever forget that we’re one nation under  God, then we will be a nation gone under.  I began  this  speech by  stating  I  would  focus  of President Reagan’s  moral and social legacy rather than on  the tremendous impact he had in bringing down the Iron Curtain and freeing  Eastern Europe. But in truth, these different areas of policy all flowed from  the same wellspring of faith and conscience.  In a particularly moving speech before  the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in 1984, President  Reagan tied together these seemingly  separate strands. He told listeners:  Our mission stretches far beyond our borders: God’s family knows no borders. In your  life, you face daily trials, but millions of believers in other lands face far worse. They  are mocked and persecuted for the crime of  loving God. To  every  religious dissident  trapped in that cold, cruel existence, we send  our love and support. Our message? You are  not alone; you are not forgotten; do not lose  your faith and hope because someday you,  too, will be free.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  that  a  larger  excerpt  of  this  speech be printed in the RECORD following my remarks.  ",2004
226,Senate,108,-0.199,143,2004-06-14,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I come to  the Chamber today to discuss a reality  of today’s world in Iraq and elsewhere  that I think has not received the appropriate attention. I am referring to  the thousands of men and women who  have been seriously wounded in recent  U.S. combat missions. The numbers  wounded in Iraq have soared in recent  weeks. Fatalities have risen likewise  to a total of 817 yesterday. Of the latest data I have been able to find, 5,015  military personnel have been injured in  Iraq, 2,049 have been able to return to  action within 72 hours, and 2,964 could  not, and many of these injured troops  will face months, if not years, of rehabilitation. Many of these troops will  suffer lifelong disabilities.  I am told Walter Reed Army Hospital  is close to being filled to capacity. I  have been to Walter Reed twice this  year, and while I talked with soldiers  who were wounded in the Iraqi theater,  I can tell you that coming face to face  with our soldiers in a hospital ward is  a sobering event. It makes you think  about the costs of war and the sacrifices  these men and women have  made for our Nation, for each of us.  Memorial Day has just passed, and I  have tried to think how best to recognize the sacrifices of our wounded service men and women. I am not sure that  I ever can appropriately and fully recognize their sacrifice, but I want to  try. That is why I introduce today the  Service Act for Care and Relief Initiatives for Forces Injured in Combat Engagement Act, or the SACRIFICE Act.  The SACRIFICE Act  addresses  the  I  commitment shown by our troops injured in combat and attempts to reciprocate in kind.  My bill does three things. First, it  would recognize the sacrifice of American military personnel killed and injured in combat and the heroic efforts  of our medical teams through a sense  of the Senate.  Second,  it would aim to ease the  stress of families who are attempting  to follow the whereabouts of a loved  one injured by combat by establishing  a tracking system  for wounded personnel being transported out of a combat zone.  Third, it would call for a $10 million  authorization  to modernize medical  combat  equipment,  treatment,  and  combat care triage for our medics in  their fight to save lives.  Let me  tell my colleagues how  came to write this bill.  Arkansas is a relatively small State  with a relatively high enrollment of  Arkansans serving our Nation in Active Duty and in the National Guard  and Reserve. In March of this year, we  said goodbye to 3,000 fellow Arkansans  who were deployed to Iraq as part of  the 39th Infantry Brigade of the first  Cavalry.  It was hard for me to witness separation of families as soldiers prepared for  year long war zone deployment. It has  been painful to receive news of the 8  Arkansans who have fallen since the  beginning of that deployment and the  additional 44 who have been seriously  injured and transported out of theater.  In honor of this sacrifice, the first  section of my bill is a sense of the Senate regarding the American military  personnel killed and injured in combat  and the heroic efforts of our medical  teams.  The second section of the bill, the  tracking portion, is an easy, no-cost  provision to ease emotional stress of  families whose loved ones have been  listed as seriously injured or very seriously injured and are being transported  out of theater.  As I mentioned before, 44 Arkansas  members of the 39th Infantry Brigade  have thus far been listed as seriously  injured or very seriously injured and  evacuated out of  theater. Although  Congress does not receive notification  of the wounded, I continuously receive  calls from families who are distraught  and worried because of failures in the  current family notification system.  The Defense Department has a computer tracking system that is designed  to help keep families of fallen soldiers  informed of their whereabouts, but the  system is not without glitches. For example, some  families who have contacted my office have been distraught  after hearing from military that they  are not exactly sure where the soldiers  were at the time. This has made it difficult for families to make plans to  travel  to  the hospitals where  their  loved one are being cared for.  Also, when a soldier is upgraded from  seriously injured or very seriously injured to not seriously injured, the Department of the Army closes out their  case in the computer tracking system,  making  it  particularly  difficult  for  families to keep track of their loved  ones. We can and should do more for  families of loved ones during such trying times.  I want to recognize SPC Henry Austin Phillips of Charlie Company of the  153rd  Infantry,  39th Brigade out of  DeQueen, AR.  For example, some families that have  contacted my office have been distraught after hearing from the military that they were not sure exactly  where the soldiers were at that time.  This has made it difficult for families  to make plans to travel to the hospital  where their loved ones are being cared  for.  Also, when a soldier is upgraded from  ‘‘seriously injured’’ or ‘‘very seriously  injured’’ to ‘‘not seriously inured,’’ the  Department of the Army closes out  their case  in the computer tracking  system, making  it particularly difficult  for  families to keep track of  their loved ones. We can—and should—  do more for the families of loved ones  during such trying times.  I want to recognize SPC Henry Austin Phillips of the Charlie Company, 1–  153d  Infantry,  39th Brigade  out  of  DeQueen, AR. He did a great job in the  field, and the communication problems  that ensued  following his  injury are  not a reflection of him or the military.  He was proud to serve his country,  and his State and country are proud of  him. I know that if he could return, he  would.  As I understand it, this is the situation that Pam Phillips endured when  her husband was wounded in Iraq, losing his lower right leg.  After suffering his injury, Specialist  Phillips requested that he deliver the  news to Pam regarding the seriousness  of his condition.  He talked with Pam on Wednesday,  May 19, asked her to join him as soon  as possible at the Landstuhl Hospital  in Germany, where Specialist Phillips  understood he would be receiving critical treatment. Naturally, Pam told  her husband that she would be there.  I can only imagine that call but it  should come as no surprise that Pam  and Specialist Phillips both assumed  that the Army would assist Pam in  joining her husband as soon as possible.  That was Specialist Phillips’s wish.  But that did not happen.  The nature of Specialist Phillips’s injuries  required  that he  be heavily  sedated following this phone call so he  was unable to speak directly with his  wife for several days.  After talking with her husband on  May 19, Pam assumed that someone in  the Army would assist her in getting to  Germany and advise her of her husband’s health status. For the record,  we do indeed provide spouses with Invitational Travel Orders to transport immediate family members of the seriously wounded. I have encountered several problems with those orders, too.

227,,108,-0.401,157,2004-06-14,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Speaker,  I appreciate  the great work done by Chairman HUNTERand  Ranking Member SKELTONon this legislation,  but I must reluctantly rise to highlight a major  problem that I hope will be fixed before this bill  reaches the President’s desk.  There is an obscure provision of the bill that  I want  to make sure Members know about,  and that is Section 1404, which would require  U.S. companies to get a license before they  export any goods listed on the Military Critical  Technologies List. According to a copy of that  list I found on the Defense Technical Information Center Web site, computers that exceed  1500 MTOPS are considered  to be military  critical.  So under this bill, exports of desktop computers, laptops and Sony PlayStations would  require a license. Making matters worse, the  license requirement would apply to all exports,  even those headed to our allies. If you want  to sell a Sony PlayStation  to England, you  would need a license. I think that is a major  problem.  Our  current  laws  allow  exports  up  to  190,000 MTOPS  to Tier  III  countries  like  China and Russia.  I personally  think  that  190,000 MTOPS is an outdated metric. But to  go down to a 1500 MTOPS metric is literally  the stone age of computing.  If  there are specific military critical  technologies  that are not sufficiently controlled  under existing export regulations, like night vision or surveillance devices, then let us draft  something  that controls  those  technologies.  But to say that we cannot freely sell a laptop  to  someone  in  London,  that  the  Sony  PlayStations cannot be exported to Canada, I  think is wrong.  I know that this is about war, but it shouldn’t  be about war on the American economy.  f  HONORING CATHY GIOVANDO,  CELESTE HALL, AND CAROL SIEBE  HON. LYNN C.

228,,108,-0.556,157,2004-06-14,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor 3 teachers who are retiring from Two  Rock Union School in a rural community near  Petaluma, CA. Cathy Giovando, Celeste Hall,  and Carol Siebe are special  teachers who  have worked together at the school for many  years. But beyond that, they will always be remembered for their successful efforts to preserve the Two Rock Coast Guard Training Facility.  Now the West Coast training center for the  Coast Guard’s new role in the Department of  Homeland Security, the Two Rock facility has  10 schools offering 50 courses to 4,000 students a year. It is hard to believe that this center was on the chopping block in cost-cutting  efforts in the 1990s—and not just once, but  twice. And twice, Giovando, Hall, Siebe, and  others on the Save the Base Committee rallied elected officials and the local community  as well as children and parents from the small  Two Rock School, to preserve a facility that  was originally established by the War Department in 1942.  As their representative in Congress during  the 1990s,  I knew how  important  this base  was to the fabric of this small community and  to the security of our Nation. However, without  the passion of these teachers, it would have  been difficult  for me  to convince  the Coast  Guard and the entire California Congressional  Delegation of this. It is for sure that Clinton  administration  officials were  especially  impressed with the art work and stories sent to  them by children from the school. In the world  of politics, these children proved that the personal can make a difference.  And, as teachers, these women were instrumental in Two Rock School’s recognition as a  California Distinguished School. Their legacies  include one of the first school gardens in the  area and, with the entire staff, creation of an  assessment program that enables teachers to  work with each child’s strengths and weaknesses.  Retirement will include everything from travel  to real estate classes. Coincidentally,  the  families of all three are from the same area in  Northern Italy which will figure prominently in  their travel plans.  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to honor Cathy  Giovando, Celeste Hall,  and Carol Siebe  whose warmth and dedication exemplify  the  best  that  teachers can offer  to our Nation’s  children. Their commitment extends beyond  the classroom to an appreciation of the significance of all the key elements—including the  Coast Guard Training Facility—that are essential to a community’s well-being.

229,,108,0.407,164,2004-06-14,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  thank a  true public servant, Dr. William E.  ‘‘Bill’’ Ward who has given over 25 years of  faithful service to the City of Chesapeake and  her residents.  Mayor Ward and  the City of Chesapeake  have a long history together. Having resided in  Chesapeake with his wife Rose since its incorporation in 1963, Mayor Ward has been instrumental in helping to shape and form one of  our Nation’s largest cities.  Mayor Ward has been serving his community in a variety of capacities for many decades. Those who know him best know that he  is first and foremost an educator. Mayor Ward  is Professor Emeritus and former Chair of the  History Department at Norfolk State University,  where he taught from 1973 to July of 2000. In  addition, he serves on the Board of Visitors at  his alma mater, Virginia State University in Petersburg, Virginia.  Mayor Ward’s love of government and service eventually led him into public life in 1978  and he has faithfully served since that date.  From 1978–1984, he served as a member of  the Chesapeake City Council and served as  Vice Mayor from 1984–1990. Mayor Ward is  the  longest serving Mayor  in Chesapeake’s  history having served  in  that capacity since  October 4, 1990.  During his tenure on the Chesapeake City  Council , the city grew from 100,000 people to  more than 210,000. Through a time of great  change, Mayor Ward provided continuity of  both leadership and direction.  In closing, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the Mayor’s wife Rose and their children Michael and Michelle and thank them for  their support and sacrifices over  the years.  The Ward family will continue to be among the  most well-respected and much-loved members  of the Chesapeake community.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in honoring  Mayor Ward,  for his years of dedication  to  Chesapeake and for his selfless service to her  citizens.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO LANCE CORPORAL  BENJAMIN  RIGOBERTO  GONZALEZ  HON.

230,,108,-0.161,164,2004-06-14,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, every year, the  National Endowment  for  the Arts honors an  elite group of master folk and traditional artists  for their lifetime contributions to the Nation’s  musical and artistic heritage. The prestigious  National Heritage Fellowships, awarded by the  NEA, honor artists not only for their artistic excellence but for their commitment to passing  on their skills and cultural traditions to a new  generation.  I am especially proud that one of this year’s  winners hails  from  the Fifth District of Tennessee. Mr. Jerry Douglas, of Nashville, is a  peerless  player  of  the  steel  guitar,  the  ‘‘Dobro’s matchless contemporary master,’’  according to the New York Times. He is a musical innovator often compared to Jimi Hendrix  and Charlie Parker, having garnered eight  Grammy Awards among his myriad accolades.  He is in fact one of the few artists to have a  the Dobro named  special model of  in his  honor.  Mr. Douglas learned music at an early age,  first as a singer and a player of the mandolin  and guitar. But he says that once he discovered the Dobro, ‘‘I stopped singing because  it was like I’d found another way to have a  voice.’’ Since finding that voice, Mr. Douglas  has  influenced all  forms of American music,  including bluegrass, country, rock,  jazz, and  the Dobro  blues. He has  taken  from  its  Southern rural roots into Celtic and even clasto eminstrument  sical music, adapting his  brace all styles.  This prolific career has yielded Mr. Douglas  more than 1,000 recordings. He has worked in  the company of a diverse array of well-known  artists,  including Garth Brooks, Paul Simon,  James Taylor, Reba McEntire, and  the  late  Ray Charles. He is acclaimed by fellow musician Alison Krauss as ‘‘the greatest Dobro  player the world has ever known’’ and by Life  Magazine as one of the top ten best country  musicians of all time.  I am honored to recognize Mr. Douglas for  his achievements and contributions to American music and congratulate him on his recognition by  the NEA.  It  is  thanks  to artists  such as Mr. Douglas that Nashville continues  to be proudly known as Music City, USA.  f  IMMIGRATION REFORM  HON. MIKE ROSS  OFARKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 14, 2004  ",2004
231,,108,-0.201,164,2004-06-14,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to express  the need for discussion on true immigration reform.  With over eight million illegal immigrants in  the U.S., and approximately half a million  more entering the U.S. annually, it is now time  for Congress to be diligent in trying to truly engage in discussion on how we can effectively  manage immigration here in the U.S.  I do not support illegal immigration. I also do  not support amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Individuals who violate America’s laws  should not be rewarded  for  illegal behavior,  and I believe amnesty perpetuates illegal immigration. The fact that there are eight million  undocumented immigrants estimated to live in  the U.S.  illustrates alone  that previous amnesty programs have not worked.  I am seeing the effects of immigration with  regards to healthcare and our hospitals. This  burden is not a problem because of illegal immigration alone. Legal immigrants are working  citizens, but many do not have benefits such  as health insurance. They are forced to ignore  health problems until  they’re magnified and  eventually forced to seek care in emergency  rooms. Unfortunately, these costs often must  be absorbed by hospitals, taxpayers and private insurance policy holders through higher  premiums.  We are appropriating  funds  to deal with  issues such as these in the short-term, but we  also have to start having discussions on long-  term solutions to legal and illegal immigration.  Being uninsured is only part of the problem.  We must not lose sight of the significant role  immigration has played in the development of  the United States. We must be wise as we  move into unchartered waters regarding new  immigration policies. We must look for ways to  construct positive steps that will ultimately lead  to a better life for everyone.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. DOUG OSE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 14, 2004  ",2004
232,,108,0.386,171,2004-06-14,Mr. TIBERI.," Mr. Speaker, folks from across  the country came to Washington this week to  mourn  the  passing  of  President  Ronald  Reagan. Even in death, the former President  continued  his  fascinating  connection with  Americans of all types.  Although  I never met Ronald Reagan, he  was one of my inspirations for entering politics. I was 18 at the time of his 1980 presidential campaign and it was the first big election to which I really paid attention. I remember being drawn to what this man, a half a  century older than me, was saying about having faith in our country, its people and their future. He was optimistic, cheerful and came  across as a thoroughly likable guy.  It was simply astounding how he could establish a bond with even the most unlikely audience. In 1984, I was a senior at The Ohio  State University and a member of the marching band. We were asked to play at a rally  that President Reagan would be holding at St.  John Arena. At first we all thought it would be  an official band appearance, but then we were  informed that since the President’s visit was  actually a campaign event, we could not appear as The Ohio State University Marching  Band. If we wished, though, we could volunteer on our own, and appear without our uniforms. There were roughly 200 members  in  the band at that time and, as I recall, roughly  200 of us jumped at the opportunity to play at  the President’s campaign event. Think of it. A  couple of hundred college kids were treating  the appearance of a 73-year-old Republican  President as enthusiastically as the Michigan  game—we would not have missed it for the  world.  President Reagan could connect with college kids and he could connect with Democrats, particularly those like my dad, an Italian  immigrant who worked as a machinist. He  came to America so he could have a better  life and his kids’ lives would be better still. He  knew exactly what Ronald Reagan was talking  about.  He was The Great Communicator. President  Reagan swept aside the filters and ‘‘analysis’’  of the news media and spoke from the Oval  Office directly with the American people. He  had the gift of explaining issues and his positions on them in simple, effective terms—a gift  all  too  few of us  in politics  today possess.  President Reagan spoke in a way that made  Americans feel like they were almost partners  with him.  Perception  is  reality, and Ronald Reagan  knew that. His message of hope and optimism  put a new face on the Republican Party, and  brought an end to the dour Nixonian era of  GOP politics. Young people  like me began  looking at the Republican Party in a different  way. Because of Ronald Reagan, we could  take pride in being Republicans.  I was struck by the attitude I saw in Washington this week. Certainly, there was sadness  and grief over the loss of one of the giants of  our time. But in keeping with the make-up of  the man himself, there was more. As often as  not, people also smiled when they spoke of  Ronald Reagan, often displaying  that same  sense of hope and good cheer that he himself  had radiated throughout his life. For all his accomplishments, it’s that same sense of hope  and optimism that I’ll think of whenever I remember Ronald Reagan.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN  SPEECHOF  HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 8, 2004  ",2004
233,,108,0.267,171,2004-06-14,Mr. TURNER of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I’m honored  to  join my colleagues  in support of H.  Res. 664, honoring the late Honorable Ronald  Wilson Reagan, 40th President of the United  States. As is the case for so many speaking  in  this chamber  today, Ronald Reagan was  one of my personal heroes.  Although we are all deeply saddened by the  passing  of  President Reagan,  Americans  today are still touched by his legacy and his  steadfast belief  in  the promise of  this great  Nation. By using his famous wit, he knew how  to make us believe in ourselves again. Each  of us has our favorite examples of the Reagan  wit. My favorite quote is, ‘‘Government’s view  of the economy could be summed up in a few  short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps  moving,  regulate  it. And  if  it stops moving,  subsidize it.’’  To Ronald Reagan, ‘‘America is a shining  city upon a hill for all to see and to follow and  reach  to, something  toward which mankind  should  strive.’’ Reagan brought  convictions  and determination as well as a genuine, hopeful and optimistic outlook to the office of President. Ronald Reagan never doubted his convictions. He never lost faith in America. His reassuring  tones were comforting even  in difficult times. With Reagan as president, it was  indeed morning again in America.  Just prior to Ronald Reagan assuming the  presidency, many people wondered whether  this  country’s best days were behind us.  Reagan  insisted:  ‘‘America’s best days  lie  ahead.’’ By the time he left office, the United  States was enjoying  the  longest peacetime  economic expansion in our history. President  Reagan’s most long-lasting legacy is his role  in winning the Cold War. While the common  doctrine of the time called for containing Communism, Reagan boldly predicted  it would  soon be ‘‘left on the ash-heap of history.’’  During the journey that was the Reagan revolution, he restored prosperity, confidence, optimism, faith and pride in America. While we  will miss Ronald Reagan, his contributions to  the world will be felt for generations to come.  He came to Washington to change the country  and ended up changing the world. As he said  in his farewell address to the Nation from the  Oval Office,  ‘‘A  final word  to  the men and  women of the Reagan revolution, the men and  women across America who  for eight years  did the work that brought America back. My  friends: We did  it. We weren’t  just marking  time. We made a difference. We made.  the  city stronger, we made the city freer, and we  left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not  bad at all.’’  Summing up an American icon, a giant, like  Ronald Reagan  is an enormous  task.  I am  grateful for the vision Ronald Reagan taught  me and the lessons about the power of convictions,  the value of principled  leadership,  and  the goodness and  the decency of  the  human spirit. We’ll miss the twinkle in his eyes  and affable smile which have left this earth.  However,  the contributions he made  to his  country and  to mankind remain with us, as  vast as  the great continent  that  the United  States spans, and God willing, will outlast us  all.  As an American, I want to join in offering my  support of H. Res. 664, honoring the late Honorable Ronald Wilson Reagan, 40th President  of the United States.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN  SPEECHOF  HON.

234,,108,-0.262,171,2004-06-14,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in offering a tribute to former President Ronald Reagan. He  is  rightly  remembered as a larger-than-life figure—a man who  conquered first Hollywood, then California, and  then Washington, DC, and whose message of  freedom and democracy spread around  the  world. Though I did not know him well, I did  know his daughter Maureen very well, and she  is also missed.  President Reagan was naturally possessed  of the qualities that make a great leader. As  Governor of California and later as President,  he used a blend of humor, kindness and boldness to communicate with the American people, to challenge and defeat the Soviet adversary, and to promote his uniquely American vision of how things should be.  While I disagreed with a number of his policies, I always admired his ability to convey his  ideas and his power to persuade.  The enormous outpouring of emotion and  love for this man comes as no surprise. When  we think of Ronald Wilson Reagan, we will remember his  infectious optimism and grace,  and his belief that there is always a better day  ahead for America.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN  SPEECHOF  HON.

I was first elected  to Congress in 1988, on the same day that  President George H.W. Bush was elected. Because Members of Congress officially take office on January 3, while a new President does  not  take office until January 20, my  first 17  days as a Congressman were during the last  17 days Ronald Reagan served as President.

236,,108,0.315,1,2004-06-23,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize this morning’s honored guest chaplain, Dr. John C. Davidson, who serves as the pastor of the Redeemer Lutheran Church in Lancaster,  Ohio.  Dr. Davidson has been an ordained  minister for 22 years and has faithfully  served his parish and the Lancaster  community during that time. He has  earned two master’s degrees and a doctorate degree from the Concordia Theological  Seminary  located  in  Fort  Wayne, Indiana, and St. Louis, Missouri.  In addition to his parish duties, Dr.  Davidson also serves as second vice  chairman of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, where he provides governing assistance to 172 congregations  located in Ohio and portions of West  Virginia and Kentucky.  Dr. Davidson is also known as a community leader. He serves as chaplain  for the Charity Newsies  in Fairfield  County and the Fairfield County Coroner.  On the personal side, Dr. Davidson  and his wife, Luann, have been married  for 22 years and are blessed with four  beautiful children, Rachel, Emily, Andrew, and Mark.  Dr. Davidson is an uplifting minister  who is loved by his family and is well  respected by the Lancaster community  and the members of the Redeemer Lutheran Church.  As Ohio’s Seventh District Congressman, I would like to take this opportunity to publicly recognize Dr. Davidson for his commitment to the church  and his community over the years. His  many contributions  to  the  spiritual  growth of central Ohio are noteworthy,  and I thank him for his service.  f  SPENDING RESTRAINT  (Mr. RYUN of Kansas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

239,House,108,-0.132,8,2004-06-23,Mr. CRAMER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding me this time, and I rise today  to  support my colleagues,  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON)  particularly, in opposition to the rule  that shuts off debate on fully funding  the intelligence community’s counterterrorism operations. I do this reluctantly, and I do not do this very often.  I want to say to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle that this should  have been the opportunity for us to  fully debate this issue, because there is  no real debate as to whether this bill,  when we get to the bill, provides full  funding to the intelligence community  for this global war on terrorism. We all  know that this bill does not do that,  and we have fallen into the trap ourselves. We are perpetuating the trap of  continuing  to  fund  the  intelligence  community in fits and starts, in bits  and pieces.  The war in Iraq, as difficult as it is,  is a war. The war on global terrorism,  as unpredictable as it is, is a real war.  Every day we are faced with warnings,  with threats that we are going to be attacked,  soon, between now and  the  elections.  b1100  Every administration, or at least the  past several administrations, have fallen  into  this  trap  of  using  supplementals as a way to slowly but  surely face the budget issues that we  have to face. We are saying here today  that we want to stop that, that we  want to break that habit, that we want  to up front tell the agencies what they  will get and let them then tell us what  they need so we can perform our oversight.  This  is not a partisan  issue. Both  sides  of  the  aisle  have  admitted  through the hearing process, this year,  last year as well, that we have got to  stop this practice. The administration  says this  is not enough money this  year;  that  later, whatever  ‘‘later’’  means, we will get to the point where  we will get to more funding.  This is not the way to do it. So today  we must send a clear message that  ‘‘business as usual’’ is no longer acceptable. Today we must put politics  aside and do what is right for our intelligence community and  for our national security. Today we must make  sure the intelligence community has  the resources it needs.  Oppose this rule.  ",2004

They are  following our lead. I would suggest that  we should evidence that same spirit of  bipartisanship in this body.  ",2004
242,House,108,-0.238,8,2004-06-23,Mr. BOSWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman for her hard work,  and  I  thank  the gentlewoman  from  California (Ms. HARMAN) for her hard  work.  Mr. Speaker, I did take some notice  of my good friend and colleague, the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD).  I appreciated his remarks about the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Chairman  GOSS). I agree. I think he has done an  excellent job. But none of us are perfect. I think there was an exception  here. I actually thought that he would  plus-up this counterterrorism budget.  But here we are, and I rise to oppose  the rule on the Intelligence Authorization Act. In particular, I am surprised  that a number of Democratic amendments were ruled out of order, notably  those of the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. PETERSON), mine and  the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. CRAMER),  which  would  fully  fund  the  counterterrorism budget needs of the  intelligence agencies.  I wish the Republicans had been willing to debate this issue head on, rather  than hide behind a procedure.  As the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Mr. PETERSON) has pointed out, the  current bill authorizes less than one-  third of  the  funds  the  intelligence  agencies need to fight the war on terrorism. The intelligence agencies will  have a tough time accomplishing their  mission if they do not receive full funding  for  the  counterterrorism  operations.  At CIA, these funds do not go to the  paper clips and photocopiers. They go  towards mounting  counterterrorism  operations on every continent. They go  towards collecting information on preventing terrorist attacks. They go towards funding operations in Afghanistan, to prevent resurgence of the terrorist sanctuaries in the remote mountains. They go towards working with  partner  governments  on  counterterrorism.  They  go  towards  capturing key al Qaeda leaders.  When  there  is  uncertainty  about  funding, according to the agencies’ testimony, it causes the agencies to hold  off on operations, potentially putting  lives in danger and ruining intelligence  collection operations.  The administration officials have admitted  they  are  not  fully  funding  counterterrorism in this bill, but will  send a request for the rest of the funds  after the election, while at the same  time urgently warning of a possible  terrorist attack before the election. I  say to my good friends and colleagues  here today, what should the American  people expect us to do? Is it acceptable  to wait until after the election, when  we already know what we need to do?  No, it is not acceptable. The American people expects us to debate these  issues fully and openly and not hide behind procedures. If, as the administration officials keep warning us, there is  a terrorist attack on the U.S. this summer, my colleagues  in the majority  will wish they had debated and settled  the Peterson amendment, rather than  squashing the debate. We will all wish  that we had acted and  fully  funded  counterterrorism.  Mr. Speaker, I fully urge the rejection of this rule, so that the important  issues  like  the  shortfall  for  counterterrorism  in this bill can be  properly debated.

243,House,108,0.478,22,2004-06-23,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman  from Florida  (Ms.  for yielding me  this  time, and I appreciate the time and effort she has put into this very important effort here.  Mr. Speaker, having listened to the  remarks of the gentleman from California (Mr. LANTOS), I have to say that  this legislation is clearly bipartisanship at its best. We all know of the  very  famous  line  of  Senator  Vandenburg’s that partisanship ends at  the water’s edge.  While in trying to deal with the challenge of the United Nations, it is absolutely essential that we pursue bipartisanship as well as we can, and we know  within this structure, encouraging democracy is a very important basis of  that; and that is why I would like to  not only compliment the gentleman  from California (Mr. LANTOS) and the  others who have been involved in putting this  legislation together but to  compliment another very strong bipartisan effort, which actually was the  brainchild for this important piece of  legislation.  A couple of years ago as we looked at  the great challenge of trying to deal  with the United States’ role  in the  United Nations, we put together a task  force that was done by Freedom House  and the Council on Foreign Relations;  and I was very pleased to cochair that  effort, along with our former colleague  Lee Hamilton. And, again, it was bipartisanship at its best, in that we had a  wide range of people from varied backgrounds who had been involved in the  diplomatic realm, in private sector organizations, nongovernment organizations involved with dealing with challenges that exist in the United Nations.  We came up with some recommendations as to how we could enhance the  leadership role of the United States of  America in the United Nations, and I  would commend to my colleagues this  report. Actually, the report  itself  is  only about 25 pages long, and it is a  very good read. There are additional  views.  It  goes  through  some  other  items in here; but basically the report  itself, along with the conclusions, are  about 25 pages.  And, again, it includes in it items  that  the gentleman  from California  (Mr. LANTOS) has just discussed. This  concept of pursuing a democracy caucus, something that is very important  for us to ensure that it is nations that  are committed to self-determination,  political pluralism, the rule of  law,  those things that we have a tendency  to take for granted here in the United  States that should be the true leaders  within that very basic concept of the  United Nations, and that is why this  restructuring, the role that the Department of State will be able to play in  having a structure that can help us, enhance our leadership and deal with the  challenges that exist in nations, such  as the Sudan, which was just referred  to by my good friend.  I do believe that this legislation, Mr.  Speaker, is going to be a great help to  us as a Nation and to the world as we  pursue those goals, and so I simply  want to express my appreciation to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LANTOS), to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN), to the others, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. HYDE),  those who have focused on this, and  also to express my appreciation to all  of the organizations that worked with  us with the task force that we put together, as well as individuals within  the Department of State who have  helped fashion this effort.  So this is a very important measure.  I believe it will go a long way towards  addressing the shared goals that we  have, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",2004
244,House,108,0.409,22,2004-06-23,Mr. KENNEDY of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to show my strong support for this  legislation’s  important  language on  the creation of a ‘‘Democracy Caucus’’ at the United  Nations.  Mr. Speaker, there is a growing crisis at the  UN. This crisis is the decline in the UN’s focus  on building democracies and spreading freedom  throughout  the world.  Increasingly,  the  UN is becoming dominated by non- and, in far  too many cases, anti-democratic governments.  For example, the 191 members of the United  Nations, 102 do not have completely free and  democratic governments. 47 members are notorious dictatorships. 6 are even known  terrorist states.  As the UN has lost its focus on promoting  democracy, scandal has plagued the organization. Take  the Oil-for-Food  program. The  world, particularly the Iraqi people, is waiting  to learn the magnitude of corruption involved  in the Oil for Food scandal. Credible reports  allege the UN paid itself at least $1.4 billion in  commissions for its work on a program that  stole as much as $10 billion in food and humanitarian relief from the Iraqi people it was  designed to help. This is only the latest examples of a crisis of confidence at the UN.  Nearly half of the 53 countries sitting on the  UN Human Rights Commission are known violators of  the human rights of  their own citizens.

I also want to commend the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  ROS-  LEHTINEN) for her leadership and consistent leadership on this issue as well.  I commend also the makers of the motion,  the majority  leader  the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. DELAY) and  the  gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr.  HOYER), our distinguished whip,  for  putting before us a resolution that I  think we should all support. I think it  gets right to the point, right to the  point of what we need which is a negotiated settlement between the parties.  This resolution preserves that right for  those parties.  Mr. Speaker, we can never say  it  enough, America’s commitment to the  safety and security of the State of  Israel  is unwavering. There are unbreakable bonds of friendship between  the United States of America and the  State of Israel. That is for sure. The  United States stands with Israel because of our common interest, our fundamental from in the most basic of all  rights, the right to exist, the right to  live free from fear, the right to put our  children on a school bus in the morning  knowing  that  they will come home  safely in the afternoon.  Let there be no doubt the United  States of America  stands with  the  State of Israel because of those bonds  of friendship but really first, and more  fundamentally, because it is in our national interest to stand with the State  of Israel. I view this resolution as an  endorsement of a fresh start.  I listened intently to what my colleagues have said about concerns they  have about the plight of the Palestinians in the region and I share them.  This resolution preserves the right for  final negotiations between the parties  for those parties to resolve their differences. It recognizes that for Israel to  be secure and safe, it is important and  necessary for there to be a Palestinian  state.  So when the Prime Minister of Israel  Sharon  announced withdrawal  from  Gaza, and we do not know the extent  yet from the West Bank, I viewed it as  a new, fresh opportunity for peace in  the Middle East, which is in the national interest of our country and the  international interest of the world and,  certainly, the regional interest of those  involved directly.  By passing this resolution, the House  of Representatives will affirm the support of the United States already confirmed by President Bush  for Prime  Minister  Sharon’s withdrawal  plan.  The principles endorsed by the resolution are consistent with the framework  for peace previously outlined by President Clinton and intended to facilitate  the implementation for the road map  for peace.  The  road map  remains  the  best  chance  for a comprehensive solution  for the differences between Israelis and  Palestinians. It is time for all parties  to the road map to use the opportunities presented by the Sharon plan to  bring  an  end  to  the  violence  and  achieve  lasting peace  in the Middle  East.  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, I did not want this debate to end without adding my voice to  it and my strong endorsement of this  resolution. It follows a very long, very  enduring bipartisan tradition, one that  says that we are two lonely defenders  of  freedom,  the United States  and  Israel. We are two lonely defenders in a  very  difficult  neighborhood  in  this  world and we do have a common obligation.  And  that  is  something  else  that  should be said from this side of the  aisle, and our leader alluded to it very  well.

Although I agree with the  purpose of  the bill, my position  is  based on the reliance  in the bill of  mandatory minimum  sentencing.

As a former FBI special agent, I well understand  the  importance of human  intelligence  gathering. The patriots of our intelligence community are frequently unsung heroes, not receiving due credit for their tireless efforts. Due  to the nature of their work, they don’t make  the headlines, but their work will continue to  derail  terrorist  activities  and  thus  prevent  headlines from being made.  Mr. Chairman, we’re facing significant new  threats in the post-Cold War era, and certainly  since September 11, 2001. New hot spots  have emerged throughout the world, and new  havens for terrorists and their supporters.

My  colleagues will  be  given an opportunity in the next few  minutes to vote on two approaches to  administration reporting on Iraq. The  Kennedy troop estimate requirement is  entirely too burdensome. We cannot  predict troop levels 5 years in advance.  No one is that good. Political developments in Iraq will drive security estimates  so we cannot determine now  what our needs are going to be years in  advance.  KENNEDY’s 30-day requirement would  not give the Department of Defense  enough time to staff a report, much  less complete one.

When the Fruit and Vegetable Program was first enacted as part of the  2002 farm bill, the legislative language  did not specify which States were to be  participants in the program, but the  States were specified in the conference  report. The Department of Agriculture  followed the conference recommendations.  Because we are passing this bill with  a somewhat unusual process that will  not  involve  a  conference  report,  I  would like to clarify which States are  intended to be added to the program.  Committee staff discussions have intended that the additional States to  participate in the Fruit and Vegetable  Program are Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and this was  our understanding as we finalized this  bill. I am in agreement with these discussions, and it is on this basis that we  are completing this bill.  ",2004

As the chairman  knows, the section of the bill titled,  ‘‘Household  Applications,’’  provides  school districts with an incentive to reduce the nonresponse rate during the  income verification process.  I would  like to offer an example of the operation of 10-percent  improvement criteria in nonresponse rates, so that the  committee’s  intent  is not misinterpreted. A district with a non-response  rate of 40 percent, for example, would  have to reduce its nonresponse rate to  36 percent, in order to meet the 10-percent improvement criteria and be entitled to maintain existing verification  procedures under current law.

259,Senate,108,-0.266,162,2004-06-23,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  support  this amendment,  which I have cosponsored with the Senator from Oklahoma, to extend the Energy Savings Performance Contract  program through the end of fiscal year  2005.  Our amendment is urgently needed to  stem the damage being done to a very  successful program that brings private  sector expertise, and private sector financing, to efficiency projects that reduce the Federal Government’s energy  use, and energy costs.  Since the 1970’s Federal Government  agencies have been setting an example  for the Nation on how to reduce energy  waste and save money by improving  their energy efficiency—spending $2.3  billion less for energy in FY2000 than  in FY1985. One of the reasons for this  success is the availability of Energy  Savings  Performance  contracts,  ESPCs. These contracts offer a way to  make energy savings improvements at  Federal facilities at no cost to the Government, by leveraging private capital.  The Department of Defense has been a  leader in the use of Energy Savings  Performance contracts.  Under the ESPC authority enacted in  1992, private sector companies enter  into contracts with Federal agencies to  install energy savings equipment and  make  operational  and maintenance  changes to improve building efficiency.  The company pays all of the up-front  costs for making the energy efficiency  improvements  and  guarantees  the  agency savings through the term of  contract. The energy service company  then  recovers  its  investment,  over  time, by receiving a portion of the  agency’s energy cost savings.  Since 1992, this program has brought  nearly $1.1 billion in private sector investments to Federal agencies, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in  permanent savings to the taxpayers.  The ESPC program has the support of  a broad and diverse coalition of businesses,  environmental  groups  and  labor—including the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, U.S. PIRG, and the Teamsters.  Unfortunately, the statutory authority for the ESPC program expired at  the end of FY2003. As a result of the  program lapse, over $300 million in energy efficiency projects have been halted nationwide. Pending contacts are in  limbo along with over 3,000 new jobs associated with these projects. Although  I and others have made several efforts  to extend the program, these efforts  have been unsuccessful, primarily because the Congressional Budget Office  assigns a cost to the program, unlike  the Office of Management and Budget  which considers  the program  to be  budget neutral.  While the debate over proper scoring  of the program goes on, the loss of new  business and experienced personnel has  put this program into crisis. With each  passing week, the benefits and potential of ESPCs are bleeding away. At a  time of high energy costs, high deficits,  and  high  unemployment,  Congress  should act as soon as possible to extend  ESPC authority.  I thank the managers of the bill for  accepting  this  short-term  extension  amendment. I also pledge to continue  working with Senator INHOFEand other  supporters of the ESPC program to  enact a permanent extension of this  valuable efficiency program.

260,,108,-0.658,169,2004-06-23,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to introduce a resolution of inquiry to request  documents about the abuse of detainees and  prisoners  in  Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. Two weeks ago, Democrats publicly requested that the White House release  all documents concerning  the growing  Iraq  prison abuse scandal. We were  ignored, so  today  I am offering a  resolution of  inquiry  which formally requests that the White House  to release the documents.  We are in the midst of one of the most serious incidents of human rights abuses in our  Nation’s  history.  In  Iraq, Afghanistan  and  Guantanamo, it is increasingly clear that our  Nation’s military and civilian contractors—at  the behest of the very highest officials in the  administration—engaged  in physical, psychological, and sexual abuse on a widespread  basis. Scores of detainees were murdered.  Numerous warnings were ignored. The Justice  Department provided  the  legal  cover necessary to justify torture.  The resolution I am offering today will ensure  that  the administration no  longer picks  and chooses what information it will share with  us. While the administration released a number of documents yesterday pertaining to the  treatment of detainees and prisoners, we’ve all  learned that it only shares what information reflects on it best. There is no reason to believe  that  the memos made public yesterday represent all of what the President and his Cabinet approved.  The documents also touch on only one of  many issues that need investigation. While understanding how  the administration came  to  deny Geneva Convention protections  to detainees is important, it is also critical to determine what the administration did once it realized its military was committing abuse, what  role contractors had  in  this mess, whether  warnings were ignored, and more. Therefore,  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution  so that we may get the rest of the documents  in the administration’s possession so that we  may conduct a thorough investigation.  The prison scandal is a stain on our Nation  and an impediment to the prosecution of the  war against terror. If this Congress can’t find  the will to investigate an abuse of this magnitude, it calls into question our entire constitutional system of checks and balances.  We’ve given the President and the Republican majority every opportunity to participate  in what any decent  society demands—accountability  for  inhuman and degrading acts  committed in our name. If they won’t help us  get to the bottom of why these atrocities happened, we’ll do it without them.  H. RES.—  Resolved, That the President is requested,  and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of  Defense, and the Attorney General are each  directed, to transmit to the House of Representatives not later than 14 days after the  date of the adoption of this resolution all  documents in their possession, except those  documents in the Attorney General’s possession that have been found by a court to be  protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) in a proceeding at which the Attorney General or the Department of Justice is  a party, relating to the treatment of prisoners or detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan, or  Guantanamo Bay and any requisite instructions for handling such documents, including—  (1) every report, memorandum, or complaint from the International Committee of  the Red Cross relating to the treatment of  detainees or prisoners and any documents  that reference such memorandum, report, or  complaint by the President, by any Federal  official covered by this resolution, or by any  agency under any such Federal official;  (2) every report, memorandum, or complaint from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty  International, Iraqi Human Rights Association, Afghan Human Rights Commission,  Physicians  for Human Rights, or Human  Rights First relating to the treatment of detainees or prisoners and any documents that  reference such memorandum, report, or complaint by the President, by any Federal official covered by this resolution, or by any  agency under any such Federal official;  (3) every document relating to interrogation techniques;  (4) every internal report of a law enforcement, military, or intelligence agency or organization concerning interrogation or detention operations;  (5) every internal report of a law enforcement, military, or intelligence agency in response to allegations that the treatment of  prisoners or detainees violated or continues  to violate international or American law;  (6) every document and memorandum regarding the applicability of the Geneva Conventions, the Convention Against Torture  and Other Cruel,  Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment, the International  Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, sections 2340–2340A of title 18, United States  Code, the War Crimes Act of 1996, and the  Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments  to the Constitution of the United States to  the treatment of prisoners or detainees;  (7) every document and memorandum relating  to command  relationships between  military police units and military  intelligence units;  VerDate mar 24 2004  04:13 Jun 24, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A23JN8.010 E23PT1 ",2004

264,House,108,0.403,17,2004-07-06,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to Vince Dooley  upon his retirement as Athletic Director at the University of Georgia.  I  could use the time to recite the countless achievements of this great Georgian as a Coach and Athletic Director,  but I will not. Instead, I will submit for  the RECORDa 4-page resume outlining  Coach Dooley’s  lasting contributions  to the University of Georgia.  I prefer  to use  this  time  telling  America about the man who made such  a difference in so many lives, including  my own. I first met Coach Dooley in  1961, when he was the guest speaker at  my high school banquet for our football team. He was the freshman coach  at Auburn and friends with our coach,  Jim Loftin. That night, he made a  three-win  team  feel  like  national  champions, just like Vince Dooley always did, always encouraging and always motivational.  Three years later, he arrived in Athens, Georgia, as the new football coach  for the Georgia Bulldogs, and Athens  would never be the same again. He  took a three-win team from the previous year and molded it into a 7–3–1  team, defeating Georgia Tech and winning the Sun Bowl Championship over  Texas Tech.  In the years to follow, Vince Dooley  led Georgia to intersectional victories  over Michigan, Texas, Notre Dame,  UCLA and Michigan State. In his 25  years as head coach, he led the Bulldogs to six Southeastern Conference  championships, 20 bowl games and the  1980 National Championship.  His tributes, however, do not lie in  the trophies he collected, but rather in  the lives he molded; men like Tommy  Lawhorne, an undersized, over-achieving linebacker, now a leading surgeon  in Columbus, Georgia; and Billy Payne,  an all Southeastern Conference end, responsible for convincing the world to  come to Georgia  for the Centennial  Olympic Games; or the greatest player  ever to play for Georgia, or, I would  submit, for any other university in the  country, Hershel Walker. Only a coach  like Vince Dooley could  instill  the  character  and  humility  for  which  Hershel is known.  There are thousands more  I could  mention. They may not be in a Hall of  Fame,  but  they  played  for Vince  Dooley. They all represent the character, humility and work ethic that  Vince Dooley instilled in all that came  his way. We know  them as Bucky  Kimsey, Clayton Foster, Fred Barber,  Andy Johnson and Frank Ros. Their  communities know them as leaders.  There  is no greater  tribute  to a  man’s career than the success of those  who learned under him. It is only fitting  that  the man  replacing Vince  Dooley as Athletic Director is Damon  Evans, just one of many who played for  Georgia’s  greatest  coach,  Vince  Dooley.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  OSBORNE), the former national championship  coach  of  the  Nebraska  Cornhuskers.  ",2004
265,House,108,0.351,24,2004-07-06,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Speaker, just a couple of quick points.  Again, the gentleman referred to the  Iraqi businessmen whose hands were  cut off. They came here to the Capitol  of the United States of America and  had a press conference. I did not see  anything about that anywhere near the  front page, simply to make the point.  ",2004
266,House,108,-0.404,38,2004-07-06,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," And this is a clear  difference of opinion, and I think the  administration has clearly articulated  where they want the country to go.  And I want to share a statistic that I  think I have shared here before.  When I was in the State Senate in  Ohio, the University of Akron did a  study; and the study was amazing what  the impact of State support for higher  education was. And the study came  back, and it said for every dollar, because in Ohio we were going through  the same kind of budget cuts as everyone else, and the legislature at that  time and the Governor at that time,  still do, are going after the big pot of  money that  is going to the universities.  So the study came back. The University of Akron did a study. It said for  every dollar that the State of Ohio invested in the higher education, they  would get almost $2 back in tax money,  basically because a high  school diploma, a worker with a high school diploma would make about $20,000 a year  average. Someone with a college diploma, with a BA or a BS, would make  on average 35 or $40,000 a year. So this  person who had the college diploma  would pay double in taxes and then go  on probably to get a master’s or something else, and then you would pay  even more in taxes, income tax, sales  tax,  property  tax,  the whole  nine  yards.  So from the State’s position, every  dollar you invest, you get almost $2  back in tax money. That is a good deal.  That is a good deal, because you are investing  in  the  long-term growth of  your economy. It is that person with  the bachelor’s degree. For the most  part, there is always exceptions, and I  am not saying you have to go to college to be successful, because you do  not, or have a college degree to be successful, because you do not; but on average those people will be out in the  economy creating  jobs, being entrepreneurs,  developing  the new  technology, the new economy that needs to  grow, which we do not even know what  it is yet.  And so the best thing that we can do  now is just educate a lot of people and  let them go out into the economy, support them with business  incubators,  worker  retraining,  small  business  loans; let them go out into the economy and create and manage new, alternative energies and on and on and on  and on. That is a whole other story,  but my point is that what do you want?  If you are sitting at home right now in  Ohio or somewhere across the country,  what do you want? What would you  rather have, a government that is saying we are going to invest in you and in  your children,  in  their college education so that they will eventually become taxpayers? Or do you want a  check for $300 from the Bush tax cut,  while your property tax goes up, while  they have to pass a police and fire levy  in your city, while your tuition  increases go up. I know in Ohio they have  gone up 9, 10 percent, 3, $4,000 over the  last couple of years.  And  then when you  look at  the  health care, up $3,000. There are certain  things that we can do together as a  country, as a people, as a Congress,  that we cannot do on our own. You  cannot build a hospital on your own.  You cannot build a road on your own.  You cannot build a school on your own.  There are certain things that we need  to do as a country, and one of the  things that we need to do is to make  sure that everybody has an opportunity  to go to college, because it will benefit  everybody, and in the long term we are  all going to benefit.  What I want the American people to  know from my perspective is that the  difference is the short-term, $300, here  is your  check,  government  is, you  know,  giving  you  something  back,  which is great and I think a lot of middle-income people need  that, and  I  think we should support the child tax  credits  and  eliminate  the marriage  penalty, my own opinion; but to give  millionaires a hundred thousand dollars back at the expense of veterans,  investments in education and all these  other things.  I mean, for example, and I am going  to finish here, when we tried to come  here about maybe a couple of weeks  ago, maybe 3, 4 weeks ago, and we  wanted to say the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY), the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Appropriations, tried to pass an amendment, and  he is the Democrat. We tried to pass an  amendment that would rescind the tax  cuts for millionaires. The millionaire  worker would  still get  $23,000 back  from the Bush tax cut. So we did not  completely eliminate the tax cut for  him, but we reduced it in order to fully  fund veterans, fully fund No Child Left  Behind, fully fund college education,  reduce the cost of tuition, double the  Pell grants, the whole nine yards, invest in health care, provide more coverage for children, and it went down.  And I think that, if there is one vote  over the last 2 years for this Congress,  that will be the vote. Were you going  to stand here and vote for millionaires  and make sure that these programs are  not funded, or are you willing to say  we need a certain percentage of that  tax cut back, because the long-term interests of the country are at stake?  And I think those are going to be clear  votes that a lot of people will hear  about, and I just think it was an opportunity for all of us to straighten up  this budget, the problems that we have  been having, and invest in our country.  And we did not do it, unfortunately.  VerDate May 21 2004  04:35 Jul 07, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06JY7.075 H06PT1 ",2004

268,,108,-0.376,136,2004-07-16,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to Roberto Mendez, a  longtime  resident of South San Francisco, which is in  my congressional district,  for being honored  with the 25th annual COPE Unity Award by  the San Mateo County Central Labor Council.  The COPE award is presented annually by the  Labor Council’s Committee on Political Education (COPE) to honor an individual for his or  her outstanding service.  A native of Guatemala City, Guatemala, Roberto moved  to  the United States  in 1968,  after graduating from military school. From the  moment of his arrival to America, Roberto exhibited a dedicated work ethic as he spent his  days learning English while working in a New  Jersey  textile  factory at night. After working  long hours with no benefits, no overtime pay  and minimal safety protection, Roberto eventually left the textile industry to work in the restaurant business where he worked his way up  from busboy to assistant manager.  Looking for more challenging work, Roberto  joined United Air Lines in 1984 working in the  flight kitchen, where he was responsible  for  the upkeep and stocking of the plane’s kitchen. He joined the Machinists Local 1781 and  immediately became an active member. Within  ten years, Roberto was elected Shop Steward.  His rise at United was as equally meteoric as  it was within the union, and Roberto quickly  advanced from working in the flight kitchen to  performing critical maintenance and mechanical work. Additionally, Roberto was recently  selected to be the West Coast Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, where he is responsible  for assisting  the more  than 3,500  United Airlines  local employees deal with a  wide variety of problems including substance  abuse  treatment,  stress,  harassment,  and  other personnel matters.  Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, in the wake  of the tragic events of September 11, 2001,  countless Bay Area workers were displaced  from their jobs. Roberto’s enthusiasm and devotion to his union colleagues lead him to be  an instrumental component in the efforts to assist  the airline, hospitality, construction and  other workers whose jobs were lost in the post  9–11 economic downturn. He coordinated with  the San Mateo County PennisulaWorks program  to make available  re-employment and  retraining services.  Roberto Mendez’s compassion for his fellow  workers led him to organize monthly food distribution and coordinate  re-employment and  re-training services for displaced workers and  their families. Serving over 350,000 pounds of  food  to hundreds of  families,  these monthly  distributions continue to serve over 175 families per month. In addition, Roberto assisted in  more  than  80 Rapid Response  sessions,  which informed displaced workers about services and resources available  to assist  them  during those difficult times.  Mr. Speaker, along with his wife Maria, and  their two children, Roberto’s family has made  its mark in South San Francisco and the Bay  Area with their strong will and dedicated sense  of justice. I urge all of my colleagues to please  join me in recognizing an extraordinarily devoted community activist on his 20 years of  outstanding service and his recognition by the  San Mateo Central Labor Committee with the  25th Annual COPE Unity Award.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

271,,108,-0.294,143,2004-07-16,Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today on behalf of  the men and  women of  the 4th Congressional District of  New York in support of this Resolution condemning  the July 9th advisory opinion  from  the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which  denounces Israel’s security fence.  I have long been an ardent and proud supporter of  Israel.  In recent years,  the volatile  and unstable history  that has underscored  Israel’s history has become even more bloody  and  pronounced. We  can  understand  as  Americans  that  Israel has a responsibility  to  protect its citizens from the grave threat posed  against the country from those terrorists that  seek to harm it.  The security fence has drastically enhanced  Israel’s ability to protect itself from terrorists by  significantly limiting the ability of terrorists to  access  Israeli cities. For example, since  its  construction,  suicide  bombings  along  the  northern West Bank have decreased by 90  percent. Contention and criticism to the wall  lies with the proposed plans to have the wall  run through the area of northern Jerusalem.  Prior to the ICJ’s opinion, efforts were made to  change  certain aspects of  the designated  route to limit the impact it could have on localities near and around the wall’s course.  Local Palestinian communities, those most  directly affected by  the wall’s construction,  have worked with Israel to redirect the wall in  certain areas to lessen the impact. The wall’s  construction  is condemned by  the Court of  Justice because of claims that it violates certain boundary  laws. However,  the wall  is a  protection  for both  Israelis and Palestinians.  Their joint effort has not only lessened any undesirable impact for both parties, but proven  the possibility  for compromise between both  areas.  I have long felt that America should not attempt to dictate decisions for Israel. With this  resolution, we are simply showing that we are  supporting  Israel’s step  toward safeguarding  its people. We as Americans must sympathize  with the fact that the Israelis are attempting to  confront terrorism by erecting a wall to stand  as  its physical and metaphorical barrier.  In  condemning  the opinion of  the  International  Court of Justice and supporting this resolution,  we as a body align ourselves with the best interests of  the  Israeli people, progress and  peace in the Middle East, and in the best interests of all Americans who wish to one day  see calm in a section of the world so long divided.  Thank you.  f  AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,  AND  RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2005  SPEECHOF  HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE  OFDELAWARE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 12, 2004  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 4766) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2005, and for other purposes:  ",2004
272,,108,0.229,143,2004-07-16,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  commend Chairman BONILLA and Ranking  Member KAPTUR for including a strong commitment of  funding  in  this bill  for  the  implementation of  the Low Path Avian  Influenza  program at  the Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service (APHIS). This $23 million in  funding will allow APHIS to promptly address  the repeated and diverse outbreaks of avian  influenza that have occurred in several states  including my state of Delaware.  This additional funding is necessary to respond to the many needs confronting this vital  industry  including: Expanded monitoring of  avian influenza, increased surveillance of the  live-bird markets and distributors, advanced  research on and  implementation of  fast and  economical tests, and confirmed identification  and tracking of avian influenza sources.  The presence of avian influenza presents an  immediate threat to the U.S. poultry industry.  It constitutes a significant danger to the national economy and potential serious burden  on interstate and foreign commerce.  As you know, in early February, two flocks  of chickens  in Delaware were confirmed as  having H7N2 low pathogenic avian influenza,  and roughly 83,000 birds were promptly depopulated. Isolated avian influenza infections  were then identified among chickens in both  New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Later  in  the  month, officials determined  that a  flock of  7,000 broilers in Southeast portion of Chairman BONILLA’s home state of Texas  tested  positive for a highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza. The most recent case came when a  flock of chickens in Pocomoke City, Maryland,  tested positive for the H7 avian flu, which led  to more than 300,000 birds and chicks being  depopulated on  three  farms. The  infections  discovered this year follow past outbreaks of  low pathogen flu in Virginia, Rhode Island and  Connecticut.  The USDA response to the outbreaks occurring this year has been prompt and the assistance provided to the state Departments of Agriculture and the poultry industry has been instrumental in helping to identify, contain and  eradicate  the avian  influenza outbreak—but  there is still much that needs to be done. Even  before the recent infections, the Administration  recognized the expanding need to implement  a comprehensive strategy to battle avian influenza by including $12.7 million in funding in  the APHIS FY’05 budget request for the Low  Pathogen Avian Influenza (LPAI) program and  recently  transferring $13.7 million  in FY’04  funds into the program.  This builds on the close to $1 million provided in FY’04 that is scheduled for implementation at the end of this month. I believe it is  critical that APHIS receives the proper amount  of  funding  to maximize  the resources at  its  disposal to strongly address this serious problem. Low Path AI is capable of mutating into  highly pathogenic  forms. The occurrence of  HPAI in Texas led Secretary Veneman to declare an Extraordinary Emergency earlier this  month. A healthy and vital poultry industry is  a major contributor to the recovering economy  of this country, and the finding of AI, particularly the highly destructive High Path AI, represents a major threat in this regard.  Moreover, the multi-billion dollar poultry export industry is put at risk by the avian flu discoveries. Many of our  trading partners continue to impose import bans on U.S. poultry  products. While some of these importers have  set  restrictions on products  from  specified  states, others have  taken  the more drastic  step of banning importation of poultry products  from our entire country. We need to give our  trade negotiators the necessary support in the  form of these AI surveillance and control efforts, to allow them to negotiate with our foreign trading partners and convince them to re-  open these markets.  Again,  I commend Chairman BONILLA and  Ranking Member KAPTUR for providing APHIS  with the critical resources it needs to address  this threat to our poultry industry.

273,,108,-0.317,150,2004-07-16,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing  the career and retirement of Carol Madison,  Executive Director of the Illinois Center for Autism for 27 years.  The Illinois Center for Autism, ICA, is a non-  profit, community-based mental health  treatment, special education center, and vocational  training site, dedicated to prevent the unnecessary  institutionalization of people with autism and help them achieve the highest level  of  independence  possible  in  their  home,  school, and community. Students/Clients must  be diagnosed as autistic and/or exhibit characteristics, such as severe communication disorders, severe behavioral disorders, uneven  intellectual skills, and socially  inappropriate  behaviors.  Under Carol’s direction and service as the  ICA’s first Executive Director, the Illinois Center  for Autism was established  in  the  fall of  1977  to provide a Special Day School Program. At that time, it was serving only eight  children with autism.  In January 1978, the Illinois Center for Autism was incorporated as a 501c (3) not-for-  profit corporation. The ICA’s mission then was  to prevent the unnecessary institutionalization  of children with autism. ICA received accreditation in 1992 from the North Central Association (NCA). To this day, ICA has maintained  its accreditation and serves both adults and  children throughout Southern Illinois.  In 1992, under Carol’s leadership, the ICA  began an  innovative  initiative. With Carol’s  careful hand guiding  the program,  the  ICA  opened  a  gourmet  Italian  take-out  eatery  called Pasta Fare. Pasta Fare provides an  ideal site for food service training for the ICA’s  clients. They assist in all aspects of the business,  learning  to apply  their  functional academic, social and communications skills in a  work setting. All clients at Pasta Fare are employees of the Illinois Center for Autism. Clients are  transitioned  into  the community  for  further competitive employment opportunities  and many are placed into food service and related occupations.  Not only has Carol and the ICA been able  to prevent the unnecessary institutionalization  of hundreds of people with autism, she and  the Center have also helped them to become  productive members of society.  Carol has devoted her  life  to serving  the  needs of  the disabled community. She has  served as a Site Visitor for the US Department  of Education’s Blue Ribbon Schools program  and as a Hearing Officer with the Illinois State  Board of Education from 1977–1987. She has  consulted with the Madison County Association for Retarded Citizens and served on the  Illinois State Board of Education Advisory  Council on the Education of Children with Disabilities from 1992–1999. She has served as  the Director of the National Association of Private Education Centers and was the Chairman  of  the  Illinois Guardianship and Advocacy  Commission.  The future holds great promise for the Illinois Center  for Autism and  the people  it  serves and we owe a great debt of gratitude  to Carol for the work she has done on behalf  of hundreds of young people in our area.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in recognizing the contributions of Carol Madison and wish her and her family the very best  in the future.  f  AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,  AND  RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2005  SPEECHOF  HON. BOB FILNER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 13, 2004  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 4766) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2005, and for other purposes:  ",2004
274,,108,-0.652,150,2004-07-16,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of the Fiscal Year 2005 Agriculture Appropriations bill. The bill includes several projects that  will benefit my district.  Imperial County  in my Southern California  district is a desert farming community located  on the California-Mexico border. The county is  one of  the  top agricultural counties  in California. It produced over $1.2 billion of agricultural products in 2002. The county is a leading  producer of agronomic and winter vegetable  crops, as well as livestock.  This bill contains language that directs the  Under Secretary  for Rural Development  to  give consideration  to projects  that would directly benefit my constituents:  The  Imperial Valley Sugarcane/Renewable  Energy/Ethanol  Project—Environmental  and  water conservation issues are of grave concern to the agricultural producers in my district.  Alternative,  higher-value  commodities  must become available  to ensure  the best  economic and environmental use of the land  and water. This  rural development project  could provide such an alternative to many of  our  farmers while producing sugar, ethanol,  and  renewable energy. My constituents are  pursuing an economic development project to  develop sugarcane production and processing  capabilities, along with ethanol and renewable  energy production, in the Imperial Valley. The  number one crop in the Imperial Valley is alfalfa, which has a much  lower dollar value  than sugarcane. Due to a rural-to-urban water  transfer that has reduced the number of acres  that may be planted  in  the Valley, my rural  constituents searched for an alternative to alfalfa—and  found  it  in sugarcane. The economic conversion project  includes development of sugarcane acreage in the Valley, as  well as construction of a new sugarcane processing facility on the site of an existing sugar  beet processing facility in the Valley. The current sugar beet  facility, which currently only  operates four months of the year, employs approximately 300 people (100 full-time and 200  seasonal employees). Opening the new sugarcane processing  facility would allow  year-  round processing at the site, dramatically increasing the number of full-time job opportunities at the facility. The project would also allow  the creation of a power plant reliant on renewable  fuels, principally  from residue  from  the  production and processing of sugarcane. Further, the project includes plans for ethanol production  from  the sugarcane. Due  to California’s phase-out of MTBE as a gasoline oxygenate, the state requires a stable supply of  ethanol, and a local supply will dramatically reduce  transportation  costs  for ethanol purchasers. Sugarcane-to-ethanol production  in  the Imperial Valley will greatly benefit the economic well-being of my constituents—as well  as reduce renewable and clean fuel costs for  the nation while protecting environmental quality.  Environmental Technology Business Park—  The County of Imperial is working to catalyze  development of an EcoPark for location of renewable energy and  ‘‘green  technology’’  industrial projects. An investment in this project  would  leverage  funding already allocated  for  development of biomass-to-ethanol projects in  Imperial County over the past three years by  local, state and federal agencies. The EcoPark  is expected to attract more than $400 million  in private investment and sustain more than  4,000 jobs in the related industry and agricultural sectors. Further, a variety of new and established firms are interested in bringing additional  technologies  to  the EcoPark, such as  methane digesters, minibiorefineries  for biodiesel, nutraceutical manufacture,  liquid natural gas production, and solar power generation. The EcoPark will be a beacon of economic and environmental development for renewable fuels projects.  Desert Farming  Institute and The National  Center for the Study of International Trade in  Agriculture—My constituents are interested in  establishing a ‘‘California Desert Farming Institute’’ at the San Diego State University’s Imperial Valley campus. The Imperial Valley of  California is one of the most successful examples of desert farming in the world. San Diego  State University-Imperial Valley  campus, a  Hispanic-Serving Institution, is located on the  border with Mexico and thus a logical site for  VerDate May 21 2004  02:37 Jul 17, 2004 Jkt 029061 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15JY8.056 E16PT1 ",2004
275,House,108,0.554,2,2004-09-08,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  again to pay tribute and support to our  troops, particularly in Afghanistan. We  should be reminded that there is a lot  of inordinate negative press and that  Americans have been apprised of the  situation in Iraq, and I think there is a  lot of good things happening also in Afghanistan.  Just one of the accomplishments is  they are continuing to attack the narcotics trade to prevent proceeds from  being used to fund terrorists and insurgents. We are helping the Afghans provide for their own security and rebuilding provinces shattered by more than  20 years of war, tribal fighting, and  Taliban oppression. Afghanistan’s presidential and parliamentary elections  are slated for October 2004 and 2005, respectively.  Those are just a few of the accomplishments of our troops engaged  in  Operation Enduring Freedom  in Afghanistan. But  there  is  one  other  thing: one of the accomplishments, obviously, is that their actions overseas  and in Iraq have prevented another terrorist attack here in the United States.  So  I am proud of our courageous  troops defending our Nation, and encourage my colleagues to join me in  singing their praises also.  f  CALLING UPON THE VICE  PRESIDENT TO APOLOGIZE  (Mr. STRICKLAND asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

I appreciate the fact that the gentleman is withdrawing the amendment  because there is not an offset, but I  want to commend him for his thoughts  on this issue because it is important.  These centers are very important, and  it is a classic example of what confronted us in the subcommittee, and  that is, there is so much in the way of  good things that need to be done, and  we had to make priority judgments. We  will keep this in mind as we go to conference, but I certainly think the need  is out there.  ",2004

281,House,108,-0.388,79,2004-09-08,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment.  First of all, I would like to thank our  distinguished chairman because he has  worked with us and understands the  importance of this very critical issue  in so many Members’ districts across  the country. I rise in strong support of  the amendment, and I am appreciative  for all of us who have been working together. Just a few words on it, and  again I thank our chairman.  Last year CMS decided to change and  reinstate the patient rehabilitation facilities 75 percent rule, a rule which  was enforced inconsistently and intermittently until it was fully suspended  in 2002 because rehabilitation care had  evolved  so  far beyond  the original  rule’s scope.  In an effort to ensure that the rule  would be updated appropriately, Congress asked CMS  to commission an  independent study on the status of rehabilitative care and use the findings  to rewrite the rule. As my colleagues  know, we had more than 300 Members  of Congress supporting this request and  the inclusion of similar directives in  the fiscal year 2004 omnibus spending  bill and the Prescription Drug Act.  CMS issued the final 75 percent rule  without the benefit of a study, leaving  the list of qualifying conditions practically the same as those imposed two  decades ago. Considering the impact of  I  these  rehabilitation policies on  the  health and well-being of our constituents, we could not stand by and let our  call for a study go unfulfilled. So again  with the support of the Committee on  Ways and Means chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMAS),  and  the  ranking member,  the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL),  the  LoBiondo-Lowey-Wamp  amendment will ensure that an independent  study of the issue is conducted and the  findings used to rewrite the 75 percent  rule.  I am very appreciative, Mr. Chairman, of both committees, and particularly the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman REGULA). We have worked  together in a bipartisan way to bring this  amendment to the floor, and I want to  thank the staff of the gentleman from  California  (Mr. THOMAS), Joel White  and Deb Williams, for carefully working out the details of this amendment  late last night and early this morning.  I am delighted we have been able to  work this out.  b1445  ",2004
282,House,108,0.428,79,2004-09-08,Mr. WAMP.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief,  just to add that this is one of those  rare opportunities for the Appropriations Committee and the Ways and  Means Committee to meet at the water’s edge. Sometimes we put limitation  amendments  on  appropriations  bills and they strike those through a  point of order, which they have the  right to do here. Yet they chose to  agree with us and say that this GAO  study needs to be completed and all the  science needs to be brought to bear before this rule is actually implemented.  Let me just say that one of the greatest areas of innovation in our health  care delivery system in this country is  inpatient  rehabilitation  hospitals  where virtually every family in America has had somebody benefit from one  of those hospitals, and they are wowed  at what we are doing. It is a very fluid  area of health care.  It  is changing  every month  because  of new  technologies and new procedures. Yet some  of these rules are antiquated in these  13 categories. They need to be changed  based on what is happening in health  care, not a bean counter at OMB saying, we only have this much money or  we want to reduce this much money,  therefore, this is what you are going to  be reimbursed for.  In our health care delivery system,  we need to reimburse wherever the innovation is, wherever the patient is,  wherever the need is, wherever the cure  is; and that is what this does is allow  science to prevail and not some arbitrary limitation that is set down the  street by any administration or any  government bureaucrat.  That is, frankly, where the Congress  is doing its job to weigh in, because we  are  sensitive  to  these  things;  and,  frankly, sometimes the Appropriations  Committee  can  be  very helpful  by  using the power of the money flow and  the appropriations process to say, wait  a second, stop the trains, we are going  in the wrong direction.  This is a win-win. Congratulations to  all and thanks especially to Ways and  Means for letting us live to fight another day on behalf of patients and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals across  the country. I thank the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) and the  gentleman  from  New  Jersey  (Mr.  LOBIONDO). It is always a pleasure to  work with them.  ",2004
283,,108,-0.45,100,2004-09-08,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, there are now more  than 8 million people out of work in  this country; 3 million have been out of  work for so long they have exhausted  their  unemployment  compensation  benefits. We have more than 1.5 million  fewer private sector jobs than we had 4  years ago, and the administration’s response to that has been to impose new  regulations allowing employers to chisel workers on overtime protection, despite the fact that cost of living has  risen twice as much this year as last  year, despite the fact that gas prices,  college tuition, and health care costs  are going through the roof.  I had planned at this point to offer an  amendment with the gentleman from  California (Mr. GEORGEMILLER) which  would block most of the sections of  that new rule with one exception: We  would have allowed the changes to go  forward that improve the situation for  workers that make between $8,000 and  $23,000 a year. But now I have been told  that if I intend to offer that amendment tonight, the majority will shut  down the House for the evening.  The record will show that the minority on every single appropriation bill  has cooperated procedurally with the  majority,  even when we  have  not  agreed with the content of those bills,  in the interest of comity in the hopes  that  somehow we could  reach compromise  and  accommodation  as we  move through the process.  In spite of that cooperation, the majority by the end of this fiscal year will  only be able to show that they have  passed 1 and possibly 2 of the 13 appropriation bills. I want it made clear that  the reason for that miserable record is  because of the rigidity of the majority  and because of their refusal to work  with the minority or even other members of the majority in the other body.  This is part of a long pattern of procedural abuse.  On prescription drugs, the majority  held the vote open for 3 hours when  they did not get the result they wanted. On the PATRIOT Act, the Sanders  amendment was held open for 40 minutes until enough arms could be broken  on the majority side. On vouchers on  the D.C. bill, the roll was held open for  50 minutes until the majority could  achieve a different result. On campaign  finance, the House was kept at bay for  2 hours before  the majority moved  ahead.  I would simply make this point, Mr.  Chairman. The majority is busy trying  to bring the nicer points of democracy  to Iraq. It would be nice if they would  recognize those same niceties here at  home.  I want to make one further point.  People are asking me, why are you cooperating procedurally on bringing the  Labor, Health, Education bill to the  floor when you are so opposed to its  contents? Well, there are two reasons.  First of all, because we believe on the  minority side that these issues ought  to be debated even if we do not win.  Secondly, very  frankly,  I want  the  record to show in the end that even  though the minority has given the majority every single procedural cooperation that we could, that the majority  has still not been able to perform because of its own rigidity and because  they refuse to work with anybody, because they refuse to compromise with  anybody.  It is outrageous after we have been  asked for so long to bring this bill to  the floor, they now want to pull the  bill so they have another chance to  twist arms overnight.  Do you really want to put workers in  so much of a corner that you will not  even allow us to have a vote on this  overtime provision? We already won  this vote once in the House, we won it  once in the Senate, and yet the majority  leadership arbitrarily stripped  it  out of the bill last year. Now you are  trying to play the same game this  time. I hope that every majority Member who intends to vote for this amendment tomorrow,  if the House comes  back into session on this bill, I hope  you will stick with your conscience  overnight and not cave in to pressure  by tomorrow morning.  ",2004
284,House,108,0.019,107,2004-09-08,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  the time, and my friend from Pennsylvania asked for the specifics.  The Blue Dog budget this year proposed to spend no more than President  Bush recommended that the Congress  spend, and we  intend to stick with  that. When my colleague talks about  spending and he talks about revising  history, in the 8 years prior to the last  31⁄2, spending went up 3.4 percent per  year on the average. In the last 31⁄2  years, spending has gone up 10.4 percent.  The gentleman keeps asking for specifics  from  the minority  side. Last  time I checked, the minority does not  even get recognized for amendments so  that we can do some of things that we  talked about doing. We were denied  having even a vote on some of our  budgets over the last 31⁄2 years. The  gentleman keeps  talking about  specifics and rhetoric. His rhetoric does  not match the specifics.  We are going to prove unequivocally  sometime in the next 2 or 3 months  that the economic game plan we are  under is not working because we are  going to have to vote to increase the  credit card limit of the United States  of America  for the third time  in 3  years, this time through $8 trillion.  Yes, the war is expensive and we must  pay for the war, but this is the first  war in the history of our country that  is being fought at the same time we are  asking to reduce the amount of money  available to make sure the troops have  the material that they need in order to  fight the war.  If my colleague wants to make that  argument, be my guest. All we are suggesting with this simple motion is go  back to what worked in 1994, pay-as-  you-go. It worked when we were bipartisan working on it. It worked in 1997  when we worked together as Democrats  and Republicans. What has happened in  the last 31⁄2years to suggest that, in a  bipartisan way, we do not want to follow that which has worked?  That is the fundamental question for  this body. I ask for a vote in favor of  the gentleman from Indiana’s motion.  It is returning common sense, pay-as-  you-go, making tough choices; does not  raise taxes on anyone. It just says if we  are going to increase spending for any  worthwhile project, we have got to pay  for it; if we are going to cut taxes and  increase the deficit, we have got to cut  the  spending  first, not  rhetorically,  after the next election. Do it now, and  my colleagues will find there will be  some Blue Dogs working with them.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  PEARCE). Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion  to instruct.  There was no objection.  ",2004

286,House,108,0.528,107,2004-09-08,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I move to suspend the rules and pass  the Senate bill (S. 2634) to amend the  Public Health Service Act to support  the  planning,  implementation,  and  evaluation of organized activities involving statewide youth suicide early  intervention and prevention strategies,  to provide funds for campus mental and  behavioral health service centers, and  for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:  S. 2634  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Garrett Lee  Smith Memorial Act’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) More children and young adults die  from suicide each year than from cancer,  heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke,  and chronic lung disease combined.  (2) Over 4,000 children and young adults  tragically take their lives every year, making suicide the third overall cause of death  between the ages of 10 and 24. According to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third overall cause of  death among college-age students.  (3) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control of the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, children  and young adults accounted for 15 percent of  all suicides completed in 2000.  (4) From 1952 to 1995, the rate of suicide in  children and young adults tripled.  (5) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide  among young adults ages 15 to 19 increased  11 percent.  (6) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide  among children ages 10 to 14 increased 109  percent.  (7) According to the National Center of  Health Statistics, suicide rates among Native Americans range from 1.5 to 3 times the  national  average  for  other  groups, with  young people ages 15 to 34 making up 64 percent of all suicides.  (8) Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public health tragedy linked to underlying mental health problems and that  youth suicide early intervention and prevention activities are national priorities.  (9) Youth suicide early intervention and  prevention have been listed as urgent public  health priorities by  the President’s New  Freedom  Commission  in Mental Health  (2002), the Institute of Medicine’s Reducing  Suicide: A National Imperative (2002), the  National Strategy  for Suicide Prevention:  Goals and Objectives for Action (2001), and  the Surgeon General’s Call to Action To Prevent Suicide (1999).  (10) Many States have already developed  comprehensive statewide youth suicide early  intervention and prevention strategies that  seek to provide effective early intervention  and prevention services.  (11) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college counseling centers revealed  an increase in the number of students they  see with psychological problems. Furthermore, the American College Health Association found that 61 percent of college students  reported  feeling hopeless, 45 percent said  they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 percent felt suicidal.  (12) There is clear evidence of an increased  incidence of depression among college students. According to a survey described in the  Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1,  2002), depression among freshmen has nearly  doubled (from 8.2 percent to 16.3 percent).  Without  treatment,  researchers  recently  noted that ‘‘depressed adolescents are at risk  for school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self-medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide—now the third leading cause  of death among 10–24 year olds.’’.  (13) Researchers who conducted the study  ‘‘Changes in Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years’’ (1989–2001) at Kansas  State University stated that ‘‘students are  experiencing more  stress, more  anxiety,  more depression than they were a decade  ago.’’ (The Chronicle of Higher Education,  February 14, 2003).  (14) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 20 percent of  full-time undergraduate college students use  illicit drugs.  (15) The 2001 National Household Survey on  Drug Abuse also reported that 18.4 percent of  adults aged 18 to 24 are dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In addition, the  study found that ‘‘serious mental illness is  highly correlated with substance dependence  or abuse. Among adults with serious mental  illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were dependent  on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while  the rate among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 percent.’’.  (16) A 2003 Gallagher’s Survey of Counseling Center Directors found that 81 percent  were concerned about the increasing number  of students with more serious psychological  problems, 67 percent reported a need  for  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:16 Sep 09, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08SE7.170 H08PT1 ",2004

Many  times  in  this House we do  things for symbolic purposes, and I am  not suggesting that this legislation is  being done for symbolic purposes, but I  do have to raise the question, as I did  earlier, as to just what extent this bill  may be successful if everything goes  right.  As I indicated before, we are spending  at $82 million. That translates  into  around the addition of one new guidance counselor in every county in my  State. So we have to question really  are we providing any new services to  the majority of kids, or are we just lifting up hopes and also the expectations  of future calls for greater spending on  these programs?  As to the aspect of additional harm  that may come from this, that is the  very nature of the question that I raise  here. We have yet to hear of any testimony in this body as to what is the nature of the benefits of this, from academic institutions, parents or otherwise, how this may benefit the students. Anecdotally we may have some,  but I would think before we get into  such a critical area as dealing with the  mental state of our kids that we would  want to have that information on hand.  ",2004

302,,108,-0.308,198,2004-09-08,Mrs. TAUSCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to bring to your attention the accomplishments  of the Wellness Community of the San Francisco East Bay area.  The Wellness Community provides support,  education, and hope  for people with cancer  and their loved ones, serving more than 1,000  participants in the Bay Area annually.  Cancer affects  three out of  four  families  across our Nation, over 1.3 million Americans  each  year. Cancer  does  not  discriminate,  crossing all ethnic, racial, age, national origin,  sexual orientation, and socio-economic lines. It  is one of the most devastating diseases afflicting Americans today.  The Wellness Community of the San Francisco East Bay area provides services to improve  the quality of  life  for cancer patients,  their  families, and  loved ones. Services  include weekly and monthly support groups,  monthly educational programs, stress management and gentle movement programs, and  a cancer resource library.  In addition to providing a close-knit, home-  like atmosphere,  the Wellness Community’s  programs also enable  those with cancer  to  take an active stance  in combating  the disease by forming a support network for patients  and their families.  The Wellness Community  believes  that  hope is a valuable tool for combating cancer.  Rather than identifying themselves as passive  victims,  the Wellness Community empowers  patients  to play an active  role  in  improving  their own lives by working directly with their  healthcare teams to bring about the possibility  of recovery.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  commend  the Wellness Community on over  twenty years of dedicated service in improving  the  lives of  individuals,  families, and  loved  ones who are affected by cancer in the San  Francisco Bay area.  I urge the House of Representatives to recognize  their declaration of September 18,  2004 as  ‘‘The Wellness Community Day of  Celebration.’’  f  CITY OF COLLEYVILLE RANKED IN  TOP TEN  HON.

For over twenty years, the Big Brothers Big  Sisters of North Alabama has provided hundreds of children with a positive influence and  a  strong  foundation  to  help  guide  them  through adolescence. Every volunteer does a  great deal  to  improve  the quality of  life of  these children and to help them develop goals  and aspirations of their own. For its hard work  and continued commitment, Big Brothers Big  Sisters of North Alabama is recognized nationally  for  its performance as one of  the best  agencies in the country.  Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 100th year  of the national Big Brothers Big Sisters program, and on August 14th, a reunion and centennial picnic was held in Huntsville. This picnic was an opportunity for everyone involved  with Big Brothers Big Sisters  to come  together, trade success stories, and relive the  times each volunteer and child has had  together.  Mr. Speaker, I’ve always believed that our  children should have an opportunity  to succeed and be an active participant in our communities.  I’m pleased  that  there are a  large  number of  individuals who are committed  to  helping less fortunate children in our area. I  rise today to commend each and every person  who is involved with Big Brothers Big Sisters  and join in their centennial celebration.  f  SUPPORTING GOALS OF NATIONAL  MARINA DAY  SPEECHOF  HON.

304,,108,0.47,205,2004-09-08,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Mr. Bill Garrett of El Cajon, CA and  his commitment and accomplishments for his  community, his  family and his country. He  began by preparing himself with  the  finest  education by earning a Masters Degree  in  Public Administration with specialty  in personnel and  labor  relations  from California  State University, Fullerton. He also earned a  Masters in Science in Urban Planning from the  University of Arizona and a Bachelors Degree  in Political Science  from  the University of  Washington.  Bill has a history of public service  that  began with his commitment  to his country  when he joined the United States Army. After  his military commitment, Bill worked as an  urban planning consultant in Arizona and California before becoming City Manager of  the  City of Corona. In 1996, Bill became the City  Manager of El Cajon and brought a ‘‘can do’’  attitude to every department.  For  the past eight years, Bill Garrett has  played an  integral role  in  the shaping of El  Cajon and the surrounding communities. His  efforts with the downtown corridor, the expansion of housing rehabilitation and his role in  assisting  first  time home buyers are well-  known. His strong belief that the employees of  El Cajon are its greatest resource has caused  the city to excel far beyond expectations. His  obedience to the dictates of his council and  the elected mayor has created a team effort  second to none.  Bill Garrett is highly respected by his peers  from around the nation but his greatest satisfaction comes from the accolade and respect  from his fellow employees for the City of El  Cajon. He has nurtured,  trained, educated,  and assisted his fellow employees through the  good and tough times. He has also shared his  insight and knowledge with the California City  Management  Foundation,  the  International  City Management Association, the San Diego  City-County Managers Association and  the  National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.  In addition, Bill is a vital player as President  of the Cuyamaca College Foundation Board, a  member and past President of the El Cajon  Rotary Club, Secretary of  the Grossmont-  Cuyamaca College District Auxiliary, founding  member of El Cajon Sister Cities Committee  and President of the El Cajon Historical Society.

305,,108,-0.487,212,2004-09-08,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, combating terrorism has emerged as one of the  most  important U.S.  foreign policy and national security priorities. The number of  terrorist groups  is  reportedly growing and  the  technology to inflict mass casualties is becoming more readily available. The United States  and other cooperating nations are confronted  with  four major  tasks, namely,  (1) deterring  and  identifying  terrorists and  their sponsors  and supporters (2) weakening terrorist financial ability and infrastructure (3) making potential  targets extremely difficult  to be accomplished, and  (4) containing damage  in  the  aftermath of terrorist attacks. Given these priorities Congress and the administration should  accept the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report as a guidance document  toward effectively combating  terrorism without  diminishing  the people’s  civil  liberties and  rights.  Combating  terrorism  requires government  activity designed to gather information on, and  restrict the activities of individual terrorists and  groups seeking to engage in direct or indirect  terrorist activity. This is a challenge facing the  Congress as  to how—in a growing age of  globalization, deregulation, democracy and individual freedom—to institute effective communication between various  intelligence agencies, information sharing across Federal, State  and  local governments and private sectors  and  the method of  implementing  regulatory  and monitoring systems which will help deter,  identify, and track terrorists and stop their activities.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  RESOLUTION  HONORING THOSE VOLUNTEERS  WHO HELP AMERICA’S MILITARY  FAMILIES  HON.

Mr. Speaker, since the conflicts in Afghanistan and in Iraq began, the strain on our military families has been tremendous—with extended  tours of duty and several activations  and reactivations  During  this  time, our military  families  face  unique and trying challenges. While their loved  ones are deployed overseas or away for extended periods, these families must cope with  the anxiety and a fear of a different kind than  experienced in combat.  This anxiety can be just as intense. ‘‘Will my  husband come home?’’ ‘‘Is my daughter’s unit  in  the  line of  fire?’’  ‘‘How will  I make ends  meet while  the kids’  father  is gone?’’  ‘‘How  should I explain this to our kids?’’  These are the questions that race through  the minds of the spouses and the children of  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:16 Sep 09, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A07SE8.069 E08PT1 ",2004
307,,108,-0.4,219,2004-09-08,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to congratulate ESPN on its 25th  anniversary. At 7 p.m. on September 7, 1979,  the Entertainment and Sports Programming  Network  began  broadcasting  SportsCenter  from Bristol, CT in my district. Bill Rasmussen  had the crazy idea that a 24-hour sports cable  network might be a success. It started with a  single building with no running water and a  control  truck on cinderblocks showing such  odd sports as Australian  rules  football and  darts. Twenty-five years later, he has proven  to be right. That single building has grown into  nine control rooms, 31 edit suites, more than  2,000 television monitors, and a library of over  a million tapes.  ESPN is now one of the most widely known  brand names in the world and more than 90  million people are exposed  to ESPN each  week. It has expanded its networks to include  ESPN2, ESPN Classic, ESPNEWS, ESPN  Deportes, ESPN Today, and ESPN Radio.  ESPN.com  receives over 2.3 million page  views during peak hours with its instant score  updates. Meanwhile, workers stuck in their cubicles from 9 to 5 can find a diversion for a  few minutes reading Page 2, Page 3, and the  Sports Guy’s insight on what it means to be a  Red  Sox  fan.  ESPN  the Magazine  has  reached a circulation of 1.7 million in just five  years and won the National Magazine Award  for General Excellence in 2003. ESPN Zone  restaurants in eight cities serve as the ideal  place to grab a bite and watch the game.  ESPN’s signature program, SportsCenter,  has developed a cult following and many viewers will admit to watching multiple episodes of  the same sports report back-to-back-to-back. It  has touched all corners of the globe with locally produced episodes in Canada and Brazil,  a Spanish version for the rest of Latin America, China,  India, and Taiwan. SportsCenter  has not only helped create sports superstars,  its personalities have become stars  in  their  own  right. Chris Berman, Keith Olbermann,  Bob Ley, Greg Gumbel, Dan Patrick, Stuart  Scott, and Craig Kilborn have become celebrities and their vernacular has become the language of the sports fan.  Not to be forgotten is the major role ESPN  has played  in  the expansion of women’s  sports. Who would have thought in 1979 that  the NCAA women’s  lacrosse national championship game would be shown in front of a  national television audience? Or that the highest rated basketball  telecast ever on ESPN  would be the 2004 NCAA women’s basketball  championship, won by the University of Connecticut. That includes more than 6,000 men’s  and women’s basketball games. Where else  can young girls aspiring to become the next  Mia Hamm watch their heroes?  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today in congratulating Bill Rasmussen for his  crazy  idea  and  thanking ESPN President  George Bodenheimer and all the folks at Bristol U. for their passion and dedication to bringing  the wonderful world of sports  into  living  rooms 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I  am proud  to say  that ESPN  is  in  the First  Congressional District and I wish you 25 more  years of success.  f  RIBS TO OUR TROOPS  IN  IRAQ—  COURTESY OF THE HOLTVILLE  ATHLETIC CLUB  HON.

308,,108,-0.575,226,2004-09-08,Mr. HINCHEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the City of Poughkeepsie in Dutchess  County, New York, which is part of the 22nd  Congressional District  that  I proudly serve.  This year marks the 150th Anniversary of the  incorporation of  the City of Poughkeepsie.  I  am pleased to recognize the City of Poughkeepsie and the important contributions it has  made to Dutchess County and to the State of  New York.  Located along  the banks of  the majestic  Hudson River, the City of Poughkeepsie is situated in the heart of Dutchess County. European settlers chose the site because it was  surrounded by unbroken and abundant waterways. These waterways provided  the early  settlers with the source of energy needed to  power their water wheels and mills, beginning  a long tradition of economic ingenuity that the  City  of Poughkeepsie  continues  to  demonstrate today.  Poughkeepsie was the first seat of county  government and, during the American Revolution, General George Clinton mobilized  the  Continental Army  activities  from  the  city.  Spared  from battle during  the war, Poughkeepsie became  the second capital city of  New York State in 1777. In 1788 the Ratification Convention for New York State, including  Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, assembled  at  the courthouse, debated, and ratified  the  New York version of the Bill of Rights to be included in the Constitution.  Poughkeepsie has been home  to many  milestones over time, including the publication  of  the  first newspaper  in New York State  which, by 1791, became  the Poughkeepsie  Journal that is still being read today. Poughkeepsie was also home to the introduction of  the magnetic telegraph in 1846. By the 1850’s  manufacturing had become  the city’s staple,  providing employment at businesses such as  the  Poughkeepsie  Glass Works,  Poughkeepsie  Iron Works, and  J.O. Whitehouse  Boot and Shoe Factory. Poughkeepsie was  home  to Governor George Clinton’s  recommendation that ‘‘an act for the encouragement of schools’’ be passed,  leading  to  the  idea of public  funding of education  in New  York State. In subsequent years the city became known as a stanchion for the promotion  of education, and was home  to numerous  learning  institutions  such  as  the Eastman  Business College and Riverview Military Academy.  In 1854 Governor Myron Clark signed the  papers making the incorporation of the City of  Poughkeepsie official. Since  the  late nineteenth century, Poughkeepsie has grown by  leaps and bounds. Manufacturing jobs at companies  like Fiat Motors and Western Publishing have driven economic growth. The construction  industry  completed  such  notable  projects  as  the Mid-Hudson  Bridge,  the  Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge and, under the  direction of  the Works Progress Administration, the U.S. Post Office. Cultural and social  initiatives  such  as  John  Collingwood’s  Bardavon Opera House and Vassar Brother  Hospital are still icons in the City of Poughkeepsie.  Cities  like Poughkeepsie are an essential  component of our nation’s past, present, and  future, and deserve to be honored and recognized for their numerous contributions to our  states and country. Mr. Speaker, it gives me  great pleasure to recognize the City of Poughkeepsie, New York as it celebrates the 150th  Anniversary of its incorporation.  f  RECOGNIZING THE SELECTION OF  STEPHEN  WARNER  TO  THE  UNITED STATES OLYMPIC TEAM  HON.

309,,108,0.661,233,2004-09-08,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Steven R. Heape, a proud member  of the Cherokee Nation. He was born in Long  Beach, California on March 25, 1951. His family eventually moved to Fullerton, where Steven  graduated  from Fullerton Union High  School. Steven also attended Fullerton Junior  College as a Business Administration Major,  while working as a Major Account Representative for Armor Food Company.  His  interest  in motion picture production  eventually led him to produce the film titled,  ‘‘Location to Recovery,’’ one of the first education docudramas to be released from 16mm  film to VHS videotape.  In 1994, Mr. Heape and business partner  Chip Ritchie  formed Rich-Heape Films,  Inc.,  certified by the Cherokee Nation to focus on  the history and preservation of the American  Indian culture. Today, Rich-Heape Films is an  internationally  recognized  firm with  several  award-winning films to its credit. The American  Indian Chamber of Commerce awarded it the  2003 American Indian Business of the Year.  In August, Mr. Heape was one of five Native  American  filmmakers  invited  to participate  in  the strategic film and video content planning  for the new Smithsonian’s National Museum of  the American  Indian  in Washington, D.C.  In  March 2004, Mr. Heape began the most challenging project of his career, producing a two-  hour PBS documentary on the Indian Removal  Act of 1830, better known as  the Cherokee  Trail of Tears scheduled for release in 2005.  On September 12, Mr. Heape is being recognized by the Little Eagle Free Foundation  for his contribution and philanthropy  in preserving the languages, history and cultures of  Native Americans.  It is only fitting that Mr. Heape is to be commended for his extraordinary efforts to document and preserve Native American culture  and the part played in American History.  f  CONGRATULATING  PARK  UNITED  CHURCH  MAGNOLIA  METHODIST  HON.

Belchik was a 30 year old native of the  Godfrey-Alton area in southern Illinois. He was  killed on August 22nd in what is believed to be  an ambush that resulted in a mortar detonation killing him and two other soldiers.  Cpl. Belchik was a 1992 graduate of Alton  High School, in Alton Illinois. Not enough can  be said about  the great sacrifice  this man  made  for his country, he made  the ultimate  sacrifice. He  is survived by his wife, Mary  Belchik; his mother, Lynn Lenker of Godfrey;  his  father, Stephen Belchik of Staunton; his  brother Brian Belchik of Alton and his sister,  Julie Prats of Chicopee, Massachusetts. My  thoughts and prayers go out  to his  families  and loved ones.  Cpl. Belchik gave his life in an effort to improve the lives of others. This sacrifice should  never be forgotten. Cpl. Belchik, along with so  many other brave men and women, put their  lives on the line day in and day out. My sincere thanks goes out to them all.

312,,108,-0.455,240,2004-09-08,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the first ever ‘‘National Attention Deficit Disorder Awareness Day.’’ This  day, made official by Senate Resolution 370,  will serve as an important tool in furthering the  national education campaign about Attention  Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, also known as  AD/HD.  Although AD/HD can affect people across  racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines, poor  and minority communities have been especially underserved by the available resources.  The disorder can  interfere with school and  workplace activities, lead to antisocial behavior, and even substance abuse and problems  with the justice system. It is only recently that  AD/HD has  received national attention, so  there are still many children and adults who  remain undiagnosed and suffering  from  the  stigma associated with this disorder.  Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/  Hyperactivity Disorder  (CHADD), a national  non-profit organization, was founded in 1987  to  increase awareness and offer  resources  and encouragement  to  those suffering  from  the disorder and  their  family members. Recently CHADD has expanded into Santa Cruz  County with the creation of Chapter #605, and  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to welcome  them  to our community. Only  through  education and understanding can we, as a nation, begin to address the effects of this disorder and seek ways to treat it.  It is important to realize the effect AD/HD  can have on individuals and communities, and  I would like to commend the efforts of CHADD  Chapter #605 in their goal of expanding understanding of  this disorder. Through combining grassroots campaigns with  the new  ‘‘National Attention Deficit Disorder Awareness  Day’’ we can begin to address this problem on  both a local and national level.  Dudley DeZonia, who has successfully been  at the helm for 30 years as President of Royal  Truck Body.  Businesses like Royal Truck Body are the  backbone of this country and they are an enduring symbol of  the American Dream. The  approximately 23 million businesses of  the  size and scale of companies like ROYAL in  the United States employ more  than half of  the country’s private work force, create three  of every four new jobs, and generate most of  America’s innovations.  For example, 30 years ago  in my district,  Mr. DeZonia had a dream to lead a truck body  business in the City of Paramount. California.  His long-term vision for Royal Truck Body was  and still  is  to deliver  top-quality products at  competitive prices, which has enabled  the  ‘‘ROYAL’’  trademark  to become  the  recognized  leader and  largest service body company in the Western United States.  Royal Truck Body has a 5,000-square-foot  design studio and 145,000 square  feet of  manufacturing  and  warehousing  space.  ROYAL pushes this space even further with  an additional 40,000 sq. ft. at its satellite locations in Phoenix, Arizona; Dallas, Texas; and  Sacramento, California.  Royal Truck Body has had a continuing pattern of growth since  its  inception, and  its  growth  recently has been at an ever-accelerating pace. In 1995, ROYAL became a bailment pool company for Chevrolet; in 1997, it  became a converter pool company  for both  Ford and GMC; and in 2000, it added Dodge.  ROYAL has also been a member of the National  Truck  Equipment  Association  since  1978.  Royal Truck Body has grown  from producing four truck bodies per day to more than  35 bodies per day. ROYAL earned  its  ISO  9001 certification in 1999, which made it the  first body manufacturer in the United States to  achieve this goal. From 2001 to 2003, ROYAL  was awarded General Motors Specialty Vehicle Sales Leader Award in the United States.  Also, in 2002, Ford presented ROYAL with the  Top Volume Pool Account Award and  the  Ford’s Directors Award for top volume of F-  Series chassis cabs.  Mr. DeZonia  is a business success story,  and he continues to make many contributions  to  the  local community. He consistently donates to the local Paramount Education Partnership and  to seniors at Paramount High  School for college scholarships. ROYAL prides  itself in its employees’ successes because its  employees are its family.  Today, let us honor Mr. Dudley DeZonia. By  celebrating Mr. Dudley DeZonia’s successes,  we  celebrate  American  enterprise.

After  serving nine years as the principal for Aspen  High School, Kendall announced his  retirement after the completion of the 2004–2005  academic year. As Kendall prepares for retirement,  let  it be known  that  I, along with  the  Aspen community am grateful for the commitment he has shown to educating our next generation of leaders.  Kendall started his career in education as a  high school teacher thirty-one years ago. After  spending much of his career positively influencing students in the classroom, he had the  opportunity to have a different impact working  in administration. Nine years ago, Kendall accepted the job as the principal at Aspen High  School. During his tenure as principal, Kendall  has led the charge to improve the quality of  and access to education in the area. Following  his lead, the school added accelerated classes  as part of the International Baccalaureate program. His most significant achievement was to  complete the forty-one million dollar renovation  and expansion of the high school.  Mr. Speaker, Kendall Evans has done a remarkable job during his career at Aspen High  School. As principal, he has provided tremendous  leadership  for  the  faculty, and as a  teacher, he has provided insight for his students. I thank him for his commitment to education, and wish him all the best in his last  year at Aspen High School.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

315,,108,-0.205,240,2004-09-08,Mr. DAVIS of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, as  Congress debates issues of vital importance  to our Nation’s education and defense, I would  like to take a few minutes to say thank you to  a well respected individual in the 4th District of  Tennessee.  After spending over thirty plus years on the  bench, as a General Sessions Part I Judge,  Judge Jimmy Matthews decided to retire due  to deteriorating health. Judge Matthews, a life-  long  resident of Maury County, Tennessee,  will be sorely missed for his wisdom, courage,  and determination to effectively serve the law  and all it protects.  Matthews was Maury County’s  first  lay  judge and will be its last (a lay judge does not  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:16 Sep 09, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08SE8.079 E08PT1 ",2004
316,,108,-0.53,12,2004-09-17,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Mark Kohl, a teacher at Lodi High  School, who was recently named Wisconsin  Teacher of the Year. Kohl is one of only four  teachers to receive this honor. His success as  a teacher comes from the trust and encouragement he gives his students. He allows his  students to establish the standards and expectations that govern the classroom, and encourages them to take ownership of their learning.  Education  is put  into action  in Kohl’s classroom where both teacher and students voice  the characteristics of the kind of teacher and  student  they want  to be, and  together  they  pledge to be the very best. Activities such as  these make Kohl and his students partners in  the learning process.  Beyond  the classroom, Kohl  is  the school  district’s  forensics coach. For more  than 20  years he has taken the time to teach and motivate students in the art of public speaking. In  addition, he is an active participant in the community. He helped  found  the Lodi Stepping  Stones  Theater  and  volunteers with  the  Friends of the Arts group as well as the Lodi  Challenger 4–H. Every year he assists  in a  weekend community reading of the local classic, ‘‘The Sand County Almanac.’’  Students, colleagues, and parents are fond  of Kohl and his work both at school and in the  community. His students attest  to his caring  nature and his ability to understand them and  encourage them to reach their potential. Fellow Lodi High School colleagues admire his  teaching style that allows him to connect with  students and engage them both in the classroom and the world around them. Parents of  Kohl’s students are appreciative of his work to  prepare their students for life beyond school  and their place in the community.  Mark Kohl’s success and impact as a teacher is reflected in each of the students he has  inspired over his many years of  teaching at  Lodi High School.  I  join Kohl’s  family and  friends,  the Lodi community, and  the Wisconsin Department of Education in congratulating him as Wisconsin Teacher of the Year.

318,House,108,0.284,6,2004-09-29,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for the time.  I just wanted to speak on another  issue, if I can just for a minute. An earlier speaker mentioned the FBI and  funding, and I  just wanted to make  sure the record, since the CONGRESSIONALRECORD is supposed to be a factual document,  to  let  the Members  know on both sides, since September  11, 2001, the Committee on Appropriations has supported the FBI’s transformation, increasing the FBI’s budget  nearly 50 percent from $3.1 billion in  fiscal year 2000 to $4.6 billion in fiscal  year 2004.  These funding increases have allowed  the FBI  to  increase  the number of  Joint Terrorism Task Forces to 100;  create the Office of Intelligence; create  the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, which the administration has done  with FBI, CIA, Homeland Security,  who meet together every day; the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force;  and  the Terrorist Screening Center;  hire thousands of new agents and analysts and support staff, including 620  additional linguists; create new training programs for agents and analysts;  and upgrade the technology capabilities.  We have National Academy of Public  Administration looking at the reformation of the FBI. The General Accounting Office, the Congressional Research  Service, and the 9/11 Commission in its  report  referenced  the work  of  the  House Committee on Appropriations. It  must have been a misunderstanding,  but I just want the Members to know  that, as we look in the record, this  Congress, both sides, and this administration have increased the FBI budget  by dramatic numbers.  ",2004
319,House,108,-0.409,6,2004-09-29,Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island.," Mr.  Speaker, I never could have thought I  would see it, a House that is run by a  conservative majority that is bent on  imposing its will on the minority.  We have seen it many times, but, Mr.  Speaker,  it  is so  interesting to see  that, this morning, we are taking up an  issue, we are enforcing our will upon  the people of this District of Columbia.  Whereas, we would not even allow any  other State or this Congress to dictate  its will against the interests of our own  local communities, we are prepared to  do that to the District of Columbia.  It should not be any surprise, I suppose, to our delegate, the gentlewoman  from  the District of Columbia  (Ms.  NORTON). She has seen  it too many  times where she represents a populace  here in Washington, D.C., that does not  have the vote, does not have the vote  here in the Halls of Congress. It does  have a vote, however, on the local management of the city, not until today.  Today, the Congress says, not only  will you not have a vote in the Halls of  the Congress, not only as United States  citizens will you be denied the right to  vote, but you will also be denied in  your own local government to decide  what is in the best interests of your  people.

320,House,108,-0.416,13,2004-09-29,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct  conferees.  The Clerk read as follows:  Mr. Neal of Massachusetts moves that the  managers on the part of the House, on the  disagreeing votes of the two Houses to the  Senate  amendment  to H.R.  4520,  be  instructed as follows:  1. The House conferees shall be instructed  to include in the conference report an effective rate reduction for income from production activities in the United States, and such  an effective rate reduction—  A) shall be provided in the form of a deduction as in the Senate amendment, and shall  not be provided in the form of a corporate  rate reduction, as in the House bill,  B) shall be available to all businesses (including  farmers,  farm  co-operatives,  subchapter S corporations, and other unincorporated businesses) engaged in U.S. production activity as in the Senate amendment,  C) shall include the provisions of the Senate amendment that adjust the size of the effective rate reduction based on the respective portions of the taxpayer’s business in  the United States and overseas in order to  provide the largest effective rate reduction  for businesses that have not moved operations offshore, and  D) shall include the provisions of the Senate amendment (not included in the House  bill) that ensure that the rate reduction will  not be available for income attributable to  cost savings resulting from purchasing imported parts or outsourcing labor overseas.  2. To the maximum extent possible within  the scope of conference, the House conferees  shall be instructed to not include any increase in tax benefits for the overseas operations of multinationals.  3. The House conferees shall be instructed  to develop a conference report that will not  increase the  federal deficit  in either the  short or long term. In doing so, the House  conferees also shall be instructed:  A. To include in the conference report the  provisions of the Senate amendment that  eliminate tax benefits for companies that reincorporate overseas, and the provisions of  the Senate amendment that restrict corporate tax avoidance transactions, including  codification of the economic substance doctrine and the provisions directly targeted at  transactions utilized by the Enron corporation, and  B. Shall drop the provision of the House  bill that provides for private collection of  Federal tax liabilities.  4. The House conferees shall, as soon as  practicable after the adoption of this motion, meet in open session with the Senate  conferees, and the House conferees shall file  a conference report consistent with the preceding provisions of this  instruction at a  time permitting passage before the adjournment before the election.

321,House,108,0.384,20,2004-09-29,Ms. DUNN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman very much for the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the motion to instruct, and I urge my  colleagues to vote against it.  The jobs bill before us is urgently  needed. We need it to remove the international sanctions put upon our United  States products by the European Union  that are hurting sales of U.S. goods  overseas and are jeopardizing jobs here  in the United States.  We need the jobs bill to help promote  job creation here in the United States  by reducing taxes on United States  manufacturers.  We need the jobs bill to update provisions in the tax code that are decades  old and penalize American companies  and keep them from competing with  foreign companies.  We need the jobs bill to move forward  in the spirit of the bipartisan progress  that has already occurred and has been  made on these issues.  The provisions that some are contesting here on the floor right now won  bipartisan support in the other body  and also here on the House floor. This  bill is not about moving jobs overseas.  It is about creating incentives to keep  jobs right here in the United States.  We need to move the jobs bill to conference, and we should do it without  delay. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the motion to  instruct, to support going to conference  so that we can bring back a conference  report that everybody can support.  ",2004
322,House,108,0.362,20,2004-09-29,Mr. MCCRERY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, this Democratic motion  to instruct conferees reflects what is  their increasingly obvious 19th century  state of mind. One would think, listening to the comments of our colleagues  on the left, that we are back in the industrial  revolution, or maybe,  they  have moved forward to the first part of  the  20th  century, mid-20th  century,  maybe even right after World War II,  when the United States was not only  the biggest and baddest bear in the industrial woods but just about the only  bear  in the  industrial woods. Those  times have changed. This is the 21st  century. The market has changed significantly.  One of my colleagues on the Committee on Ways and Means pointed out  that he learned from Goldman Sachs  that, over the last couple of years, we  have  seen  300,000  to  500,000  jobs  outsourced, in other words, American  companies creating 300,000 to 500,000  jobs off our shores in foreign countries.  That is true.  But what he did not tell my colleagues and what he could have found  out at Goldman Sachs or from our own  Department of Commerce is that, during that same period of time, even  more than 300,000 to 500,000 jobs were  created here in the United States by  foreign companies wanting to access  our market. That is the 21st century  market. No longer are we building infrastructure  to  transport American  made goods from the east coast to the  west coast like we did in the 19th century. Those were great days, but today,  American  companies  have  to  build  some of their things overseas to access  those markets, to compete with the numerous companies that are in competition with them today, unlike the 19th  century and mid-20th century.  In today’s market, we dadgum better  get over there and compete, or we will  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:43 Sep 30, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29SE7.053 H29PT1 ",2004
323,House,108,-0.389,27,2004-09-29,Mrs. CAPPS.," I thank my colleague  from  the District  of Columbia  for  yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. Our troops are struggling in Iraq. The budget deficit is at  an all-time high. The Republican-led  Congress has failed to finish its work  on the budget, on appropriations bills,  the highway bill, all of the legislation  vital to keeping our country going, and  the response from the Republican leadership? Pass a bill repealing gun laws  in the District of Columbia.  Mr. Speaker, this is a bad bill on its  own merit and an affront to the citizens of Washington, D.C. The citizens  of this District have the right to enact  laws to make their neighborhoods safer  without interference from the Congress  and the NRA. This is election-year politics practiced at the expense of District residents who do not even have a  vote in the House or the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, the fight against terrorism is a focus of this Presidential  campaign, as it should be, and the fight  against terrorism  is a given  in our  daily lives. We live in a time of high  alerts. Checkpoints now ring this Capitol. Yet passage of this bill into law  would certainly not aid  in our war  against terrorism. It would in fact encourage proliferation of weapons in the  immediate vicinity of the Capitol, the  White House, the Supreme Court, and  scores of Federal agencies and foreign  embassies located throughout this city.  One would think that our congressional leadership would want us to support the policemen and -women who  work to protect us and these institutions which are such national symbols,  all of which present tempting targets  for terrorists or the deranged.  But this legislation would undermine  the efforts of our local law enforcement and put our police at even greater risk. It is an antipolice bill, abuse of  congressional power, and an attempt to  draw attention away  from what we  should be working on. I urge my colleagues to vote down this ill-conceived  measure.  ",2004
324,House,108,0.565,27,2004-09-29,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of this legislation. I learned  a long time ago serving in the Colorado  State legislature that criminals do not  care about the laws we pass. They do  not know who their Congressman is.  They do not know who their Senators  are. They do not have respect for law  or lawmakers.  Right here in Washington, D.C., there  are many things that we are extremely  proud of. One of the things, though,  that really is a blot is the infamous  distinction as the murder capital of the  world. I think that we need to give  criminals who would commit heinous  crimes  in this District of Columbia  pause. I think we ought to make them  wonder whether or not an individual  that they would harm, whether or not  they are going to harm a family or try  to rape a woman or murder someone,  give them pause, let these criminals  wonder if that individual might be able  to defend themselves.  It is important when we think that  businesses  in  this District, business  owners can have guns on the premises,  but individuals cannot have guns that  are ready to use in their homes to protect their family. All of us know that  our family members are more important to us than any material possession  that we have. We need to give individuals in the District a right to defend  themselves and we need to give these  criminals that make this the murder  capital of the world a doubt in their  mind as to whether or not someone will  be able to defend themselves.  ",2004
325,House,108,-0.464,27,2004-09-29,Ms. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, let me say how much I appreciate  the Delegate from the District of Columbia for carrying on the good fight.  It is ironic that this bill proposes to  implement constitutional rights to the  District of Columbia when in fact this  body has not allowed the District of  Columbia to have a voting Member of  the United States Congress and voting  Members of the United States Senate.  This is a cruel hoax under the guise of  a constitutional amendment.  I watched some of the hearing yesterday, and it was ironic. This bill was introduced a year ago. Since it was introduced, I thought it had gone to the  mortuary and that rigor mortis had actually set in on it, and I was applauding it. But then I found out yesterday  that  it was  just  in a calling period  where people could come by the pew,  sign the book until you got over 200  signatures on the book, and then you  get it out.  This bill also came out after this  House celebrated the  life of Ronald  Reagan who was shot in this city, the  District of Columbia. And I apologize  to Mr. Brady who  is still paralyzed  from a bullet shot in this District. The  President said he wants more minorities to join the party of Lincoln because he was the Great Emancipator.  Lest we forget, Abraham Lincoln was  assassinated, too, by a bullet. He was a  Republican. Garfield was a Republican.  He was assassinated.  We are so patronizing. We know what  is best for the District of Columbia.  The chief of police said they do not  want the bill. The Mayor says he does  not want the bill. The council does not  want the bill. The newspapers had an  editorial against the bill, and we are  going to impose this anyway.  As we speak today, we are memorializing a police officer who came from  the gentleman’s district, Fort Wayne,  Indianapolis, and was killed last week  by a bullet. A month before that, we  memorialized  another  police  officer  that was killed by a bullet, and I bet  nobody on this bill ever visited one of  the families of the grandmothers that  were killed in this District.  This bill is one of the worst pieces of  legislation that I have seen as a Member of this House, and I apologize to  the grieving families for it.  b1330  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the  life of William ‘‘Count’’ Basie and his  influence on  jazz and  swing music.  Born in Red Bank, New Jersey, Count  Basie began to learn the piano under  his mother’s  direction.  In  1924, he  moved to New York City to perfect his  talent and begin his remarkable career.  Throughout the years, he developed  and advanced his own music style. In  1935, Count Basie formed his own nine-  piece  group  called  the  Barons  of  Rhythm. The Barons of Rhythm’s style  was a powerful one. This earned Basie  the nickname ‘‘Count.’’ By the end of  the 1930s, the band was one of the most  popular in the world, with hits like  ‘‘One O’clock Jump’’ and ‘‘Jumpin’ At  the Woodside.’’  Count Basie continued to share his  talent with  the world  through  the  1970s. In 1985, one year after his death,  President Reagan  awarded him  the  Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1996,  the U.S. Post Office honored him with  a commemorative stamp.  Today, Mr. Speaker, we honor the  100th anniversary of the birth of Count  Basie and acknowledge the tremendous  impact he had on music.

333,Senate,108,-0.205,146,2004-09-29,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  also rise to oppose this amendment by  the Senator from Pennsylvania. This  is, as Senator COLLINShas indicated, a  matter we discussed in what I thought  was a very thoughtful discussion in our  committee deliberation on a similar  amendment.  There are good arguments on both  sides. The objective here is to balance  the independence we want our national  intelligence director to have with the  importance of having a trusting relationship with  the President of  the  United States. In the end, I concluded  it would be wrong to give a fixed term  to the national  intelligence director  for the reason to which I just heard  Senator COLLINSrefer.  Remember, we have given the national intelligence director two main  responsibilities. One is to administer  the intelligence community. The other  is to be the principal intelligence adviser to the President of the United  States. In fact, one could argue, although the national intelligence director as administrator has many customers, if you will, for intelligence, the  No. 1 customer is the President of the  United States as President and certainly as Commander in Chief. So that  is a relationship that must be a trusting relationship.  The  danger  is  that  an  incoming  President will be given  someone  in  whom he does not have that kind of  confidence. Unfortunately, history—recent history—gives us an example of  that, without attributing blame. President Clinton and then-Director of the  FBI, Mr. Freeh, had a relationship that  was  not mutually  confident,  and,  therefore, he had somebody  in that  critical position who had very  little  contact with  the President  of  the  United States. He was Director of the  FBI, not the principal personal intelligence adviser in the sense of giving  advice personally to the President of  the United States.  The concern about the independence  of the national intelligence adviser is  an important one. I feel very strongly  that in this bill Senator COLLINSand I  offer, and our committee offers to the  Senate, we have done a lot to protect  the independence of the national intelligence director.

335,,108,-0.364,258,2004-09-29,Ms. MAJETTE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise today to honor a true  patriot for his heroic courage under fire—Lieutenant Tyler Brown.  Lieutenant Brown, who was  from Atlanta,  Georgia, made the ultimate sacrifice on September 14, 2004, when he gave his  life  in  service to our country while on duty with the  United States Army in Iraq. His untimely and  unfortunate passing serves as a reminder that  freedom comes at a terrible cost, and that we  all live in a free land because so many like  Tyler have died  to protect  those cherished  freedoms.  Although Lieutenant Brown was with us but  for an all too brief time on this earth, he will  forever remain in the hearts of the family and  friends who so dearly loved him. The example  he set by his service, by his devotion, and by  his loyalty to his country will, like a beacon,  shine a ray of light through the darkness to  show the way for all those who follow in his  footsteps.  I’m confident that, by answering his nation’s  call to service, Lt. Brown understood all too  well  that he,  like so many other brave men  and women, could be thrust into harm’s way  in the pursuit of peace and liberty and the protection of freedom. These are perilous times,  and events taking place throughout the world,  even within our own borders, have sharpened  our  focus on  the grave dangers around us.  Yes, Lt. Brown understood the nature of his  service, and stepped forward proudly to represent the best that is within us. With great  admiration and respect, we honor him today.  In spite of the tears that are flowing, and the  sharp pain residing deep within us, may we be  comforted by the knowledge that Tyler is now  safely in God’s hands, that he has been welcomed home with a warm, secure and loving  embrace.  I offer my condolences  to his  family and  friends. We all share your grief; we all mourn  your loss. My prayers are with you. JOE SKEEN FEDERAL BUILDING  HON.

336,,108,0.382,258,2004-09-29,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, last week the  House approved H.R. 3734, which would designate the federal building located at Fifth and  Richardson Avenues in Roswell, New Mexico,  as the ‘‘Joe Skeen Federal Building.’’ Naming  this building after our late colleague would be  a  tremendous honor  to his memory and his  family, and I strongly support this legislation to  accomplish that goal.  Representative Skeen was a dedicated patriot who answered the call of his country by  joining the Navy and the Air Force Reserves.  He built his life on helping people, serving his  neighbors and fellow citizens in the New Mexico State Senate before being elected to the  U.S. House of Representatives as a write-in  candidate in 1980. He served in this venerable  body for 22 years, the longest-serving Member  of the House from New Mexico. He was respected by his colleagues and  loved by his  constituents  for being honest,  caring, and  hard-working.  I had the privilege of serving with Joe for 20  years in Congress, and I am proud to have  been his friend. I remember many conversations I had with Joe over the years. He spent  much of his  time on  this  floor sitting  in  the  ‘‘Florida corner,’’ delighting us with his wonderful sense of humor and thoughtful opinions.  He is greatly missed.  Mr. Speaker, Joe’s death from Parkinson’s  disease in December 2003 may have closed  the book on a life characterized by unfailing  public service, but  it did not extinguish his  memory, which lives on in the hearts of his  family, his  friends, and  the Members of  this  body. The ‘‘Joe Skeen Federal Building’’ will  stand as a testament to the great New Mexican who served his constituents and the people of the United States so tirelessly for many  decades. I thank my colleagues for honoring  Joe by approving H.R. 3734. f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  CESAR HERNANDEZ  HON.

SOLISand myself,  to honor  the amazing achievements of  the  women athletes at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. In particular, I want to celebrate  the success of  the United States Women’s  Soccer Team, who made us proud by winning  a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics, beating  Brazil 2–1 in overtime, on August 26, 2004.  I would especially  like  to  recognize Julie  Foudy  and Brandi Chastain,  our  honored  guests for a Congressional Caucus for Women’s  Issues  reception  today, Tuesday, September 28, 2004, celebrating the accomplishments of  female U.S. Olympic athletes. As  Captain and 16-year veteran of the U.S. Women’s National Team, Julie Foudy is one of the  most influential athletes in the United States.  Through the end of 2003, she had started in  229 of the 239 games in which she appeared,  including all six of  the world championship  events played by the U.S. women. And if that  was not impressive enough, she scored in all  four of the Women’s World Cup tournaments.  Her teammate, Brandi Chastain, another longstanding player on the U.S. Women’s Soccer  Team, provided one of the greatest moments  in the history of sports with her penalty kick on  the USA’s  fifth shot  in  the 1999 Women’s  World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl.  These women have become some of  the  most  famous athletic  role models on earth.  They have taught our children that if you work  hard and you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything. Indeed, these women are  helping  to  fundamentally change perceptions  about athletics. It is no surprise that our little  girls look up to these strong, motivated women  for inspiration. But to also see little boys wearing  jerseys emblazoned with  the names of  their  favorite women players  is a wonderful  sight. The accomplishments of this generation  of women athletes demonstrates the profound  impact that Title IX has had on increasing opportunities in sports for women and girls. Title  IX, part of the Education Amendments of 1972  requiring that public schools and colleges provide equal educational and athletic opportunities for girls and women, has unquestionably  been a tremendous success.

338,,108,-0.491,265,2004-09-29,Ms. KILPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor one of the State of Michigan’s longest serving public officials Mr. Andrew Swiecki.  Andy was born on August 2, 1939 in the city  of Wyandotte, the forth of five children of Andrew and Sophia Swiecki. He attended school  in Wyandotte, and after graduating  from Mt.  Carmel High School he attended the University of Detroit and graduated with a degree in  Industrial Relations in 1963.  He is married to the former Pat Prosniewski,  and they are the parents of three children: Andrew Kenneth, Jeffrey Allen and Susan Nicole  Swiecki-Radel. Andy, and his wife Pat, have  three grandchildren and are expecting a fourth  grandchild in 2005.  First elected to Wyandotte’s City Council in  1967, Andy served on  the Council  for 12  years, being elected to six 2-year terms. He  was then elected Wyandotte’s City Treasurer  in 1979 and has been re-elected to that position 10 times. Andy has served the citizens of  Wyandotte for 37 years.  He is a member in good standing of many  clubs and professional organizations,  including: Wyandotte Goodfellows; Downriver YMCA  Board; Wayne County Treasurers Association;  Downriver Community Conference; Southeast  Michigan  Community  Alliance;  Municipal  Treasures USA/Canada Association; Chairman  of Wyandotte Employees Retirement  Commission;  the Polish Legion of American  Veterans; St. Stanislaus Kostka Club 30; Our  Lady of Mt. Carmel Church Ushers Club and  Holy Name Society; Polish Roman Catholic  Union; Knights of Columbus; and many others.  Andy was named Citizen of the Year by Wyandotte Service Clubs in 1990 and was honored as Volunteer of the Year by the YMCA in  2003.  As you can see Mr. Andrew Swiecki is well  deserving of our  recognition  for his many  years of service to his community. f  PLEDGE PROTECTION ACT OF 2004  SPEECHOF  HON. DENNIS MOORE  OFKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 23, 2004 The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2028) to amend  title 28, United States Code, with respect to  the jurisdiction of Federal courts inferior to  the Supreme Court over certain cases and  controversies involving the Pledge of Allegiance: ",2004
339,Senate,108,0.415,242,2004-10-07,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. President, I wish  all of my colleagues could have been on  the floor to hear the remarks from the  distinguished Senator  from  Indiana,  who is a very valued member of the Intelligence Committee. We have some  very good members on both sides of the  aisle.  Senator BAYH always asks  incisive  questions. He gets to the bottom of the  very comprehensive and complex issues  we discuss. I thank him for being a valued member of the Intelligence Committee. I want to thank him for offering this amendment, which, outside the  beltway and I suppose on the floor of  the Senate and for anybody listening  or watching, is pretty mundane, or arcane: What on Earth  is he  talking  about, ‘‘on-demand sequential referral  of legislation, reporting from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’’?  Were it not for the fact that Senator  is an excellent speaker and a  highly  appreciated Member  of  this  body, probably nobody would be even  understanding this, or paying any attention.  I know this Senate wants to get this  bill done. I know we want to go to conference on intelligence reform. I know  we have the tax bill. I know we have  the omnibus bill. I know people want  to leave for the weekend. People are  tired, and Lord knows we have been  wrestling with this issue on how we reorganize the Intelligence Committee to  make it more effective, in line with  what  the  9/11 Commission has  recommended, what every commission has  recommended  down  the  years—the  Bremer Commission, the Gilmore Commission,  the Hart-Rudman Commission, the CIS Study, all these commissions, not to mention the 24 times we  have tried reform of the Intelligence  Committee since Dwight David Eisenhower and  failed  in each and every  case. I know the  fatigue  factor, the  high-glaze  factor has set  in  in this  body, as evidenced by the membership,  as evidenced by my dear colleagues and  friends across the aisle now talking  about something else, even though I  could probably talk as loud as the Senator from Massachusetts. But, having  said that, let me try to tell Members  what this is about.

340,House,108,0.26,11,2004-11-16,Mr. KING of New York.," Mr. Speaker,  I move to suspend the rules and pass  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 110) recognizing the 60th anniversary of the  Battle of the Bulge during World War  II.  The Clerk read as follows: H.J. RES. 110 Whereas the battle in the European theater of operations during World War  II  known as the Battle of the Bulge was fought  from December 16, 1944, to January 25, 1945;  Whereas the Battle of the Bulge was a  major German offensive in the Ardennes forest region of Belgium and Luxembourg which  took Allied forces by surprise and was intended to split the Allied forces in Europe by  breaking through the Allied lines, crippling  the Allied fuel supply lines, and exacerbating  tensions within the alliance;  Whereas 600,000 American troops, joined by  55,000 British, Belgian, Canadian, and other  soldiers, participated in the Battle of the  Bulge, overcoming numerous disadvantages  in the early days of the battle that included  fewer numbers, treacherous terrain, and bitter weather conditions;  Whereas the Battle of the Bulge resulted in  81,000 American and 1,400 British casualties,  of whom approximately 19,000 American and  200 British soldiers were killed, with the remainder wounded,  captured, or  listed as  missing in action;  Whereas  the worst  atrocity  involving  Americans in the European theater during  World War II, known as the Malme´dy Massacre, occurred on December 17, 1944, when 86  unarmed American prisoners of war were  gunned down by elements of the German 1st  SS Panzer Division;  Whereas American, British, Belgian, Canadian, and other forces overcame great odds  throughout the battle,  including most  famously the action of the 101st Airborne Division in holding back German forces at the  key Belgian crossroads town of Bastogne,  thereby  preventing German  forces  from  achieving their main objective of reaching  Antwerp as well as the Meuse River line;  Whereas the success of American, British,  Belgian, Canadian, and other forces in defeating the German attack made possible the  defeat of Nazi Germany four months later in  April 1945;  Whereas thousands of United States veterans of the Battle of the Bulge have traveled  to Belgium and Luxembourg  in  the  years since the battle to honor their fallen  comrades who died during the battle;  Whereas the peoples of Belgium and Luxembourg, symbolizing their friendship and  gratitude toward the American soldiers who  fought to secure their freedom, have graciously hosted  countless veterans groups  over the years;  Whereas Luxembourg has erected over 90  monuments and plaques commemorating the  liberation of Luxembourg by United States  Armed Forces during World War II;  Whereas the 60th anniversary of the Battle  of the Bulge in 2004 will be marked by many  commemorative events by citizens of the  United States, Belgium, Luxembourg, and  many other nations;  Whereas the friendship between the United  States and both Belgium and Luxembourg is  strong today in part because of the Battle of  the Bulge; and  Whereas section 204 of the Veterans Benefits Act of 2002 (38 U.S.C. 2409 note) authorized the Secretary of the Army to place in  Arlington National Cemetery a memorial  marker honoring those who fought in the  Battle of the Bulge: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled, That Congress— (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the  the battle in the European theater of operations during World War II known as the  Battle of the Bulge, which began with a German surprise attack in the Ardennes forest  region  of Belgium  and Luxembourg  and  ended with an Allied victory that made possible  the  defeat  of Nazi Germany  four  months later;  (2) honors those who gave their lives during the Battle of the Bulge;  VerDate jul 14 2003  05:25 Nov 17, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K16NO7.032 H16PT1 ",2004
341,House,108,0.57,18,2004-11-16,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Indiana for putting  together this hour.  Mr. Speaker, it is my high honor tonight to welcome two new Members of  the Texas delegation. First from out in  west Texas, Texas 11, we welcome Representative MIKECONAWAY.

MIKE  CONAWAYhas volunteered his time to  serve the citizens of Texas on the board  for 7 years, including more than 5 years  as chairman. He has served as chairman and board member of the Family  Services of Midland, Texas. He and his  wife, Suzanne, have four children and  four grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, my next-door neighbor,  my new next-door neighbor in Texas 24,  is Representative KENNYMARCHANT.  is a  former Carrollton City  councilman and mayor of that city.

Madam Speaker, it is my honor to  welcome  these  two members of  the  Texas delegation. We are indeed fortunate. And, as the gentleman from Indiana pointed out,  ‘‘Don’t mess with  Texas.’’  ",2004
342,Senate,108,0.361,95,2004-11-16,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, today I  want to recognize a truly great citizen,  a great tribal  leader and a miltary  hero, John  ‘‘Roddy’’ Sunchild. The  Rocky Boy Tribe of North Central  Montana, the State of Montana and the  United States of America have lost an  outstanding leader, citizen and soldier.  And for those of us who had the privilege of knowing him, his family and  colleagues, we have lost a great father,  grandfather, husband and friend.  John ‘‘Roddy’’ Eagle Sunchild, Sr. an  enrolled member of the Chippewa Cree  Tribe of the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation was born June 30th, 1930, the  grandson of Sunchild, an early leader  of the Cree people. He attended schools  on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation  in Montana in his youth.  Roddy was a quiet, unassuming man.  At the same time, he was a fierce advocate for his community and his people  and a courageous warrior/soldier for his  country. He possessed a gentle, understated sense of humor that put people  at ease and, at the same time, made  points more eloquently than long-winded speeches.  At age 17, Roddy enlisted in the U.S.  Airborne Paratroopers and was immediately assigned to a tour in Korea. It  was during his time with the 4th Airborne Ranger Company that he distinguished himself as one of the most honored members of the 187th Regimental  Combat Team. Roddy  received citations which included the Master Parachutist Badge, Airborne Glider Badge,  the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with  Double Valor, the Purple Heart, the  U.S. Good Conduct Medal, Korean Campaign Medal, the U.S. Presidential Unit  Citation, the French Fourragere, and  Master Sergeant. The highest level he  attained in the military was an E7.  Roddy and his wife Florence, a retired teacher for the Rocky Boy Elementary School system, have four children, nine grandchildren, and one great  grandchild.  In 1984, he was elected to the Tribal  Business Committee, where he advocated for tribal education opportunities for his people, along with better  health services. His leadership, while  serving as Chairman  for  the Stone  Child College Board of Directors, was  the primary catalyst for the college in  achieving full accreditation. He initiated various wellness programs for the  Chippewa Cree Tribe and sought opportunities  for  individual  improvement  though health, education, and a stronger tribal government.  In  1992, Roddy was elected Tribal  Chairman and during his tenure the  Chippewa Cree Tribe sought, and was  awarded, a Self-governance Compact  from the U.S. Department of Interior  Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA. Roddy  was a staunch proponent  for Tribal  Higher Education and  for  improved  Health Care for his people. Roddy was  very  well  known  throughout  the  United States and Canada for his active involvement in the well being and  improvement of Indian Country.  Over the past several years, Roddy  founded and served as the Chief Executive Officer for the National Tribal Development Association, NTDA, which  administers federal grants and cooperative agreements to enhance the governance and economies of Indian Reservations. The NTDA also works to promote inter-tribal trade and commerce  and create programs that serve as a  hand up, rather than a hand-out.  Roddy  exemplified what  could  be  construed as a true modern warrior. He  was able to advocate and promote modern ways in order to ensure that Natives could compete in today’s world.  While doing this he still held on to and  practiced his true traditional and cultural ways. He was one of our Sundance  leaders, and had earned the right to  practice various other cultural ceremonies. His presence played an integral  part in most cultural ceremonies held  on the Rocky Boy’s Reservation.  Family was of particular importance  to Roddy. What Roddy enjoyed most  was being at home with his family. He  especially  enjoyed his many grandchildren. Roddy was an active member  of numerous Native American organizations and associations and was a  great advocate  for Native American  Veterans, especially on the Rocky Boy.  Roddy not only set an example for  others to follow, he set about his life’s  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:13 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S16NO4.REC S16NO4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

He was honored at  the Greater  Wilkes-Barre Labor Council Dinner at Pittston  Convention Hall on October 29, 2004.  George Vitanovec has been a dedicated  Teamster since 1968. He worked  for Acme  Warehouse in Forty Fort for 22 years and represented the members as their shop steward.  George was first elected as Vice President of  Local 401 in 1990 and then elected President  of Local 401 in 1993. He was elected for five  consecutive  terms and  retired on June 30,  2004.  George was a veteran of the United States  Army and served a  tour of duty  in Vietnam  from  1965–1966. He was  honorably  discharged in 1967.  George has been involved with many organizations such as  the Greater Wilkes-Barre  Labor  Council,  Teamsters  Joint  Council,  Teamsters  International and also  the United  Way just to name a few. He has been dedicated to many organizations within the community. He was a coach for St. Therese Little  League, South Wilkes-Barre Mini Mohawks,  Founder and President for the YMCA wrestling  program and was also a baseball coach for  Meyers High School. He is a member of the  St. Nicholas Church, Holy Name Society,  North End Slovak Club and  the Brookside  American Legion. He is also an avid fisherman  and hunter.  George is above all a dedicated husband,  father and grandfather. He is married to Shirley Morio Vitanovec. He has a daughter Kerry  Ann, a son George Jr., a son-in-law Kevin and  a  daughter-in-law  Susan.  He  has  twin  grandsons Michael and Patrick Flaherty.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you and my esteemed colleagues in the House of Representatives please join me in congratulating George  Vitanovec and wish him all the best for a well  deserved retirement.  f  HONORING  THE  CENTRAL  NEW  JERSEY CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INDUSTRIAL  SECURITY  HON.

344,,108,0.244,130,2004-11-16,Mr. FERGUSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the Central New Jersey Chapter of  the American Society for Industrial Security on  their 25th Anniversary.  In 1979 a group of  ASIS members chaired by Douglas Goode  convened  to  form  the Central New Jersey  Chapter which has now grown to include over  300 members who represent  the public and  private sectors of the Security Industry.  ASIS is the preeminent organization for security professionals, with more  than 33,000  members worldwide. Founded in 1955, the organization is dedicated to increasing the effectiveness and productivity of security professionals by developing educational programs  on broad and specific security concerns. ASIS  also advocates the role and value of the security management profession to business, the  media, government entities, and the public.  I commend all the members of the Central  New Jersey Chapter of ASIS for their tireless  work concerning the state of security in Central New Jersey. Their efforts are an excellent  reflection on ASIS  international and make  Central New Jersey a safer place  for  those  who live and work there.  f  A PROCLAMATION IN MEMORY OF  SERGEANT RICHARD MORGAN  HON.

345,,108,-0.631,137,2004-11-16,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to two of Hayward, California’s outstanding  citizens, Carl  and Marilyn  Baker-Madsen.  Marilyn and Carl are celebrating 50 years of  service as they retire from their employment in  the city of Hayward.  Marilyn has been the Library Director of the  Hayward Public Library since October 1985.  During her  tenure,  the Library has  implemented a number of programs and services  with outstanding demonstrable outcomes that  are models for libraries in other cities. In the  fall of 1996, Marilyn was recognized at  the  California Library Association Annual Conference as Librarian of  the Year  for outstanding service to libraries. In January 2000,  she received the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Celebration Committee  Annual Community  Service Award which honors individuals who  have contributed substantially to keeping Dr.  King’s work alive and active in the Hayward  community. In October 2001, she received the  Hayward City Employee Award  for  volunteering in the community beyond work commitments.  In November 2003, Marilyn received  the HEARTS  of Service Award  for  demonstrating commitment  to  the organizational  values of the city of Hayward.  Carl is retiring from his position as equipment manager for the city of Hayward. He is  described as an employee who goes beyond  the call of duty to serve his community and  stands  tall  in his  field. He has volunteered  over many years, in many capacities to benefit  Hayward. He was named Hayward City Employee Volunteer of the Year.  Carl and Marilyn have been very active supporters of  the Hayward Arts Council and  its  projects. Both have been  tireless volunteers  on behalf of the arts programs and services at  events, such as Cinco de Mayo, Youth Pride  fairs, Kids’ Art Day and Farmer’s Market and  police department neighborhood events where  Carl has helped set up and staff booths that  provided free art projects for children.  Carl describes himself as ‘‘a Friend of the  Library . . . Director.’’ Through the years, he  has given more and more of his own time to  ease  the work of  the Library staff. He has  been active at Literacy Plus receptions,  the  Celebrating Cultures in Harmony Festival and  major outdoor book sales. Friends of the Library know  they can count on Carl  to contribute to the success of Library events.  The Baker-Madsen’s have worked with exemplary commitment to enhance the quality of  life in Hayward, California. Their contributions  have been felt at the Hayward Public Library,  the Hayward Arts Council, in City Hall, as well  as  in  the many community venues  in which  they participate.  I join their friends and admirers in expressing appreciation and a hearty  thank you  for  exemplifying the ‘‘Heart of the Bay’’ at its very  best.  f  HONORING JUDY LICHTMAN FOR  THIRTY YEARS OF LEADERSHIP  HON.

346,,108,-0.386,144,2004-11-16,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge  the achievements of Empire City  Iron Works, the oldest and largest steelmaker  in New York City. For the past 100 years, Empire City  Iron Works has played an  integral  role in developing New York’s distinctive urban  landscape. At a time when many of its competitors are struggling, Empire City’s specialized service and ability to adapt to changing  market conditions make  it a model  for new  businesses in the region.  Empire City Iron Works was established in  1904 by Leopold Heffner, an ironworker who  immigrated to the United States from Austria.  Early in its history, Empire City produced cast  iron frames and covers for coal-delivery holes  installed in New York City sidewalks, some of  which remain to this day. During World War II,  Empire City’s employees worked diligently to  provide  supplies  to  the U.S. Navy,  constructing ammunition boxes and gun racks, as  well as watertight doors for ships produced in  the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In later years, Empire  City made enormous contributions  to New  York City’s power grid, one of the most reliable networks in the country. In cooperation  with Consolidated Edison, the company built  almost every power plant  in  the New York  metropolitan area.  Today, Empire City  Iron Works  furnishes  and installs a wide range of metal products including steel pan and ornamental stairs, structural steel, railings and walkways. On occasion, it works directly with artists, cutting and  fitting pieces to create sculptures according to  the artist’s specifications. The company has  also  undertaken  a  number  of  high-profile  projects in recent years, such as the extensive  renovation of the Museum of Modern Art and  the construction of the first new building at the  World Trade Center site. With projects ranging  from the Time Warner Center in Manhattan to  the Atlantic Center Mall  in Brooklyn, Empire  Iron Works continues to thrive; at present, it  has more than 75 employees at its factory in  Long Island City, Queens.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request that my  distinguished colleagues join me in paying tribute to this fine company and its exceptional  work in New York City. I wish the management and employees of Empire City  Iron  Works another 100 years of success.  f  REMEMBERING WILLARD T.  ‘‘BILL’’ HODGE  HON. TIMOTHY V.

347,,108,0.264,144,2004-11-16,Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, on  September 21, 2004, Willard T. ‘‘Bill’’ Hodge  got on his  tractor  to clear some brush and  weeds from his farm. It would be the last time  this prolific farmer would tend to his historic  and treasured land, but his contributions to agriculture  in  Illinois will be  remembered  for  many harvests to come.  Bill Hodge started  farming  in Champaign  County in 1956 on his farm in Seymour, Illinois, which to this day remains one of the oldest  farms  in  the county.  In  the 1970’s, Bill  served on  the Champaign County Zoning  Board where he had the opportunity to venture  from township to township listening to the concerns of area  farmers. Mr. Hodge used  this  experience to come to Washington, DC to tell  agriculture’s story  to members of Congress.  He also served on former Representative Ed  Madigan’s Farm Advisory Committee.  In 1981, The News Gazette named Bill  Hodge Farm Leader of the Year. He served  on  the Champaign County Forest Preserve  District  from 1987  to 1993 during which he  was credited for leading the district stably and  successfully.  Bill Hodge cared deeply about what was  good  for his  fellow  farmer. This  intertwined  with his interest in local politics as he made  successful efforts  to get his colleagues  involved in the process.  While many in Champaign County feel the  loss of Bill Hodge, comfort can be taken in the  fact that he passed away on a gorgeous Tuesday  in September doing what he  loved  the  most. Whether it was tending to his own farm  or helping the agriculture community in Champaign County, Bill Hodge always left the land  in better shape than he found it.  He will truly be missed.  f  IN CELEBRATION OF NATIONAL  BIBLE WEEK NOVEMBER 21–28, 2004  HON. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 16, 2004  ",2004

These  three  distinguished  individuals  have worked  diligently and selflessly to advance the cause of  human rights and social equality, and  I am  proud to recognize their many achievements  on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.  I was honored to be invited to attend the  International  Humanitarian  Awards  Dinner  hosted by the World Union for Progressive Judaism, which represents over 2,000,000 progressive  Jewish  congregations  in over 41  countries. This respected organization seeks  to strengthen modern Jewish life through supporting congregations; integrating Jewish religious traditions with inclusiveness and gender  equality; and advancing social  justice  in  the  spirit of  tikkun olam, which means repairing  the world.  Sheila Lambert’s professional experience includes twenty years at The Dun & Bradstreet  Corporation. Her extensive volunteer experience focuses on Jewish continuity and helping  underserved and disadvantaged populations,  particularly women and children.  A member of the board of Project Kesher,  Sheila is the Founder and Board President of  Bottomless Closet, and  is a member of  the  Board of Governors and Overseers of Hebrew  Union College Jewish Institute of Religion.

She is also a member of the  Advocacy Council for the Citizen’s Committee  for Children.

349,,108,0.367,151,2004-11-16,Mr. BONNER.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pride and pleasure  that  I rise  to honor Mr.  John Saint, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Mitchell Corporation in Mobile, Alabama, on the occasion of his being honored  by  the Mobile Civitan Club with  its 56th  Mobilian of the Year Award.  A native of Sand Mountain, Alabama, and a  veteran of the Vietnam War, John Saint has  been actively involved in the life of the Mobile  community for many years. The Mitchell Company is one of the leading real estate and development companies in the southern United  States, and its official work in the community  is matched by its dedication to the families of  Mobile and their needs. Under the guidance  and  inspiration of John Saint,  the company  has become one of the leaders in the area of  charitable giving in south Alabama.  Each year, the Mitchell Company sponsors  a ‘‘Giving Tree’’ fundraiser, in which area students contribute hand-made Christmas ornaments to decorate a tree in the company’s offices. For each ornament received, the company makes a contribution to charity, and the  success of  this program has been  tremendous. Under John Saint’s leadership, the company in 2003 donated over $18,000 to Saint  Mary’s Home, a facility in Mobile that provides  temporary shelter and residential treatment for  abused and neglected children. Additionally,  Mobile County schools which participated  in  the ‘‘Giving Tree’’ program received $20,500  in donations. All told, the ‘‘Giving Tree’’ program has over the years contributed a total of  $70,000 to Saint Mary’s Home and $113,500  to area public, private, and parochial schools.  Along with the ‘‘Giving Tree’’ program, the  Mitchell Company  provides  free meals  at  Camp Smile, a summer program  for adults  with disabilities, and Camp Rap-A-Hope, a  summer program for children battling cancer.  The company also makes  its corporate  jet  available to transport cancer patients to their  chemotherapy appointments in states outside  of Alabama and serves as the corporate sponsor for the Lady’s Professional Golf Association.  The Civitan Club received numerous worthy  nominations  for  men  and  women  from  throughout Mobile who in their own way also  make significant contributions to their friends  and neighbors on a daily basis. I am certain  it is difficult to make the final selection for the  Mobilian of the Year Award, but as in the past,  this year’s winner has shown a level of community support and charitable giving  in  the  Mobile area which  is,  in my opinion, unmatched anywhere else  in  the state. John  Saint gives as much as he does to his community, and inspires many other friends and  coworkers to do likewise, simply because he  says such a spirit of generosity comes naturally to him. There are hundreds of families in  Mobile, Alabama, whose lives are richer because of his natural desire to support his fellow man.  Along with his many family, friends, and colleagues, both  in Mobile and  throughout  the  f  THE CASE OF MIKHAIL  TREPASHKIN  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 16, 2004  ",2004
350,,108,0.16,151,2004-11-16,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  there is reason to fear for the fate of rule of  law in Russia. I want to present one relevant  example.  Mikhail Trepashkin, an attorney and former  Federal Security Service, FSB, officer was arrested on October 24, 2003, a week before he  was  scheduled  to  represent  in  legal proceedings the relatives of one of the victims of  a terrorist attack in Moscow. Mr. Trepashkin’s  American client is Tatyana Morozova of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In September 1999, Ms.  Morozova’s mother was killed and her sister  barely survived the bombing of an apartment  house  in Moscow. Officially,  the crime was  blamed  on Chechen  separatists,  but Mr.  Trepashkin was expected to present the findings of his investigation which suggested involvement of elements of the FSB in the 1999  apartment bombings in Moscow as well as an  aborted attempted bombing  in  the  city of  Ryazan.  Mr. Trepashkin had been a consultant to the  public commission set up by prominent human  rights activist and former Duma Deputy Sergei  Kovalev  to  investigate  the 1999 bombings.  The Kovalev  commission asked many unpleasant questions but got precious  few answers from the authorities. Meanwhile, in the  course of his investigation Trepashkin discovered evidence that didn’t track with the official  version of  the bombing  incidents. This  included events in Ryazan, where a bomb in an  apartment basement was discovered by local  police and safely detonated hours before  it  was due to explode. The two suspects in that  case were released after presenting FSB identification documents. The whole incident was  later declared a ‘‘readiness exercise’’ by Russian authorities.  Several months later, the co-chairman of the  Kovalev Commission, Duma Deputy Sergei  Yushenkov, was assassinated in front of his  home. Four persons were convicted of  the  murder. Another member of the Commission  died of food poisoning in a hospital, another  was severely beaten by thugs, and two members lost their seats in the Duma. The activities of the decimated commission came to an  abrupt halt.  A week before  the October 24, 2003  trial  opened,  the police  just happened  to pull  Trepashkin over on the highway, and just happened to find a revolver in his car. Trepashkin  claims  the gun was planted. Three weeks  later, he was put on trial and sentenced to 4  years labor camp by a closed court for allegedly divulging state secrets to a foreign journalist.  Mr. Speaker, I don’t know all the details of  this case, but  it  looks very much  like Mr.  Trepashkin was prosecuted in order to prevent  him from releasing potentially damaging information regarding the activities of the FSB.

351,,108,0.528,158,2004-11-16,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to submit the following remarks for  the Record.  We have before us H.R. 4518, the ‘‘Satellite  Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization  Act of 2004’’ (SHVERA). The bill will also be  known as ‘‘The W.J. ‘Billy’ Tauzin Satellite Television Act of 2004,’’ in honor of our former  House Energy  and Commerce Committee  chairman. Naming this bill after Chairman Tauzin is only fitting, as he has done so much to  foster  the growth of satellite  television,  increase television service competition, and improve choices for consumers. Chairman Tauzin  is currently recovering  from a bout with  cancer. My understanding is that he is doing  so with his  characteristic  vigor and good  humor, and is faring well. I am sure all join me  in wishing him a speedy recovery.  H.R.  4518  reauthorizes  certain  expiring  communications and copyright act provisions  that govern  the  retransmission of broadcast  television signals by direct broadcast satellite  (DBS)  providers  such  as  DirecTV  and  EchoStar. It also modernizes other provisions  to enhance consumer choice, increase parity  between satellite and cable operators, and further promote competition. Because the bill implicates both communications and copyright  issues,  the House Energy and Commerce  Committee and  the House Judiciary Committee have worked closely in drafting the legislation.  Indeed, pursuant to a compromise between  the House Energy and Commerce Committee  and  the House  Judiciary Committee, H.R.  4518 has now been amended to combine its  copyright provisions with the Communications  Act provisions of H.R. 4501. H.R. 4501 resulted from an extensive examination of satellite  television  issues  in  the House Energy  and  Commerce  Committee.  The  Subcommittee on Telecommunications and  the  Internet held an oversight hearing on March  10, 2004, and a legislative hearing on April 1,  2004. The Subcommittee then marked up legislation on April 28, 2004, and the full Committee marked up legislation on June 3, 2004.  That legislation became H.R. 4501. The Committee filed a report on H.R. 4501 (H. Rept.  108–634) on July 22, 2004.  What follows is a section-by-section analysis  of some of the Communications provisions in  Title II of H.R. 4518, as amended, that have  changed from the provisions that originated in  H.R. 4501. Mr. Upton, Chairman of the House  Energy  and Commerce Subcommittee  on  Telecommunications and the Internet, also will  address some of the changes.  SECTION202. CABLE/SATELLITECOMPARABILITY  Section 340(a) authorizes a satellite operator to retransmit an out-of-market signal to a  subscriber in a community if the signal is significantly viewed over the air in the community. A satellite operator may carry such a signal whether or not the station is affiliated with  a network, as evidenced by section 340(a)’s  reference to the carriage of ‘‘the signal of any  station located outside the local market’’ that  is significantly viewed, as opposed  to any  ‘‘network station’’  (emphasis added).  In  the  cable context, the FCC allows a cable operator to carry the digital signal of a broadcast  station as significantly viewed once the FCC  has ruled that the analog signal of the station  is significantly viewed. In re Carriage of Digital  Television Broadcast Signals, CS Docket No.  98–120, First Report and Order & Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 01–22, at  ¶ 100. In implementing Section 340, the FCC  should  treat  satellite operators  in a  comparable  fashion  to  cable operators  to  the  greatest extent possible with respect  to carriage of significantly viewed stations, in terms  of both current and future significantly viewed  rulings.  Section 340(a) also provides that a satellite  operator may carry an unlimited number of  significantly viewed signals, just as a cable operator may. Section 340(a) does so by explicitly stating  that satellite operators may  retransmit  such  signals  ‘‘[i]n addition  to  the  broadcast signals  that subscribers may  receive under section 338 [governing carriage of  local signals] and 339 [governing carriage of  distant signals].’’ This clarification  for significantly viewed signals  is necessary because  section 339 of  the Communications Act (47  U.S.C. §339) prohibits a satellite carrier from  providing a household with the signals of more  than two distant affiliates of a particular network per day.  Section 340(a)(1) provides that satellite operators are allowed  to carry as significantly  viewed any signal that the FCC has previously  determined to be significantly viewed for purposes of cable carriage subject, however, to  the FCC’s network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. Satellite carriers are  authorized upon enactment of SHVERA  to  carry such signals.

352,House,108,0.495,13,2004-12-06,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  HOLDEN) for his contribution, as well,  to this effort, and also more especially  thank him for the kind words he has  extended to our colleague, the gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. STENHOLM),  who has served this Congress with distinction  for 26 years, the  last 8 of  which as the ranking member of the  Committee  on  Agriculture.  He  is  known across the country as somebody  who has helped American agriculture.  He worked with my predecessor, our  colleague Congressman Combest, his  neighbor, former neighbor in Texas, to  write the last farm bill which has been  a noteworthy success in the first almost 4 years now of its implementation. He is somebody that I will miss as  my partner in working with American  agriculture, and I thank him and commend him for more than a quarter century of service to the people of this  country.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
353,House,108,-0.263,13,2004-12-06,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  strong support of S. 2856. This important legislation clarifies Congress’s intent in the last  Farm bill—that administrative costs needed to  implement  voluntary  conservation programs  should flow from the Commodity Credit Corporation and not from the working lands programs themselves. It is crucial that we pass  this bill  today otherwise scarce conservation  funds will once again be lost.  Mr. Speaker, USDA has diverted more than  $200 million from four working lands conservation programs. Specifically, USDA diverted  precious funds from the Environmental Quality  Incentives Program (EQIP), the Farmland and  Ranchland Protection Program  (FRPP),  the  Grasslands Reserve Program, and the Wildlife  Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to pay for  administrative costs.  The 2002 Farm Bill clearly intended USDA  to use mandatory funds from the Commodity  Credit Corporation to pay for the administrative costs of  two  land  retirement programs.  The plain language of the statute and legislative history, including a critical colloquy, support  this  interpretation of  the Farm Bill, and  GAO concurred in a recent memo. But, government lawyers misinterpreted the 2002 Farm  Bill and forced USDA to divert working lands  funds.  Despite  the  funds provided by  the 2002  Farm Bill, most farmers and ranchers offering  to restore wetlands and grasslands or offering  to change the way they farm to improve air  and water quality are still rejected when they  seek USDA conservation assistance. For example,  farmers and ranchers  face $3 billion  backlog when they seek financial assistance  through the Environmental Quality Incentives  Program  to  improve water quality or wildlife  habitat. These  long  lines only grow  longer  when funds are diverted.  By providing new  funds  for working  lands  programs  like EQIP and WHIP  in  the 2002  Farm Bill, Congress  provided  needed  resources  to  help  farmers manage working  lands to produce food and fiber and simultaneously enhance water quality and wildlife  habitat. For example, EQIP helps share  the  cost of a broad range of  land management  practices that help the environment, including  more efficient use of fertilizers and pesticides,  and innovative technologies to store and reuse  animal waste.  Lastly, because 70 percent of the American  landscape is private land, farming dramatically  affects  the health of America’s rivers,  lakes  and bays and the fate of America’s rare species. Most rare species depend upon private  lands for the survival, and many will become  extinct without help from private landowners.  When farmers and ranchers take steps to help  improve air and water quality or assist rare  species, they can face new costs, new risks,  or loss of income. Conservation programs help  share these costs, underwrite these risks, or  offset losses of income.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is an  important bill  to  America’s hardworking farmers and ranchers  and I urge my colleague’s support.  ",2004
354,House,108,0.556,20,2004-12-06,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material  on the subject of H.R. 5394, the bill  under consideration.  ",2004
355,House,108,-0.266,20,2004-12-06,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my  colleague  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN). He has worked very  diligently on this issue. I know he personally is an avid sportsman and takes,  therefore, more than passing interest  in these matters. He also does very  well representing the constituents involved in the domestic manufacture of  arrows.  This has been a hard one to get right.  We first passed it in 1997, trying to address this issue. The language in the  FST bill that passed just a few weeks  ago we thought took care of it. We had  the joint tax and Treasury Department  involved in getting that language correct, and only now we are finding that  it is going to be a new tax to be collected by about 10,000 sports retailers.  Mr. Speaker, we want to fix this, and  we want to fix this one right, quick. So  I am going to ask for support on this  motion today.  I would like to, in the course of my  remarks, however, address an  issue  raised by  the gentleman  from New  York (Mr. RANGEL), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and  Means, and his statement will be made  a part of the RECORD.  He had offered for the chairman a  deal to bundle in a unanimous consent  package the bow and arrow fix, plus a  provision to address the circumstances  of the Virgin Islands and other territories under the corporate tax reform  bill, the FST bill mentioned earlier, as  well as something to address the devastation in Haiti, and so I would just  read a couple of paragraphs from his  statement because I think it is appropriately before the body.  The  ‘‘Ways and Means Committee  Chairman THOMASknows that the bows  and arrows correction could have been  handled by unanimous consent.’’ There  had been a request that a correcting  provision from the FST/ETI bill also be  included to assist the Virgin Islands  and some attention provided to the  devastation  affecting  the  people  of  Haiti.  ‘‘The recently enacted FST/ETI legislation contains a provision that will  adversely affect the economic development programs of the Virgin Islands  and other possessions.  ‘‘The provision denies the Virgin Islands the ability to provide economic  incentives to companies doing business  in the Virgin Islands if they have some  U.S. source income.’’  It is also clear that House leadership  is unwilling to provide assistance to  poverty-stricken Haiti. ‘‘Obviously, our  neighbor  in  this hemisphere  is not  viewed as so urgent that  it cannot  wait. I am talking about a country  that is so poor they bake clay and pretend it is bread.  ‘‘It is unclear to me why’’ the Haiti  trade preferences bill could not have  been brought up by year end.  I agree that, to summarize the ranking member’s feelings, it is fine to address this bow and arrows provision,  absolutely fine. We have some issues  we  also  wanted  addressed,  circumstances  about  possession  under  FST/ETI and something to be done to  address the pathetic circumstance of  Haiti, and that would have been our  preference also at year end.  Having now stated what our preferences would have been, let me again  summarize the minority position on  this bill. It needs to be corrected. We  want it corrected. We do not think it  should have taken three times to get  right, but here we are. We are willing  to get it right this time.  I again salute the gentleman from  Wisconsin’s (Mr. RYAN), my colleague,  efforts who have been untiring and in  the end will today prevail in getting  this right.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.  ",2004
356,,108,0.54,34,2004-12-06,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Polly E. Hodges, who is retiring on January 7, 2005 from her post as Chief Financial  Officer of the Congressional Budget Office. I  would like to take this opportunity to thank her  for her service to CBO and to the Congress.  Polly was born and raised in Arkansas. She  began her postsecondary studies at Hendrix  College but obtained her bachelor’s degree in  accounting and business, cum  laude,  from  San Antonio’s Trinity University. Soon afterward, she earned the Certified Public Accountant designation and honed her professional  skills at Tenneco, where she rose to the position of senior auditor. After a brief  flirtation  with the idea of medical school, she became  chief accountant to Jacuzzi Brothers, Inc., and  then  joined CBO’s staff on December 21,  1981.  Polly began her career at CBO as Finance  and Budget Officer and was later named its  Chief Financial Officer. For 23 years, she has  overseen the office’s budgetary and financial  affairs and provided sound financial counsel to  each of its six Directors. Polly has played a  major role in developing and executing CBO’s  annual budgets, working closely with its management and with staff of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Even during a  period of tight budgets—not normally a situation  relished by budget officers—Polly was  proud to assist Appropriations Committee staff  in crafting report language that proved useful  in leading the legislative branch through potentially painful funding reductions.  Polly’s service  to  the Congress has extended beyond the confines of CBO—she was  a founding member of the legislative branch’s  Financial Management Council and continues  to provide  that organization with  thoughtful  counsel.  Throughout her years as a public servant,  Polly’s command of  financial methods and  management and her professional and personal integrity have enriched both CBO and  the Congress. Thank you, Polly, for your dedication and service, and we wish you well in  your retirement.  f  HONORING MR. JACK MERKEL  HON. NICK SMITH  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 6, 2004  ",2004
357,,108,0.249,34,2004-12-06,Mr. SWEENEY.," Mr. Speaker, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 106(a)) any foreign  accounting firm that audits an issuer of securities in the United States capital markets shall  be subject to the same regulatory framework  applicable to domestic accounting firms. The  Act requires that foreign audit firms must adhere to the same rigorous standards applicable to domestic firms.  Sarbanes-Oxley also established the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (PCAOB) and directs them to conduct a continuing program of  inspections of  registered  public accounting firms and to investigate alleged violations of the Act, related securities  laws, and auditing and  related professional  practice standards.  The PCAOB recently approved rules under  which non-U.S. regulators would be permitted  to fulfill the inspection and enforcement mission of the PCAOB if the non-U.S. regulator is  judged by the PCAOB to be sufficiently independent and rigorous. What concerns me is  that  the PCAOB might allow  the Canadian  Public Accountability Board to fulfill this mission. This would be a serious mistake.  The PCAOB in looking at its own structure  and mission identified five factors as bearing  upon the independence and rigor of the non-  U.S.  regulatory systems:  (1) The adequacy  and integrity of the non-U.S. system; (2) the  system’s source of funding; (3) the system’s  independence from the accounting profession;  (4) the system’s transparency; and (5) historical performance.  The first looks at the system’s authority to  inspect, investigate, sanction and enforce professional standards of the accounting profession.  The second assesses  the accounting profession’s authority over  the governance and  operation of the non-U.S. regulatory system.  How many accountants have decision making  authority? Are they appointed by government?  Does the government or the accounting profession hold removal power?  The third implicates the accounting profession’s control over  the system’s source of  funds.  The  fourth on  transparency requires open  rule making procedures and periodic reporting  to the public.  With  respect  to historical performance—if  the system is new the PCAOB will not consider this factor.  Consequently, any decision by the PCAOB  to rely on a specific non-U.S. regulator should  require that they pass these minimum tests.  The Canadian Public Accountability Board fails  these tests.  The Canadian Public Accountability Board  has no direct statutory authority.  It has no  oversight mechanism, no  transparency, and  no public interest accountability. It is subject to  the whims of its membership and its governing  structure  is comprised primarily of accountants. Most importantly, the source of funding  for the Canadian Public Accountability Board  is in fact the accounting industry itself.  As the PCAOB moves toward granting reciprocity to foreign organizations to help enforce  Sarbanes-Oxley the Congress will be watching  to make certain that the interests of the American investors and the integrity of the U.S. financial sector are protected.  f  IN MEMORY OF NEW YORK CITY  FIREFIGHTER  AND  ARMY  NATIONAL  GUARD  SERGEANT  CHRISTIAN ENGELDRUM  HON.

Beyond the insight, experience and professionalism  these gentlemen brought  to  this  body,  they represented  the very essence of  what it means to represent New York State in  Congress. They were  loyal  to  their constituencies, and their voters were in turn loyal to  them. Their policy expertise transcended ideological lines, and they understood that, in our  corner of  the world, good people are good  people, regardless of party affiliation. People  voted  for  them year-in and year out on account of who they were as people, and how  hard they worked for Buffalo, Rochester, Corning and  the Southern Tier. JACK and AMO  have nearly 30 years’ worth of experience in  Washington between them, and, though none  of us like the fact that they are leaving us, we  are all grateful to have been the beneficiaries  of  their good humor, wisdom, graciousness  and friendship.  The U.S. Congress, New York State and  our country are better off for having been represented by these two gentlemen. I’ve had the  privilege of serving with JACKand AMO for a  long time and feel fortunate to consider them  good friends. It is my hope the other members  of this body from New York and beyond recognize and applaud  their service,  friendship,  and loyalty to those who have worked beside  them along the way.  I know  I will miss JACKQUINN and AMO  HOUGHTONwhen the gavel falls to begin the  109th Congress; but I join my colleagues in  wishing them the absolute best for whatever  comes next. I take comfort, though in knowing  that departure from this House will not signal  the termination of their public service. Nor will  it be the end of their involvement in the lives  of the people they represented so well, for so  many years.  So as we depart for the year and bring an  end to the 108th Congress, I once again say  good-bye and  thank you  to JACK and AMO  while wishing them the very best for the future.

360,,108,-0.382,48,2004-12-06,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  Joan Eagleson, who was  recently honored  with  the  highest  award  of Sacred Heart  Schools, the St. Madeleine Sophie Medal by  the Schools of the Sacred Heart in Atherton,  California.  An extraordinary educator at St. Joseph’s  School, Joan has said her greatest teachers  are  the children she works with every day.  The children are her delight and lifeline. Joan  believes children are grounding and one has  only to listen to their truth and see their beauty. Joan’s ability to really hear children draws  them to her and she is always there for them.  Joan received her MA in Counseling from  the College of Notre Dame. Recognizing the  need  for children  to be heard, she spearheaded the Middle School Advisory Program  and  the Rainbows Program. Joan  is marvelous at helping children recognize the light  and  love  in  themselves. One student said,  ‘‘Have you ever noticed how good you  feel  about  yourself  after  talking  with  Mrs.  Eagleson?’’ What better  testimony  to Joan’s  ability to bring out the best in a person.  When Sister Ann McGowan, RSCJ hired  Joan 16 years ago, she was given the opportunity to teach and run the library. Joan recalls  with gratitude Sister Helen Daly’s mentoring.  Sister Daly saw in Joan the capacity to become a bridge where children could find consolation and support  in  the new and mysterious world of books and learning. Anyone  who has ever walked through St. Joseph’s library can feel it is a welcoming place of comfort,  warmth,  trust  and  generosity.  Joan  doesn’t fit the stereotype of the librarian who  only says, ‘‘Shh, be quiet.’’ Joan creates an  atmosphere  of  enthusiasm  for  learning,  a  place where children have time to discover, to  be curious,  to be  imaginative,  to know  the  value of not knowing and then, of asking the  question and knowing how and where to find  the answer. Most  importantly, Joan guides  children  to  recognize  that what  is essential  they have within.  When asked what she hoped for the children  to  learn at St. Joseph’s School, Joan  said, ‘‘the value of simplicity and balance in  life; the value of time to be; the value of being  present to the moment; the value of embracing life wholeheartedly; the value of working in  community;  the value of human  touch;  the  value of experiencing  joy  in  the process of  learning.’’  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring this great and inspiring educator,  Joan Eagleson, as she is honored with the St.  Madeleine Sophie Medal.  f  RECOGNIZING THE MCGRAW HIGH  SCHOOL LADY EAGLES ON THEIR  SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP  HON.

Under the leadership of coaches John  and Kathy Rutan, they concluded an amazing  undefeated  season with winning  the  state  championship. Their  impressive 24–0 record  was the first perfect season for the Lady Eagles, as well as the first state title in school  history.  I would like to recognize goalkeeper Christy  Mott, forwards Taryn Bilodeau, Jen Rutan, and  midfielder Laura Buerkle for their outstanding  individual  achievements. Christy Mott was  awarded the State Tournament Class D Goalkeeper award, as well as an Honorable Mention in the Central Counties League All-Stars.
