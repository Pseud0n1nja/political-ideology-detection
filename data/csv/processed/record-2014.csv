1,House,113,-0.426,15,2014-01-07,Mr. TONKO.," Take a break, as they  say.  You can’t have  it both ways. You  can’t deny all these  legislative bills  that are advanced to the Congress or  initiated by Members of the House that  would speak to job growth. The President has sent forward on behalf of the  administration a number of bills that  would grow our economy, grow the climate to enhance job growth.  You can’t  reject  that agenda and  then not  reauthorize  the unemployment insurance benefit package. If you  are going to do that, if you are not  going to reauthorize, then you need to  do the jobs packages that have been  sent here. But to do both, to reject the  job  packages—the  legislation  that  would grow that climate—and also reject the reauthorization of unemployment insurance, reject minimum wage,  reject  the SNAP programs,  that  is  harsh. That is not being guided by a  moral compass, and that is not America at her best.  So  I would  implore with my colleagues on this floor this evening, with  Representative GARAMENDI, Representative HORSFORD, I would implore the  leadership of this House to pursue that  agenda that provides for job creation  and that speaks to economic justice  and  that  responds with  insensitive  measure to those who are unemployed  through no fault of their own who are  actively searching for employment.  We need those job-training programs.  We need the assistance programs, so as  to maintain the economic comeback  from the recession.  ",2014
2,House,113,-0.355,15,2014-01-07,Mr. HORSFORD.," You talked a  great deal about the education, reeducation programs. Research, which we  haven’t covered today. And, of course,  the infrastructure issues.  And by the way—you are using American taxpayer dollars for all of these  things—we ought to be buying American-made products. So we will make it  in America using American taxpayer  dollars.  We talked a lot about infrastructure.  Every dollar you invest, $1.57, pumped  into the economy,  jobs created. Mr.  HORSFORD, you talked about the unemployment in the building trades, very  important. Most people can go back to  work, and this can go immediately.  Oh, by the way, August of this year,  unless we fund and expand the transportation  programs  in  the United  States, there will be no more new bids  for transportation programs. This issue  is before the Congress today.  This one, this is what happens when  you don’t invest in infrastructure. This  is the  Interstate 5 bridge  in Washington just near the Canadian border.  You talk about commerce, it came to a  halt. This bridge collapsed. More than  a couple of thousand bridges  in the  United States are in similar jeopardy  and could collapse. Major infrastructure needs to be done.  This is my district. I have 1,100 miles  of levees, floods. We have a Resource  Development Act bill in conference—I  am fortunate enough to be on that conference committee—and this  is what  we must do. We must improve our levees, we must deal with Superstorm  Sandys, and we must make sure that  we are protecting our citizens.  Once again, how do we pay for it?  Why are we giving the Karzai government $3 billion not knowing how they  are going to spend it? I will tell you  where you can spend $3 billion. You  make sure our levees are sound and up  to date.  Mr. HORSFORD, would you like to join  us and we will do the quick minutes  here.  ",2014

If all  time is used, I would notify Members  our  rollcall  vote will  be  about  11  o’clock.

5,Senate,113,0.529,36,2014-01-07,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President,  I  come to the floor today, and as I do so,  Washington has an  incredible opportunity for a new beginning—a beginning that would begin by listening to  the American people and what  the  American people want, and not  just  what Washington and the Democrats in  this body think  is best  for all the  American people.  According to a new Associated Press  poll, most Americans say health care  reform is the top issue they want the  government to work on this year—the  top  issue  they want government  to  work on this year. Fifty-two percent of  people have said that is what they are  asking us to work on.  People have seen—and I heard about  this  all  around Wyoming  over  the  Christmas holiday—the complete failure of the health care law’s big rollout  last year. They saw President Obama  and they saw Washington Democrats  break one promise after another. As a  matter of fact, one of the President’s  promises was designated ‘‘the lie of the  year.’’ The American people have lost  faith this administration can ever get  health care reform right.  It wasn’t just a bad Web site. The  President said: Well, the Web site was  bad. He said: The health care law is  more than a Web site.  In spite of what the Obama administration has said, it wasn’t all fixed last  year because the Web site is just the  tip of the iceberg. And huge Web site  failures? Absolutely. I heard it everywhere I went around Wyoming, and I  actually even heard it brought up when  I was  in Afghanistan  visiting  the  troops on New Year’s Day.  So it is not just the Web site, with  the higher premiums, canceled coverage, can’t keep your doctor,  fraud  and identity theft, higher copays and  higher deductibles; the Web site continues to be just the tip of the iceberg.  Beyond all of those things we have  been talking about coming down the  line and hitting the American people,  we have also seen even more problems  surface already this year.  Here  is a headline  from the Wall  Street Journal, January 3: ‘‘Consumers  Hit Snags as Health Law Kicks In.’’  The snags? We can imagine what they  are. People have been going to the doctor, going to the pharmacy looking for  help, and even though they signed up  for insurance in the new exchange, it  turns out they can’t be found. They are  not in the system.  So Web site failures? Absolutely. Insurance companies aren’t sure who is  signed up with  them. People aren’t  sure if they are covered. Doctors aren’t  sure who is covered.  Doctors, as a result of their training,  their compassion, their care for human  beings, are trying their best to help  their patients. They have been fighting  a losing battle against the exchanges  and all of the problems with the new  Washington-mandated  health  insurance. One Chicago doctor tried for 2  hours to verify the new insurance for a  patient who was scheduled for surgery.  The office manager  finally gave up.  The doctor went ahead with the surgery without what should have been a  routine approval  from the  insurance  company.  Here is another problem some people  are going to have to deal with this  year. The Associated Press ran an article headlined ‘‘Adding a baby to health  plan is not easy.’’ Every day, babies are  born and need to be included in the  family’s health plan. For common life  changes such as having a baby, you  would normally just call your insurance company and they would take  care of it from there. Not under this  law. If you have to buy your insurance  through one of the new health care exchanges, it is not that simple. According to the article, ‘‘the HealthCare.gov  website can’t handle new baby updates,  along with a list of other life changes  including marriage  and  divorce,  a  death in the family, a new job or a  change in income, even moving to a  different community.’’ Yet the Obama  administration and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services says the  Web site is fixed. It can’t handle a baby  being born, marriage, divorce, moving,  change in income. It can’t handle any  of those things, and they claim it is  fixed.  Here  is another problem that has  turned up. Washington Democrats said  the law would lead to fewer people visiting  emergency  rooms—I  heard  it  right here on this floor: fewer people  getting  their  care  in  emergency  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:32 Jan 08, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G07JA6.031 S07JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 3 K S D n o S E M A J T         ",2014
6,Senate,113,0.434,43,2014-01-07,Mr. SHELBY.," A recent Bloomberg  analysis contains figures that help us  put  this  staggering number—$4  trillion—into perspective.  I also ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the RECORDthat Bloomberg  article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From Bloomberg, Dec. 17, 2013]  FED’S$4 TRILLIONINASSETSDRAW  LAWMAKERS’ SCRUTINY  (By Jeff Kearns)  The Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet  is  poised to exceed $4 trillion, prompting warnings its record easing is inflating asset-price  bubbles and drawing renewed lawmaker scrutiny just as Janet Yellen prepares to take  charge.  The Fed’s assets rose to a record $3.99 trillion on Dec. 11, up from $2.82 trillion in September 2012, when it embarked on a third  round of bond buying. Policy makers meet  today and tomorrow to decide whether to  start curtailing the $85 billion monthly pace  of purchases.  Among Fed officials,  ‘‘there’s discomfort  in the sense that the portfolio could grow almost without limit,’’ former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said last week during a  panel discussion in Washington. Kohn said  there was ‘‘discomfort in the potential financial stability effects’’ and added:  ‘‘There’s  some legitimacy in those discomforts.’’  Fed Governor Jeremy Stein has said some  credit markets, such as corporate debt, show  signs of excessive risk-taking, while not posing a  threat  to  financial  stability. Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the  House committee that oversees the Fed, last  week said he plans ‘‘the most rigorous examination and oversight of the Federal Reserve  in its history.’’  While any effort to rewrite the law establishing Fed powers lacks support from Democrats who control the Senate, the scrutiny is  undesirable for central bankers who believe  ‘‘independence  is  priceless,’’  said  Laura  Rosner, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas SA  in New York.  NOTWELCOME  THEFEDAPPROACHESATAPERONTIPTOE  ‘‘It’s not a welcome development that a lot  more time and focus is spent on answering  questions’’  from Congress, said Rosner, a  former researcher at the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York. Lawmakers may also use  the size of the balance sheet to ‘‘draw attention to concerns they have about the Fed’s  responsibilities and growing role in financial  regulation.’’  Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, whose second  four-year term ends next month, has quadrupled Fed assets since 2008 with bond purchases  intended  to  lower  long-term borrowing costs and reduce unemployment. Vice  Chairman Yellen, who may win Senate confirmation this week to replace Bernanke, has  been a supporter of the policy.  The Fed has said it will keep buying bonds  until the outlook for the labor market has  ‘‘improved substantially.’’ Thirty-four percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg  Dec. 6 predicted the Fed will start reducing  purchases this month, while 26 percent forecast January and 40 percent said March.  ASSETSHELD  The Fed’s balance sheet exceeds the gross  domestic product of Germany, the world’s  fourth-largest economy. It’s enough to cover  all U.S.  federal government  spending  for  more than a year. It could pay off all student  and auto loans in the country with $2 trillion  to spare, Fed data show. The central bank’s  assets are set to exceed the $4.1 trillion held  by BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world’s largest  asset manager.  The  third  round of quantitative easing  probably will total $1.54 trillion before  it  ends, bringing the balance sheet to $4.3 6 trillion, according to economists in the survey.  ‘‘This is a stimulus of the first order. It’s  just unprecedented,’’ Alabama Republican  Senator Richard Shelby said in an interview  last week. ‘‘The Fed is an independent body,  but we can point out what they’re doing.’’  Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond  Fed and a critic of the Fed’s bond buying,  said in a Dec. 9 speech he expects the Fed  policy makers to discuss reducing purchases  at this week’s meeting. Adding to the balance sheet ‘‘increases the risks’’ associated  with exiting stimulus, he said.  ‘REALRISK’  Shelby, a five-term senator and past chairman of the Banking Committee sees ‘‘a real  risk’’ the balance sheet will ignite inflation.  So far, there’s little sign that’s happening: a  measure of prices watched by the Fed rose  0.7 percent in October from a year earlier,  below the central bank’s 2 percent target and  the least in four years.  At 22 percent of the $16.9 trillion U.S. economy, the balance sheet is surpassed by those  of other major central banks as a percentage  of  gross  domestic  product,  according  to  third-quarter data compiled by Haver Analytics in New York. In the euro zone, the figure is 24 percent, and in Japan, it’s about 44  percent.  That doesn’t mollify Republican critics.  When Yellen started to make global comparisons at her Senate confirmation hearing  last month, Shelby interrupted her.  ‘‘I’m asking about the Federal Reserve of  the United States of America,’’ he said.  WARNINGSIGNS  Yellen is set to take over amid warnings  that assets from leveraged loans to farmland  are showing signs of froth.  The Fed and other U.S. banking regulators  have said they want to crack down on underwriting standards in the market for high-  risk, high-yield loans.

8,,113,-0.382,71,2014-01-07,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of an  extraordinary woman, Katherine Agnes McMillan, who passed away at the age of 89 on December 10, 2013. She was  the youngest of  nine children born  to  Irish  immigrants, John  Patrick and Margaret Kearns Trumble, and  was the Valedictorian of her graduating class  at Sacred Heart Academy.  Katherine McMillan served in the Navy as a  nurse, and went on to serve her community  uncommonly well as a devoted RN  for 37  years at Sequoia Hospital where she worked  in  the Emergency Room and was a  legend  there.  After  retiring  from  the nursing profession,  Katherine launched a ‘latchkey’ day care program at St. Pius Catholic Church in Redwood  City, the first of its kind in the Archdiocese of  San Francisco. She provided quality child care  for school age children with her trademarks of  professionalism, discipline and caring.  Katherine gave generously of her time and  considerable talents at Serra High School in  San Mateo,  the school her son Robert attended and she loved. She became the first  woman to earn and be honored with the ‘ ‘In  Via Award’ ’ by this all male school.  Katherine is survived by her beloved daughters, Katherine and Mary, her son Robert  (Julie) and her two adored grandsons, Sean  and Kenny.  I had the privilege of knowing Katherine McMillan for over three decades. With her Irish  pride and her Boston accent, she was a force  of nature, a loyal and loving friend, an extraordinary mother, and a woman of great  faith.  She lived her faith in all she did, and every  day of her life was guided by it.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring the life of a woman who will be  greatly missed by all who had the good fortune  to know her and never be  forgotten.  Katherine McMillan was  a  true  patriot,  a  woman who  loved her  family deeply and  served her community, her church and her  country with great dedication and joy. For this,  the entire U.S. House of Representatives extends its condolences to the McMillan family.  f  CONGRATULATIONS  TO  FRIDA  BAZAN, WINNER  OF  1ST  HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH ESSAY  CONTEST  HON.

9,,113,0.548,71,2014-01-07,Mr. FARENTHOLD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the winner of the 1st Annual  for  Hispanic Heritage Month Essay Contest  the 27th Congressional District of Texas.  Ms. Frida Bazan,  from El Campo High  School, in El Campo, Texas wrote the winning  essay, entitled ‘ ‘Honoring My Hispanic Heritage. ’ ’ I ask that Ms. Bazan’s essay be entered  into the CONGRESSIONALRECORD. It reads as  follows:  Hispanic Heritage makes a great influence  in my life because it is a way of life. This culture is deeply important to me because it represents who I am, how I live my life, and how  I view the world. All these characteristics form  part of my life and personality, which I love,  and lead me to proudly say that I am honored  to be Hispanic.  Hispanic Heritage Month means celebrating  our heritage by sharing stories and informing  others of our  traditions and customs, while  honoring where we came from. As we share  stories about  the  traditional Christmas posadas, Dı´a de los Muertos celebrations, and the  famous Grito de Independencia, we let others  know more about our lives and at the same  time spread our culture.  As a Hispanic,  I have strict, conservative  parents who have made me the person I am  today. I have inherited ideas such as being respectful to our elders, the willingness to work,  attending church, dedicating myself  to help  others, and above all being a strong person  who overcomes obstacles I may face; these  are  important Hispanic  characteristics  that  have been enforced to me by my parents and  grandparents. All  this has helped me during  my lifetime and will continue to lead me in the  correct path as  I aspire  for my  life goals.  I  have many goals for my future, and my biggest dream is to one day become a physician  assistant and make a difference  in people ’s  lives by helping  those  in need. My parents  have  taught me  to use perseverance and  never stop fighting for what I want because I  can reach anything I put my mind to, and I  know that with their advice and my hard dedication I can get very far in life. Hispanics are  people who never give up when it comes to  accomplishing  their  life goals and will  face  sacrifices and have dedication to reach their  goals and persuade others to do the same.  Hispanic Heritage may fade away in families  who move  to  live  in  the United States and  adopt another culture. As a Hispanic, I consider it my duty to make sure that my heritage  is not forgotten. As my parents have done with  our  family,  I will ensure  that our heritage  is  protected  for generations by  telling others  about our  traditions and customs. When  I  have a family of my own I will tell them all the  memorable stories my parents told me about  our family traditions. I will continue to use traditions, such as the pin˜atas, language, posadas, dances, and foods, to keep the Hispanic  heritage alive in my life and inculcate those  values to my descendants.  As a proud Hispanic  I will never  forget  where my family’s roots initiated. Even though  I live in a different country with a different type  of life and traditions, my Hispanic heritage will  always remain in my memories and deep in  my heart.  Congratulations  to Frida Bazan  for writing  the winning essay. Thank you also  for your  participation  in  this contest and  for sharing  some of your traditions and customs. Best of  luck to you in all your future endeavors.  f  IN HONOR OF MR. MARCUS  KAUFFMAN  HON. RICHARD HUDSON  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 2014  ",2014
10,,113,0.675,71,2014-01-07,Mr. HUDSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the life of Marcus Kauffman, a young  man who tragically lost his life after being shot  by home intruders on December 2nd of last  year. He  fought courageously  to survive  for  three weeks before succumbing to his injuries.  Marcus Kauffman, often called Marco by  friends and  loved ones, was an outstanding  citizen. He selflessly served as a volunteer  firefighter with  the Scotch  Irish Fire Department in Woodleaf, North Carolina. As a firefighter, Marco heroically put himself in harm’s  way and displayed immense dedication to the  safety of others. We are  fortunate  to have  brave men and women like Marco who dedicate and  risk  their  lives as  firemen  for our  well-being and security.  Marco’s life was taken much too soon. He  will be remembered for his extraordinary heroism and devotion to his family in the face of  danger. I applaud Marco for his bravery, and  I thank him for his heroic and selfless actions.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Kauffman was a proven  leader in our community, but he was also a  loving husband, a soon  to be  father, and a  faithful friend to many. My wife Renee and I  will continue to pray for the family and loved  ones of Marco, including his wife Maryann and  their unborn child. I hope that they find peace  in this troubling time.  f  CONGRATULATIONS  HIGH  SCHOOL  MARCHING BAND  TO  SHINER  COMANCHE  HON.

11,,113,-0.515,78,2014-01-07,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable unsung  hero, Mrs. Williestine ‘ ‘Peggy’ ’ Lark, a woman  who is truly worthy of admiration.  Mrs. Lark  is a wife, a mother, a grandmother, an educator, a mentor, and a friend  who exemplifies true womanhood through her  virtuous lifestyle. She has dedicated her life to  empowering the lives of her family and community.  Mrs. Lark is the third of twelve children born  in the small town of Monticello, MS. She has  always desired  to pursue a good education  and become successful  in  life. After completing high school, she attended Mississippi  Valley State University  located  in  Itta Bena,  MS. Mrs. Lark was the first in her family to  graduate from college. After receiving her degree, she became a teacher in Durant Public  Schools. In 1969, she married and started a  family there in Durant, MS.  While raising her children, Denise, Monica  and LaRonica, Mrs. Lark instilled in them the  value of being well-educated. She lived by example and continued to pursue her education  as well. She received her Master’s Degree in  Education in 1979 and continued to further her  education with degrees  from both Jackson  State University and Delta State University.  Mrs. Lark was  relentlessly  involved  in her  daughters’ education and committed  to supporting them in their extracurricular activities.  She also voluntarily  took on mentoring children in her community as well as the students  she taught. With her support and encouragement, many of her students have successful  careers. Among  them are her daughters—  Denise, who is an elementary school principal  and Monica, a high school teacher.  In  the year of 1995, Mrs. Lark  lost her  daughter, LaRonica  to a car accident. Although  this was a  trying  time  for her, she  thrived by sharing herself with the children in  her community. Even through her daughter’s  death, she allowed her daughter to become an  organ donor and donated her heart.  Today, Mrs. Lark  is active  in her grandchildren’s education and encourages them to  volunteer in their schools and community. Her  grandchildren are honor students—one of who  has graduated from high school attends college on scholarship, with an ACT score of 25.  Her grandson and two granddaughters volunteer every summer in programs for youth.  Mrs. Lark is retired from teaching after 35  years  in  the Durant Public Schools system.  She is presently the coordinator of the after-  school tutorial program at the Community Students  Learning Center  in  Lexington, MS,  where she teaches and inspires children from  her ‘ ‘heart ’ ’. She can often be found voluntarily  transporting community children  to summer  the comthroughout  programs and activities  munity.  In Mrs. Lark’s personal  time,  she often  opens up her home to mentor, tutor, feed, and  reward children for their achievements. She is  also a devoted Christian and Sunday school  teacher. She loves to help children learn, be  creative, and feel good about themselves.  There is nothing more picturesque than the  smile that Mrs. Lark wears for each child’s accomplishments. She has  the gift of making  people feel good about themselves and finds  the  time  to  teach and  inspire  those around  her, giving others the ability to wear that same  smile that she wears everyday.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in recognizing an unsung hero, Mrs. Williestine  ‘Peggy’ ’ Lark,  for her dedication  to serving  others.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  100TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF  THE  SMITH-LEVER  ACT,  THE  FOUNDING LEGISLATION OF THE  NATIONWIDE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM  HON.

Whereas U.S. Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia and U.S. Representative A. F. Lever of  South Carolina authored the Smith-Lever Act  to expand  the  ‘vocational, agricultural and  home demonstration programs in rural America’ ’ by bringing  the  research-based knowledge of the land-grant universities to people  where they live and work.  Whereas Cooperative Extension is a critical  component of the three-part land-grant university mission and works collaboratively with research, particularly the Agricultural Experiment  Station System, and academic programs  in  106 colleges and universities; including historically black, Native American and Hispanic-  serving institutions; in all 50 states, the District  of Columbia and six U.S. territories to reach  traditional and underserved audiences  in all  communities.  Whereas the Cooperative Extension System  continues  to  receive  federal  programmatic  leadership and support enabled by the Smith  Lever Act and other  legislation  through  the  U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

13,House,113,-0.393,4,2014-02-04,Ms. SEWELL of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Black History Month and the countless contributions and sacrifices made by notable  African Americans to this great Nation. I also stand before you to proclaim the month of February as a time  of  reflection  for Alabama’s Seventh  Congressional District.  In honor of Black History Month, I  thought it would be befitting that we  pay honor and tribute to the native  sons and daughters of Alabama that  have made  significant  contributions  not only to the great State of Alabama, but to this Nation. As representative of the Civil Rights District and a  beneficiary  of  the  sacrifices  of  so  many, I have committed to sharing the  stories of these extraordinary men and  women throughout the month of February so that their contributions will  forever be recorded and referenced in  our Nation’s history.  b1030  Today, I again begin with a tribute  to Virgil Ware, 13, and Johnnie Robinson, 16. These American heroes and  Birmingham natives  lost  their  lives  within hours of the historic bombing of  the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church on  Sunday, September 15, 1963.  While many of us have heard the  heart-wrenching stories of the four little girls that perished in that bomb,  many aren’t aware that on that same  day, Virgil and Johnnie were also victims of unspeakable and senseless violence.  Virgil Ware was born on December 6,  1949,  in  Birmingham,  Alabama  to  James and Lorine Ware. He was the  third of six children. One of his surviving brothers, Melvin Ware, describes  Virgil as a special child who was exceptional  in his educational endeavors.

This legislation ensures that Americans’ ability to fish and hunt will not  be arbitrarily limited by the whim of  Federal bureaucrats.  LATTA Title I of this bill directly responds  to bureaucratic threats posed by the  EPA. In 1976, Congress barred the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA,  from regulating firearms and ammunition. However, this has not stopped attempts  to  circumvent  the  law  by  claiming that, while EPA may not be  able to regulate ammunition,  it can  regulate  components of ammunition  and  fishing tackle. This would be a  massive power grab by the EPA despite  a clear lack of legal authority.  Banning  lead  bullets  and  tackle  would increase costs for hunters, sports  shooters, and fishermen, and cause economic harm to outdoor sportsmen and  the recreation industry. This legislation ensures that the EPA does not—  does not, Mr. Chairman—have the authority to regulate ammunition and  fishing tackle.  Title II of this bill makes more funding available to States for a longer period of time to create and maintain  shooting  ranges,  which  preserves  American tradition.  Title III would direct the Secretaries  of Agriculture and Interior to allow,  with a permit, commercial filming on  Federal lands for crews of five or fewer.  This permit would ensure a fair return  to the taxpayer in exchange for use of  their lands.  Title IV of this bill would allow for  the importation of legally taken polar  bear hunting  trophies  from Canada  that, through no fault of the sportsmen, have become trapped in a bureaucratic limbo. This is focused squarely  on resolving existing permits snarled  in red tape and does not open the door  to any future imports.  The next two titles of the bill would  allow sportsmen across the country to  more  easily obtain a Federal duck  stamp by making them available for  purchase online and would protect law-  abiding  individuals’  constitutional  right to bear arms on lands owned by  the Army Corps of Engineers.  Title VII establishes a Wildlife and  Hunting Heritage Conservation Council  Advisory Committee in order to protect the rights of sportsmen while finding a balance with commonsense conservation.  The last title of the bill requires Federal land managers to support and facilitate use and access  for hunting,  fishing, and recreational shooting on  Forest Service and BLM land. It protects sportsmen from arbitrary efforts  by the Federal Government to block  public lands from hunting and fishing  activities by implementing an  ‘‘open  until closed’’ management policy. However, it does not prioritize hunting and  fishing over other multiple uses of public lands.  Hunting,  fishing,  and  recreational  shooting are  longstanding American  traditions that deserve our protection.  This important legislation is not a solution in search of a problem. Regrettably, bureaucratic threats to hunting,  fishing, and recreational shooting are  very real. That is why this bill has  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:41 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A04FE7.021 H04FEPT1         ",2014

59,Senate,113,0.855,53,2014-02-04,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. President, as the  Senate turns its attention this week to  the  farm bill conference report, my  thoughts turn to the Wild West to put  its provisions in context. Frankly, its  950 pages lend themselves to talking  about the good, the bad, and the just  plain ugly.  I mention the good, because while  this farm bill falls far short of gaining  my support, it is not entirely without  provisions worth  highlighting. Conferees, including a one-term extension  of the Payments in Lieu of Taxes, or  the PILT Program. That gives temporary predictability at least for counties with low tax bases due to Federal  land ownership and provides Congress  with time to chart a long-term solution in this regard.  In addition, the bill authorizes permanently the stewardship contracting  authority. This is a critical land management  tool  that  allows  us  to  proactively reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It is one I have long  called for. While reforms to the liability requirements are also included, the  report fails to include necessary flexibility on cancelation ceilings. That is  something I will continue to work on  in the future.  Sadly, when  it comes to the bad,  there is not enough time to list all of  the  items  in the report that should  make any lawmaker cringe who is concerned about our  crushing national  debt or those of us trying to reform agriculture policy.  Rather than truthfully trimming the  already  generous  agriculture  safety  net, taxpayers should prepare for yet  another round of entirely new alphabet  soup subsidy programs. The Senator  from Illinois explained very well the  Crop  Insurance Program  that  is  so  heavily subsidized, 62 percent.  I think all of us with auto insurance  or other types of insurance would love  to have that kind of contribution from  the Federal Government. This report  does not even provide commonsense reforms that limit waste and largess to  sustained hallmarks of agriculture subsidies. The report also fails to limit agricultural payments to those who are  actually involved in farming.  It cannot even provide a reasonable  income limit, as was discussed by the  Senator from Illinois, for those who already receive crop insurance subsidies.  Incomprehensibly, any renegotiation of  the arrangement between crop insurers  and the Federal Government would be  required to be revenue neutral, despite  billions of dollars in taxpayer savings  having been found in previous renegotiations.  This bill is purported to be fiscally  conservative because it saves $16 billion or so in tax dollars. Before we pat  each other on the back in this regard,  we need to remember that Congress has  a pretty dismal  record of actually  knowing how much farm bills are going  to cost.  According to Taxpayers for Common  Sense, ‘‘The last two farms bills are on  pace  to  exceed  their Congressional  Budget Office score by more than $400  billion, and there’s no assurance that  this farm bill will be any different.’’  Let’s get to the ugly. For years, direct payments have been one of the  clearest  signs of what needs  to be  changed in Federal spending. The Federal Government has been handing out  roughly $5 billion a year to farmers regardless of whether they are farming  the land. I want to pay tribute to the  Senator from Michigan who has fought  to end these direct payments.  The Senate did a pretty good  job  there, but the House did not. I myself  have long sought to end these direct  payments. I was encouraged with the  Senate action to end these payments  outright. But despite our fiscal situation, the best we could get in the House  was allowing direct payments to continue, albeit slightly reduced for cotton, for 2014 and 2015.

60,Senate,113,0.342,67,2014-02-04,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  come to the floor for the third time to  express my opposition  to  the  farm  bill—obviously not in total, but to certain provisions of it, particularly provisions I had a hand in writing—and to  set the record straight, once again.  I come here because several of my  colleagues have approached me  indicating confusion on whether the payment limits provisions I fought for are  in this bill or not in this bill. People  are going to tell colleagues there are  payment limitations in this bill, but I  am here to set the record straight with  facts. They don’t accomplish what I  tried to accomplish, and they are even  much more liberal than in existing law  in regard to my amendment.  My original payment limit provisions  included  a  $50,000  individual/$100,000  married couple cap for the shallow loss  programs shown as Price Loss Coverage—PLC—and the Agricultural Risk  Coverage—ARC—programs. In this bill  farmers will have to pick one of those  programs for the next 5 years.  The conference report allows  individual farmers to get $125,000 and married couples to get $250,000 from the  PLC and the ARC programs.  This is where this has really exploded  because what I just referenced is a 150-  percent increase over what my limits  allowed—the  limits  that passed  the  Senate without discussion and limits  adopted in the House of Representatives on a 230-to-194 vote. That is just a  plain,  simple  fact—a  150-percent  increase over what my limits allowed.  The conference report allows the PLC  and ARC programs to pay out 150 percent more than my limits did.  This intentional change by the conference committee allows each farmer  to get significantly more from these  new countercyclical programs that are  not even World Trade Organization—  or, as we say around here, WTO—compliant.  Another way  of  looking  at  this,  under the 2008 farm bill, an individual  farmer could only get $65,000 from the  countercyclical program. Under  this  bill, they can get $125,000  from the  countercyclical program. That means  they almost doubled what the countercyclical program will pay out compared to current law.  Furthermore, some university analysis has already shown the high target  prices for certain crops in this bill will  likely have a 70- to 80-percent chance  of  triggering payments  through  the  PLC program any given year of this  farm bill.  So, I say to my colleagues, please  don’t buy what my opponents are selling on this issue, or at least trying to  sell. My payment limits are not in this  bill. The result of that is going to be a  countercyclical program that will be  much more market-distorting than the  current ones for a few crops. How can  it not be more distorting? The PLC  program is designed to trigger more  often and pay out larger amounts than  the old countercyclical program  for  certain crops in the 2008 farm bill.  That is just a plain, simple fact. I am  sorry if proponents are having a tough  time acknowledging that publicly, but  that is what this bill actually does.  Their bill does lots of things, but brilliantly reforming Title I is not one of  them.  I am sure we have been told that this  bill reforms. It is like some of the opponents of payment limits still thinking this is 1975 or some year back then.  Back then, the national debt was still  measured  in billions and  the WTO  didn’t even exist. Unfortunately  for  them, things are very different today.  Recently, the WTO declared our cotton  program noncompliant, and we happen  to have a $17 trillion national debt. But  worse  than  this,  I  say  to my colleagues, is the fact that these amendments were adopted on the floor of the  Senate, and they were adopted in the  House of Representatives by a 230-to-  194 vote. They should not have even  been subject to negotiations.  The moral authority of the people of  the United States was behind what  both Houses did. Because we have a $17  trillion national debt, we ought to be  able to save this $387 million that this  amendment would have saved. It had  the moral authority of a majority of  the House and the Senate, which moral  authority should not have been overridden by a handful of people sitting in  conference.  I stress this latter point for one simple reason: Rule XXVIII of the Senate  says if things are the same in both  Houses,  they  should  not  be  conferenceable.  I  say  this  to my  friends, not that this bill is going to go  down to defeat and we start over again  and maybe accomplish what I want to  accomplish, but to make sure other  conferences do not abuse the Senate  rule  like this conference abused the  Senate rule; and also to tell my colleagues here that, both working with  what rules maybe we can get through  the U.S. Department of Agriculture or  on some other piece of legislation, I intend  to  pursue  these  goals  that  I  sought, and I intend to keep reminding  my colleagues of Senate rules being  violated by conferees that should not  have been violated.  I yield the floor.  ",2014
61,Senate,113,0.409,67,2014-02-04,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, I come to  the floor today to discuss the many  ways ObamaCare continues to negatively affect Americans.  Yesterday, the Washington Post published an article exposing yet another  problem with healthcare.gov. I would  like to share a couple of excerpts from  that article. The article begins:  Tens of thousands of people who discovered  that HealthCare.gov made mistakes as they  were signing up for a health plan are confronting a new roadblock: The government  cannot yet  fix the errors. Roughly 22,000  Americans have filed appeals with the government to try to get mistakes corrected.  . . .  Those mistakes, according  to  the  Post,  include being overcharged  for  health insurance, being directed to the  wrong  insurance  program  or  being  wrongly denied coverage.  So what is the status of those appeals?  The Post reports:  For now,  the  appeals  are  sitting, untouched, inside a government computer. And  an unknown number of consumers who are  trying  to  get help  through  less  formal  means—by calling the health-care marketplace  directly—are  told  that  HealthCare.gov’s computer system is not yet  allowing federal workers to go into enrollment records and change them. . . .  So let me summarize here. Mr. President, 22,000 Americans are either without insurance or are paying too much  for insurance as a result of mistakes  made by the Federal health exchange.  Healthcare.gov contains no appeals  process. Attempts to find recourse by  other means have been unsuccessful,  and the administration’s response  is  basically: Tough luck.  President Obama was interviewed by  FOX News’ Bill O’Reilly this weekend.  One of the topics they covered was  healthcare.gov’s problems.  The President said:  The goods news is that right away we decided how we’re going to fix it. It got fixed  within a month and a half. It was up and  running, and now it’s working the way it’s  supposed to. . . .  Let me repeat that The President of  the United States said: ‘‘ . . . now it’s  working the way it’s supposed to. . . .’’  Well, tell that to the 22,000 people  wondering why  there  is no appeals  process on the Web site or why their  paper appeals are stuck in a computer  system at the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services, where,  the Post  says, the appeals process is currently  stopped because ‘‘the part of the computer system that would allow agency  workers to read and handle appeals has  not been built.’’  When Bill O’Reilly asked President  Obama about the Web site problems,  the President  responded  by  saying  that—and I quote again—‘‘I don’t think  anybody  anticipated  the  degree  of  problems  that  you  had  on  healthcare.gov.’’  That is not an excuse. It was the  President’s job to ensure that people in  the administration were anticipating  the problems that would occur, and the  President owes the American people an  explanation of why he did not because  this is not just a story of bureaucratic  incompetence. It is the stories of the  tens of thousands of individual Americans who are suffering as a result of  the Web site glitches and who are wondering  how  they will  afford  their  health care under ObamaCare—Americans like Addie Wilson, whose story is  highlighted in the Post article.  Addie is a 27-year-old who makes just  $22,000 a year.

62,Senate,113,0.382,95,2014-02-04,Mr. HATCH.," I wish to take a few  minutes to talk about our Nation’s  international  trade policies. Specifically, I wish to discuss efforts to renew  trade promotion authority, or what we  call TPA. The most recent authorization of TPA expired nearly 7 years ago.  Since that time, Republicans have, by  and large, expressed support for renewing it.  In August 2010, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk  testified  that  the  Obama administration needed TPA to  conclude ongoing trade negotiations.  However, after that time,  little was  done to move the ball forward on renewing TPA. In September 2011, Minority Leader MCCONNELLand I offered an  amendment on  the Senate  floor  to  renew trade promotion authority for  President Obama.  Unfortunately, despite  strong  support  from the Republican caucus, a  number of Democratic Senators actively opposed our efforts, and it received virtually no Democratic support. As a result, our efforts failed.  In March  2013,  then-Acting USTR  Marantis again expressed the administration’s support for renewing TPA and  pledged to work with Congress to get it  done.  In June 2013, United States Trade  Representative Michael Froman, during testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, formally requested  on behalf of President Obama that Congress renew TPA.  Throughout most of 2013, I worked  with Chairman BAUCUSand Chairman  of House Ways and Means to  craft a bipartisan bill to renew TPA,  one  that  could  pass  through  both  Houses and the Senate. We introduced  our bill in January.  Last week, in his State of the Union  Address, President Obama asked ConCAMP gress to pass TPA legislation so his administration could complete negotiations on two very ambitious and important trade agreements. While I thought  President Obama could have spoken  more forcefully on this matter, his call  for TPA renewal was clear and unambiguous. Yet so far the call appears to  be going unheeded—or  should  I  say  among Democrats in the Senate.  Why is TPA so important, trade promotion authority? I think some additional context is necessary.  The administration  is currently  in  the midst of negotiations on the Trans-  Pacific Partnership, or TPP, an Asia-  Pacific trade agreement that is currently being negotiated between the  United States and 12 other countries,  including some of the world’s largest  economies, such as Japan, Canada, and  Mexico.  The Asia-Pacific  region  represents  more than 40 percent of the world’s  trade and, as a group, TPP countries  represent the largest goods and services export market for our country, the  United States of America.  On the other side of the world, the  United States is negotiating a bilateral  trade agreement with the 28 countries  of the European Union. This is called  TTIP. The United States and the EU  generate over half of the world’s economic output. Total goods trade alone,  however, between the United States  and the EU amounts to over $1 trillion  a year. Investment flows represent another $300 billion a year on top of that.  Together,  these  two  trade  agreements have the potential to greatly expand access for U.S. products in the  foreign markets  around  the world.  Most importantly, they would help to  grow our economy and create jobs at  home.  These two separate trade agreements  and negotiations represent what is the  most ambitious trade agenda  in our  Nation’s  history.  While  everyone  knows that I am a pretty outspoken  critic of the Obama administration, I  believe  the  administration  deserves  credit on this front. But if these negotiations are going to succeed, Congress  must approve TPA.  Because of the unique structure of  our government, our  country needs  TPA. Our trading partners will not put  their best deal on the table unless they  know the United States can deliver on  what it promised.  TPA empowers our trade negotiators  to conclude agreements and provides a  path for passage in Congress. That is  why every President since FDR has  sought trade promotion authority. No  economically significant trade agreement has ever been negotiated by any  administration and approved by Congress without it.  Put  simply,  if Congress does not  renew TPA, the TPP negotiations and  the TTIP negotiations with the European Union will almost certainly fail.  That is why it is so disconcerting to  me to see how some of my colleagues  across the aisle have responded to the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:14 Feb 05, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04FE6.075 S04FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2014
63,,113,-0.389,116,2014-02-04,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor  the Pacific Conservatory of  the Performing Arts (PCPA) located at Allan Hancock  College in Santa Maria, California.  During its 50 years, PCPA has become a  nexus of artistic talent on the Central Coast.  Over the course of that time it has nurtured  thousands of students and provided an oasis  for patrons of the arts.  Founded in 1964 by Donovan Marley, the  newly  formed company quickly gained  local  support, and in 1965 Santa Maria voters approved $1 million in funding to build the Performing Arts Center building on the Allan Hancock college campus. It was eventually named  the Marian Theatre, after Allan Hancock’s  wife, Marian Hancock. In the summer of 1974,  an outdoor theater was constructed in just 58  days to host outdoor summer performances in  Solvang, CA. Decades  later,  these venues  continue to put on incredible performances for  Central Coast residents.  The heritage of PCPA, however, is not just  in landmark buildings, but in the cultural legacy  that  it has provided  for generations.  In  fact, many of the nation’s greatest actors had  their beginnings at PCPA and  its alumni  include Academy Award winners Robin Williams, Kathy Bates, and Mercedes Ruehl.  Many of us on the Central Coast remember  our first experience at a PCPA performance,  and I know that it will continue to delight us  with  its excellence  for years  to come.  I applaud the PCPA for its years of dedication to  bringing  the performing arts  to  the Central  Coast with an unmatched level of quality, passion, and talent. Congratulations on fifty years  of excellence.  f  RECOGNIZING MR. WALTER TOOLE  HON. DANIEL WEBSTER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 4, 2014  ",2014

DOUG COLLINS  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 4, 2014  ",2014
66,,113,0.636,116,2014-02-04,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, my  district lost a cherished member of our medical community when Dr. Thomas Lumsden  passed  away  on  January  17,  2014.  ‘Dr.  Tom’s’ ’  life of service  touched  thousands of  families in Northeast Georgia, and he will be  dearly missed.  Dr. Tom was born in Nacoochee Valley on  May 20, 1925. His strong work ethic was evident from an early age, as he graduated the  valedictorian of Nacoochee High School  in  1942. Five years later, he married India Dyer  Lumsden while studying at the Emory University School of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1949. After completing an internship  at Atlanta’s Grady Hospital, he served in the  U.S. Army Medical Corps at Regensburg, Germany for two years. Dr. Tom then worked as  the assistant resident in general surgery at Atlanta’s VA Hospital from 1952 to 1953 before  returning to Northeast Georgia.  Dr. Tom established his  family practice  in  Helen  in 1953, and became an organizing  partner of  the Habersham Medical Group  in  Clarkesville two years later. Focused on surgery and obstetrics, and Dr. Tom delivered  more  than 4,000 babies over  the course of  nearly  four decades on staff at Habersham  County Medical Center. Remarkably, for more  than 30 young families, Dr. Tom had delivered  mother or father —or both —and delivered their  children years later. He continued his service  even after retiring from his practice in 1993,  working part time as a medical staff member  at the Lee Arrendale State Prison.  In addition to his practice, Dr. Tom served  as president of the Habersham County Medical Society, president of  the Ninth District  Medical Society, chairman of the Medical Association  of Georgia’s Rural Health Committee, and on the American Medical Association ’s Council on Rural Health. He became a  Fellow of  the American Academy of Family  Practice in 1972 and was named Physician of  the Year by the Medical Association of Georgia. He was a charter member and Fellow of  the American Academy of Family Physicians.  Dr. Tom’s civic  involvement extended well  beyond the medical community. He served as  Mayor of Helen, Councilman  for  the city of  Clarkesville, and Assistant Scout Master  for  Boy Scout Troup 5. Dr. Tom and his family  joined  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  Clarkesville  in 1955, and over  the years he  served that body as an Elder, Sunday school  teacher, and pastoral search committee member. He helped form the first EMS service in  Clarkesville and trained first responders in the  Clarkesville Fire Department. An avid historian, Dr. Tom was an authority on local history  and archeology. He even published a book,  ‘Nacoochee Valley, Its Times and Its Places,’ ’  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Todd  Lodwick, competing in the Nordic Combined,  has  inspired athletes  from around  the U.S.  since  he  began  his Olympic  career  in  Lillehammer  in 1994.  I could not  think of a  more deserving U.S. athlete to display our flag  on this world stage.

For  the  third  time  since  October,  Forbes.com has listed Port Saint Lucie as one  of the top places to live or do business, and  I  am  delighted  to  recognize  the  recent  Forbes.com list that names Port Saint Lucie  as one of the 25 best places to retire in 2014.  Forbes cites excellent climate and air quality, lower cost of living, median home price,  and low crime rate as their key criteria for the  ranking. Just months ago, Forbes selected  Port Saint Lucie as one of the best places in  the country for business and careers based on  education data, job growth, and the lower cost  of doing business.  In  addition  to  Forbes,  last September,  Movoto.com, a national online  real estate  broker, claimed Port Saint Lucie as number  one on their list of the 10 best places to live  in Florida based again on the city’s low crime  rate, cost of living, and housing among other  factors.  Port Saint Lucie commands national attention  for  its  incentives  for  families,  entrepreneurs, and  international business  leaders  alike and a perfect balance of warm yet temperate year-round weather.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 11, 2014  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 3578, a bill to ensure new and  revised requirements for screening testing or  treatment of airman or air  traffic controller  sleep disorders.  As the former chair of the House Homeland  Security Committee Subcommittee on Transportation Security  I am  in strong support of  this bill. This bill is a commonsense measure  to address sleep disorder conditions that airman and air traffic controllers may be experiencing.  Under  the bill  the Secretary of Transportation can follow consistent acceptable medical standards and practices, to implement or  enforce actions that provide for the screening,  testing, or treatment; including consideration of  all possible  treatment alternatives  for sleep  disorders.  Sleep disorders is a serious matter that requires Congressional action to save lives and  improve medical knowledge and best practices  to assist those who suffer from a wide range  of conditions.  There are 40 million people, or about 5 percent of  the population,  in  the United States  who suffer from chronic sleep disorders. It is  estimated that sleep disorders cost U.S. employers about $18 billion in productivity due to  sleep loss issues.  Further it is estimated that about 62 percent  of all adults in the United States experience  sleep problems a few nights each week.  During any year, about 30 percent of all  adults suffer from insomnia. In addition, only  29 percent of adults report getting the required  amount of sleep each night.  At least 37.9 percent of adults report unintentionally falling to sleep during the day once  in the past month. The annual number of fatal  car crashes associated with falling asleep at  the wheel is 1,550. The number of non-fatal  crashes  associated with  falling  asleep  is  40,000.  Sleep disorders can occur due to medical  conditions  such  as  excessive  drowsiness,  fibromyalgia or narcolepsy and  low  thyroid  function.  Drowsiness in the context of sleep disorders  is more serious than when the average person  feels drowsy or sleepy during the day. We can  usually  deal with  that  feeling  by walking  around, consuming a hot beverage or distracting themselves with other mentally stimulating activity.  The excessive drowsiness experienced as a  sleep disorder is a feeling of abnormally needing to sleepy during the day. People experiencing excessive drowsiness may fall asleep  in inappropriate situations or at inappropriate  times.  Fibromyalgia  is a common syndrome  that  can lead to sleep disorders. Fibromyalgia is a  syndrome  in which a person has  long-term,  body-wide pain and tenderness in the joints,  muscles,  tendons,  and  other  soft  tissues.  Fibromyalgia has also been linked to fatigue,  sleep problems, headaches, depression, and  anxiety.  Narcolepsy is more widely known as a nervous system disorder that can cause a sufferer  to fall into an uncontrolled sleep nearly instantaneously. The exact cause of narcolepsy is  unknown.  In some patients, narcolepsy is linked to reduced amounts of a protein called hypocretin,  which is made in the brain. The reason why  narcolepsy can lead to less production of this  protein is unknown.  Researchers believe  that  low  levels of a  protein called hypocretin may be an underlying  cause of narcolepsy—a disorder  that makes  people  fall asleep during  the day. Pharmaceutical companies are now looking for drugs  that will replenish the lost hypocretin.  Emmanuel Mignot, of Stanford University  Medical School, California, and his colleagues  identified that low levels of hypocretin in patients with narcolepsy,  their study appear  in  the September issue of Nature Medicine.  There is no cure for narcolepsy and symptoms include an uncontrollable desire to sleep  during in the day, sudden loss of muscle tone,  and paralysis. Narcolepsy  is diagnosable as  early as aged 15 to 25, and those affected by  the disorder must find ways to cope with illness by changing their work and eating habits  to achieve a level of normal behavior.  There is far too little research that answers  the  hard  questions  about  sleep  disorders  which impact airman and air traffic controllers  as well as millions of people  in  the United  States.  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of  H.R. 3578.  f  DR. CAROLYN COLLINS  HON. KATHY CASTOR  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 21, 2014  ",2014

I would like to  report that the United States has committed a billion dollars, and the European Union has committed, as of the  news reports today, another $15 billion.  This is critical in the need to help  them get their economy back strong  after the incidences over the last couple of months. It is unlikely that Russia will pull back  from the Crimea.  Prime Minister Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov have said that they cannot control these self-defense  forces.  Who are they kidding? Russian soldiers  with no unit  identification does not  qualify them as self-defense forces.  If the world stands by and lets this  happen, it will be like Neville Chamberlain  in  the Sudetenland, quoting  ‘‘peace  in our time’’ as Russia continues to gobble up sovereign states.  I want  to applaud  the Ukrainian  commander who was the only calm  man on the peninsula, Colonel Yuliy  Mamchuk, when he marched his soldiers to the Belbek airbase to continue  the job that they do in securing and  fixing the  facilities. It was a tough  standoff, but Colonel Yuliy was astonished by the change of events in that  he has had such a great working relationship with  the Russian military  over the years, and obviously, this relationship no longer resides in the relationship between Ukraine and Russia.  On September 4 through 5 of this  year, the next NATO summit will be  held in South Wales. I call upon members of NATO to now do what they  should have done in the last summit.  NATO now must offer membership action plans to those aspirational countries that are moving towards democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. In  particular, they need to grant membership action plans to Ukraine, Georgia,  and Moldova.  Now is also the time for us to continue to license LNG facilities so that  we can export natural gas to our free  and democratic countries around the  world, to those who are signatories of  the World Trade Organization and also  to those who are members of NATO. It  is difficult times as you know, Mr.  Speaker,  but  the  coalition  of  free  democratic  countries  must  stand  united against totalitarianism.  TRANSPORTATION NEEDS  ",2014
75,,113,-0.428,1,2014-03-05,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  this is the March Madness season on  Capitol Hill, when we in Congress greet  thousands of our constituents, many  who are here to talk about transportation. It is something that every one  of our constituents cares about.  Yesterday, I was able to greet hundreds of cyclists from around the country, and  then  leaders of America’s  counties; already this morning I’ve visited with people from the preservation  community  and  a  large  delegation  from Oregon.  Next week, I will start all over again  with the American Public Transit Association. These people are all desperate for a 6-year, fully funded transportation bill, with stable, non-general  funded money. They are standing on  the edge of a cliff due to Congress’ refusal—I almost said inability—to provide necessary funds, if not to do it  right, at least to do it adequately.  I came to Congress shortly after the  Clinton administration and Congress  last raised the gas tax. That was 21  years ago, when gasoline was $1.08 a  gallon—and  I wonder  if Barack had  even met Michelle—and there it has remained for 21 years.  Due to inflation and fuel economy increases, the average cost per mile that  the American motorist pays  to  the  Federal  transportation  program has  been cut in half.  I went on the Budget, and the Ways  and Means Committees for the last 8  years in order to deal with this issue.  Frankly, I am tired of waiting. I introduced a gas tax  increase, phased  in  over 3 years, to fully fund a 6-year reauthorization.

76,House,113,-0.119,8,2014-03-05,Mr. BARROW of Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, I rise in great disappointment  that the President’s budget makes no  provision for deepening the Savannah  harbor.  The Port of Savannah is one of the  busiest in the country and is a major  throughway for all sorts of essential  goods coming in and out of the country. The State of Georgia has collaborated with the Federal Government to  ensure that the port is deepened to accommodate the larger ships that will  soon come through the expanded Panama Canal.  After decades of study, State and  local stakeholders, congressional authorizers and appropriators, the Corps  of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  and  the  EPA have all endorsed this project as  technically feasible, economically justified, cost-effective, environmentally  responsible, and in the national interest.  Vice President BIDENrecently visited  Savannah and promised we would get  this project done, ‘‘come hell or high  water.’’ Only OMB now stands in the  way.  This project makes sense to almost  everyone who has studied it. I share  the frustration of my constituents that  it continues to be stalled by bureaucracy, and I urge the President to lead,  follow, or get out of the way of the effort to make this project happen.

77,House,113,0.307,8,2014-03-05,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Madam Speaker, this year marks the  100th anniversary of the Smith-Lever  Act of 1914, which established the Cooperative Extension Service. Extension is  a  unique  educational  partnership  among Federal, State, and local governments and the Nation’s land-grant  universities to extend research-based  knowledge to the American public and  private industry.  Over the years, Extension has connected  individuals and  families with  the resources and expertise of our Nation’s land-grant university system. In  Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University provides this educational network, working to help families make  sound  economic  and  nutritional  choices, and help businesses increase  efficiency and troubleshoot production  and industry challenges.  Madam Speaker,  today,  the Penn  State College of Agricultural Sciences  is on the Hill with agricultural businesses and industry advocates to share  with us the importance of the Cooperative Extension Service.  As we celebrate the 100th anniversary  of the Smith-Lever Act, I want to give  congratulations and recognition to the  outstanding  Penn  State  Extension  team, which is led by Interim Dean  Barb Christ, and thank them for their  important work to improve the lives  and economic outcomes of countless  families  and  businesses  across  the  country.  f  WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

78,House,113,-0.39,8,2014-03-05,Ms. HAHN.," Madam Speaker,  this  month we join together as a nation to  celebrate Women’s History Month. We  pay tribute to the generation of women  whose courage, perseverance, and leadership have helped build our great Nation—from everyday working mothers  to women like civil rights icon Rosa  Parks  and  labor  activist  Dolores  Huerta. Our journey would not be possible without these great women and so  many others who proudly took the seat  at the table and at the front of the bus  to  chart  the way  for our Nation’s  progress.  But, while progress has been made in  gender equality, we still have a  lot  more work to do when two-thirds of  the minimum wage workers are women  in this country and nearly one-third of  families headed by a single female are  living in poverty.

79,House,113,-0.279,15,2014-03-05,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I do urge  my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and defeat  the previous question and to vote ‘‘no’’  on the underlying bills.  We could be doing a lot of important  work here in the House rather than to  have, I think, what both sides would  agree is a purely symbolic 50th vote to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, unless  there are, perhaps, some who think  ‘‘50’’ is the magic number. I think anybody who has a degree of political  sense realizes, if the other 49 didn’t go  anywhere, this one is very unlikely to  go anywhere. Rather than proceed with  something that isn’t going anywhere  and  that gives  the Democrats once  again the opportunity to talk about  how important it is to make health  care more affordable—and the American  people  overwhelmingly  want  health care to be fixed, not repealed—  we could be doing a lot of important  things that the American people actually want this body to do.  Let’s talk about immigration reform.  There is a bill that passed the Senate  with Democrats and Republicans—68  votes. It is rare for more than two-  thirds of the United States Senate to  come together around a commonsense  solution. How did they do that? They  did that because the American people  want this problem solved. They are  sick and tired—and they should be; I  am, too—of having over 10 million people illegally in this country. In my district, there are tens of thousands of  people who are  there  illegally. We  don’t even know because there is no  way to even count. President Obama  has deported over 2 million people at  an enormous cost to taxpayers—$10,000  to $20,000 per deportation. That is how  much it costs taxpayers—you and me,  Mr. Speaker.  Guess what? There is a bipartisan solution supported by the law enforcement  community,  supported by  the  business community, supported by the  technology industry, supported by both  the agriculture industry—farmers and  farmworkers—and supported by business and labor, supported by the faith-  based community, supported by over 75  percent of Americans across the political spectrum, supported by a majority  of Republicans  and  a majority  of  Democrats and a majority of Independents. That bill is ready.  There is a bipartisan House version,  H.R. 15. Let’s bring that forward under  a rule. That bill would have the votes  to pass tomorrow if we brought it forward. We could send it to the President. We could reduce the deficit by  over $100 billion,  increase our GDP,  create hundreds of thousands of jobs  for American citizens, as the bill has  been scored. Finally, we could secure  our borders so we could have control  over who comes and goes, both people  and illicit products. That is what the  American people want. Let’s get that  bill through rather than celebrate yet  another empty anniversary for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  I strongly suggest that my colleagues  start bringing forward bills that the  American people want to see pass. If we  can bring forward immigration reform  with bipartisan support and get it out  of this body and to the President’s  desk, the American people will start to  improve their opinions of this institution. When I see the polls and they say,  oh, 15 percent approval is what Congress has—or 12 percent—it is really no  wonder because it is a little bit like a  broken record around here. They are,  frankly, sick and tired of our every  week, it seems like, repealing the Affordable Care Act and making health  care more expensive for the American  people. They don’t want to see us talking about golden rings and 50th anniversaries of votes. They want to see us  solving problems.  We offer the Speaker and the majority leader the opportunity to do that.  We welcome the Republican immigration  principles.  There  are  ample  grounds to work on a bipartisan solution based on H.R. 15 or on another bill  that encapsulates those principles that  the Republicans laid down on which we  can find common ground so as to solve  a very real problem, to grow our economy, to reduce our deficit, to secure  our borders, and to ensure that America remains competitive in the global  economy. I challenge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to reach a solution on that issue and to really move  forward with regard to making health  care more affordable.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  this closed process—this closed rule—  that allows no Republican ideas and no  Democratic ideas to come forward, to  enter this discussion. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question  so the Democrats can bring forward the  unemployment  insurance bill, and  I  also encourage my colleagues to vote  ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2014
80,House,113,0.57,15,2014-03-05,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  Talk about doing the will of the people. There was an election  in Texas  yesterday. There was a question on the  ballot—to support or oppose the President’s takeover of the health care industry in this country. Ninety-two percent of the people were recorded as  being in opposition to the President’s  takeover of health care. So, in fact, in  the district I represent, that is a significant amount.  Today’s rule provides for the consideration of two bills to provide relief for  hardworking Americans who are faced  with  the  administration’s  expensive  and restrictive mandates both in the  health insurance and energy sectors.  I want to thank my colleagues LYNN  from Kansas, the Republican  Conference vice chair, as well as the  chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Energy and Power,  from Kentucky,  for  their thoughtful pieces of legislation.  I encourage my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bills.  The material previously referred to  by Mr. POLISis as follows:  Mr. WHITFIELD JENKINS ANAMENDMENTTOH. RES. 497 OFFEREDBY  MR. POLISOFCOLORADO  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections:  SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this  resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to  clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House  resolved into the Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3546) to provide for the  extension of certain unemployment benefits,  and for other purposes. The first reading of  the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of  order against consideration of the bill are  waived. General debate shall be confined to  the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means and the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure. After  general debate the bill shall be considered  for amendment under the five-minute rule.  All points of order against provisions in the  bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the  House with such amendments as may have  been adopted. The previous question shall be  considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without  instructions.  If  the  Committee of the Whole rises and reports  that it has come to no resolution on the bill,  then on the next legislative day the House  shall,  immediately after  the  third daily  order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,  resolve into the Committee of the Whole for  further consideration of the bill.

THEVOTEONTHEPREVIOUSQUESTION: WHATIT  REALLYMEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the  previous question on a special rule, is not  merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering  the  previous  question  is  a  vote  against the Republican majority agenda and  a vote to allow the Democratic minority to  offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about  what the House should be debating.  Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the  House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on  the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the  consideration of the subject before the House  being made by the Member in charge.’’ To  defeat the previous question is to give the  opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House.

Now, maybe  instead  of  repealing  ObamaCare the 51st or the 58th or the  100th time—legislation is not going to  go any place—maybe we could take a  little bit of a time out and consider the  legislation that Dr. ROE and I have  worked on that is not partisan, that  doesn’t  have  anything  to  do with  ObamaCare, that would enable families  in their time of need to know what  their choices are and to make sure that  their choices, whatever they might be,  are respected, they are respected  in  their city, they are respected across  State  lines, that they protect their  family, and that they get the care they  want and they need as they approach  end of life.

83,House,113,0.518,22,2014-03-05,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentlelady and congratulate  her on her leadership for this bill and  making sure that we reinsert a notion  of fairness back into the law for the  people of this country.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the SIMPLE Fairness Act.  For the past few months, the President’s health care law has been wreaking havoc on  the American people.  After the administration’s disastrous  launch of the exchanges, ObamaCare  has been anything but what the President had promised it would be. It has  become very clear  that  this  law  is  doing more harm than good.  We now know that ObamaCare has  pushed up to 5 million people off the  health care plan they liked, and many  are now being denied the care they had.  To make matters worse, many of these  new plans will force Americans to pay  higher  premiums  and  higher  deductibles. This leaves them with a  limited number of options for health  care coverage.  Many folks are also finding out that  they cannot keep the doctor or the pediatrician that they want to go to and  trusted. To put it simply, this is not  how America should work. The American people deserve better.  Yet, time and again, the Obama administration has shown its true colors  by putting politics first and unilaterally delaying parts of the law to avoid  political  repercussions. This has become most evident by the administration’s delay in the employee mandate  for big businesses and its refusal to  delay the individual mandate for working Americans.  Just yesterday, it was reported the  administration will announce another  major unilateral delay on their minimum coverage requirements to—and I  quote the publication The Hill—‘‘ease  election pressure on Democrats.’’  Doesn’t it say something that the authors of this  legislation are worried  that  it  is being  implemented before  they face voters again?  And I ask: Will  future Presidents,  perhaps of our party, be able to simply  delay  or  cancel  all  or  part  of  ObamaCare? Will my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle withhold complaint then?  There  is no greater  indictment of  this law or proof of its failure than the  fear that full implementation invokes  in its authors.  It  is not  fair to pick and choose  which parts of an unpopular law should  be enforced at the expense of working  individuals  for  political  expediency,  and it is just not fair that businesses  and  insurance companies get delays  and exemptions and not hardworking  Americans. It is not fair.  Millions of Americans all over the  country are already living paycheck to  paycheck. The last thing they need is  another brazen attack on their pocketbooks  from a health care  law they  don’t want, they didn’t ask for, and  that doesn’t work for them.  Through this administration’s ad hoc  implementation of ObamaCare, some  people won’t have to pay the penalty,  but others will. Here is who I am concerned about and who the bill before us  today protects, the single mom, who  for whatever reason ended up without  insurance for several months.  She doesn’t need a new tax bill from  Uncle Sam for hundreds of dollars because she can’t access the coverage  that Washington says she must. She  could use that money to pay the heating bill or to buy groceries for her children.  All Americans—not  just some—but  all Americans deserve a delay from the  punishing  financial penalties of  the  President’s health care law. This is our  chance to make it happen. With the  legislation before us today, no one in  this country would be forced to pay the  individual mandate tax in 2014.  This is an opportunity to stop the political games and put working Americans  first. Let’s stand together and  support the SIMPLE Fairness Act in  CAMP bipartisan fashion and give our constituents some relief from the financial  burdens of ObamaCare.  I would like to thank Chairman DAVE  and Representative LYNN JENKINS for their hard work on this issue  and on behalf of working Americans.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation.  ",2014
84,House,113,0.559,22,2014-03-05,Mr. SCALISE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlelady from Kansas for yielding and for her leadership on this bill  that I am proud to cosponsor.  The SIMPLE Fairness Act is about  just that, providing fairness for hardworking taxpayers. If you look at how  the President’s health care law is being  implemented, Mr. Speaker, you have  got the President literally saying he is  going to give exemption after exemption after exemption to the political  class, to the select few who have special interest protections here in Washington.  The President, by the way, has said:  Big businesses can get exemptions from  ObamaCare. The President has said: Insurance companies can get exemptions  from ObamaCare.  But then, when  it comes to hardworking taxpayers, families out there  who are struggling under the weight of  this law, the President says no, you  can’t have that same exemption that  he has given to everybody else.  So what we are  saying here, Mr.  Speaker,  is  if these exemptions are  good enough for big businesses and if  these exemptions are good enough for  insurance companies,  shouldn’t  they  also be good enough for hardworking  taxpayers who are struggling in this  bad economy that the President has  given us and under the weight of this  unworkable  law,  that  the President  himself  is acknowledging  is unworkable, by giving all these exemptions  away to everybody else?  Now,  if you  look at the  law, Mr.  Speaker, the President doesn’t have  the  legal authority to  just waive a  law—to literally take out a pen and  change the law.  What the President does have is the  ability to work with us in Congress in  a bipartisan way, which when you look  at the vote on this bill, it will be bipartisan in support of giving these hardworking taxpayers that same exemption.  But this law, ObamaCare, is built on  a foundation of broken promises. If you  like what you have, you can keep it, of  course,  is probably the most broken  promise in political history; but there  is more.

85,House,113,-0.473,29,2014-03-05,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.  Chairman,  Kofi  Annan,  the  former Secretary-General of the United  Nations wrote in The Washington Post  earlier this year:  Climate change is the biggest challenge of  our time. It threatens the well-being of hundreds of millions of people today, and many  billions more in time.  Robert Rubin, the former Treasury  Secretary, said recently:  There are a lot of really significant monumental issues facing the global economy, but  this supersedes them all.  DINGELL,  The Energy  and Commerce Committee is the committee in the House  that has the power to tackle this monumental issue, the biggest challenge of  our time, but we are missing in action.  Instead of listening to the scientists  and working on a bipartisan basis to  protect the planet for our children and  future generations, we are considering  today a science denial bill that would  strip the EPA of authority to stop dangerous carbon pollution.  The  venerable JOHN the  longtime chairman of the Energy and  Commerce  Committee,  is  famously  known for pointing to a photo of the  Earth, which I have here to the right,  to describe the committee’s jurisdiction. Under his  leadership, the committee was known for listening to the  experts, tackling the toughest problems, and crafting responsible science-  based policies. But today we need a  new symbol to represent what we are  doing.  The Energy  and Commerce Committee has joined The Flat Earth Society. We considered a very similar bill  to this one last Congress.  Here  is what Nature, one of  the  world’s leading science journals, said  at the time:  Misinformation was  presented  as  fact,  truth was twisted, and nobody showed any  inclination to listen to scientists, let alone  learn  from them.  It has been an embarrassing display, not just for the Republican  Party, but also for Congress and the U.S.  citizens it represents.  b1600  It is hard to escape the conclusion  that the U.S. Congress has entered the  intellectual  wilderness—The  Flat  Earth Society.  The United States is a major contributor to climate change. It cannot be  stopped without us. We have a moral  responsibility to act, but the Republican majority has brought a bill to the  floor that does  just the opposite. It  makes  the  problem worse  by  preventing EPA from acting.  If we pass this terrible bill, we will  vote to let China leap ahead of us in  the race to build the clean energy economy for the future, and we will be ignoring our moral obligation to protect  the planet for our children and grandchildren.  As you might have guessed, I strongly oppose this bill. Future generations  will be appalled that we are considering it today. Coal-fired power plants  are the largest single source of carbon  pollution in the country. Today, there  is no limit on how much carbon pollution these power plants can emit. That  is why President Obama directed the  Environmental Protection Agency to  use its existing authority under law,  under the Clean Air Act, to require  power plants to control carbon pollution. EPA has proposed a rule to require new coal plants to use available  pollution control technology to capture and sequester carbon. For existing  coal  plants, EPA  is working with  stakeholders to think through the best  approach. H.R. 3826, the bill under consideration today, would stop EPA from  issuing  any  rules  and  allow  these  plants to continue to keep emitting unlimited amounts of carbon pollution.  Republicans complain they don’t like  EPA’s approach, but they won’t even  admit climate change  is a problem,  much less accept the President’s invitation to work together on a solution.  Instead, they want to pass a bill to  deny the problem, block EPA action,  and weaken the Clean Air Act.  My message to my Republican colleagues  is simple:  if you don’t  like  what EPA is doing, tell us your plan. If  you have other ideas for reducing carbon pollution to prevent catastrophic  climate change, let’s hear about them.  If you don’t, you should step aside and  let the President lead.  Today is an embarrassing day for our  committee on Energy and Commerce  and the U.S. House of Representatives  if this bill is to be passed. I hope that  does not come about.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2014
86,House,113,0.303,29,2014-03-05,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Chairman, at  this time I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California  (Mr. MCCARTHY), the majority whip.  ",2014
87,House,113,0.462,29,2014-03-05,Mr. MCCARTHY of California.," Mr.  Chairman, in 2008 in an interview with  the San Francisco Chronicle, President  Obama warned us that under his policies for energy, ‘‘electricity rates will  necessarily skyrocket.’’ Now it appears  with high electricity costs, that this is  a promise that the President chose to  keep.  Today, millions of Americans are suffering from one of the coldest winters  in recent memory, and in some cases,  the most expensive. In New York, some  homes are seeing their heating bills  double, but it doesn’t have to be this  way. The U.S. is currently enjoying a  revolution  in energy production, the  energy that heats our homes and keeps  us warm during the cold winter nights.  Americans across the country should  be celebrating this breakthrough. In an  economy where the Nation’s  income  today is lower than in the year 2000,  abundant energy should provide a sense  of relief to strained budgets, but because of this administration’s policies,  Americans are simply left out in the  cold with their energy bills.  First, the Democrats tried cap-and-  trade, but that failed in a Democrat-led  Congress. Now this administration has  proposed arguably the most expensive  regulation ever by the EPA, one that  would render the construction of any  future  coal  power  plant  impossible  through the mandating of technology  that isn’t readily attainable.  Today, coal accounts for 37 percent of  total U.S. electricity production. The  EPA’s  regulation will  cost approximately $1,200 per household per year in  lost  income. That  is  $100 more  a  month. Most importantly, this regulation will cause the greatest amount of  harm,  lost  jobs, diminished  incomes,  and higher electricity bills  in areas  where incomes are modest, as are the  lifestyles of those who live there. It  isn’t the rich on Fifth Avenue or in  Beverly Hills who will be impacted; it  is the American working class. Communities  like  Indiana’s Second District, home to our good friend, Congresswoman  or  Ohio’s Fourth District, home to our  friend JIM JORDAN; or the First District, home to Chairman RYAN; or even  Wisconsin’s Second or Iowa’s First District,  both  represented  by my  colleagues on the other side. All will be  unnecessarily hurt by this regulation.  For all the talk from my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle about  fairness, this regulation is profoundly  unfair. The Electricity Security and  Affordability Act  sponsored  by my  friend, EDWHITFIELD, rejects the administration’s back door attacks on  America’s energy bills. This legislation  restores opportunity and  fairness by  ensuring more American paychecks do  not unnecessarily go to expanding electricity and heating costs.  Mr. Chairman, at a time when energy  production  is booming, the cost per  family should be dropping, not rising. I  suppose  the President actually held  true to another promise: he has promised an all-the-above energy policy.

90,Senate,113,-0.351,71,2014-03-05,Mr. HARKIN.," Earlier today a vote  was taken in the Senate that, to this  Senator, marked  about  the  lowest  point that I think this Senate has descended in my 30 years here. I don’t say  that lightly. I was in Congress during  the  impeachment  process  trial  for  President Clinton. I thought that was a  low, but it didn’t compare to what happened today.  The vote on Debo Adegbile to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil  Rights Division at the Department of  Justice sent a strong message. This is  the message we sent today and, young  people, listen up.  If you are a young White person  working  for a  law  firm and have a  chance  to defend  someone who has  done something wrong—even a heinous  crime—my advice from what happened  today  is you should  feel  free to go  ahead and do your job as a lawyer. Who  knows? You might wind up as the Chief  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court one  day.  However, if you are a young Black  person working on civil rights issues at  the NAACP  legal defense  fund and  you—under your obligations as an attorney—are called upon to handle an  appeal for someone who committed a  heinous crime, the message sent today  is you’re putting your career on the  line.  If you fulfill your duty as a lawyer,  you will be denied by the Senate from  being an assistant attorney general in  the U.S. Department of Justice. We  have a double standard, a terrible double standard.  While in private practice, the Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court defended  a mass murderer in Florida who committed eight murders. He is the Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court. Did we  hear one peep  from  the Republican  side? I didn’t hear anyone on this Senate floor at that time raising it as any  issue at all for his qualifications to be  a judge on the appeals court or to be  the Chief  Justice  of  the Supreme  Court, and rightfully so. It should have  never been an issue. He was fulfilling  his  legal obligations and his moral  duty as a lawyer.  Debo Adegbile, working as an attorney for the NAACP legal defense fund,  did nothing different. He was only  asked to work on an appeal. And because of that, and only because of that,  he was excoriated on the Senate floor  and denied his opportunity to be an Assistant Attorney General  for  Civil  Rights.  Did anyone  raise an  issue of his  qualifications? No. He  is  eminently  qualified.  But  person  after  person  spoke about the heinous murder that  took place in Philadelphia, the murder  of a police officer by a young Black  man who had bragged about it—a heinous crime, a horrible crime. Debo  Adegbile didn’t defend him at trial. He  only filed appeals aimed at protecting  the defendant’s civil rights and the  civil rights of all Americans.  I listened to the Senator from Pennsylvania this morning. He had a big  poster with a picture of the police officer and his wife on their wedding day.  He was talking about how horrible a  crime this was, how the murderer had  bragged about it, and all that is terrible.  But it had nothing to do with Debo  Adegbile. The Senator from Pennsylvania  said  it  is why Mr. Adegbile  should not be approved to be an assistant  attorney  general,  because  he  worked as a lawyer on a defendant’s  appeal.  What about the Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court? He defended a person  who killed eight people. I don’t see my  friends on the Republican side of the  aisle clamoring  to  institute an  impeachment process. Maybe they did not  know that John Roberts defended a  mass murderer. But now that they do,  are they going to try to impeach the  Chief Justice because he fulfilled his  legal obligation to defend a murderer?  I hope you see the ridiculousness of  that argument and how unfair it was  for Debo Adegbile to be denied—not on  the basis of any qualifications but because he was fulfilling his duty as a  lawyer. I have not heard one person say  he is unqualified or he has done something that would disqualify him. No.  He did what he was supposed to do  within his legal profession—and he was  denied.  Shame.  Shame  on  this  Senate.  Shame on every Senator who claims to  be a lawyer, who went to law school,  raised their hand and was sworn into  the bar. Shame on every lawyer who  voted against Mr. Adegbile because he  worked on an appeal.  If somebody had some question about  his  qualifications  or  felt  that Mr.  Adegbile is totally unqualified, that is  a different story. I challenge anyone to  come forward with anything remotely  connected  to his qualifications  that  would show him to be unqualified.  I wish to read—and I will close shortly—a quote from James Silkenat, the  president of the American Bar Association. Listen up, lawyers.  He said:  A fundamental tenet of our justice system  and our Constitution  is that anyone who  faces loss of liberty has a right to legal counsel. Lawyers have an ethical obligation to  uphold that principle and provide zealous  representation  to  people who  otherwise  would stand alone against the power and resources of the government—even to those accused or convicted of terrible crimes.  Continuing:  I was alarmed to learn that there is some  opposition  to Mr. Adegbile’s nomination  based solely on his efforts to protect the fundamental rights of an unpopular client while  working at the legal defense fund. His work,  like the work of ABA members who provide  thousands of hours of pro bono legal services  every year, is consistent with the finest tradition of this country’s legal profession and  should be commended, not condemned.  Shameful.  It was a shameful vote  today, a rush to judgment based upon  emotion.  I will not name any names, but I had  one Senator say: My head tells me he  should be confirmed, but my guts, my  emotion, say no.  We make our decisions based on that  around here? God help us. Maybe we  ought to all go back and think about  ‘‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’’ Read  the  book, watch the movie, and know what  it is to stand against the powers of government and defend someone who  is  unpopular.  Mr. Adegbile wasn’t even the defense  attorney. He only worked on an appeal  relating directly to legal issues particularly important to the civil rights  community.  Shame on the Fraternal Order of Police. Shame on them. I have been one of  their strong supporters for my 30 years,  but  shame on  them  for doing  this.  Shame on them. They mounted a campaign against Mr. Adegbile just on that  one thing. Shame on all of us here, especially  the  lawyers—especially  the  lawyers. It was a rush to judgment and  a shameful episode in the history of the  Senate.  I know Senator REID filed a motion  to reconsider. I hope he will, and I hope  people will pray on  this and  think  back, especially the lawyers who are in  the Senate. Think about  it. Think  about the ethical obligation, the ethical obligation to do what he did—and  he did nothing wrong. Hopefully Mr.  Adegbile, on a motion to reconsider,  will have the votes to take his position  as Assistant Attorney General for Civil  Rights in the Justice Department.  It is a shameful day for the Senate.  I yield the floor.  ",2014
91,Senate,113,-0.438,78,2014-03-05,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, when we  think of those who provide treatment  to our  loved ones, we think of registered nurses like Ann Wayt—a long-  time staff member of Affinity Medical  Center in Massillon, OH. Ms. Wayt has  earned both the Affinity Medical Center Nurse Excellence Award and the esteemed Cameos of Caring award from  the University of Akron’s College of  Nursing. Patients and fellow nurses in  the hospital’s orthopedic unit, were  touched daily by Ms. Wayt’s professionalism and  care. Several of Ms.  Wayt’s coworkers have referred to her  as a role model.  It does not come as a surprise that a  nurse who cares so much about her patients also cares about her fellow workers and their working conditions. Collective bargaining in health care isn’t  just about a paycheck. It is about staffing levels, patient safety, and ensuring  health care quality. For years, joining  a union was a ticket to the middle  class and ensured that those who work  hard and take responsibility can still  get ahead.  However, on September 26, 2012, Ann  was fired by Community Health Systems, the hospital’s parent company,  shortly after she rallied with co-workers to organize a collective voice for  better, safer workplace conditions and  patient care. In  fact, Ms. Wayt was  fired by the hospital the day before the  nurses voted to form a collective bargaining unit. Though other grounds  were given, both the National Labor  Relations Board, NLRB, and the Federal Court ruled Ms. Wayt was fired because she was a lead organizer for her  fellow nurses.  We have seen too many attacks on  workers’ rights  in recent years. We  have seen too many efforts to hamstring the NLRB and its ability to protect the rights of workers, and we have  seen too many people fired for engaging in collective activity.  Fortunately, the NLRB stepped  in  and held a hearing last year, and the  findings speak for themselves: Community Health Systems was ordered to reinstate Ms. Wayt and to recognize the  nurses’ union. Community Health Systems refused to comply.  In January 2014, Federal Judge John  Adams ordered Ann’s  reinstatement,  the recognition of the nurses’ collective bargaining unit and for the hospital to stop harassing the nurses because they want a voice at work.  Nurses are on the front lines of patient care and deserve to have their  voices heard on  important, common  sense issues such as:  Minimum staffing levels based on patient acuity;  the  right  ments;  the right to advocate for patients;  and  lift equipment safety protections for  RNs and patients.  A 2013 study by the American Nurses  Association  shows  that when workplaces collaborate and listen to worker  input, nurses are able to provide care  more effectively, and hospitals gain  better overall patient outcomes.  Welcome back, Ann, and congratulations.∑  refuse unsafe assignto  f  TRIBUTE TO COREY TAYLOR  ∑",2014

Corey is a sophomore at Las Vegas’  Northwest Career and Technical Academy and the host of her own radio  show, which focuses on bullying issues  in high schools. She is on a mission to  end the senselessness that is bullying.  Championing  a  safe  environment  through activism of acceptance, even  at a young age, Corey has embraced diversity by defending individual expression.  Overcoming her own situation of adversity is just one example of character  Corey stands upon as a leader in her  community. The hard-earned money  she saves goes to her radio show, where  she reaches an audience through her  words in addition to her actions. She  encourages people of all ages to surround themselves with positive influences and  to  embrace  their unique  qualities.  Through her community outreach,  Corey encourages her peers to be true  to themselves despite any type of social pressure. She refuses to let her  spirits be diminished by bullying, and  her work has inspired others to do the  same.  I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring and congratulating Corey for  her service and contributions to Nevada.∑  f  KCAM RADIO  ∑",2014
93,Senate,113,0.208,78,2014-03-05,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  wish  to honor Alaska  radio  station  KCAM on its 50th anniversary on the  air.  KCAM, is a radio station located in  Glennallen, AK and it literally had an  earth-shattering start. That is because  KCAM signed onto the air under emergency orders late on the day of the  Great Alaskan earthquake, on March  27, 1964. While the station had been  planned and in preparation for going on  air, its broadcast air date was advanced  under emergency orders by the Federal  Communications  Commission  so  it  could provide  lifesaving  information  and aid in disaster relief communications following the largest earthquake  ever recorded in North America.  At 5:36 p.m. Alaska Standard Time  on Good Friday, nearly 50 years ago, an  earthquake struck deep beneath Miners  Lake  in  northern  Prince William  Sound,  just  90 miles  southwest  of  Glennallen. The  quake, which  then  measured 8.6 on the Richter Scale but  which has since been revised upwards  to 9.2, sent shockwaves up to 700 miles  away. The earthquake and resulting  tsunami killed 131 people, 115 in Alaska  and others  in California and on the  west coast. Amazingly only 12 people  were killed by collapsing buildings and  the quake itself, 119 in the tsunami  that followed.  The earthquake, which lasted more  than  4 minutes,  released  10 million  times more energy than the atomic  bomb  that  devastated  Hiroshima,  Japan, according to a story  in The  Alaska Almanac. The quake devastated  Southcentral  Alaska,  inundating  Valdez and other coastal villages, destroying whole blocks in downtown Anchorage, the State’s now largest city,  but causing significant damage even  north of the Chugach Mountain Range,  where Glennallen is nestled.  KCAM, found at 790 on the AM radio  dial, signed on in a part of east central  Alaska, in the Center of the Copper  River Valley, that then and even now  is underserved by broadcast communication outlets. Then as now the station provides vital weather  information, travel reports—valued by motorists on the Alaska Highway, the only  surface route between Interior Alaska  and the Lower 48 States—plus news,  sports and music. The relative isolation of the region is highlighted by the  fact that Caribou Clatters, the station’s  on  air  community  bulletin  board, is a valued way for area residents to get personal news to friends  who live off the highway, in remote  cabins not served by the array of telecommunication  devices  that many  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:54 Mar 06, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G05MR6.030 S05MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2014

SMITH  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 5, 2014  ",2014
96,,113,0.16,99,2014-03-05,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker, last  week,  I chaired a subcommittee hearing on  U.S. policy toward Sudan and South Sudan.  The hearing was very important, and not only  because  the United States Government has  been involved in Sudan and its various crises  for the past three decades. Many of us first  became interested in Sudan in the 1980s because of the persistent reports of modern-day  slavery, in which northern Arabs enslaved African southerners. My office helped to bring one  of  these unfortunate people  to America  for  medical treatment after he was freed, and his  story affected me deeply.  Ker Deng had been kidnapped into slavery  while still a child, and while he was an adolescent,  the man who held him  in bondage  rubbed peppers in his eyes, blinded him and  later abandoned him. Ker is studying here in  the United States  thanks  to his benefactor,  Ellen Ratner, and is awaiting a second operation to help him recover at least some of his  eyesight. How many  other Sudanese will  never have that opportunity or even achieve  their freedom? For example, Ker’s mother has  never been freed from bondage.  We began supporting southern Sudanese  efforts to end the oppression from the North in  the mid-1990s. In 2005, we helped both North  and South achieve the Comprehensive Peace  Agreement, CPA, to end the long civil war and  provide  the steps  for a mutually beneficial  peace and productive coexistence. Unfortunately, the rebellion in the Darfur region distracted from efforts to fulfill that agreement.  Khartoum’s  alliance with  the  Janjaweed  Arabs resulted in mass killings and displacement in Darfur. An estimated 1.9 million people were displaced, more than 240,000 people  were forced into neighboring Chad, and an estimated 450,000 people were killed. At  the  time, Congress  insisted  that  this was genocide. Eventually, the Bush administration concurred, but the United Nations declined to go  so far in their terminology, calling what happened in Darfur ‘ ‘crimes against humanity.’ ’  A peace agreement between the main rebel  force in Darfur and the Government of Sudan  was signed in May 2006, but it did not last. In  fact,  no  sustained  agreement  has  been  reached between the government and Darfur  rebel groups—partly because  these groups  have continued to split and form offshoots, but  also because the Khartoum government has  not appeared willing to resolve the Darfur situation constructively. In June 2005, the International Criminal Court initiated an investigation that resulted in arrest warrants for Sudan  President Omar al-Bashir and three other government officials and militia leaders. None of  these warrants has been served, none of the  four have been  taken  into custody and  the  Government of Sudan has refused to cooperate with the ICC.  Meanwhile,  the  CPA  remained  unimplemented.  In  January  2011,  South  Sudan, which had been a semiautonomous region of  the country since  the signing of  the  CPA, voted in a referendum on whether to remain part of Sudan or become independent.  Having been marginalized and mistreated for  decades,  it was not surprising  that southern  Sudanese voted overwhelmingly—at the level  of 98.8 percent—to become an  independent  nation. On July 9, 2011, South Sudan became  the world’s newest nation. However,  these  unimplemented elements of  the CPA would  bedevil the new country from its birth.  A referendum in the disputed Abyei region  and consultations on  the status of Sudan’s  Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states were  never  completed.  In May 2011, Sudanese  armed  forces assumed control of  towns  in  Abyei, quickly forcing at least 40,000 residents  to flee. Within weeks, fighting spread to Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, as Khartoum sought to crush the Sudan People’s Liberation Army—North, which had  fought with  southerners  in  the North-South  civil war.  Northern attacks on residents in those three  areas continue unabated.  Last year, Sudan and South Sudan engaged in a conflict over oil supplies from the  South, involving allegations that Khartoum was  undercounting  the  level of oil  flow  to cheat  South Sudan, as well as the southern seizure  of the oil town of Heglig. Again, this dispute  was  largely  the  result of unresolved  issues  from the CPA.  South Sudan continues to be engaged in a  conflict that began last December, despite a  cessation of hostilities agreement. Thousands  have been killed and tens of thousands have  been displaced. Exact  figures are constantly  shifting because this conflict continues. I will  soon  introduce  a  resolution  offering  a  sequenced approach to reaching a lasting resolution to this newest crisis.

Located  in Meadville, Pennsylvania, Tech  Molded Plastics celebrated  its 40th year  in  business just last year. In 1973, Bill Hanaway  and his wife Eva started their family business  in a  rented garage. Over  the years, Tech  Molded has expanded and diversified its business through smart investments in their people and  technology.  In  the mid-1990s, Tech  Molded erected the factory building that now  houses  its company headquarters.  In 2011,  the company expanded again by purchasing  the building adjacent to it with an investment  of more than $1.5 million. Today, sons Scott,  Mark, and Doug still run the family business  along with  their mother, Eva, manufacturing  precision parts for the electronics, automotive,  and medical  industry. Employing 120 Pennsylvanians and generating sales of $17.7 million, Tech Molded Plastics embodies the best  of America’s family-owned small businesses.  Mr. Speaker, in light of being awarded Processor of the Year, I ask that my colleagues  join with me today in recognizing Tech Molded  Plastics for its national leadership in the plastics  industry and  for  the  invaluable contributions of the Hanaway family to the citizens of  Meadville and Western Pennsylvania.

98,,113,0.601,1,2014-03-12,Mr. BROOKS of Alabama.," Madam  Speaker, in 1945, at the end of World  War II, America’s Federal debt to gross  domestic product ratio was 120 percent.  Washington responded with leadership.  In 1946, the Federal budget was slashed  a massive 40 percent.  In  1947,  the Federal  budget was  slashed by another 38 percent. The result? America rose to the challenge,  and America prospered. By 1980, even  though per-capita  inflation adjusted  Federal spending had tripled, Federal  debt had shrunk to 30 percent of GDP.  Since 1980, America’s per-capita Federal  spending has  exploded  to  five  times more than 1948 levels. The result? America faces a skyrocketing $17  trillion debt burden.  America’s Comptroller General warns  that  America’s  financial  path  is  unsustainable. Instead of confronting  our debt dependence, Washington kicks  the can down the road and immorally  sells our children into the equivalent of  indentured  servitude  and  poverty,  while driving America’s Federal debt  to dangerous levels.  To preserve  the  liberty and prosperity our ancestors sacrificed to give  us, we must free Americans to again  earn their prosperity and significantly  cut Federal non-defense spending to restore financial responsibility and provide the stable monetary environment  needed for economic growth.  If the Federal Government will be financially responsible and stop killing  job creation, America’s economy will  soar because we have, within our grasp,  a massive new technology and energy  boom.  Mark Mills, adjunct fellow, Manhattan Institute states:  By 2020 or so, the United States is expected  to surpass Saudi Arabia in oil output and  Russia in gas, according to the International  Energy Association’s best estimate.  Dan Yergin, one of the world’s leading energy  experts,  estimates  that  the United  States turnaround in energy has generated  1.7 million new jobs . . . and that number  should almost double by 2020.  The RAND Corporation adds:  The pace of technological change—whether  through advances in information technology,  biotechnology, or such emerging  fields as  nanotechnology—will most certainly accelerate  in  the next  10  to  15 years, with  synergies across technologies and disciplines  generating advances in research and development, production processes, and the nature  of products and services.  Amazing  economic  possibilities  abound if the Federal Government will  simply allow Americans to seize them.  Unfortunately,  too many paternalistic Washington politicians distrust  the American people to earn a better  life for themselves or to take care of  each other without government coercion or intervention.  Financially irresponsible Washington  politicians  insist on spending money  we do not have, risking a debilitating  American insolvency and bankruptcy,  debasing our currency, punishing success, rewarding destructive behavior,  and strangling job creation in bureaucratic red tape.  The Federal Government,  by  attempting to supply and command all  things, saps America’s spirit of energy  and devours the financial capital needed for innovation, productivity growth,  and jobs.  America must stop kicking the can  down the road to a day when the debt  challenge is even more daunting. The  time to act is now, while America has  sufficient economic strength to succeed. We cannot wait until America is  bankrupt and defenseless, our currency  is valueless, and we are overwhelmed  by closed businesses, lost jobs, and poverty.  Congress must use the debt limit, the  budget, appropriation bills, and every  other means available to free America  from the growing burden of crushing  debt and a dictatorial Federal bureaucracy.  America ended Democrat President  Jimmy Carter’s economic malaise with  one election in 1980, giving us the wildly successful economic policies of Republican President Ronald Regan in 25  years of unparalleled prosperity.  America’s  choice  is  between  economic depression brought about by socialist, heavy-handed, bureaucratic Big  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

For 20 years, our immigration system  has been left to rot due to congressional inaction. As a result, today we  have over 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows.  After 20 years of neglect, we finally  have a commonsense immigration reform package that has already passed  the Senate with bipartisan support and  has an unprecedented array of support  from  religious  groups,  law  enforcement, and business leaders throughout  the country. It is rare to find a subject  that labor leaders and the Chamber of  Commerce can agree on, but both have  called on Congress to promptly pass  comprehensive  immigration  reform.  Speaker BOEHNER and the House Republican leadership have ignored the  millions of voices calling for reform,  refusing even to bring it up for a vote.  Now, today, we are preparing to vote  on the ENFORCE Act, legislation that  would have the practical effect of ripping millions of young men and women  away from the only home they have  ever known.

President Obama has repeatedly exceeded the boundaries of the executive  powers allowed to him in the Constitution. We have worked to check this  overreach in the House, but the President has unilaterally decided to ignore,  waive, or change laws without authorization from Congress.  Notably, President Obama has  repeatedly created exemptions and delayed provisions to cover for the many  broken promises of his health care law.  The legislation under consideration  today will grant the House and Senate  the authority to file suit against the  President to simply force him to carry  out his constitutional duty and enforce  the law.  This should not be a partisan issue.  The ENFORCE Act will protect all  Americans and our system of government from overreach by Presidents of  any political party.  ",2014
105,House,113,-0.299,22,2014-03-12,Ms. TITUS.," I rise today in opposition  to both H.R. 4138, the so-called ENFORCE Act, and H.R. 3973, Faithful  Execution of the Law Act.  b1500  These bills reveal a Republican majority that is more interested in undermining the President that in serving  the American people.  These bills could undo the critical  actions  that President Obama  has  taken  to protect DREAMers. DACA  gives  DREAMers,  including  almost  10,000 who have applied in Nevada, the  chance  to  pursue  their  American  Dream. We should be encouraging these  bright young people to explore their  options and develop their talent, not to  hide away in the shadows. These bills  would take that opportunity away.  The bills would also undermine another executive action that gives the  undocumented  families  of military  members and veterans the chance to  stay in the United States as long as  they don’t have a criminal record.

109,,113,0.495,36,2014-03-12,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Madam Speaker,  article  II,  section  3 of  the United  States Constitution declares that the  President  ‘‘shall take care that the  laws be faithfully executed.’’  However, President Obama has failed  on many occasions to enforce acts of  Congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has stretched his regulatory authority to put in place policies that Congress has refused to enact.  Although President Obama is not the  first President to stretch his powers  beyond their constitutional limits, Executive overreach has accelerated at an  alarming rate under his administration.  DESANTIS To help prevent Executive overreach  and require greater disclosure when it  occurs, the gentleman  from Florida,  Representative DESANTIS,  introduced  H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the  Law Act.  I want  to  thank Representative  for  introducing  this commonsense  legislation  to ensure  that  there is greater transparency and disclosure  regarding  the  executive  branch’s enforcement of Federal law.  The Justice Department is currently  required by law to report to Congress  whenever it decides to adopt a policy  to refrain from enforcing a Federal law  on the grounds that the law in question  is unconstitutional.  The Faithful Execution of the Law  Act strengthens this provision by requiring the Attorney General to report  to Congress whenever a Federal official  establishes or implements a formal or  informal policy to refrain from enforcing a Federal law and the reason for  the  nonenforcement,  regardless  of  whether it is being done on constitutional or policy grounds.  As Professor Jonathan Turley observed regarding this legislation in testimony  before  the  Judiciary  Committee:  It is hard to see the argument against such  disclosures. Too often, Congress has only  been informed of major changes by leaks to  the media.  Congress should not have to rely on  media  leaks  and  other  unofficial  sources to find out that the executive  branch has decided not to enforce Federal laws.  Congress cannot possibly know the  extent of executive branch nonenforcement of the laws without mandatory  disclosure of all nonenforcement policies by the person who should be fully  aware of such policies, namely, the Attorney General, the Nation’s chief law  enforcement officer.  Passage of H.R. 3973 is essential if  Congress is going to play an active role  in overseeing that the separation of  powers between the branches is maintained and that the President is faithfully executing the laws.  I thank the gentleman from Arizona,  the chairman of the subcommittee, for  yielding me this time, and I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.  ",2014

As with our consideration of the ‘‘ENFORCE Act,’’ H.R. 4138, I must note the  lack of deliberative process pertaining  to consideration of this bill.  The gentleman from South Carolina  spoke eloquently on the other bill and  talked about the need for process—the  importance of process. Process can be  important, but process was not important on this bill.  It wasn’t important in the other bill.

I  am pleased  that  four, well-qualified  nominees to the U.S. District Court for  the Eastern District of Michigan will  now be before the Senate, and I urge  my colleagues to confirm them. Each  of them has demonstrated a commitment to impartial justice and a thorough knowledge of the law. Each was  recommended  by  an  independent  screening committee that Senator STABENOWand I have formed. It is broadly  based and chaired by one of Michigan’s  truly  outstanding  lawyers,  Eugene  Driker.  Each of the nominees has a distinguished background. Matthew Leitman  served as a clerk to Justice Charles  Levin on the Michigan Supreme Court  and has extensive experience in private  practice, focusing on complex commercial  litigation, criminal defense, and  appellate litigation. He has argued before State and Federal trial courts, as  well as numerous appeals before State  and Federal appellate courts, and has  written a number of influential journal  articles on important aspects of State  and Federal law such as immigration  and  fraud  enforcement. He has  on  many occasions been recognized by his  peers as one of the most effective and  knowledgeable litigators in our State.  He is also dedicated to public service.  He has been a pro bono honoree for the  Eastern District  of Michigan  every  year since 2008.  Judith Ellen Levy worked in private  practice and as a trial attorney for the  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission in Detroit. She has conducted research and taught classes and  seminars at the University of Michigan. Since 2000, she has served as an assistant U.S. attorney and Civil Rights  Unit chief in the U.S. Attorney’s Office  in Detroit.

I want to reiterate my appreciation  to Senator BURR for the way we have  worked together on this bill. He was  very generous in his comments to me  and about me, and I appreciate it. But  what I so appreciated in working with  him is that his whole focus was: How  do we protect these children? And his  work to ensure that the children are  safe when they are at the daycare, regardless of the size of the provider, was  important. So, yes, we have good background checks. At the same time, we  were  looking  at health  and  safety  standards, making sure the staffs are  at least trained in the elements of first  aid, so that if the children needed help  because  they  swallowed  something—  until  the  911  responders  could  be  there—they would have that training.  That is really important.  Yet we had to look at it in a way in  which we did not overregulate. So we  wanted quality standards, but we did  not want to have so many rules, so  many  regs—exactly  what  Senator  ALEXANDER cautioned us about: Let’s  not overregulate so that we then stifle  or end up shrinking the pool. So we,  again, worked  on what—the  phrase  ‘‘sensible center’’ comes  from Colin  Powell: that if we work hard and listen  to each other, we can find that sensible  center. So it was the balance between  Federal standards but also local flexibility on the best way to achieve those  standards, and also to help States pay  VerDate Sep 11 2014  10:30 Oct 28, 2014 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD14\MAR 2014\S12MR4.REC S12MR4 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 K S D n o r e n y o e j         ",2014

I thank the Senator from Maryland for her courtesy.  In addition, I would like to address an  amendment I have proposed to the underlying bill.  Promoting policies that enable  job  creation is a basic duty of the people’s  government. This bill we have on the  floor before us now provides  low-income, hard-working mothers and  fathers with  the opportunity  to have  quality childcare while they earn a  steady paycheck or as they go back to  school.  Americans work hard. They work  hard to provide for their families and  to make a better life for their children.  As a mother and a grandmother I understand that knowing your children  are  safe and  secure  is essential  to  maintaining a steady job. We need to  encourage responsible adults to enter  and to maintain their presence in our  workforce. That is why I appreciate my  colleagues’ work and their compromise  on this bipartisan legislation. I also appreciate how this effort has helped to  bring some regular order back to the  processes of the Senate. I especially  want to recognize Senators BARBARA  and  BURR, who  I know worked  very hard in a collaborative and bipartisan fashion in order to get this bill to  the floor.  As part of that process, I filed a proposed amendment  that  I have with  Senator KINGand Senator RUBIOto the  child care and development block grant  reauthorization. Our bipartisan amendment is a commonsense solution to the  FDA’s  overregulation  of  low-risk  MIKULSKI,  RICHARD ALEXANDER,  LAMAR health  information technology. That  includes mobile wellness apps, scheduling software, and electronic health  records. Under current law, which was  established in 1976, the FDA can apply  its definition of a ‘‘medical device’’ to  assert broad regulatory authority over  a wide array of health IT, including applications that do not pose any threat  to human safety.  Our amendment allows the FDA to  keep its focus on regulating medical  devices, while creating a modernized  oversight framework for low-risk categories of health IT. Since proposing  this amendment, I have had the opportunity to speak with Senator ALEXANDER, the ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee. I am happy to  say he has expressed an interest in that  amendment. That is identical to the  language introduced as a stand-alone  bill called the PROTECT Act.  I look forward to having the opportunity to work with him and committee members to advance the core  ideas included in the PROTECT Act,  because I believe with the guidance of  the committee, and with the guidance  of other Senators, we will be able to  achieve another bipartisan success in  this Chamber.  At Senator ALEXANDER’s request, and  in response to his kind offers to work  collaboratively on the PROTECT Act, I  have agreed not to formally offer this  amendment to the bill on the floor, but  I do look forward to working with the  Senator from Tennessee and others to  improve upon that.  Again, I thank the leadership of Senator MIKULSKI, Senator ALEXANDER,  and Senator BURR on the  important  legislation before us today.  I thank  them for their work. I thank them for  their courtesies in allowing me to rise  and  speak  on  this  very  important  amendment.

Next week, Ms. Lally,  who serves as President of Salem Co-operative Bank, will be honored with the Chief John  P. Ganley Community Service Award, which  recognizes outstanding individuals who exhibit  great concern, involvement, and leadership in  the town of Salem in New Hampshire ’s southern tier.  The award  is named  in honor of John P.  Ganley, who served the Salem community as  police chief before his death in 1989. Ms. Lally  honors Chief Ganley’s memory  each  day  through her tireless efforts to strengthen the  community, both through her work at the bank  and on the many local boards on which she  serves.  Over 28 years at Salem Co-operative, Ms.  Lally has helped to support countless children  and other community members  through  the  bank’s charitable wing, the Salem Community  Benefit, which provides funding for education,  youth  development,  and  other  community  agencies. As a board member of the Greater  Salem Chamber of Commerce, she was  instrumental in the creation of the Hidden Jewel  Awards, which honor deserving women  for  their contributions to the Salem area; and as  president of the Boys & Girls Club of Greater  Salem, she helped lead a capital campaign to  help  fund renovations and expansion at  the  community center.  Through her dedicated service to these and  other  organizations, Ms.  Lally  has made  Salem a stronger, healthier, and happier place  to live, work, and raise a family. On March 17,  the Greater Salem Boys and Girls Club will  honor her with the prestigious Ganley Award.  As the Salem community celebrates Ms. Lally,  I urge all Granite Staters and all Americans to  join them in honoring her many contributions  to our state and our Nation.  f  IN MEMORIAM  OF  THE HONORABLE BUCKNER MELTON, SR.

151,,113,-0.281,127,2014-03-12,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to a generous community  leader and outstanding public servant, and  friend of longstanding, the Honorable Buckner  F.  ‘Buck’ ’ Melton, Sr.,  Former Mayor  of  Macon, Georgia. Sadly, Mr. Melton passed  away on Wednesday, March 5, 2014. His  passing  leaves a  tremendous  void  in  the  hearts of his family, friends and the Macon,  Georgia community.  On Saturday, March 8, 2014,  friends and  family gathered to celebrate the life and career  of this influential man at a memorial service  held at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Macon.  Buck Melton was born on October 24, 1923,  in Arlington, Georgia  to  the Reverend and  Mrs. Henry Martin Melton. He grew up  in  Moultrie, Georgia, but moved to Macon to attend Mercer University. He went on to graduate  from Mercer  University’s Walter  F.  George School of Law and began his career  as an attorney in Macon.  After serving as city attorney during  the  1960s, Attorney Melton was elected to the office of Mayor in 1975. During his one term as  Mayor, Mr. Melton helped to establish Mercer  University ’s School of Medicine as well as the  city’s local option sales tax, which is still used  today. Mr. Melton was also particularly proud  of the seventy miles of roads paved in Macon  during his tenure.  The World War II and Korean War veteran  loved his adopted hometown of Macon and he  served his community in many capacities. He  was president of the Greater Macon Chamber  of Commerce in 1971, president of the Macon  Bar Association in 1973 and he served on the  board of the Macon-Bibb County Urban Development Authority, among the numerous other  civic organizations he belonged to during his  life.  George Washington Carver once said, ‘ ‘No  individual has any right to come into the world  and go out of it without leaving behind distinct  and  legitimate  reasons  for having passed  through it.’ ’ Buck Melton left behind a legacy  of  leadership and kindness  that  is still  felt  throughout  the Macon, Georgia  community  today.  Buck is survived by his loving wife of sixty  years, Tommie; children, Leigh and Buckner,  Jr.; grandson, Grady; nephews, Tim, Hank  and Will; and niece, Mary Ann.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues  to  join  me, my wife, Vivian, and the Macon, Georgia  community  in honoring  the  life of Former  Mayor Buckner Melton, Sr. He will  truly be  missed, but his legacy will not soon be forgotten.  f  JOANNA MOSMAN  HON.

JoAnna Mosman is a 12th grader at Jefferson  High School and received this award because  her determination and hard work have allowed  her to overcome adversities.  The dedication demonstrated by  JoAnna  Mosman is exemplary of the type of achievement that can be attained with hard work and  perseverance.  It  is essential students at all  levels strive to make the most of their education and develop a work ethic which will  guide them for the rest of their lives.  I extend my deepest congratulations to JoAnna Mosman for winning the Arvada Wheat  Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.  I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character  in all of her  future accomplishments.  f  HONORING  THE  102ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS  HON.

154,,113,-0.455,134,2014-03-12,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark  the three-year anniversary of the humanitarian  crisis  in Syria. This horrific conflict has  left  over  100,000  people  dead,  a  population  roughly  the size of Boulder, Colorado. Of  those 100,000 casualties of war, 10,000 were  children. As I speak, 5.5 million living children  are dangerously vulnerable, having ‘ ‘lost lives  and limbs, along with virtually every aspect of  their childhood,’ ’ according to the United Nations. And the displacement crisis continues to  explode, with some 6.5 million Syrians internally displaced within  their own country and  2.4 million Syrians living as refugees in neighboring countries.  Mr. Speaker, it is easy to become desensitized by numbers of this scale. But these are  not merely newspaper headlines. These statistics are made up of real people who had real  hopes and real dreams,  too many of which  have been crushed by war and violence. The  international community must draw on the full  spectrum of diplomatic and development tools  to bring swift, lasting stability to Syria and the  surrounding countries. Three years  is  three  years too long. The time for peace is now. We  cannot wait a moment longer.  f  HONORING  CHANG  DUK  HUH,  OWNER OF JOHNNIE’S CHICAGO  RED HOTS  HON. ED PASTOR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 12, 2014  ",2014
155,,113,-0.421,134,2014-03-12,Mr. PASTOR of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  my colleagues  to  join me  in  recognizing a  small business owner from Arizona’s Seventh  Congressional District who has left his indelible mark on  the Phoenix Metropolitan Area  through his much-beloved ‘ ‘Johnnie ’s Chicago  Red Hots’ ’ restaurant.  Chang Duk Huh, also known as ‘ ‘Johnnie,’ ’  was born in Seoul, South Korea, on February  25, 1953. The eighth of nine children, Chang  immigrated to the United States in 1976. By  1978 he and his wife, Hae, settled  in  the  greater Phoenix area where the couple raised  their  two daughters. Chang and Hae purchased ‘ ‘Johnnie’s Chicago Red Hots’ ’ in August of 1985 from its original owner, Johnnie  Dieffenbach.  In business now for nearly three decades,  Johnnie’s restaurant is best known for its 100  percent Vienna beef, Chicago-style hot dogs-  complete with mustard, onions, neon relish, tomatoes, pickles, celery salt and sport peppers-  encased in a steamed poppy seed bun and  served with a side of homemade French fries.  The dogs have been featured in a variety of  local news publications over the years, including The Arizona Republic and  the Phoenix  New Times ‘ ‘Best of’ ’ issue. What started out  as a tiny three-table restaurant with a handful  of bar stools became a Phoenix mainstay that  has been frequented by many prominent community figures such as Department of Homeland Security Secretary  Janet Napolitano,  Phoenix Suns Coach  Jeff Hornacek,  and  sports executive Jerry Colangelo.  What really defines  the heart and soul of  this small mom-and-pop shop, however, has  been  its  loyal patrons  through  the  years.  Chang and his wife, Hae, take great pride in  their product (Chang has eaten a hot dog for  lunch every day for almost 30 years), and the  couple has a strong love and appreciation for  their customers. They have strived to provide  quality  food and great service with a smile.  They have found great joy in making their customers happy.  I have been one of those happy customers,  not just because of the quality food and service, but also because they have allowed me,  as  their Congressman,  to watch  them grow  their restaurant into a well-respected and thriving eatery. Small businesses are the heart of  America ’s local economies and they are critical for our Nation’s strength. Immigrants have  especially driven entrepreneurship and  job  creation  throughout  the country, and Chang  and Hae are a perfect example of this.  After nearly three decades in business, the  establishment sadly closed its doors on February 27, 2014. In recognition of their success,  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Chang Duk Huh and his wife, Hae.  f  A TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS LEE  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 12, 2014  ",2014
156,,113,-0.348,134,2014-03-12,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the memory of Nicholas Choung Lee, a  Los Angeles  police  officer who  selflessly  served his community.  Nicholas was born on May 8, 1973,  in  Seoul, Korea. When he was six years old he  moved to California with his father Heung Jae  Lee, mother Choung Ja Lee, younger brother  Danny, and sister Jenny. They settled in Los  Angeles’ Koreatown, and Nicholas attended  high school  in Los Angeles and college at  California State University Fullerton. He joined  the Los Angeles Police Department on August  31, 1998.  After probationary  training, Nicholas  transferred first to the Van Nuys Division, and later  to the Hollywood Division, where he was assigned to a patrol car. He worked as both a  Field Training Officer and Vice Officer  in  Wilshire, before returning to patrol in the Hollywood Division in 2008. In his 16 years as a  police officer, Nicholas received more than 70  commendations. He was recently among the  officers featured in a birthday video for a 7-  year-old-boy with  leukemia, which was  just  one of  the many ways Nicholas constantly  demonstrated his selfless desire to help others.  As much as he contributed to Los Angeles  as a police officer, everyone who knew him  would agree that his family always came first.  Nicholas married Cathy Kim in 2001, and they  went on  to have  two daughters, Jalen and  Kendall. He could frequently be seen riding a  scooter alongside the two girls on their way to  school. When  the  family would have barbecues, Nicholas was always the person serving his family and friends. His wife described  him as a great provider and loving husband  and father.  Tragically, and much  too soon, Nicholas  passed away on March 6, 2014, when a truck  hit his patrol car in Beverly Hills. He is survived by his wife Cathy, and daughters Jalen  and Kendall.  We depend upon the bravery and dedication  of police officers every moment of every day,  and we often  forget  the dangers and challenges they face on our behalf. I ask all members to join me in expressing our condolences  to the Lee Family and the Los Angeles Police  Department and pledge to remember the courage and commitment of Officer Nicholas Lee,  a man who cared deeply about his family and  the Los Angeles community.

157,,113,0.641,1,2014-03-24,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, last week it  was my pleasure to attend a job fair at  Mitchell Community College in Statesville, North Carolina. The job fair was  cohosted by the Statesville Chamber of  Commerce; and both Mitchell Community College president Dr. Tim Brewer  and Chamber president David Bradley  and their staffs are to be commended  for making this important event happen and making these job opportunities  available to  jobseekers  in the  local  community.  As a former community college president, I am aware of the important role  these  institutions play  in providing  workers with the opportunity to improve their skills in order to meet the  demands of employers.  Mitchell Community College and the  Statesville Chamber of Commerce both  played  large  roles  in ensuring  that  Statesville  remains a dynamic  economic center within the Fifth District  of North Carolina.  More than 40 companies were represented at last week’s job fair. About  500  jobs were available,  spanning a  broad  range of  skills, abilities, and  compensation levels. The organizers offered a resume workshop to help applicants make a first good impression.  I would like to take a few minutes to  recognize  just a  few of  those who  helped make this event a success and  who spend every day making the economy and community of Statesville run.  Gina Shumaker is a graduate of the  Mitchell Community College Back to  Work program, and now she is giving  back to her work with Workforce Carolina. Gina spends every day matching  jobseekers with opportunities. She was  at the job fair looking to fill 197 positions, and I commend her efforts to  help individuals get back on their feet.  Goodyear; I also had the opportunity  to talk with Joe Wegmiller, who is the  plant manager for the Goodyear manufacturing plant in Statesville. This facility  has  been manufacturing  tire  molds in Statesville since 1995. I have  had the opportunity to tour the facility, and it is a key employer in the  Fifth District.  Doosan; Doosan Portable Power specializes in making generators, air compressors, and other light construction  equipment.  This  company  is  headquartered in Statesville and brings  more than 100 years of manufacturing  experience to bear on the task of providing quality equipment for construction and other industrial uses. We are  proud that they call Statesville home  and grateful for the opportunities they  provide to members of our community.  ASMO  in North Carolina employs  more than 350 people  in Statesville.  This company produces blower motors,  power seat motors, power window motors, electric power steering motors,  and other assemblies for auto manufacturers.  Mr. Speaker, at last week’s job fair, a  common refrain among employers  is  that they have had a hard time finding  individuals with the skills needed to  fill available positions. This reminded  me of H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act. This  bill would reform and reorganize our  broken Federal workforce development  system.  There is bipartisan agreement that  the current Federal workforce development programs are not meeting the  needs of America’s jobseekers, many of  whom were  in  attendance  at  the  Statesville job fair last week.  In his 2012 State of the Union address, the President asked that these  programs be reformed, and Republicans  in the House went to work and passed  the SKILLS Act, which would streamline 35 ineffective and duplicative programs, including 26 identified as being  ineffective in a 2011 GAO report.  The SKILLS Act empowers job creators,  such  as  Goodyear,  Doosan,  ASMO, and many others  that were  looking  to hire  in Statesville  last  week. The SKILLS Act would allow  local businesses to help steer workforce  development  resources  toward  fields  that are in demand right now. This bill  passed the House over a year ago. I call  on our colleagues over in the Senate to  act on this vital piece of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, this House will maintain its focus on creating an environment conducive to economic growth  and job creation.

161,House,113,-0.428,29,2014-03-24,Mrs. BEATTY.," Thank you to my colleagues.  I would like to thank Mr. HORSFORD  and Mr. JEFFRIES for hosting the Congressional Black Caucus’  important  discussion on celebrating Women’s History Month. As we honor  so many  women who have shaped our history,  let us also celebrate those who make  progress in today’s time.  Certainly, you will hear throughout  this  hour,  ‘‘When Women Succeed,  America Succeeds.’’ What an honor it  was, Mr. Speaker, to hear our President of these United States say it before an audience of millions of people  in his State of the Union address. More  importantly than his saying it is how  it was received. People received it in  the spirit that he said it. Do you know  why, Mr. Speaker? It is because, when  women succeed, America succeeds.  As you have heard, in 1987, Congress  declared March to be National Women’s History Month, giving the Nation  the chance to salute the trailblazers  who paved the way for so many of us to  have the rights that we have today. National Women’s History Month gives us  an opportunity  to acknowledge  the  groundbreakers of the past, thank the  heroines of today, and inspire the leaders of the future. It is a reminder that,  if we believe in ourselves, we can really  make a difference.  It reminds us of women like Rosa  Parks—the mother of the modern civil  rights  movement—or  the  woman  known  for: I shall be unbought and  unbossed. Yes, Mr. Speaker, Shirley  Chisholm, who ran for President and  who was the  first African American  woman elected to Congress, and, yes,  Dorothy Height, who,  if still  living,  would have just this week celebrated  her 102nd birthday. There are so many  more women we could talk about—  women of the past or today—like our  very own Congressional Black Caucus  chairwoman, MARCIAFUDGE, from the  great State of Ohio. Others are unknown outside of their own families  and  communities,  people  like my  grandmother and my great-aunt and  like my 90-year-old mother, who lives  today and sets a great example, not  only for her three daughters, but for  women across this Nation. All of them  are a part of our history, and their  courage and dedication have helped to  sustain the American spirit.  These pioneers and heroines have  brought down barriers and have created new opportunities. We have now  witnessed the first African American  woman Secretary of State, the first female Speaker of  the United States  House of Representatives—a woman I  get to sit with on a weekly basis, a  woman who sets an example. Yes, she  is  Congresswoman  There  is now  a  record number  of  women serving  in Congress, with 20  women serving in the Senate and 82  women serving in the House of Representatives.  However,  although  women have made great strides, there  is much more to do.  We continue to face discrimination  in the workplace. We have a higher  risk of sexual assault and an earnings  gap that will cost the average woman  hundreds of thousands of dollars over  the course of her working lifetime. An  average woman still makes 77 cents for  every dollar made by men, and the gap  is even wider for Black women. On average, Black women earn only 64 cents  for every dollar earned by White men.  In addition, women-owned businesses  continue  to  lag  behind male-owned  businesses. The  average  revenue  of  women-owned businesses is only 27 percent of the average revenue by male-  owned businesses.  PELOSI.

162,House,113,0.469,36,2014-03-24,Mrs. WAGNER.," I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for hosting this  Special Order. There is no greater defender or champion for faith or family  or freedom than Congresswoman VICKY  HARTZLER.  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to protect  the conscience of the American people.  Since taking office in January of last  year, I have heard from countless constituents on how the government  is  abusing  their  individual  freedoms  under ObamaCare over and over again.  I  recently  heard  from my  constituent, George, a seminarian from St.  Louis County, about the administration’s mandate. He notes that what the  administration is asking Catholic hospitals and nonprofits to do is in direct  opposition to our Catholic beliefs. He  writes to me:  Mrs. WAGNER, I ask you to please stand up  for us. We are being persecuted and unjustly  forced to comply with procedures that are in  conflict with our own beliefs.  As George articulated,  the United  States Federal Government  is  currently discriminating against its citizens of faith in this country.  One of this country’s founding principles is the freedom to worship without interference by the Federal Government. Our forefathers did not flee  from oppressive nations, build a country on liberties, and emblaze them in  the Bill of Rights just for this administration to trample on them over and  over again.  Yet the rule issued by the administration under ObamaCare  does  just  that. This administration now mandates  that  religious nonprofits  and  businesses must provide health care  benefits that go against their fundamental beliefs. If businesses and nonprofits do not comply with this mandate, they are penalized with crippling  fines that the gentlewoman from Missouri has talked about. These fines can  go up to $100 per day per employee.  This means that if a business decides  to provide health care but does not  comply with the mandate, they can  owe up to $36,500 for one employee for  the year. This is in comparison to the  $2,000 they could owe for not providing  any health insurance—any health insurance—for  that  same employee at  all.  Mr. Speaker, not only does this not  make any sense, it is discrimination by  the Federal Government  and  it  is  wrong. This mandate puts the jobs, the  livelihoods, and the health care of millions of Americans at risk. It forces  those who stand up for their conscience  to choose between paying detrimental  fines that could shut down their business or dropping health care coverage,  as has been discussed before,  completely for their employees altogether.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you: Should the  Federal Government be allowed to tell  the St. Louis Post-Dispatch what they  can and cannot print? Should the Federal Government tell my neighbors in  Ballwin, Missouri, what they can and  cannot  say about  their government  leaders? Should the Federal Government tell George, the seminarian from  St. Louis County, what he can and cannot preach?  Mr. Speaker, while in many parts of  the world authoritarian governments  control the press, prohibit freedom of  speech, and only allow for certain beliefs, that cannot be the case in the  United States of America. We will not,  I believe, stand by and watch this administration strip away our freedoms. I  will continue to fight on behalf of the  constituents of Missouri and all the  American people to keep this the land  of the free.  ",2014
163,House,113,0.57,36,2014-03-24,Mr. LANKFORD.," I thank the gentlelady for hosting this conversation and  for standing up for liberty. I have seen  you on this floor over and over again,  speaking up for what is right in our  Nation. I very much appreciate that.  When a family runs their business by  the principles of  their  faith, which  those principles used to be protected in  America, can a President step in and  say: I disagree with your faith, and so  I will pass a regulation.  This is very important because some  people believe this is written into the  law. It is not. This is a regulation that  was selected by this President. Can a  President step in and say, I am going  to create a new regulation that you  can no longer practice your faith at  work? You can practice your faith at  home, but you can’t practice your faith  at work.  Hobby Lobby is a family-owned business. It doesn’t want Washington to be  its boss. They believe that abortion  takes the life of a child and that every  child deserves the chance at life. What  is wrong with that?  If a Federal employee disagrees with  the faith practice of someone in a company,  does  that  business  have  to  change their faith, change it to the  faith of the Federal employee, or can  they keep their own faith?  b2100  It is now the rule that to open a company or to work in a job or to get  health care, you have to have the same  religious convictions as the President  of the United States.  If you don’t, you will be fined until  you change your faith practice. That is  not what we are founded on; that is not  who we are—every faith, every opportunity  for every person to  live out  what they believe at home, at work,  and in the community.  Just days ago, the President spoke at  the National Prayer Breakfast about  the cornerstone right of the free expression  of  religion. That  includes  Americans who believe that children  are a gift of God and they should be  nurtured and cared for, not discarded  as tissue.  Washington is not the boss of every  American. Our Constitution matters,  freedom of religion matters, and, quite  frankly, children matter.  This  family  is not some corporate  ogre trying to rule over their employees. They are my neighbor. They live a  mile from my house. They are a quiet  family. They are a great family that  has lived out their faith. They are a  tremendous community partner in so  many ways  in our  community and  around the country and, quite frankly,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:39 Mar 25, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K24MR7.055 H24MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2014
164,Senate,113,-0.312,50,2014-03-24,Mr. MURPHY.," Madam President, I  rise today to support the Ukraine assistance package, which will be on the  floor for a vote later this evening. I  want to thank the leadership of Senator MENENDEZand all the great work  Senator CORKERhas put into this bill.  I was proud to help put it together,  along with Senators JOHNSON, MCCAIN,  and many others who were part of our  debate in the Foreign Relations Committee.  I come to the floor, as I am sure others have and will over the course of  this afternoon, to talk about the vital  importance of a big bipartisan vote in  favor of this legislation this evening.  Having  just come  from Ukraine—I  was there this  last weekend with a  number of my colleagues, and it was  my second trip to Kiev in the last 3  months—I can tell you they are awaiting a very strong signal of support  from the U.S. Congress that will send a  message we are going to stand together  with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters as they engage in this epic battle  for their independence, for their freedom, and for their sovereignty.  I won’t belabor the underlying details of the bill, but the three components of the legislation are all equally  important to Ukraine. We heard support for all three of these pieces while  we were there over this last weekend.  First and foremost, clearly, we have  to deliver on our promise of economic  aid. There is $1 billion of loan guarantees in this bill, and it is contingent  upon the signing of a new agreement  with the IMF, but it will also leverage  about $15 billion in funds from Europe.  This is important because even before  this crisis precipitated by the Russian  invasion of Crimea, Ukraine’s economy  was incredibly fragile, and this international crisis has done nothing but to  further weaken the country.  Ukrainians have a new government—  one they have faith in, one they can believe in—that will finally bring an end  to the corruption which has been rife  throughout the Ukrainian Government  over the past decade. But this new government will be undermined by an economic crisis that will occur, guaranteed, unless the United States steps up  and provides this assistance. But we  can’t do it alone, and so that is why  the  second  component  of  this  bill  would allow the United States to agree  to a set of IMF reforms that would dramatically increase the amount of funding the IMF has to provide countries in  crisis, such as Ukraine.  Every other IMF member has signed  on  to  these  reforms except  for  the  United States, and it has been largely  due to the intransigence of this body  that the United States stands on the  sidelines.  Some  people  have  categorized the IMF reform component of  this bill as superfluous, as a political  add-on. That couldn’t be further from  the truth. When we were meeting with  Ukrainian officials in this new government  last weekend, they specifically  asked that we pass the IMF reforms,  because they know the only way they  get an assistance package that is in the  neighborhood of $20 billion or $30 billion is through the IMF. And the IMF  will be much more likely able to provide that if the United States steps up  and agrees to these reforms.  Lastly, we need to send a strong,  clear message to Russia there are consequences for their actions in Crimea.  By giving the President the authorization to move forward on a broad range  of sanctions, we will show that Putin  was wrong when he calculated that a  march into Crimea would come at little to no cost to Russia.  I want to talk for a minute about  what this really tells us about the status of Russia in the region and in the  world. I am sure my other colleagues  will come down to talk about the importance of sanctions and how they  may change the calculuses being made  in Russia and Moscow today.  I have watched the media portray the  events of the last couple of weeks as  some sign of Russian strength. To me,  this isn’t a sign of Russian strength,  this is a sign of Russian weakness.  Putin has designs for reestablishing  some sense of the old Soviet empire by  reasserting control over what Putin  calls the near abroad, which are the  former Soviet republics and Soviet satellite  states. His dream of  reestablishing the Soviet empire fell apart the  day President Yanukovych fled Kiev.  Ukraine  is the crown  jewel of the  near abroad. As Putin tried to recreate  that empire under the guise of something called  the customs union, he  knew he couldn’t do it without the second biggest country  in Europe bordering on Russia—Ukraine. His invasion of Crimea was a panicked reaction  to this new reality—a Ukraine now oriented toward the European Union.  So today, I think it is important to  understand the position Putin is in. He  has made a mess for the international  community to try to clean up through  his invasion of Crimea.  Crimea represents 2 million people in  a country of 45 million, and 90 percent  of Ukraine has a government in Kiev  which just signed an association agreement with the European Union. Russia’s economy is going to hemorrhage  if he continues the occupation of Crimea through a broad-based set of international sanctions. He has become a  pariah in the world community.  I agree with my colleague from Indiana: We shouldn’t just be talking about  removing Russia  from  the G8; we  should take Russia out of the G8 and  make it completely clear to them that  they don’t have a place at the international  table along with countries  such as the United States, France, Germany, and England if they behave in  this way.  The bill we are debating today will  give the President and new government  in Kiev tools with which to try to address and perhaps end this crisis. But it  is important to remember that this is  not about reestablishing the Cold War.  The world is oriented along paradigms  that have nothing to do with who is  with the United States and who is with  Russia. This panicked invasion of Crimea, while rightly occupying the headlines on a nightly basis, is a display of  Russia’s weak position in the region  and the world after the failure of their  puppet government in Kiev to survive.  Lastly, I will talk about the broader  history, both looking in the past but  also  looking to the  future, we may  miss when we concentrate on an hour-  by-hour basis on the crisis at hand.  Having had the opportunity to visit  Kiev a few times in the past several  months, I have had the opportunity to  learn a little bit about the history of  the place and of the people. There is a  wonderful cathedral in Kiev called the  Church of St. Sophia. It is absolutely  stunningly beautiful. It was built by  Ukraine’s greatest leader, Yaroslav the  Wise. He presided over an empire which  was at the time called Kievan Rus.  Kievan Rus was essentially the hub of  trading on the Eurasian continent. It  took goods from the east and transported them to the west. It took goods  from the Scandinavian countries and  transported them down to the Mediterranean. Everything ran through the  territory of Kievan Rus. It speaks to  Ukraine’s past but also to its future.  They have been set up with a false  choice within the crisis of the last several months: Join the European Union  or stay aligned with Russia. But what  we know is that Kiev historically has  stood at the crossroads—not just east  and west but of east and west and  north and  south. This  is Ukraine’s  past,  but  it  is  also  going  to  be  Ukraine’s future.  While we try to deal today with a  Russia run by a leader whose foreign  policy seems dictated by a desire to  poke a stick in the eye of the United  States, I ultimately think viewing the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:14 Mar 25, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24MR6.011 S24MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2014

166,,113,-0.403,71,2014-03-24,Mr. DEUTCH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor of Private First Class Leonard Kravitz,  who gave his life during the Korean War in an  extraordinary  act  of  heroism  and  posthumously  received  the Medal of Honor on  March 18, 2014. PFC Leonard Kravitz fought  valiantly  to protect our country and rightfully  deserves our recognition and admiration.  I am proud  to represent a district  that  is  home to such a large number of veterans, and  I feel tremendous gratitude to the heroes of  World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and to the new  generation of veterans  from  the Gulf War,  Iraq, and Afghanistan. My  father, Bernard  Deutch, volunteered to fight in World War II as  a teenager where he earned a Purple Heart at  the Battle of the Bulge. It was his example of  service  to our nation  that motivated me  to  serve in Congress.  PFC Leonard Kravitz sacrificed himself for  his platoon when he took over a machine gun,  fired  into an ambush of Communist  forces,  and stayed behind so that his fellow soldiers  could withdraw safely. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for his sacrifice. PFC  Leonard Kravitz was also  recommended  for  the Medal of Honor, but he never received it  due  to widespread prejudice  in  the military  against  Jewish  and  other  minority  servicemembers. His childhood  friend, Mitch  Libman, a resident of South Florida, worked  tirelessly for decades to ensure that the courageous sacrifice of his dear friend would not go  unnoticed. This heartfelt act of advocacy led to  the National Defense Authorization Act of  2002 and H.R. 3304, a bill that I introduced,  which ensures the recognition of all soldiers  who never received the Medals of Honor they  deserved.  In this era of partisan vitriol and gridlock in  Washington, our  leaders can always  look  to  veterans as an example of how  individuals  from all walks of life can put their differences  aside in order to accomplish great things. PFC  Leonard Kravitz has  finally been recognized  as the hero he is, and his friend Mitch Libman  reminds us of the duty we all have to ensure  that no soldier becomes a  forgotten hero.  I  urge every citizen of this great country to live  by their examples.  f  RECOGNIZING  DIPLOMAT  STATES  TAIWAN’S  TO  THE  CHIEF  UNITED  HON. GERALD E.

During his tenure in our nation ’s capital, Representative King was an  invaluable resource  ARIODIAZ-  SIRES,  ALBIO JOHN and dear  friend  to  the Taiwan Caucus. We  congratulate him on his next assignment as  Secretary General of National Security Council  for the Republic of China on Taiwan.  Representative King earned a Ph.D. in journalism from the University of Texas at Austin  and a Master of Arts in Communications from  Texas Tech University. During his recent tenure, Representative King worked  to  resume  negotiations  for  the Trade and  Investment  Framework Agreement (TIFA), turning a new  page in trade relations between Taiwan and  the United States. He and his  team also  worked toward passage of a bill which called  for Taiwan  to be granted observer status  in  the  International Civil Aviation Organization.  President Obama signed  the bill  into  law  in  July 2013.  As co-chairs of  the Taiwan Caucus, we  would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to commemorate  the upcoming 35th anniversary of  the enactment of  the Taiwan Relations Act  (TRA). The legislation established direct relations between Washington, DC, and Taipei.  The 35th anniversary represents an important  milestone  in  our  long-standing  relationship  with Taiwan, serving as the foundation for our  bilateral economic, security, and  trade  relations.  In closing, we congratulate Representative  King and on his successful tenure as Taiwan’s  top diplomat in the United States. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity  and to his enduring friendship.  f  RECOGNIZING THE NORTHWEST  IMMIGRANT RIGHTS PROJECT  HON. ADAM SMITH  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 24, 2014  ",2014
168,,113,-0.283,71,2014-03-24,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, it is  with great admiration that I rise to recognize  the  Northwest  Immigrant  Rights  Project  (NWIRP) on  thirty years of  fighting  for  the  rights of immigrants and refugees in my home  state of Washington. With four offices throughout the state, the Northwest Immigrant Rights  Project has protected the well-being of tens of  thousands of immigrants throughout its history.  The Northwest  Immigrant Rights Project  was  founded  in 1984 as a non-profit  legal  services organization serving Central American  refugees. Since  that  time,  it has expanded to serve individuals and families from  more  than 100 countries around  the world,  and added educational and public policy work  to its efforts. This level of excellence can be  seen in NWIRP’s innovative weekly legal clinics on  the Deferred Action Program, which  have been a vital resource for immigrant youth  in our state.  Our nation needs more advocates  for  the  rights of immigrants and refugees, and I am  proud that an organization in Washington state  is setting such a fine example. I am confident  that  the Northwest  Immigrant Rights Project  will be a strong voice on  these  issues  for  many years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project on a fantastic  thirty years. Their work is of incredible value  and I wish them well in the future.

169,House,113,0.611,2,2014-04-04,Mr. SMITH of Missouri.," Mr. Speaker,  the problems with ObamaCare never  seem to stop hurting families and individuals in Missouri’s Eighth District.  They are experiencing huge increases  in their monthly premiums, and bureaucrats are continuing  to get between doctors and patients.  Additionally, workers are seeing reduced hours because of the 30-hour rule  contained  in ObamaCare. The Save  American Workers Act will  repeal  ObamaCare’s 30-hour rule.  Because of  this  legislation,  small  businesses will no longer be forced to  choose between providing health insurance  to part-time workers or drastically cutting jobs or even eliminating  employees.  A recent study estimated a 30-hour  workweek rule could cost as many as  2.6 million Americans jobs.  Make no mistake, I am still fighting  to  fully  repeal ObamaCare, but  the  Save American Workers Act will not  fix every problem with the ObamaCare  health care mandate, but it will immediately save millions of American jobs,  and it will help families who are struggling to make ends meet.

170,House,113,-0.471,2,2014-04-04,Mr. TAKANO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to pay tribute to Marlan Bourns,  a local Riverside County inventor and  philanthropist who  recently  passed  away at the age of 93.  Marlan and his wife Rosemary founded what was then known as Bourns  Laboratories out of  their garage  in  Michigan, but  its quick growth propelled their relocation to my hometown of Riverside, California.  There, Mr. Bourns’ business grew to  becomes a significant contributor  in  the  fields of  engineering and  technology. His inventions would be used  by NASA, the medical device industry,  telecommunication  companies,  and  personal computer manufacturers.  His fair pay for employees and respectful treatment of them are several  of the reasons why some stayed with  the company for 50 years. He was able  to pour much of his success back into  the community through his generous  endowment for the University of California at Riverside, which is now home  to the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns  College of Engineering.  His friends and family will always remember a creative and inventive man  who carried with him an  incredibly  gentle nature and giving spirit. He will  be greatly missed.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW  CASTLE RED HURRICANES  (Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.)  ",2014
171,House,113,0.319,2,2014-04-04,Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I am here today to offer congratulations to the New Castle Red  Hurricanes for winning their first-ever  Pennsylvania AAAA State championship, with an undefeated 31–0 record.  The ’Canes pulled this off with a 52–  39 victory over Philadelphia’s La Salle  College High School 2 weeks ago  in  Hershey, Pennsylvania, making them  only the  fourth undefeated Pennsylvania  class AAAA  boys’  basketball  champions in State history.  I send a special congratulations to  the players’ families, as well as head  coach Ralph Blundo and New Castle superintendent John Sarandrea.  According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the day after the  ’Canes won,  Coach Blundo told a group of kindergartners that the ’Canes aren’t special  because they won the State championship.  He says they are special because of  their good grades and the  fact that  every one of his seniors are going to  college next year. He says his players  just do things the right way. I couldn’t  agree more. Go ’Canes.  f  HONORING THE ANNIVERSARY OF  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING’S ASSASSINATION  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2014
172,House,113,-0.565,9,2014-04-04,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘no’’ and defeat the previous question,  vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  ",2014
173,House,113,0.65,9,2014-04-04,Mr. WOODALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  Two paths diverged in the wood, and  I took the path less traveled, and that  has made all the difference.  Mr. Speaker, this is Washington, D.C.  There is a term called  ‘‘Washington,  D.C., math,’’ which, as my friend from  Florida, the sheriff, described earlier is  when you can raise spending by $5 and  call it a cut. That is Washington, D.C.,  math.  The path less traveled in this town is  the path of fiscal responsibility; the  path less traveled in this town is the  path of accountability; the path less  traveled in this town is the path of  transparency, and that is what these  three measures before us today propose, Mr. Speaker.  I  held  a  townhall meeting, Mr.  Speaker, about 12 months ago. They  asked if I was going to support the congressional pay raise. I said: Well, we  are not going to do a congressional pay  raise this year, but I hope one day to  come home and tell you that I have  earned it.  I do. I want to show up back home,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  tell  folks  that,  dadgummit: I have earned it. Be proud  of what we have done in Washington,  D.C. I have earned it.  I think that is true of every dime of  spending the Federal Government does.  I don’t think we ought to assume, as  the current baseline does, that every  single Federal agency is going to have  their budget increase next year by the  cost of inflation. I think those agencies  should come  to  this  institution, as  they do  in an annual appropriation  process, and say: I have earned it. I  have earned it.  I am not just talking about making a  difference in people’s lives; here are the  results. I am not just talking about  lifting people up; here are the results.  The hardest  thing  to end  in  this  town, Mr. Speaker, is a Federal program. Once they get started, they seem  to last forever. Mission creep. If they  solve one mission, they are going to  adopt a new mission, roll right on down  the line. Nobody wants to work themselves out of a job.  Is it so outrageous, is it the role only  of the fringe, as my friend from Florida  proposed, to suggest that,  if we are  going to borrow and spend more of our  children’s money, we should come and  justify it?  b1015  Mr. Speaker,  that kind of budget  transparency has become relevant only  to the fringe of America. It is not the  America I know.  I tell the young people—and I try to  start every day back home with young  people, Mr. Speaker. I say, listen, just  tell me what you want in terms of support for higher education because the  only dollars I am going to spend, I am  going to borrow from you. I am borrowing it from you.  We all love our children. We all want  our children to succeed. But we are  borrowing from them. Every decision  we make. These three bills ask  for  three things, and three things only before we make the decision to borrow  from our children:  Number one, the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act. It asks that for those programs that are going to have a big impact on our economy, that we look not  just at what the 1-year impact is, not  just at what the 10-year impact is, but  that we look at a generation of impact.  Before we start down that road less  traveled, Mr. Speaker, we should know  what it is going to cost us and how it  is going to benefit us. We don’t get  that  information today, as the gentleman from Florida, the sheriff, noted.  We have not reformed the Congressional Budget Act since 1974. That kind  of multigenerational  information  is  worthy of this body. This bill would  provide it to us for the very first time.  The Budget and Accounting Transparency Act. If you are going to lend  money, you ought to account for it;  you ought to evaluate it.  We often talk about our $17.5 trillion  debt, Mr. Speaker. That comes from  Washington math because if we were  anywhere else other than this town, we  would have to evaluate all the promises that we have made. I mean, you  know how Social Security is funded,  for example, Mr. Speaker. It is today’s  workers that are paying for today’s retirees. There is not a dime set aside for  today’s workers when they retire.  The  true cost of government,  the  true national debt, as  recently calculated by Dr. Larry Kotlikoff of Boston University, not a conservative by  any stretch of the imagination, is over  $200 trillion—$200 trillion. ‘‘Trillion’’—  we throw these words around as if they  are nothing—that is 1 million millions.  We have not had 1 million days since  the birth of Christ, Mr. Speaker. We  won’t for another 730 years. Mr. Speaker, 1 million millions is 1 trillion. We  have borrowed and promised on behalf  of our children $200 trillion.  The fair value accounting request is  only that we be honest with the American people. I am prepared to live by  whatever decision the American people  make. I believe in our Republic. But we  cannot ask people to make decisions  without providing people with good information. This bill does that.  Then finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill,  again, sponsored by my good  friend  from Texas, LOUIEGOHMERT, a  long  champion that I have the privilege of  serving with in this Congress, the Baseline Reform Act. The Baseline Reform  Act says,  if you are going to raise  spending by $1, you are actually raising  spending by $1.  I know it sounds radical, Mr. Speaker. I know it sounds like the province  of the fringe, but it is not. If you are  going  to  raise  spending by  $1, you  should  say you are going  to  raise  spending by $1. Dadgummit, Mr. Speaker, I can’t even have a town hall meeting these days and talk about budget  numbers—because I am a budget guy—  I  can’t  talk about budget numbers  without  someone  raising  their hand  and saying, now, ROB, when you talk  about spending reductions, is that really a spending reduction, or is that just  a reduction in the rate of growth? That  is how it has become.  For 4 years in this institution, we  have spent  less each and every succeeding year. Now, I would argue, contrary to what my friend from Florida  suggested,  that we  are  prioritizing  spending on shared goals, and we are  deprioritizing spending on which we do  not have those shared goals. It seems  fair in these difficult economic times,  as we are taking those dollars from  hardworking  American  taxpayers  across the country, that we identify  high-priority spending and low-priority  spending.  I will take the work at NIH, as I  mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker. That  is high-priority spending. That is basic  research that is going to make a difference in people’s lives and not a difference  in  something minor, Mr.  Speaker, but perhaps a life-and-death  difference. It is a goal that we share. It  is a goal that the Appropriations Committee shares. It is a goal that we are  going to be able to realize.  But I don’t think there is a single  man or woman at NIH, I don’t think  there is a single professor at NIH, I  don’t think there is a single Ph.D. candidate at NIH who is embarrassed to  come up here and say, I have done well.  I am a good steward of the taxpayers’  money. Trust me again.  Mr. Speaker, that is where I want to  take us with these budget bills. I want  to have folks proud of how they are  spending the dollars, proud to come  and share that with us here in this  Congress and have the American people  proud to get onboard with renewing  those dollars once again.  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support this rule. This rule  has made in order every amendment  that was germane to these three bills.  I ask them to support this rule so that  we can begin voting these bills this  very day.  The material previously referred to  by Mr. HASTINGSof Florida is as follows:  ANAMENDMENTTOH.

Families and small businesses back  home didn’t need to read today’s jobs  report  to know  that  this  isn’t  the  strong  recovery  they deserve. They  know that, with Washington’s $17 trillion of debt, it isn’t hard to see why  our  economy  isn’t  creating  enough  jobs.  Hoosiers understand  the problems,  but they wonder if Washington even  cares.  Republicans owe taxpayers a clear  plan to tackle the debt and jumpstart  the economy with private sector job  growth. That is why my colleagues and  I are offering a commonsense reform to  Washington’s broken budget process.  We have to force the Federal Government to take an honest look at how its  policies affect Americans struggling in  this real economy.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part  B of House Report 113–400.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have  an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate  the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Page 5, after line 23, insert the following:  ‘‘(d) HUBZONE.—The Director shall include  in any macroeconomic impact analysis submitted pursuant to this section the impact,  if any, of the applicable major bill or resolution on any historically underutilized business zone, as that term is defined in section  3(p)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.  632(p)(1)).’’.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution  539,  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas (Ms. JACKSONLEE) and a Member  opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair  recognizes  the  gentlewoman from Texas.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I  rise with the spirit of cooperation and  recognition that there are definitive  distinctions and differences of opinion  on the underlying legislation. I am trying to make this bill better.  My amendment requires the Congressional Budget Office to include as part  of  their macroeconomic analysis,  if  this bill passes, estimates of the potential impact, if any, on HUBZone areas  as defined by the Small Business Act.  My amendment only seeks to look at  the effects, should this measure pass,  on HUBZones as defined in the Small  Business Act.  In all actuality, Mr. Chairman, this  bill could be entitled the ‘‘Revenge of  Dynamic Scoring Act.’’ If that is the  essence of the bill, we need to find the  impact of it.  Dynamic scoring is an attempt measure that macroeconomic effects of policy changes before they happen. We  want to know in the defined areas that  deal with underserved areas all around  America, in everyone’s State, whether  or not there is an impact on these important areas.  I believe that dynamic scoring has an  impact on the outreach and the funding that we have to support the concept of a HUBZone, and therefore, my  amendment  is clear  in  its effort to  make sure that those particular areas  are in fact impacted.  The Small Business Administration  administers several programs that support  small businesses,  including  the  Historically  Underutilized  Business  Zone Empowerment Contracting, better known as the HUBZone.  I recall that the Bush administration  tried to use dynamic scoring to estimate the cost their tax cuts—asserting  that tax cuts would increase revenue in  sort of a trickle-down budgeting, but  the question  is,  these  smaller businesses that are attempting to thrive  and impacted by Small Business Administration programs, how would this  type of structure impact them.  The HUBZone program  is a small  business Federal  contracting  assistance program whose primary objective  is job creation and increasing capital  investment in distressed communities.  That is an important responsibility,  and it is an important goal for this Nation because we know that small businesses can help generate any number of  jobs; and the assistance, I know, personally, to small business has been effective and productive.  With that, I ask my colleagues to  support my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to explain my amendment to H.R. 1874, The Pro-  Growth Budget Act of 2013.  My amendment requires the Congressional  Budget Office to include as part of their macroeconomic analysis, estimates of the potential  impact, if any, on HUBZone areas as defined  by the Small Business Act.  My amendment only seeks to look at the effect,  should  this measure  pass,  on HUB  Zones, as defined in the Small Business Act.  In all actuality, Mr. Chair, this bill could very  well be entitled  the, Revenge of Dynamic  Scoring Champions Act, because that’s in essence what’s going on here.  Dynamic scoring is an attempt to measure  the macroeconomic effects of policy changes  before they happen, and continues to pop up  everywhere; in fact, even in negotiations of the  Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction,  also known as the Super Committee.  Dynamic scoring finds its roots in the anti-  tax movement. Dynamic scoring is problematic  for the agencies that score and estimate the  cost of legislation, and has been soundly rejected.  It is clear from the bill’s language and approach that it is designed to make it easier to  enact deficit-increasing tax cuts.  The bill requires CBO  to produce supplementary estimates of the economic impact of  major bills using dynamic scoring, an approach  that  involves more uncertainty and  subjectivity than current scoring rules.  None other than Former Republican Budget  Committee Chairman  Jim Nussle  opposed  moving to dynamic scoring, noting that CBO  ‘generally have done a better job than some  of the dynamic score-keeping.  That has been part of the challenge of moving  to something called dynamic scoring  is  that we have not found anything that was any  more accurate than the current way.’ ’  Believers in dynamic scoring argue that tax  cuts pay for themselves, generally by spurring  so much economic growth, to the extent that  revenues will actually increase. If I didn ’t know  any better Mr. Chair, I ’d think they were talking to us about trickle-down economics.  Mr. Chair, where have we heard  that before?  I  recall  that  the Bush administration attempted to impose the use of dynamic scoring  to estimate the cost of its tax cuts, asserting  that tax cuts would increase revenue enough  to pay for themselves, sort of a trickle-down  form of budgeting.  Unfortunately Mr. Chair, the Bush tax cuts  did no such thing, but instead caused our national debt  to explode. My amendment only  seeks to look at the effect, should this measure pass, on HUBZones, as defined  in  the  Small Business Act.  The Small Business Administration  (SBA)  administers several programs to support small  businesses, including the Historically Underutilized  Business  Zone  Empowerment  Contracting, better known as  the HUBZone program.

181,,113,-0.514,51,2014-04-04,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize Mr. Albert L. Nellum. Al transitioned  peacefully on March 1, 2014. His impact on  this city and our country may not be as well  known, but  it  is  indelible. Al was a pioneer  consultant, businessman, and activist  in his  own way.  Al was born in the heart of the Deep South:  Greenville, Mississippi and  later grew up  in  Chicago, Illinois as well. He, like a number of  us, arrived to a Washington that now barely  resembles its former self. And yet, he set out  to change it for the better. Opportunities were  scarce  for African Americans, and Al paved  the way for the presence of future black consultants in the District. During the height of the  Civil Rights Movement in 1964, he established  A.L. Nellum and Associates  Inc.,  the oldest  black-owned management consultant  firm  in  the United States.  He also supported and worked with us  in  forming what would become  the Congressional Black Caucus. We relied on Al’s expertise and advice over the years, and welcomed  his input at various stages. He helped to organize the first CBC Foundation dinner as well  as the scholarship program, which he and fellow business  leaders spearheaded. Al also  worked with Rep. Parren Mitchell on the first  CBCF Braintrust on Black Business.  Al’s activism was not limited to the U.S., but  his impact can be felt internationally. His efforts against anti-black racism in Japan are a  testament  to his commitment  to making  the  world a better place. He organized a full page  ad to oppose Japanese racism and advocated  for the fair depiction of blacks. He even traveled to Japan and met with its leaders at his  own expense, to protest these offensive products and derisive images. Al’s ties to Japan  stretched back to the 1950s when he was a  serviceman in the U.S. Army there.  I salute Al Nellum, and extend my deepest  condolences  to his  family and  loved ones.  May the memories of him sustain all of us at  this time.  f  RECOGNIZING  JAKE  CRAIN  AND  THE PEARLAND OILERS BASEBALL TEAM  HON.

182,,113,0.54,51,2014-04-04,Mr. OLSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize  Jake  Crain  of  Pearland  High  School. This young man pitched an impressive  no-hitter on Tuesday, March 25 when  the  Pearland Oilers defeated  the Pasadena Memorial Mavericks. Crain led the Oilers to an 8 –  1 victory, improving their overall record to 5 –  0 in district play.  Professional pitchers play  their entire careers without pitching a no-hitter, and Jake  achieved this as a senior in high school. The  contributions of his teammates were also integral to Jake’s achievement. He relied on his  defense to back him up and the Oilers offense  to put runs on the board. This was a team effort. Great athletes are an extension of great  teams.  The Pearland Oilers baseball team is full of  great teammates. I wish the Pearland Oilers  the best of luck this season. On behalf of all  residents of the Twenty-Second Congressional  District of Texas,  I congratulate Jake Crain  and all of his Oiler teammates on recording a  no-hitter.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

183,,113,-0.429,58,2014-04-04,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, each  year, March is designated as National Women’s History Month to ensure the contributions  of American women will be recognized and  celebrated in schools, workplaces, and communities throughout the country.  Uplifting women of character, courage and  those who have made a lifelong commitment  to serve should be acknowledged and honored. Throughout history, women are found on  the forefront of leadership when dealing with  troubling  issues  inflicting our great country.  Currently, women  face a pay gap  in almost  every occupation. Women are often paid less  than men  in  female-dominated and gender-  balanced professions. This  is awful and we  must work to make a change! We shouldn’t  have to explain this disparity to our daughters  or nieces, should they have their true worth  and value diminished. We must stand together  and fight against the inequality; no one should  be valued as superior over another. We must  continue to work and end the injustice now.  As we embark on the journey of equal rights  for all women, let us acknowledge and be conscious of those remarkable and unforgettable  leaders who struggled for equality before us—  Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner  Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and many  more. As we champion  this year’s  theme,  ‘Celebrating Women of Character, Courage  and  Commitment,’ ’  we  reflect  on  those  women, and how they can be an inspiration to  us as we continue to push forward for equality. It would be my pleasure to recognize these  women  from my district who has done outstanding work, your efforts does not go unnoticed and continue to be great. When Women  Succeed, America Succeeds.

184,,113,0.56,58,2014-04-04,Mr. MESSER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Henry County Commissioner Bill Cronk,  who is retiring after three decades of public  service.  After first being elected as County Commissioner  in 1987, Bill Cronk went on  to serve  five nonconsecutive terms in that position. Bill  became a community leader in Henry County,  working tirelessly to address the concerns of  those he served. He also mentored and befriended countless public officials and community members. Even during a brief hiatus from  his work as commissioner, Bill continued serving Henry County as the head crew chief for  the Henry County surveyor.  During his time as commissioner, Bill was a  key  figure  in  the  forming of  the solid waste  district that continues to serve the county, and  in  the opening of  the Henry County Youth  Center. He was also instrumental in bringing  Ivy Tech to New Castle. Bill’s commitment to  his community and to improving the lives of  his constituents is an example of public service to which we can all aspire.  I ask the entire 6th Congressional District to  join me in honoring Bill Cronk for a long and  distinguished career dedicated to serving the  people of Henry County. I have no doubt that  Bill will bring the same dedication and enthusiasm to the next chapter of his life as he did  in the previous one.  f  HONORING ROBERT GABLE  HON.

186,House,113,-0.391,2,2014-04-29,Mr. CICILLINE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to show you and my colleagues  the faces of the Americans that are  hurting by refusing to renew unemployment benefits.  Just  3 days after Christmas,  this  House leadership left these people out  in the cold and made it more difficult  for them to provide for their family, to  buy food, to pay their mortgages or  pay their rent. It has been 4 months  since  the House Republican  leaders  turned their backs on millions of unemployed Americans, and the situation  grows more dire for these individuals  and their families with each passing  day.  For far too long, this Congress has  described the long-term unemployed in  numbers, figures, and statistics only.  Well, today I hope that will begin to  change and that the Speaker and other  Republicans  leaders will understand  what is happening to real people because of their refusal to extend unemployment benefits.  I am launching something called the  ‘‘Faces of the Unemployed’’ to show  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle just who they are hurting. This  poster board will be outside my office,  and I will be adding people to it as they  share their stories. It will force my Republican colleagues to look into their  eyes as they pass them in the hallway  and to understand that these individuals should not be invisible.  Mr. Speaker, I want you and all of  my colleagues to look at these faces  and explain to your colleagues and to  America why you won’t allow a vote  that will help them put food on their  table, pay their rent, and provide for  their families.  These are real people, Mr. Speaker,  who have been left behind and forgotten about by this body. It is disgraceful  that, while  the Republican  budget  spends billions of dollars abroad and  protects special interest tax loopholes  that  encourage  companies  to  ship  American jobs overseas, this body can’t  provide immediate relief to the long-  term unemployed who are still recovering from the Great Recession.  In the end, this debate is about more  than dollars and cents. It is about the  families who continue to lose unemployment benefits with each passing  day that the House fails to act. It is  about the more than 200,000 veterans  and more than a million children who  have been affected by this loss of benefits.  It is about my constituents, Michael  from Riverside, Rhode Island, who is  about to lose his electricity and gas because he can’t pay his bills and, in his  own words, has ‘‘nowhere to turn.’’  It is about Paula from Bristol, who  has always worked since she was 15  years old and says she is ‘‘being made  to feel like a thief.’’  It is about Lillian from North Providence, who said she would ‘‘rather be  working’’ but can’t find a job.  These  stories  are  not  unique  to  Rhode Island. This is happening to people in every part of our country: Nevada,  Illinois, California, Kentucky,  and Mississippi, to name a few. These  people aren’t Republicans or Democrats. They are hardworking Americans who can’t find work and need our  help.  It is time to put aside our differences  and come together to provide immediate relief to these struggling families.

When Mr. CARNEYand I first came to  Congress, we looked around in search  of others who, like us, were interested  in finding common ground. Mr. CARNEY  and I now meet regularly for breakfast  with a group of Members from both  sides of the aisle.  We come together to discuss commonsense ways to solve our Nation’s  problems that Members on both sides  of the aisle can get behind. The bill  that is on the floor today is an example  of this type of commonsense approach  to making policy.  The purpose of the bill is to fix a  problem  created  by  the President’s  health care law. If we don’t fix it, 1,200  jobs will be lost across the country.  Mr. CARNEYand I may not agree on  everything.  In  fact,  the President’s  health care law is one thing we disagree on; but we do agree this specific  provision is another example of one of  the law’s unintended consequences.  This bill before us today will keep  America competitive and save American jobs. I encourage my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this  important legislation.  ",2014

They are going  to claim it is a patent troll and there  is a monitor behind the curtain, but  who that person is behind the curtain  is the inventor, the person who is coming up with the invention, the Edisons,  the Teslas, and the other people who  have improved our standard of living.  The people who have come up—even  this bill would have a serious impact  on the development of new medicines  and  new  health  care  technologies.  These people need to be protected in  their creation and encouraged, not controlled and not have their rights for  ownership of what  they  created be  trimmed.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  f  LEAVE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:  Mr. GRIFFINof Arkansas (at the request of Mr. CANTOR) for today on account of him assisting with the emergency response to the tornadoes in Arkansas.

SCHEDULE  ",2014
195,Senate,113,-0.194,65,2014-04-29,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President, if you  live along the southeastern coast of the  United States, you know the sea level  is rising. We have a lot of people who  would question the reason for this rise  of the sea  level. Some people deny  there is climate change, that the Earth  is warming up.  I think as we look at the science, we  will clearly understand the greenhouse  effect is occurring. The more we put  gases into the atmosphere by human  action such as carbon dioxide, the more  the Sun’s rays come in and reflect upon  the Earth’s surface and would naturally radiate out into space. The fact  is, as the Earth’s surface reflects the  Sun’s rays back out into space, which  is what Mother Nature intended, keeping the delicate balance of the temperature of the Earth, what happens  when we put greenhouse gases such as  CO2 into the atmosphere, a shield or  blanket, the effect of a greenhouse occurs.  As they reflect back out, they are  trapped—the Sun’s rays, the heat from  them—and it continues to warm up the  Earth. Thus, we have the greenhouse  effect.  One of the consequences of the greenhouse effect  is  that  the  icecaps  in  Greenland to the north and Antarctica  to the south are melting. This causes  the sea level to rise.  Another effect of the greenhouse effect is that as the Earth’s temperature  rises, most of the surface of the planet  is covered with seawater. Therefore,  the water  absorbs  that heat. That  causes additional effects such as the intensity, the frequency, the ferocity of  storms that fuel the storm surge and  power from the surface water they consume.  Having said all of that, then, what  are we seeing as a consequence? As I  said in my opening, if you live along  the southeastern coast of the United  States, you know that seas are rising.  The commerce committee, under the  blessing  of  our  chairman,  Senator  ROCKEFELLER, just held a hearing in  ground  zero. Ground  zero  is Miami  Beach, FL.  One of the people to testify was a  NASA scientist, a Ph.D., who happens  to be a three-time shuttle astronaut.  He  testified  in  front  of  the  committee—not predictions, not forecasts,  he testified what are the actual measurements of the rise of the sea level  over the course of the last half century. That rise is anywhere from 5 to 8  inches along the southeastern coast.  The effects of that are being felt in  southern Florida. For instance, it is  now a normal occurrence at high tide  that we are  finding parts of Miami  Beach are, in fact, flooded. The actual  beach itself and the dunes are higher  than some of the land as it progresses  away from the ocean and the barrier island of Miami Beach becomes lower.  There is a major north-south thoroughfare called Alton Road on Miami  Beach. At high tide, it is frequent that  Alton Road floods. What we are expecting in seasonal high tides coming this  October, just as they were last October,  is we will see maybe up to a foot of  water in Alton Road.  Why does this occur if it is not flooding over the dunes by the beach? Because Florida sits on a porous substrate of  limestone. It  is  like Swiss  cheese. This is why people say: Well,  why do you not do what the Dutch did?  The Dutch built dikes. They are under  sea level; New Orleans, the same thing,  dikes and canals. Under sea level. You  cannot do that in Florida, because with  the porous  limestone supporting the  earth, the land, what happens is the  rise in tides causes more pressure, and  it causes the saltwater to start to invade this honeycomb of limestone that  supports the land of Florida and there  you get saltwater intrusion.  With the rising tides and rising sea  levels, that water also starts coming  into the drainage systems that keep  Florida dry. That is happening now in  Miami Beach at high tide. We had it  last time in October in the seasonal  high tides. We are going to have  it  again in the high tides coming this October. So naturally this  is going to  cause  a  considerable  extra  expense  since you cannot build a dike for the  local government, the State government, and the Federal Government to  keep people dry. I am happy to say the  local governments of South Florida  have all banded together and you are  seeing them speak with one voice as  they have, for example, not competing  for a grant from the Federal Government but instead they have banded together and supported the grant application for the city of Miami which is the  first ground zero, in order for Miami to  try to attack its problem.  There is an economic consequence to  this as well, as we had someone from  the Miami-Dade  convention  bureau  come and point out. I can sum it up as  I did during the hearing: No beach, no  bucks. Florida is blessed since we have  more coastline than any other State  save for Alaska, and we certainly have  more beach than any other State. Florida  is blessed with  these beautiful  beaches that people from all over the  world want to come and enjoy.  No beach, no bucks. It is going to  have a huge economic consequence, not  only in the cost of government to try  to hold back the water but also in lost  business.  I will conclude my remarks by saying  not the measurements, 5 to 8 inches.  That has already been done. That has  happened, 5 to 8 inches of sea level rise  the last 50 years.  Now the forecast. The forecast in the  scientific community—and we had one  of the scientists from one of the State  universities  testify,  along with  the  NASA scientist, is that it is going to be  upwards of a foot within the next 20 to  30 years. By the end of this century, we  are talking 2 to 3 feet.  Let me tell you what that means for  the State of Florida. The State of Florida this year will surpass New York in  population as the third largest State,  moving on toward 20 million people,  and 75 percent of that population is on  the coast of Florida. The east coast,  the west coast, which is the gulf coast,  is 75 percent of our population.

196,Senate,113,0.657,72,2014-04-29,Mr. SCOTT.,"  I  thank  the Senator  from North Dakota for his strong leadership on that which is obvious to most  of us, which is the need to move forward on the Keystone Pipeline.  I was a businessman before I arrived  here in Congress and I will tell my colleagues that our goal in business was  to do the right thing. As a Senator, I  wish to do the right thing for all of the  American people. Thanks to the strong  leadership of Senator HOEVEN, we have  an opportunity to do just that. Yet this  administration  continues  to  ignore  policies that would help hard-working,  hard-hit American families.  I think back several years ago when  I was growing up  in a single-parent  household, and I think about the very  difficult choices my mom had to make  between food and gas and energy consumption. What a horrible position to  put any American family in. Yet every  single day we delay a decision on the  pipeline, we say to struggling families:  Not now, not here, but maybe later.  That is not the right message to send  on the broader topic of this energy  economy.  The fact is, if we factor in incomes  under $30,000, 25 percent of that income  goes toward energy consumption. What  a difficult position to find a single parent in, struggling to make ends meet.  Yet we have an opportunity not only to  address that issue in the broader topic  of the energy conversation but to specifically address the issue faced by millions and millions of Americans, and  that is the issue of unemployment.  The pipeline is not an issue of politics, it is an issue of the American people. The fact is that over 42,000 jobs  would be created and we would pump  billions of dollars  into the Nation’s  economy. Yet the administration simply says—after 51⁄2years, after several  studies—we should wait a little longer,  as if we have not waited long enough,  with  those  42,000 American  families  who could be positively impacted by  going back to work. How long should  we wait to see this administration do  the right thing?  I support this proposal. I support the  legislation. I support congressional action to move this administration into a  position where 61 percent of the American people already  find themselves.  They are already saying, Let’s move  forward on the pipeline. They are ready  to see action on constructing the pipeline because they understand that if we  can’t solve this simple  issue, where  there  is already bipartisan  support,  how do we address the deeper challenges in the energy economy?  I don’t often find myself in the position to quote from members or even  presidents of labor unions. I have to  gulp when I make my next statement,  because it is so rare, so foreign to me.  But I will say that Terry O’Sullivan,  general  president  of  the Laborers’  International Union of North America,  got it right when he said, ‘‘This is once  again politics at its worst.’’  Here we see an amazing collaboration  between labor unions, Democratic Senators, Republican Senators, and conservative groups, all coming together,  asking—even begging—the President to  do the right thing. I don’t know exactly what it will take to get the President to do what he said during a lunch  meeting with all of  the Republican  Senators when he said, Do you know  what we should do? By the end of 2013,  we should find ourselves with a decision coming out of his office, his administration. Yet this is 2014. It reminds me a little bit of ObamaCare;  they continue to move the deadlines.  We need action for the American people and we need action for the American people right now.  Let me close, Mr. President by thinking through where we are today on  such a simple decision. I believe 62 Senators in this body during the budget  resolution  debate  supported moving  forward on the Keystone Pipeline; is  that correct?  ",2014
197,Senate,113,0.34,72,2014-04-29,Mr. HOEVEN., That is correct.  ,2014
198,Senate,113,0.43,72,2014-04-29,Mr. BLUNT.,"  I  thank  the Senator  from South Carolina for pointing out  that bad Economic Policies have the  most impact on the most vulnerable  among us,  including the number he  gave of the percentage of income of  families who have less than $30,000 of  income a year, how much of that already goes to energy.  The administration says they are for  an all-of-the-above energy policy. That  appears to be an all-of-the-above energy policy unless we know it works  and unless we know it is available and  unless we know we could get it, in this  case, from a friendly source. Somehow,  they are not for that. They are for ‘‘all  of the above’’ until we really look at  what is there and what we know works  and what makes our current energy  needs met in the best way.  The pipeline is an example of a solution that would decrease our country’s  dependence on nations we can’t rely on  quite as heavily. It increases our trading  relationship with our very best  trading partner. That oil is going to be  sold to somebody and a pipeline will be  built. The question is, Is the pipeline  built to connect to the most logical  customer and the best trading partner  and come south or does the pipeline go  to the west and the oil goes to Asia?  This  is not about whether  the oil  comes out of the ground.  It  is not  about whether a pipeline gets built. It  is about whether we do that which  makes the most sense.  On April 18, the State Department,  by the direction of the President, once  again, said we are going to wait a little  while longer. How many deadlines do  we have to blow by? I think it is interesting  that  in  the  last  couple  of  months when people have left the administration—when  the Secretary of  the Interior leaves and is asked about  the pipeline, he says, Oh, of course we  should build the pipeline. When the  Secretary  of Energy  leaves  and  is  asked about the pipeline, he says, Oh,  of course we should build the pipeline.  Everybody knows  that  the  logical,  commonsense thing to do is to build  this pipeline and let us benefit from  this energy. It has become an example  of a commonsense decision versus regulators out of control—regulators who  don’t want us to use the resources we  have or the resources that are right  next to us.  The national security implications of  Canadian oil are pretty great and pretty obvious for everybody to figure out.  The economic security implications of  doing business with somebody who does  business with us—every time we send  the Canadians a dollar,  for decades,  they have sent us back at  least 90  cents. Every time we involve ourselves  in  that  trade and  strengthen  their  economy, they turn right back around  and  strengthen  our  economy. Why  wouldn’t we want to do that?  Just the cost alone of building the  pipeline,  talk  about  a  shovel-ready  project: 20,000 jobs, not a single taxpayer dollar involved. In fact, the company immediately starts paying taxes  to State and local government as that  pipeline is extended through communities and almost all of our States. Another  830,000  barrels  of  oil  a  day.  Roughly 6 percent of all of our daily  imports  come  from  this  one  new  source. But, as others have pointed  out, that pipeline then becomes available for other objectives as well. A bipartisan determination on this  floor  has shown that we should obviously  build this pipeline.

199,Senate,113,-0.488,149,2014-04-29,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the Minimum Wage Fairness  Act because it is time to give everyone  a fair shot. More and more States are  voting to raise the minimum wage.  Last week, the Hawaii State legislature passed a bill to raise the minimum  wage in my home State. Hawaii’s bill  would increase the wage from $7.25 to  $10.10, and increase the tip wage to at  least $9.35.  Hawaii will become the tenth State  enacting a wage increase since President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union  Address.  In  2014 alone, Connecticut,  Delaware, Maryland, Minnesota, West  Virginia, and Washington, DC have enacted wage increases. Hawaii will become the 26th State with the higher  minimum wage than the current Federal minimum wage. It is time for Congress to join with the States that are  leading the charge to give hard-working families a raise.  I am going to share a few reasons  why the Senate should vote to raise  the minimum wage. First, today’s Federal minimum wage is a poverty wage.  If the minimum wage had kept up with  inflation since 1968, the minimum wage  today would  be  about  $10.68.

The Coram Fire Department exemplifies  bravery, selflessness, and a strong sense of  community. For 85 years, its members have  been willing  to  leave  their homes and  their  families at any hour of the day or night, running toward danger to save their neighbors.  The department has grown with the community, expanding its services and its facilities to  ensure the safety of Coram residents. It has  opened its fire house to more than just fire-or  department-related activities. Two civic groups  meet regularly at the auxiliary fire house. And  any  time my office  is  in need of a meeting  space, whether to honor our nation’s veterans,  to bring  in banks  to help homeowners with  mortgage issues, or to celebrate our military  academy nominees,  the Coram Fire Department has welcomed us and provided  the  space with support for our events.  The  Coram  Fire  Department  is  also  proactive in its advocacy for the fire and emergency services. Whenever there is something  that can be done to make the jobs of volunteer emergency service personnel easier, or  the need  to call our attention  to something  they  feel makes  it harder,  the membership  works hard to find ways to resolve the issue.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of  the residents of the First Congressional District, and  in particular the residents of Coram, I offer my  thanks and best wishes to the Coram Fire Department. Here’s  to 85 more years of dedicated service to the community.  f  COMMENDING SUMMER BROWN ON  EARNING THE GIRL SCOUT SILVER AWARD  HON.

201,,113,0.913,156,2014-04-29,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to recognize Pastor Benny Tate,  the Senior  Pastor of Rock Springs Church  in Milner,  Georgia, for over 25 years.  When Dr. Benny Tate first arrived in Milner,  Georgia, Rock Springs Church had  just 60  members in its congregation. Today, that number has grown to more than 6,000.  Under the leadership of Pastor Tate, several  ministries  were  formed  at  Rock  Springs  Church in order to meet the needs of the community, including:  The Rock Springs Medical Clinic to care for  those who cannot afford medical  insurance,  the Potter’s House, which ministers to women  battling drug and alcohol abuse, Rock Springs  Christian Academy, offering quality education  to children K  through 12, and  the  Impact  Street Ministries, which helps the homeless by  serving meals and providing clothing to those  in need.  Psalm 68:5 says, ‘ ‘A father to the fatherless,  a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling. ’ ’ Or James 1:27 says, ‘ ‘Religion that God  our Father accepts as pure and  faultless  is  this: to look after orphans and widows in their  distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.’ ’  Dr. Tate’s work is a shining example of what  scripture tells us the role of the church should  be—to care for the poor, the fatherless, and  widows.  Today, Pastor Tate and his wife of more  than  thirty years, Barbara,  reside  in Griffin  Georgia, and are parents  to  their daughter,  Savannah Abigail.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring Pastor Benny Tate  for his 25  years of outstanding leadership and service to  his community at Rock Springs Church. I wish  him many blessed years ahead as he continues to lead, serve, and further the gospel at  his full service church.  f  DONNA PALERMO  HON.

Ms. Palermo began working for the Chamber as an executive secretary  in 1988 and  continued to move through the ranks of the organization, serving as an administrative assistant, vice president, and interim president. In  May 2001, she became the first woman in the  Chamber ’s 120-year history to serve as president, a position she held for 13 years.  Beyond her work with the Chamber, Ms. Palermo  is an active member of  the Hazleton  community, serving  in numerous  leadership  roles including President of the Northeastern  Chamber of Commerce Services Organization,  Chair of  the Luzerne County Convention &  Visitors Bureau, and Chair of the Greater Hazleton Area Civic Partnership. She is also a  member of the Greater Hazleton Health Alliance (now Lehigh Valley Hospital-Hazleton),  Leadership  Hazleton,  Lackawanna/Luzerne  County Metropolitan Planning Organization,  and CAN BE.  In addition to her involvement with many of  the areas organizations and charities, she has  undertaken several special projects, including  an effort to bring back a health insurance program for the Chamber. As a result of her collaborative efforts,  this health  insurance program has grown beyond the Greater Hazleton  Chamber to 17 additional Northeast Pennsylvania Chambers of Commerce.  Mr. Speaker, having had  the pleasure  to  work with Ms. Palermo on many projects centered on community service and economic development,  I can attest  to her  integrity and  strong sense of community pride. Therefore, I  commend Donna E. Palermo for her years of  committed service to her community and the  Greater Hazleton Chamber of Commerce, and  I wish her continued success in the future.  f  CONGRATULATING  MR.

Mr. Gibbs-Bowling of Lincoln High School in Tacoma recently received  the highly prestigious Milken Educator Award,  which is given by the Milken Family Foundation to recognize excellence in teaching. Mr.  Gibbs-Bowling, winner of  the $25,000 prize,  was the only recipient this year from Washington State and one of only 35 educators  honored nationwide.  Mr. Gibbs-Bowling teaches Advanced Placement Government and Advanced Placement  Human Geography, as well as a senior seminar on applying  for college and obtaining  scholarships. He is an engaging teacher who  sets high standards for his students while inspiring them with a creative classroom experience. He is known to have his classrooms debate Supreme Court cases and hold mock  Congresses.

205,,113,-0.263,163,2014-04-29,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mike Jawson on his retirement from  the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  Mike has served as Center Director  for  the  USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences  Center  in La Crosse, WI  for  the past nine  years. During this time, Mike has repeatedly  shown his dedication  to his  field and his  strong leadership capabilities.  Mike’s background is indicative of both his  strong ties to Wisconsin, and his commitment  to his field. Mike earned a Bachelor’s degree  in Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin-  La Crosse, a Master’s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Ph.D. from  Washington State University. In the past, Mike  has worked  for  the Dept. of Defense as a  Chemist,  for  the USDA–ARS as a Soil Scientist, for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln  as an associate professor,  for  the EPA-Kerr  Research Center as Branch Chief, and for the  George Washington Carver Center as a National Program Leader and working with  the  National Climate Change Office.  In 2005, Mike returned to Wisconsin to become Center Director at USGS in La Crosse.  KLOBUCHAR In this capacity, Mike managed the multi-disciplinary program of biological research, directing 11 different science teams, each with dynamic personalities and varied skill sets. As a  leader of the science component of the Upper  Mississippi River Restoration’s Long Term Resource Monitoring Program, Mike was able to  secure and implement funding for facility improvements  and  several  new  restoration  projects. Additionally, Mike was able to host  the  first Center visits of U.S. Senators AMY  and TAMMYBALDWIN, and  then-  Governor Jim Doyle.

206,,113,0.334,163,2014-04-29,Mr. LANCE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor Mr. Kenneth Bateman,  the President  and Chief Executive Officer of Somerset Medical Center, who has been named Outstanding  Citizen of the Year by the Somerset County,  New Jersey, Business Partnership.  Ken is a mainstay of the Somerset community where his contributions to the county, its  residents and  the New Jersey  life sciences  sector have improved the lives of many. Under  his leadership, the Somerset Medical Center  has experienced tremendous growth, expanding and encompassing new missions and endeavors that have made the facility a premier  regional medical center.  Ken and the Somerset Medical Center have  invested  in  the community by building new  state-of-the-art  facilities which  have made  Somerset a healthier and better place to live  and raise a family.  I congratulate Kenneth Bateman for his well-  earned recognition.  f  RECOGNIZING JOSEPH J. WENDA  HON. MICHAEL G.

207,,113,0.202,163,2014-04-29,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, Joseph J.  Wenda, a Middletown Township resident and  former township supervisor, passed away on  April 24, 2014 after a long illness. He was 55  years old, a father and brother, who also will  be  remembered  fondly by his  relatives and  many friends. Joe was soft-spoken and humble in his demeanor, but strongly dedicated to  public service and his community. An elected  township supervisor who served with distinction, he was respected and admired  for his  hard work and thoughtful decision-making. He  was a man of integrity who treated his associates with equal and sincere interest and respected all points of view. He was first elected  supervisor in 1996 and held office until 2001.  Although he was often asked to seek re-election or a higher office, he chose to remain active  in community and civic affairs, serving  with equal dedication. Joe Wenda will be remembered throughout the community he loved  for his contribution and his service—and he  will be missed.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  DARYL  IDLER,  HENRY  GAMBOA  AND  ROBERT  RODRIGUEZ  OF  EL  CAJON, CALIFORNIA  HON. DUNCAN HUNTER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 29, 2014  ",2014
208,,113,0.512,163,2014-04-29,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate  the unselfish  contribution of  Henry Gamboa, Robert Rodriguez and Daryl  Idler and to recognize their tireless support of  the patients of Balboa Naval Medical Center  San Diego.  For eight consecutive years, the ownership  of  the Cottonwood Golf Club, 3121 Willow  Glen Road, El Cajon, CA, has consistently  and generously donated their two 18-hole golf  courses, golf carts, equipment, staff and their  time for the success of the annual Duncan L.  Hunter Wounded Marines Golf Classic. Their  contribution represents as much as $15,000  annually  in  lost  revenue, employee salaries  and miscellaneous expenses for the day of the  tournament, as well as the weeks and months  of preparation prior to the actual event.  Because of their dedication to the patients  at Balboa, more than a quarter million dollars  have been raised during the eight-year history  of the tournament. This year’s classic is the  largest  to date  in  terms of numbers participating and in dollars raised, expected to exceed $75,000.  Always  family oriented, Cottonwood Golf  Club has  the same small-town values  that  make the course such a great place to play.  Some of the biggest events in East San Diego  County that are inspired by their family values  include  the previously mentioned Duncan L.  Hunter Wounded Marines Tournament,  the  Mother Goose Parade Tournament, the Jack-  a-Lopes Classic and a wide variety of  local  and regional community and charitable events.  What makes the Duncan L. Hunter Wounded Marines Golf Classic truly unique is the fact  that every dollar raised goes directly for patient’s care. Armed Services, YMCA, a 501c3  not-for-profit organization, administer the Restricted fund, meaning every penny goes for  the patient ’s creature comforts.  As the Congressman whose district includes  the Cottonwood Golf Club, I am proud to have  the honor and privilege of representing these  businessmen and their great business. I ask  my colleagues  to  join me  in saluting Henry,  Robert, Daryl and everyone at Cottonwood  Golf Club for continuing to demonstrate to all  of us  that caring  for  those who defend our  freedom  is more  than words,  it’s a commitment to following through on what needs to be  done.

210,Senate,113,-0.45,13,2014-05-12,Mrs. BOXER.," I reserve my right to  oppose this modification, and I wish to  briefly explain why, as my colleague  explained his reason why he wanted to  modify.  I think what Senator LANDRIEUhas  offered is what everybody in this country thought we were going to do. Senator LANDRIEUand I disagree on Keystone. No one could be a stronger advocate for Keystone than she is, period.  I believe tar sands should not be  brought into this country the way they  would be brought in at a 45-percent increase with this pipeline—eventually  300 percent. We could have had a robust  debate. The Senator and I would have  been respectful and caring about each  other, but we would have disagreed. We  could have had the vote.  Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I believe when you give your word, you  keep your word. Leadership was very  clear that if we were able to give the  Republicans and Senator LANDRIEU a  vote on Keystone, we could move forward with Shaheen-Portman, a bipartisan, incredibly important energy efficiency bill.  Instead, what we know  is Republicans want to offer—and it is in my jurisdiction so I can speak about it—environmental riders, the likes of which I  have never seen in one grouping, essentially  repealing  the  essence of  the  Clean Air Act that was signed into law  in 1970 by Richard Nixon, and the 1990  amendments which were signed  into  law by George Herbert Walker Bush.  They want to put those on this bill.  You have got to be kidding. Something  as serious as that?  So I object to the modification.  ",2014
211,Senate,113,0.636,20,2014-05-12,Mr. RISCH.," Mr. President, this week  we celebrate National Small Business  Week, which pays tribute our Nation’s  many small business owners and entrepreneurs. I wish to recognize a small  business in my home State of Idaho  that provides an  invaluable  service.  There is something special about businesses that dedicate themselves to providing and improving life-saving equipment. Search and rescue teams, first  responders,  and  emergency medical  technicians hold a high standard for  what they will purchase, because there  is no margin  for error. It gives me  great pleasure to honor Cascade Rescue  Company of Sandpoint, ID.  In 1962, Victor Bradley was volunteering his time to help injured skiers  in Washington State. Pulling someone  on the toboggans in use in the 1960s  was incredibly strenuous, especially if  several people needed help. Mr. Bradley  knew that there must be a better design. Mr. Bradley spent several years  designing and improving sleds, until in  1966 he decided to start the Cascade Toboggan & Rescue Equipment Company.  Mr. Bradley and his son Robert obtained a patent for their design and  began selling toboggans to rescue professionals throughout the region. Orders  grew  exponentially,  especially  after a demonstration at Lake Placid  drew national attention. Robert Bradley took the reins from his father in  the early 1970s, and helped develop Cascade Toboggan into an internationally  respected brand.  Ownership later transitioned to Dana  and Susan Jordan,  relatives of  the  Bradleys, who are the current owners  and operators. To better fit the over  150 products being provided, they renamed  the business Cascade Rescue  Company, which is based in Sandpoint,  ID. Today, the company provides rescue equipment across America and to  23 other countries.  So  often, we measure  success  in  terms of dollars and cents. While Cascade Rescue Company has a strong bottom line, they can also be proud of having been a vital component of countless  life-saving responses. Ski patrols, firefighters, and medical technicians rely  on Cascade products every day to safely and effectively do their jobs. I congratulate Cascade Rescue Company for  nearly 50 years of growth, dedication,  and service and wish them well in the  future.∑  f  CONGRATULATING MARELLI’S  MARKET  ∑",2014
212,Senate,113,-0.259,20,2014-05-12,Mrs. SHAHEEN.," Mr. President,  I  wish to congratulate Marelli’s Market  in Hampton, NH, on celebrating their  100th anniversary.  Opened in 1914 by Italian immigrants  Luigi and Celestina Marelli, Marelli’s  has been  serving  traditional  Italian  fare,  including cigars, olive oil, and  homemade ice creams, to generations  of  families  in the Hampton community. They are most well-known  for  their world-famous  roasted  cashews  and peanuts, which the  family continues to roast themselves.  Today Marelli’s is run by Luigi and  Celestina’s sons, Richard and Bobby,  and grandchildren, Karen Raynes and  Marcia Hannon-Buber, and the market  has  remained a  cornerstone of  the  Hampton community. The market was  recently entered into the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places,  a testament to its place in our State’s  history.

I salute the chairman of our T&I  Committee, Mr. SHUSTER from Pennsylvania, for his tireless efforts in this  regard, and as well our subcommittee  chairman, Mr. GIBBS, and our ranking  member on the full committee, Mr. TIM  BISHOP.  One of the first acts of our Federal  Government was to  improve navigation. On August 7, 1789, the first Congress federalized the lighthouses built  by the Colonies and appropriated funds  for their operation and maintenance.  b1275  Today, in the 113th Congress, we keep  faith with that fundamental premise of  government by advancing  legislation  that authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers  to  improve navigation on  our inland waterways and our ports.

217,House,113,-0.373,30,2014-05-20,Mr. NOLAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in support of the Justice for Victims of  Trafficking Act as a proud original cosponsor of the legislation.  I want to join the chorus of people  here in their praise for Judge POEand  for Congresswoman MALONEY for the  tremendous work that they have done  over a number of years bringing this  important legislation forward; and, of  course, to Congressman GOODLATTEand  Congressman SCOTT likewise for bringing this forward.  It is too troubling to know that there  are 300,000-some children that are being  sold into sex trafficking in this country, and that there are only some 300  beds for them when attempts are made  to rescue, as Judge POE just pointed  out. These children aren’t in some foreign country. They are right here in  our own backyards. These are our own  children. We can do so much better.  While our national law enforcement  officials  are  fighting  this  terrible  scourge, there are many organizations  like Men Against Trafficking in Duluth, Minnesota, in my own congressional district, who are out there providing safe harbor services for girls and  boys that are rescued from this terrible  scourge.  This legislation represents the fact  that Congress recognizes that we can  be of assistance in fighting this terrible  scourge. We do so with this act—again,  of which I am a proud cosponsor. But I  am so proud of what Judge POE and  CAROLYNMALONEYhave done on this.  What the bill does, it says that these  children are the victims, they are not  the criminal, as they have so often  been treated in our society. They are  the victims of child abuse, they are the  victims of rape and violence and unmentionable crimes and terrible, terrible things. They are entitled to the  protection, the medical services, the  counseling, all that we can provide.  ",2014
218,House,113,0.447,30,2014-05-20,Mrs. WALORSKI.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today and speak on the importance  of combating human trafficking. I am  grateful  that  the House  is bringing  forth five antitrafficking bills to the  floor today.  Human  trafficking, which  includes  labor and sex trafficking, is the second-  largest and  fastest-growing criminal  industry in the world. Trafficking may  seem  like an  international problem,  but there are 300,000 children at risk of  sex trafficking here in the U.S.  The State of Indiana has formed a  cutting edge, antitrafficking task force  that involves both public and private  groups. This task force, called IPATH,  has investigated more than 200 cases in  Indiana, and continues to rescue children and adults from involuntary servitude in commercial sex trafficking.  Great work is being done in the Hoosier State, but antitrafficking advocates agree that much more is needed.  That is why I am proud to cosponsor  the Justice for Victims of Trafficking  Act and proud  to  support  the bills  being voted on today.  This bill will provide  law enforcement with necessary tools to address  the problem of trafficking by helping  tackle the demand issue itself and improve services  for survivors.  It also  protects  foster children by requiring  that the National Center for Missing  and Exploited Children  be  notified  when children are missing from foster  homes or child care institutions.  Madam Speaker, protecting people  trapped in trafficking situations is not  a partisan or a political issue. It is not  an issue that only happens overseas. It  happens on American soil, and it happens every day all across this country.  We must work together to fight this  issue, to be the voice for those who are  literally trapped, and to bring an end  to this terrible crime.  I urge my colleagues to support the  antitrafficking bills on the floor today.  ",2014
219,House,113,0.563,30,2014-05-20,Mr. PITTENGER.," Madam Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  the Justice for Victims of Trafficking  Act, and much other legislation that  we will consider today.  I also rise  in support of Antonia,  Maria,  and  Rosa,  three  wonderful  women from Charlotte who fell victim  to human trafficking.  Maria was  trapped when  she  answered an ad  for aspiring actresses.  Rosa was snatched from a local gas station while waiting for a ride. Antonia  dreamed of owning a bakery before  falling victim to human trafficking.  These women aren’t statistics. They  are  individuals whom  I know  from  Charlotte, ordinary women—someone’s  daughter,  someone’s  granddaughter.  Yet at a very young age they were  forced into modern day slavery.  According  to  the Department  of  Homeland Security, trafficking is a $32  billion a year industry, and the average  age for a girl entering the commercial  sex trade is just 12 to 14 years old.  Madam Speaker, this is one of the  most heinous of crimes. As Members of  Congress, we have a constitutional and  moral obligation to protect the most  vulnerable in our society from this horrific exploitation. Increased awareness  and education is a critical first step in  breaking the cycle of exploitation here  in the United States and around the  world.  Today, we have the opportunity to  take legislative action, voting on five  bills which will help people like Antonia, Maria, and Rosa. Today, we can  vote to enhance the victim assistance  programs, give law enforcement better  tools to catch the scum whom we call  traffickers  and  facilitators,  and  fix  some of the loopholes exploited by traffickers.  Thank you  to Mr. GOODLATTE,  to  Judge POE, to Mrs. MALONEY, to SUSAN  BROOKS, and to many others who are  involved in this very important effort.  Thank you to the majority leader for  his involvement, to all members of the  trafficking task force, and thank you  to each Member who will support this  very important cause.  Thank you  to Antonia Childs  of  Charlotte, who has dedicated her life to  helping other women escape modern  day slavery. Maria and Rosa wouldn’t  be on the road to recovery without you.  I urge my colleagues today to support the antitrafficking legislation before us today.  ",2014

221,House,113,0.635,51,2014-05-20,Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan.," Madam  Speaker, we know a lack of normalcy  and barriers to participation in sort of  age-appropriate  activities  increases  vulnerability of trafficking, homelessness, and other negative outcomes that  kids that are in foster care experience.  This bill—and I appreciate the authors  of this bill—would ensure that youth  and foster care can participate in more  age-appropriate activities and they are  going to be better connected with their  communities and their friends and less  vulnerable, therefore, to becoming victims of sex trafficking.  In all this nastiness, negativity, and  ugliness, I get to talk about a little ray  of  hope,  though,  as well. Bethany  Christian Services, which is located in  west Michigan and has operations in  my district, is an example of an effective child welfare organization  that  dramatically  improves outcomes  for  children in foster care.  Bethany  comes  alongside  families  who will walk with these kids at this  time of crisis and welcome them unconditionally into their loving, caring  homes.  It  is also an organizational  model that has proven successful. Foster parents work with staff from community  agencies  toward  identified  goals for the children in their care, empowering these foster parents to dramatically improve outcomes for those  kids that are in their care.  I thank the author of this, who is  going to give this same opportunity to  all foster children.  ",2014
222,House,113,-0.402,51,2014-05-20,Mr. DOGGETT.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker,  I want to thank  Chairman REICHERT for his leadership  on this measure.  In this place, we need to make what  progress we can under the conditions  that exist and make as much of it as  possible. I hope that the Senate will respond to this measure. But in order to  provide an effective response, we need  to have the revenues to provide the resources along with the requirements to  meet the needs of our foster youth.  A few weeks ago, I met with a number of attorneys in San Antonio who  work with  foster youth, particularly  those who are aging out, as well as a  number of community service groups,  religious and nonreligious in their orientation. They describe immense problems that our foster youth face. When  they age out at age 18, only about 2  percent of those young people in the  San Antonio area ever end up in college.  b1730  Many of them do get a substantial  taxpayer subsidy over their lives. Unfortunately, it is a subsidy in our jails  and in our penal system after they are  engaged in some harmful conduct.  This bill is one step that we can take  to address the exploitation of these  young people, particularly of young  women. There are broader problems  out there that need our attention, but  I  favor moving  forward with  the  progress that we can make today to address this one critical problem.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2014

SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.  (a) SHORTTITLE.—This Act may be cited as  the ‘‘International Megan’s Law to Prevent  Demand for Child Sex Trafficking’’.

Sec.5.Sense of Congress provisions.  Sec. 6.Enhancing the minimum standards  for  the  elimination  of  trafficking.  Sec.7.Assistance  to  foreign countries  to  meet minimum  standards  for  the elimination of trafficking.  Sec.8.Rules of Construction.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds the following:  (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years  old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and  murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey  by a violent predator living across the street  from her home. Unbeknownst  to Megan  Kanka and her family, he had been convicted  previously of a sex offense against a child.  (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan’s Law  (Public Law 104–145) as a means to encourage  States to protect children by identifying the  whereabouts of sex offenders and providing  the means to monitor their activities.  (3)  In  2006, Congress passed  the Adam  Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of  2006 (Public Law 109–248) to protect children  and the public at large by establishing a  comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and  law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders.  (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that  known  child-sex  offenders  are  traveling  internationally, and that the criminal background  of  such  individuals may not  be  known to  local  law enforcement prior to  their arrival.

224,House,113,0.529,65,2014-05-20,Mr. THORNBERRY.,"  chairman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I want to start by  commending the leadership of Chairman MCKEON and Ranking Member  SMITH in getting this bill to the floor  in such a timely way, especially after  the President’s budget was quite late,  but also in getting this bill here on a  unanimous vote by the committee.  None of us agrees with every provision that is in this bill, but members of  the committee were able to put aside  personal  preferences  on  individual  issues to support a bill that benefits  the Nation overall, and I hope that the  House will do likewise.  I think it is important to emphasize  that it has been a bipartisan effort,  working together with the chairman  and the ranking member and also with  the chairmen of the subcommittees and  with the ranking members of the subcommittees, that has gotten us to this  place.  I think it is especially appropriate  for this bill to be named for Chairman  MCKEON, not only in recognition for  his leadership on this bill, but for his  leadership of  the  committee during  some very challenging circumstances  throughout his tenure.  Some of those challenges have  included our own budget issues, as was  just addressed by the ranking member,  as well as a myriad of threats around  the world, so this measure that does so  much for our country’s security will always be associated with the many contributions of Chairman MCKEONto our  country’s security.  Mr. Chairman, this bill meets the  budget  targets  of  the House-passed  budget resolution and also of the Ryan-  Murray budget agreement. I agree with  the ranking member in that it does not  solve our budget issues in the future—  we still have to grapple with those—  but this year, it meets those requirements, and it does so by making some  difficult choices.  In addition, among the many provisions of this bill, there are those that  start to make a modest start on some  defense reforms that are being worked  on by both the House and the Senate in  coordination with the Pentagon and  with private industry.  I think everyone recognizes that we  have to find a way to get more defense  out of the money we spend, and there  are some small but important steps to  enable us to make greater progress in  that area in the future, both by reducing overhead and by improving the way  we acquire goods and services.  This bill is also active in all areas of  responsibility for the Subcommittee on  Intelligence, Emerging Threats, and  Capabilities, including military cyber,  science and  technology,  information  technology, defense  intelligence, special operations, and counterterrorism  and irregular warfare.  I agree with the ranking member on  the  importance, especially, of cyber  and special operations. In addition, we  have  coordinated  with  other  subcommittees on a number of provisions  that touch on the areas I have mentioned. In fact, I think the work among  the  subcommittees has  been  closer  than I have ever seen it.  In that regard, I want to express my  appreciation  for my partner on  the  IETC Subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN), for  all of his insights and cooperative spirit that make our work together so beneficial and rewarding. Like the chairman, I appreciate all of the work of the  staffs of the subcommittee and the full  committee.  ",2014

Gregg and his commendable service  to  Michigan’s Western District as a bankruptcy  judge.  Judge Gregg served Michigan’s Western  District as a United States bankruptcy judge  for 27 years. Further, his service to the state  has been a long time commitment, as he has  worked for Michigan communities for over 30  years.  After graduating from Wayne State University with his Juris Doctor, Judge Gregg chose  to remain in Michigan to practice. He served  as  a  partner  of Varnum, Riddering,  and  Schmidt & Howlett in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  In 1987, Judge Gregg was designated in The  Best Lawyers in America.

234,,113,-0.434,261,2014-05-20,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Rotary Club of Sacramento as  they celebrate the 100th anniversary of their  founding. As members and supporters of this  fine organization gather,  I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Rotary  Club of Sacramento for a hundred years of incredible service to the Sacramento region.  For a century, the members of the Rotary  Club of Sacramento have stayed true to their  mission, which is to ‘ ‘encourage and foster the  ideal of service.’ ’ They have successfully done  this by providing Rotarian ’s  time,  talent and  fundraising abilities to improve the quality of  life for groups and individuals throughout the  Sacramento area. One of the greatest things  anyone can do for their community is to invest  in the future of our youth. The Rotary Club of  Sacramento understands the importance of offering a hand of service to youth organizations  and they have worked with over 250 non-profit  organizations  that  include  the Boy Scouts,  Girls Scouts, Boys  and Girls Club, Sacramento Children’s Receiving Home, Sacramento Children ’s Home, WIND Youth Services, Society  for  the Blind, BloodSource,  YMCA, Sacramento Zoo, Sacramento Library  and Powerhouse Science Center. Additionally,  the club sponsors  the Burt Chapell Golf  for  Kids Golf Tournament which benefits orthopedically handicapped children. The golf tournament had its inaugural tournament in 1927  and is the longest continuous event in all of  Rotary.  Much of  the world has changed over  the  last 100 years, but one constant has been the  Rotary Club of Sacramento’s service  to our  community. The Rotary Club of Sacramento  has  the distinction of being  the 85th oldest  club in all of Rotary International and it has  grown to be one of the twenty largest clubs in  the world. The club started with 34 members  and now has over 500 members. Members of  the Rotary Club of Sacramento come from a  wide variety of careers, backgrounds and cultures, which has given the club a unique perspective and a shared passion for service.  Mr. Speaker, as they gather for their Centennial Gala, I am pleased to honor the Rotary  Club of Sacramento and its members for their  longstanding commitment and service  to  the  entire Sacramento region. I ask my colleagues  to join me in wishing the club continued success in creating a positive, lasting change in  the Sacramento area.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE PIPELINE  INSPECTION ENFORCEMENT ACT  OF 2014  HON. JANICE HAHN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 20, 2014  ",2014
235,,113,-0.39,261,2014-05-20,Ms. HAHN.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing  the Pipeline  Inspection Enforcement  Act of 2014 to prevent oil pipeline leaks like  the one that greatly damaged the community  of Wilmington, CA.  Los Angeles  is home  to one of  the most  vast pipeline networks  in  the United States.  Both oil and gas pipelines connect the Port of  Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach with  the refineries in the area. Therefore, pipeline  safety is a very important topic for me and the  communities which make up  the neighborhoods surrounding the Port of Los Angeles—  including Wilmington, a primarily working class  community. I have represented Wilmington for  over 10 years—first on the Los Angeles City  Council, and now as a Member of Congress.  Because Wilmington sits on top of one of  the largest oil fields in the nation and a complex system of pipelines, this community lives  with a heightened threat of a pipeline leaking  or exploding. This became an unfortunate reality  for many  residents of Wilmington  this  March when an  idle pipeline burst, causing  thousands of gallons of crude oil to spill onto  a residential street reeking havoc on the lives  of families who live in the community.  The legislation I am introducing today would  have prevented the damage these families experienced by forcing companies like Phillip 66  to simply have  firsthand knowledge of what  their pipelines contain and empowering our  state  regulatory agencies  to be engaged  in  pipeline inspections.  These basic improvements to federal policy  would protect countless communities like Wilmington at no additional cost. I look forward to  working with my colleagues  in Congress  to  make this legislation law.  f  IN HONOR OF SUE MARIE  THOMPSON TURNER  HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

237,House,113,-0.397,11,2014-05-28,Mr. CASTRO.,"  In closing for our side, Mr. Speaker,  I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman  from Florida  (Mr. DIAZ-  BALART), my  legislative  brother,  a  member of the Committee on Appropriations and a champion of freedom,  democracy, and human rights in the  Western Hemisphere and around the  world.  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I  also rise in support of this important  resolution,  the  Venezuelan  Human  Rights and Democracy Protection Act.  I first, Mr. Speaker, want to start by  thanking my dear  friend, a  tireless  champion for human rights and democracy  around  the  world.  She  has  thanked, and rightfully so, a number of  people who have helped with this important legislation. But we would not  be dealing with this issue on the floor  if it weren’t for the tireless effort, the  constant and tireless struggle,  fight,  solidarity,  and  efforts  of my  dear  friend,  my  sister,  Congresswoman  ROS-LEHTINEN. Those  people  around the world who are struggling in  gulags and struggling for their freedom  know that they have in ILEANAROS-  LEHTINENa true champion, and, once  again, we  see  that  leadership here  today.  Mr. Speaker, since mid-February, the  people of Venezuela—led mostly by students, by the way—have risen up to  protest the corruption, the food shortages, the crime rates, and the alarming  repression that have worsened during  Maduro’s few months in office, in control.  In  response  to  these  legitimate  peaceful grievances, Mr. Speaker, what  the Venezuelan regime has done is they  have ordered security  forces to brutally crack down—brutally with great  force and brutality—crack down on the  opposition. They have used unlawful  force. They have used severe beatings  and beatings of unarmed protesters,  mostly students, and, by the way, even  shooting  some  of  them  pointblank.  They even jailed some of the main opposition leaders on phony charges, Mr.  Speaker.  Since the protests began, as you have  already heard, more  than  40 people  have been killed, about 3,000 people  have been arrested, many have disappeared, and hundreds more have been  injured, Mr.  Speaker.  In  addition,  Maduro’s regime has instituted a virtual media blackout, blocking images  even over the Internet and, by the way,  even  expelling  journalists,  including  CNN and NTN. Just this past weekend  alone, the Venezuelan regime blocked a  CNN news crew  from covering  local  elections. Obviously, they don’t want  anybody there who can show when and  how they are stealing those sham elections.  It is shameful, Mr. Speaker, that the  Chavez-Maduro  regime policies have  managed to really get one of the richest economies in Latin America, the  largest oil exporter in Latin America,  and they have made it apparently a  poverty-ridden nation. People now face  shortages of some of the most basic  commodities, Mr. Speaker. And, by the  way, inflation is about 50 percent over  the last year. So no wonder the people  are struggling.  Maduro has intensified his intimidation tactics, though, by increasing political arrests and by militarizing his  response, using thugs to respond to the  peaceful opposition members and students who are in the streets demanding  freedom. He has been labeling those unarmed opposition leaders as terrorists  and also enemies of the state. We have  heard that before, Mr. Speaker.  This bill, frankly, just directs our administration to rightly deny visas, to  freeze assets, and prohibit  financial  transactions to the members of the  Venezuelan  regime  responsible, Mr.  Speaker, those responsible for committing these human rights abuses. These  corrupt cowards who now have blood  on their hands shouldn’t be allowed to  travel to our country while they continue to brutalize their fellow students,  the students who are in the streets demanding freedom and the regaining of  their sovereignty.  It is time to hold these human rights  abusers accountable. Those complicit  with those egregious acts of human  rights violations, Mr. Speaker, they  have to be named. They must be named  and shamed. And they need to suffer  the consequences of their actions.  So, Mr. Speaker, I have the great fortune and privilege of representing a patriotic and vibrant Venezuelan American community in southern Florida.  They continue to bring attention to  these deplorable conditions of those in  Venezuela while the vast majority of  the  international  community  that  some would like us to yield to their  wishes, but yet they are not saying  anything. The Venezuelan people are  standing up—in many cases dying in  the streets—and the vast majority of  the international community is silent.  So some would have us just also be silent.  With the passage of this bill, the  United States House of Representatives  will send a strong signal that we stand  in solidarity with the Venezuelan people. As they struggle to regain democracy and to regain their freedom from  the Maduro regime, this House, the  United States of America, the people’s  House, stands with them. So I urge the  support of my colleagues on this commonsense resolution.  I keep hearing people that I greatly  respect: Well, but not all Venezuelans  support  sanctions. No. The  regime  doesn’t support the sanctions. But this  House, led by this leader right here sitting next to me, was instrumental in  strengthening sanctions against  Iran  when a lot of the international community was against it and, frankly, when  the administration—our own administration—was  lukewarm at best. But  this House  stood  firm. This House  stands  for  freedom  and  democracy.  And, today, once again, this House can  stand proudly side by side with those  who are giving their all in the streets  of Venezuela to regain their freedom,  their sovereignty and their dignity.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield back the balance of my time.  ",2014

241,House,113,0.503,39,2014-05-28,Mr. CULBERSON.," Madam Chairman,  when I was first assigned to the Appropriations Committee, I asked specifically to serve on the Commerce, Justice,  Science  Appropriations  Committee because of my passion for the  sciences,  for NASA,  for  law enforcement, but especially to serve alongside  FRANKWOLF.  I have come to know FRANKWOLFas  a model public servant. He is someone  who always does the right thing for the  right reasons, and the country is generally going to miss this good man. I  can’t think of a single issue that we  have dealt with in this bill that FRANK  hasn’t been the first to see the problem  approaching over the horizon—he has  recognized from the beginning.  When we took the majority several  years ago, Chairman WOLF, Chairman  ROGERS, all of us in the majority, as  fiscal conservatives, recognized the urgent need to prioritize our constituents’ hard-earned tax dollars and target them on those areas that are the  highest priority for our Nation.  This bill, as Chairman ROGERS said,  is a true reflection of FRANKWOLF’s  priorities, the fact that it is one that  we are all able to work on together,  without regard to party labels, because  we found common ground.  One of the great joys of serving on  this committee  is  to  find  so many  areas where we are able to work together and  find areas of agreement  when it comes to the sciences or law  enforcement.  The work that Chairman WOLFhas  done, for example, in protecting persecuted Christians and religious minorities around the world, this committee, all of us, Democrat and Republican alike, have been there to support  him.  Chairman WOLFwas one of the first  to spot the problem of cyber crime  coming primarily out of Communist  China. FRANKwas one of the very first  to ring the firebell and warn us of the  dangers  of  the People’s Liberation  Army and the cyber attacks on this  Nation and on private  industry.

242,House,113,-0.31,60,2014-05-28,Ms. ESTY.," Madam Chair,  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  the Thompson-King-Esty-Heck amendment to  increase funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Checks Systems (NICS).  The NICS database provides critical  information on prospective  firearms buyers, protecting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. Information in the database is  used to determine whether an individual is ineligible  to purchase a  firearm because  they  are a felon, a domestic abuser, or seriously  mentally ill. The NICS database allows sellers  to  conduct  criminal background  checks  to  make sure  firearms are not getting  into  the  hands of people who may be a danger to the  public or even themselves.  Unfortunately, many states do not have adequate  funding and  resources  to submit  the  most recent and comprehensive data  to  the  NICS database. Our amendment would  increase  funding  for NICS by $19.5 million  to  meet the growing demand from states to responsibly update the database.  According  to  the Brady Campaign  to Prevent  Gun  Violence,  criminal  background  checks have blocked more than 2.1 million illegal gun purchases,  including more  than  291,000 by domestic abusers. Background  checks prevent more than 171 convicted felons  from purchasing  firearms every single  day. These simple checks have saved countless lives in the past two decades, and it is  essential that states have the necessary tools  to prevent more tragedies in the future.  I thank my good friends Rep. MIKETHOMPSON, Rep. PETERKING, and Rep. JOEHECK for  their outstanding partnership on this commonsense amendment. Their  leadership proves  that  legislation  to prevent gun violence and  protect our families should not be a partisan  issue. I urge all Members to support this commonsense amendment to save lives.  ",2014

244,,113,-0.329,81,2014-05-28,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the addition of a piece of Massachusetts’ —and our nation’s—history  to  the  Smithsonian National Museum of  the American Indian (NMAI). In September 2013, a traditional canoe of the Wampanoag tribe, known  as a mishoon, was delivered to the NMAI from  Plimoth Plantation  in Massachusetts—completing  its  trip  down  the  coast  from  the  Wampanoag’s historical home to our nation’s  capital. Here, it will be proudly displayed as a  symbol of the cultural significance and technological advancement of the Tribe.  The history of  the Wampanoag  is deeply  intertwined with  the  turbulent settlement and  birth of our nation. Known as ‘ ‘the People of  the First Light,’ ’ the Wampanoag Tribe inhabited southern New England at the arrival of the  first European settlers. It was the Wampanoag  with whom  the Pilgrims celebrated  the  first  ‘Thanksgiving,’ ’ and it was from the preceding  and continued interactions between these settlers and that native population that our modern  judicial  system and promotion of  civil  rights evolved.  Today, the Wampanoag Tribe continues to  play an active role  in promoting  tribal rights  and preserving their heritage. Plimoth Plantation’s Wampanoag  Indigenous Program  is a  shared museum that has worked to educate  citizens across  the country and raise public  awareness of the shared history, rich culture,  and traditions of the tribe. The gift of the hand-  made mishoon—a  vessel of passage and  goods—is  symbolic  of  the  role  of  the  Wampanoag people have played  from  the  early years of our nation to our continued fight  for equality and tribal rights. I am proud that  it has found a home at the NMAI—an institution devoted to the preservation of our nation’s  intricate history.  Mr. Speaker,  I encourage my colleagues  and  their constituents  to  join me  in experiencing a page out of history and visiting the  Wampanoag mishoon at the NMAI.  f  COMMEMORATING AZERBAIJAN’S  REPUBLIC DAY  HON.

Mr. Nangle  will be retiring from his position after an extraordinary and distinguished  fifty  years  in  journalism.  In  recognition of his outstanding  career, Bill will be honored with a reception on  Thursday, May 29, 2014, at Briar Ridge Country Club in Schererville, Indiana.  Bill Nangle’s career as a  journalist spans  five decades. After beginning his career as a  correspondent in his hometown of Wabash, Indiana, Bill went on to become an editor in Kokomo and Franklin, Indiana, as well as Bristol,  Virginia. In 1970, he joined The Times, then  known as The Hammond Times, and was instrumental  in  its success, as  it has become  Northwest Indiana’s leading media company.  Throughout his career, Mr. Nangle has been  known as a leader for good government and  open access laws, fighting for the public’s right  to know what its elected representatives are  doing. In 1989, he urged Indiana lawmakers  and then Governor Evan Bayh to enact a state  law in order to reverse a court decision that  closed county coroner records to the public.  Nearly a decade later, Bill’s passion for open  government  flourished when he coordinated  with seven of the state’s largest newspapers  for a project that changed the way Indiana officials deal with requests for information. He pioneered an experiment that had reporters test  each of the state’s 92 counties for open access  to government  records. The  findings  were presented in a groundbreaking collaboration of all seven newspapers on one Sunday,  known as the State of Secrecy. The project  was so successful that then Governor Frank  O’Bannon formed a blue-ribbon panel, which  included Mr. Nangle, to investigate the situation. As a result, the State of Secrecy became  a national model for testing access to public  records and has since been replicated in 32  states.  With a diverse population in Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana, as well as Illinois, Bill  Nangle successfully managed a focus on regional journalism, while maintaining coverage  of state and national issues. Under his direction, The Times, which publishes  four zone  specific  issues, has been emulated and  this  approach termed the ‘ ‘Munster model.’ ’  During Mr. Nangle’s tenure, The Times has  made its mark as the most decorated Indiana  newspaper of  its size, winning  the Hoosier  State Press Association competition for Blue  Ribbon daily newspaper of the year in 1993,  1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2000, and 2003.  Throughout his career, Bill, too, has received  his  fair share of accolades,  including distinguished service awards from both the Hoosier  State Press Association and  the Lakeshore  Chamber of Commerce. He is also a recipient  of Ball State University’s  Indiana Journalism  Award and has been inducted into the Indiana  Journalism Hall of Fame. For his outstanding  contributions to Hoosier heritage, Bill is also a  recipient of the prestigious Sagamore of the  Wabash, presented  to him by  the  late Governor Frank O’Bannon.  William Nangle  is also committed  to his  community  in a very personal and selfless  way. This is shown through the numerous organizations to which he is active in, including  the Crisis Center of Gary, the Northwest Indiana Forum, and the Northwest Indiana Chapter of the American Red Cross, to name just  a  few. The consummate newsman, Bill also  serves on the strategic planning committee of  the Northwest  Indiana Regional  Planning  Commission.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and  my other colleagues join me in honoring Bill  Nangle  for his distinguished career  in  journalism. His commitment to his community and  his excellence  in  leadership with The Times  Media Company are unparalleled, and I wish  him and his wife, Rita, and their family, the  best in the years to come.  f  USA FREEDOM ACT  HON.

247,,113,-0.399,88,2014-05-28,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, although  I ultimately voted in favor of this bill, H.R. 361, the  USA Freedom Act, like all legislation, it is not  perfect. I, however, recognize that that without  the reforms  in H.R. 3361,  the government’s  bulk collection of phone metadata and other  records would  continue  absent  necessary  modifications. More reforms to these programs  are necessary, and  I am  looking  forward  to  continuing to implement them to protect individual liberties as well as national security.  f  TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE  MCCORMICK  HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO  OFWESTVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 28, 2014  ",2014
248,,113,0.259,88,2014-05-28,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the American Network of Community Options and Resources recipient of  the  2014 Direct Support Professional of the Year  for  the  state  of West Virginia, Katherine  McCormick. This decoration is truly an honor  to receive, as it has been awarded annually  for the past seven years to individuals in each  state whom exemplify the values of the organization.  The American Network of Community Options and Resources was founded in 1970 as  a national association of seven-hundred private providers that help support more than a  half million of Americans with disabilities  in  communities. On May 6, 2014 Katherine was  recognized  for  her  outstanding  leadership  which set her apart  from her peers  in supporting those with disabilities in all aspects of  life.  Without Katherine’s commitment  to enriching the lives of others, many West Virginians  would be unable to function effectively in society. Mr. Speaker,  the state of West Virginia  owes Katherine McCormick and the men and  women like her a debt of gratitude. I am honored to call Katherine a fellow West Virginian.  f  A NEW TRADITION OF WINNING AT  NORTH STOKES HIGH  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 28, 2014  ",2014
249,,113,0.52,88,2014-05-28,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, in sports, success  depends heavily on  tradition, and  the boys’  track  team at North Stokes High  in Stokes  County, North Carolina, provided a perfect example of just how important that dependence  can be.  I am pleased  to announce  that  the  North Stokes boys’ track team that calls the  Sixth District home,  recently won  the North  Carolina High School Athletic Association  state lA track and field championships for the  first time in the school’s history.  The Vikings path to victory, however, was  not a straight line. The team faced fierce competition—and holding no previous state titles—  it seemed the odds were against them. Despite these obstacles the Vikings were able to  solidify the top spot after completing the 4x400  meter dash. The team set a personal record of  3:34.26, which  they achieved by  knocking  eight seconds off their previous time. Coach  Mike Williams credits  the  team’s success  to  the program’s strong sense of  tradition and  support from the staff.  While winning is important, it is not everything to the North Stokes Vikings. ‘ ‘We want to  see results,’ ’ Coach Williams told the Stokes  News, ‘ ‘but it’s also important to us that the  kids are having fun.’ ’ Williams said that it took  the entire team to bring home the state championship. Members of the team included Colin  Anderson, Austin Boyles, Brandon Boyles,  Daniel Brown, Cameron Corns, Noah Dike,  Dawson Durham, Junior Fulks, James Hammonds, Erin Heath, Justin Kenard, Andy Kopp,  Andrew Lankford, Ross Lucia, Kaleb Marshall,  Kenny Myers, Laith Nickell, Ottaway Shepard,  Kevin Robertson, Jarrett Slate, Mark Tucker,  Seth Tucker, Blake Williams,  and Dakota  Young. Coach Williams guided the Vikings to  the  top with outstanding help by assistant  coaches Rodney King, Jimmy Dillard, Ben  Kelble, and Breanna Largen.  In addition to the team victory, two Vikings  brought home individual titles. Moriah Boyette  and Justin Kenard both  finished  first at  the  track meet. Boyette won the girls’ pole vault  competition, while Kenard captured  the  individual title for North Stokes in the boys’ 800-  meter  On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District  of North Carolina, we congratulate Principal  Nathan Rasey, Athletic Director Trey Wiggins,  the faculty, stag and students of North Stokes  High School for winning the lA track and field  state championships. The Vikings have started  a new  tradition of winning at North Stokes  High.

250,Senate,113,0.875,13,2014-06-04,Mr. PAUL.," Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think it is important to remember that the vast majority of Americans are  law-abiding  Americans who reside either here or  overseas and that they do have an expectation of privacy and they do have a  right to privacy. Those who break the  law should be punished, but we can’t  forget about the innocent Americans  who are not breaking the law who do  have a right to privacy.  We have had treaties such as this for  decades, and I am not opposed to the  treaties. There are beneficial aspects  to the treaties. Past treaties have had  a standard which said that one had to  be committing tax fraud or that one  had to be engaged in fraudulent activity, the same way every American here  expects that the government  is not  going to look at a person’s bank account unless they have gone to a judge  with evidence that a person is cheating  on their taxes. The government can’t  just look at everybody’s information in  the bank without probable cause. The  previous standard was that there had  to be some evidence presented that a  person was cheating on their taxes. I  think there should be some evidence  presented.  The new standard is they can look at  any of a person’s records that may be  relevant. This is a much lower standard, and I think it will be injurious to  the vast majority,  if not  the overwhelming majority, of Americans who  are actually innocent but just happen  to be living abroad.  I would be willing to work with whoever is willing to work with me on this  to get the treaties passed if we can  keep the same standard we have had  previously, which  is  a  standard  of  fraud, not a standard that these may be  relevant.  So for this reason, I object.  ",2014
251,Senate,113,-0.362,13,2014-06-04,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Madam President, I  would have more extensive remarks,  but I know my colleague from Maryland has a different unanimous consent  request. Let me make just three quick  points.  Chile’s and other tax treaties the  Foreign Relations Committee has reported favorably do not represent the  first time the Senate has considered  treaties providing for information exchange based on a  ‘‘foreseeably relevant’’ or ‘‘may be relevant’’ standard.  In fact, since 1999—so that is about 15  years now—the Senate has adopted resolutions of advice and consent for at  least eight other tax treaties using the  relevant standard. This standard has  been part of the model of U.S. tax treaties since 2006. So it is not correct that  the ‘‘may be relevant’’ or ‘‘foreseeably  relevant’’ standard is vague or ambiguous. In fact, it has been extensively  defined in agreed guidance to which no  country has  expressed  a  dissenting  opinion to date.  I must say that not only are these  objections ultimately not providing all  the benefits that all of the private-sector interests have expressed—as I referred to before, the entire business  community—but by the same token, I  simply have a tough time accepting  that those who cheat get away with  cheating and  that  somehow we are  going to make it easier for them to  cheat when the average American does  not have the opportunity nor the desire  nor do they cheat in terms of their  payment of whatever are  the  taxes  they owe to the Federal Government in  a way that helps sustain all of the  things we seek as Americans: the best  armed  forces  in the world, security  here at home, educational opportunity  for our kids.  So there is a fundamental difference  here. I will push these tax treaties, and  I will urge the majority leader to give  us votes then in a process because it  has overwhelming support and we cannot have one Member of the Senate object to a process that can provide such  benefits and such equity across the  board.  I yield the floor.  ",2014
252,Senate,113,-0.328,13,2014-06-04,Mr. CARDIN.," Madam President, let  me  underscore  the  point  Senator  MENENDEZ, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has made in  regard to these tax treaties.  I want to make two principal points,  and then a few other comments, and  then I am going to propound a unanimous consent request in regard to the  Swiss protocols.  The two points I want to raise—first  on the standard of fraud, the relevancy  standard that has been included in tax  treaties ratified by the Senate since  the 1990s. There are at least eight treaties that have used this standard. This  is the international standard on fraud.  It is not the U.S. Standard. It is not  the Swiss standard. It is not the Chilean standard. It is the international  standard.  There may have been one time when  the United States could dictate what  tax treaties would include. But we are  part of an international community. It  is part of international negotiations.

253,Senate,113,-0.245,20,2014-06-04,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President, I  appreciate the words of the Senator  from New York, and also his keen focus  on these issues for the middle class,  giving everyone a fair shot.  I rise today to talk about the problems of student debt in this country  and the effects that it has on millions  of Americans. I think we all know that  it is not just students, as much as that  is the first group we think about—students—it is also their parents. Those  are the ones I hear from a lot, and how  hard it is, and how they have that next  kid coming.  While maybe they were able to patch  together  loans and  some  income  to  help one kid go through college, the  second one comes along and it is incredibly difficult. They literally have  this Sophie’s choice about which kid  they are going to send to college or  what are they going to do with the  third kid. It just should not be happening in America today.  I  thank  Senators  BLUMENTHAL, and BALDWINfor bringing  us together on the floor, as well as Senators HARKIN, WARREN, and DURBIN for  their leadership on this issue. In the  FRANKEN,  United States we appreciate the value  of education. We know it leads to higher-paying jobs, better health, and even  longer lives. I know the value of education. My grandpa worked 1,500 feet  underground in a mine in Ely, MN. He  was not able to graduate  from high  school because when his parents died,  the two oldest boys had to go to work  in the mines. They were only 15 years  old. That is what they did. They went  to work in the mines. They were able  to keep the entire family together.  The youngest girl had to go to an orphanage  in Duluth  for a while, and  then they were able to bring her back.  Those two oldest boys never got to  graduate from high school, never went  to college, and worked in the mines  their entire life, worked underground  at a very dangerous time in our country. When the sirens would go off, they  would not know whose family member  had been killed.  That  is what my grandpa did. He  wanted a better life for my dad. He literally saved money in a coffee can in  the basement of their house so that he  could send my dad to college. Then my  dad went to college and became a newspaper reporter. My mom, during the  same time period, growing up in Milwaukee during the Depression, ended  up going to Milwaukee Teachers College and then came to Minnesota and  was a teacher.  Here I am standing today on the Senate floor, the daughter of a teacher and  a  newspaper man  and  the  granddaughter of an iron ore miner. It would  not have happened without education.  It would not have happened without  my mom’s parents struggling to make  sure she went to college, and without  my grandpa saving that money in a  coffee can after working underground  in the mines and never being able to go  to school himself.  That is what I know about education.  That is a story we hear again and again  from people  in this country. Higher  education provides students with the  skills they need to be competitive in  today’s global economy. At a  time  when more and more jobs require some  form of postsecondary school, we cannot allow cost to be a barrier to that  opportunity. We cannot allow only the  wealthy to be able to send their kids to  college. It is really that simple.  This country was built on the middle  class. This country was built on this  idea that no matter where you come  from, if you are in a little iron ore mining town in northern Minnesota, that  there is a chance that your kid can go  to college. My dad did not start at  some fancy college. My dad went to a  community  college  which  is  now  Vermilion Community College, which  was then Ely Junior College, and got  his 2-year degree. Then he went to the  University of Minnesota. Back then it  was so incredibly affordable. He would  still  send his  laundry back  to my  grandma in Ely, and she would do his  laundry and she would send it back. He  got by on barely nothing.

254,Senate,113,0.495,27,2014-06-04,Mr. VITTER.," Mr. President, I wish to  applaud the work of the Senator from  Nevada and echo his sentiments. I am a  member  of  this  bipartisan working  group on the claims backlog. I am a coauthor of the bipartisan legislation he  helped spearhead, along with Senator  CASEY. It is another very good example  of a bipartisan consensus where we can  act. We can move it. So let’s come together and let’s act in a responsible, bipartisan way, and let’s move it. That is  what veterans want. That is what veterans  tell me all across Louisiana.  That is what the veterans service organizations are saying.  This crisis demands action.  It demands bipartisan action. This  is an  area where we can act now and act effectively. We  should. The  clinics  I  spoke about are an area where we can  act now and act effectively in a bipartisan way. We should.  I also applaud Senator INHOFE, who  may be coming to the floor, for his  leadership on  this clinics  issue. We  need to authorize those and move on  with them and get that done.  I also thank Senator RUBIO, who will  be speaking later about the legislation  he has that has already passed the  House to give the leadership—the new  leadership, thank goodness—of the VA  the authority they need to take dramatic action when necessary, to clean  house when necessary, and get people  in place who are going to make a difference in that broken bureaucracy.  So let’s act now, in a bipartisan way,  where we can. Again, that is absolutely  possible in these areas, including these  27 outpatient clinics in 18 States, the 2  in Louisiana that I discussed.  We have complete agreement in the  Senate on the substance of these clinics. We have legislation that has already passed the House. So please, Senator SANDERS, release your obstacle,  release your blockade. Let’s move forward. Let’s agree where we can agree.  Let’s act where we can act, here and  now, and continue to work on those  other vital areas where we also need  agreement.  There is a common saying: Time is  money. Well, in terms of what we are  talking about, time can be lost lives.  We have  seen  cases of  that, documented cases of that with regard to  veterans who were waiting for so long  they died. Time in health care can be  lost lives.  This past week, as I traveled in Louisiana, I had a townhall meeting  in  New Orleans, among other places, and  a New Orleans police officer—a female  police officer—came and told me about  the case of her father who, because of a  lack of attention and time lapsed in  the VA system, died, literally died directly related to that. Her name  is  Gwen Moity Nolan, and although she  has lost her father, she wants to make  sure that does not happen to any other  veteran’s family, that what happened  to Richard Moity does not happen to  others. Her case was looked at by the  VA, and they admitted fault, they admitted negligence, and they actually  reached a substantial settlement with  her over their lack of attention to her  father. But she really wants to make  sure that does not happen to any other  veteran’s  family. She  came  to me  pleading: Can you make sure they have  taken the necessary steps to fix those  problems in the New Orleans VA?  So I have written to the VA and said:  I want to see the results of that investigation with regard to Richard Moity.  You say you have taken corrective action?  I want  to understand exactly  what that corrective action is.  Time is money? No. In this case, time  can be lost lives—the life of Richard  Moity, the lives of veterans in Arizona,  the lives of veterans around the country for whom inattention, delay, and  lack of responsiveness in the VA system meant lost lives.  So let’s not delay here in the Senate.  Where we have agreement, let’s move,  let’s act. We have agreement on these  clinics. We have agreement on action  to address  the VA backlog Senator  HELLER talked about. Let’s act. Let’s  move because delay can lead to serious  consequences in health care, even the  loss of life.  I thank Senators INHOFEand RUBIO,  who may be coming to the floor later  to talk about these issues, for their determined work. I look forward to moving on this issue. I look forward to Senator SANDERShopefully reaching agreement on a broader set of proposals, including this clinics issue, in the very  near future, and if not, I will be back  to the floor demanding action on these  clinics within a few days.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  BROWN). The Senator from Vermont is  recognized.

256,Senate,113,-0.769,34,2014-06-04,Ms. WARREN.," Mr. President, earlier  today,  the Senate  confirmed Mark  Mastroianni to fill a judicial vacancy  in Western Massachusetts on the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Mr. Mastroianni came highly  recommended by the Advisory Committee  on Massachusetts  Judicial Nominations. The advisory committee is comprised of distinguished members of the  Massachusetts  legal  community,  including prominent academics and litigators, and is chaired by former Massachusetts district court  judge Nancy  Gertner. Their  recommendation  reflects the strong sense of the Massachusetts legal community—and in particular the legal community of Western Massachusetts—that he will make  an excellent district court judge.  Mr. Mastroianni  is a  true  son of  Western  Massachusetts—born  in  Springfield and a lifelong resident of  Hampden County. Prior  to his confirmation, he served as the elected district attorney for Hampden County—a  position he has held  since  2011. He  graduated with honors from the American International College in Springfield, MA and went on to earn his law  degree from Western New England College School of Law—also  in Springfield, MA.  Mr. Mastroianni began his career in  the Hampden County district attorney’s office. He served there as an assistant district attorney  for over  5  years, gaining prosecutorial experience  in a wide variety of district and superior court matters. He then moved into  private practice, where he built a significant career as a defense attorney  representing clients  in criminal and  civil matters. Over the course of 16  years, he represented clients in matters before  the Massachusetts State  trial courts and appeals courts, as well  as the district court to which he has  been nominated.  In November 2010, Mastroianni ran as  an  independent and was successfully  elected to serve as the district attorney for Hampden County in the western part of Massachusetts—a position  that returned him to lead the office  where he began his career. As district  attorney, he was responsible for managing the prosecution of all cases in  the 23 cities and towns that make up  Hampden County.  Aside from the impressive qualifications of this candidate, the  fact of  Mark’s nomination is particularly important because the seat he has been  nominated to fill has been vacant for  far too long—since U.S. District Court  Judge Ponsor took senior status  in  2011. The vacancy has strained the Federal judicial system in Western Massachusetts,  causing  cases  to be postponed, forcing judges from Boston to  travel to Springfield to hold hearings,  and impeding the ability of citizens to  get their day in court. Filling this vacancy as quickly as possible has been a  top priority for me since I arrived in  the Senate last year, and his confirmation will significantly improve the administration of justice in Western Massachusetts.  I am proud to have recommended  Mark Mastroianni to President Obama.  He is an independent-minded district  attorney whose diverse litigation experiences, both as a top prosecutor and as  a top defense attorney, will enrich the  Federal bench in Massachusetts. I have  no doubt that he will have a long and  distinguished career as a member of  the judiciary.  ∑",2014
257,Senate,113,0.919,34,2014-06-04,Mr. LEE.," Mr. President, on April 11  of this year President Obama nominated Sylvia Burwell to be the new  Secretary of the Department of Health  and Human Services—HHS—a position  that was vacated that same day by  former Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.  Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 of the  United States Constitution grants the  President, as the chief executive, plenary power to nominate members of  his cabinet. But that same clause reserves the power of appointment—that  is, the power to accept or reject the  nominee—exclusively to the Senate.  The  Constitution  explains  this  unique division of power as follows: the  President ‘‘shall nominate, and’’—this  is important—‘‘by and with the Advice  and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other officers of  the United States.’’  Far from a perfunctory practice, the  responsibility to review the fitness of  presidential nominees is one of the essential mechanisms  in our Constitution’s system of checks and balances.  And for the Members of this body  who took an oath to ‘‘support and defend’’ the Constitution, this is one of  the most  solemn  duties  incumbent  upon  those occupying  the office of  United States Senator.  I urge my fellow Senators to demand  that prior to confirmation Ms. Burwell  provide concrete, specific, and  forthright answers—in writing—to the questions that have been asked of her by  Members of this body.  I refuse to sit idly by and witness the  same Washington  charade  in which  stated commitments to transparency  are more important than actual demonstrations of candor.  If we do not insist that Ms. Burwell’s  appointment be contingent upon the  transparency of her confirmation process, we will have established a dangerous precedent for the future of this  body.  Let’s not forget: much of the authority that resides in HHS ultimately derives from the delegation of authority  from Congress. And whenever Congress  delegates  power  to  the  executive  branch, we do so based on the premise  that we retain the power of oversight.  Therefore, we cannot, in good faith,  hand over the reins of one of the most  important executive departments at a  time when  questions  remain  unanswered and information is still undisclosed. Doing so would undermine the  institutional prerogatives of the Senate.  When we only partially carry out our  constitutional duties to check and balance the other branches, we alone are  to blame for the continued accumulation of power in the executive, where  unelected bureaucrats are not always  as wise or as impartial as their proponents claim them to be.  The unprecedented accumulation of  power in the executive today is a demonstrable  fact. But  it  remains an  open question whether we in Congress  care enough to do anything about it.  At this point, there is good reason for  pessimism—if the kind of acquiescence  demonstrated  in  this  confirmation  process is any indication.  But I remain optimistic, because I  know that the American people still  get it. Outside the beltway, Americans  still instinctively understand the universal  truth  articulated  by  James  Madison, the father of the Constitution, over 200 years ago—that ‘‘The accumulation of all powers, legislative,  executive, and judiciary, in the same  hands, whether of one, a few, or many,  and whether hereditary, self-appointed,  or elective, may justly be pronounced  the very definition of tyranny.’’  This is precisely the type of accumulated power possessed by executive departments such as HHS.  This power cannot be curtailed or  dispersed overnight. But it will continue to expand inexorably toward tyranny unless Members of Congress—exercising our powers as officers of a separate and coequal branch of government—don’t push back.  We can begin by subjecting this nomination to the close scrutiny  it deserves.  The first thing we must recognize is  that  this  is not  the average presidential nomination. We are not talking  about the next secretary of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Quite the opposite: Ms. Burwell has been nominated  to preside over one of the largest and  most  important departments  in  the  Federal Government. No matter who  the nominee, this is a job that should  be filled with caution and circumspection.  By way of illustration, the HHS Secretary oversees an annual operating  budget of about  $1  trillion—that  is  nearly 25 percent of all Federal spending—as well as 11 separate operating  divisions, including the very important  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services—CMS—and the Food and Drug  Administration—FDA.  Moreover, the next HHS Secretary is  going to assume the helm of an executive leviathan in the midst of implementing the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act. Obamacare is not  only the most complex—and controversial—law in recent memory, but it delegates an unprecedented amount of authority to the HHS Secretary.

258,House,113,0.593,3,2014-06-17,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, crisis: IRS emails have vaporized.  Where, oh, where have the emails  gone? Where, oh, where can they be? In  another Friday evening news dump, the  administration announced that 2 years  of Lois Lerner’s emails have vanished.  Poof, gone.  That is not all. Today, we learned  that the emails of six other prominent  IRS officials involved in targeting conservatives  have  disappeared.  Poof,  gone. Isn’t that an oddly convenient  disappearance?  Have they gone to the same place the  missing 18 minutes of Nixon’s Watergate tapes went? The IRS blames the  well-timed fiasco on a computer glitch.  Mr. Speaker, what do you suppose  would happen if the IRS came to a citizen’s home to audit their taxes and the  citizen said, sorry, the records were  lost in a computer crash? The tax collector would laugh.  It is time for a special prosecutor to  investigate the IRS and find out where,  oh, where have those emails gone. This  yarn by the IRS requires a willing suspension of disbelief. Mr. Speaker, that  dog just won’t hunt.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  HAMAS KIDNAPPINGS  (Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2014

I yield such time as he may consume  to my colleague from California (Mr.  SWALWELL).  ",2014
261,House,113,-0.364,10,2014-06-17,Mr. SWALWELL of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1671,  which would designate the U.S. postal  facility located at 6937 Village Parkway in Dublin, California, as the James  ‘‘Jim’’ Kohnen Post Office. I thank the  Chair and  the  ranking member  for  bringing this to the floor today.  On May 29, 2012, the city of Dublin,  California, and the entire Tri-Valley  community lost a lifetime public servant in Dr. Jim Kohnen. Naming this  postal facility after Dr. Kohnen would  be a fitting tribute to a distinguished  community member and Dublin’s modern-day renaissance man.  Dr. Kohnen  retired  from  the U.S.  Army Reserve as a colonel after 30  years of service in the Corps of Engineers. During his service, he graduated  from the U.S. Army War College, the  Air War College, and the  Industrial  College of the Armed Forces.  b1500  Through his work and in the community, Jim emphasized the importance  of lifetime learning.  His journey started with one of his  earliest  achievements,  earning  the  rank of Eagle Scout. Jim never stopped  learning, earning multiple degrees, including two bachelor degrees, two master’s degrees, and a doctorate in education. A constant advocate for education and its importance, Dr. Kohnen  completed his career by serving as a  high school teacher at San Leandro  High School, where he taught political  science, management,  and  general  science.  Jim Kohnen also never stopped serving. Using his education and experience, Dr. Kohnen served in just about  every  local  community organization  possible by volunteering with a variety  of local organizations, most often serving as their treasurer, including for the  Boy Scouts, the Dublin Historical Preservation Association,  the League of  Women Voters, and the Knights of Columbus at St. Raymond’s Church. Dr.  Kohnen also served as an elected or appointed official on five boards, including  the Alameda County Mosquito  Abatement District, the Dublin San  Ramon Services District, the Zone 7  Water Agency,  the Alameda County  Special Districts Association, and the  American Association of Quality.  Jim was always there to step up  when we needed him to serve in any capacity. Jim never stopped learning and  he never stopped serving, so naming  Dublin’s post office—our only post office—after Jim is a fitting tribute to  his lifetime contributions, and it helps  to inspire the Tri-Valley community  residents to follow in his footsteps by  dedicating their lives to the service of  others.  Passing this bill now also ensures  that Jim’s surviving wife, whom he was  married to for 47 years, Pat, and their  children, Bill and Mark, will be able to  see Jim honored. It is also the 50th anniversary this week of when Jim and  Pat  both met  and  graduated  from  Ripon College in Wisconsin.  Today, we honor Jim Kohnen—loving  husband  and  father,  faithful  public  servant, soldier, and Eagle Scout.  I  urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1671.  ",2014
262,House,113,-0.465,17,2014-06-17,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  4360. H.R. 4360 designates a facility at  the  United  States  Forest  Service  Grandfather Ranger District of the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina  the Jason Crisp Forest Service Building after United States Forest Service  Officer Jason Crisp.  Officer Crisp and his canine, Maros,  were tragically killed in the line of  duty on March 12  in Burke County,  North Carolina. Officer Crisp was off  duty, but nonetheless assisted local authorities in the manhunt for a murder  suspect on the loose.  This selflessness is demonstrative of  Officer Crisp’s commitment to the safety and security of his community, a  commitment shared by our many dedicated Forest Service officers.  Designating this building the Jason  Crisp Forest Service Building  is our  way of thanking and honoring Officer  Crisp and his family—his wife, sons,  parents, sister, and brothers—for his 16  years of service to the United States  Forest Service.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 4360.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2014

Today  I speak  Pride Month.  Despite all that we have achieved in  recent years towards equality, opportunity, and justice for every American,  regardless of identity or orientation,  far too many LGBT Americans still  suffer discrimination each and every  day.  In this Congress we have the chance  to pass legislation that bans discrimination  in the workplace and  in the  military and in schools, and ensures  that couples, regardless of sexual orientation, have the same rights as anyone else.  I am a proud cosponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act that affirms the  Supreme Court decision to allow same-  sex marriage and the Student Nondiscrimination Act that bans discrimination in schools.  I also support President Obama’s intention to act, where this House has  not, to end discrimination in the workplace.  Let us continue to work together to  ensure that all Americans are provided  the civil liberties they deserve.  f  LEAVE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:  Mr. CULBERSON(at the request of Mr.  CANTOR) for today on account of travel  delays.

314,Senate,113,-0.232,52,2014-06-17,Mr. KAINE.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  talk  about  an  important  topic, the topic of embassy security.  The  safety  of American  embassies  abroad and especially our capital ‘‘A’’  Ambassadors and our small ‘‘a’’ ambassadors, who go to work every day in  communities  across  the  globe—182  countries where we have embassies—to  represent the United States.  Embassy security has been  in the  news  yesterday. The President  announced the dispatch of 275 additional  marines  to Baghdad  to protect  the  American Embassy and embassy personnel in Iraq. Today we received the  news of the excellent law enforcement  work that has been done by the United  States to finally capture one of the  leaders behind the raid on Benghazi in  September of 2012. Obviously, embassy  very  security  is  an  important  and  newsworthy and topical issue.  Mr. President, I think you have noticed what I have, that in the aftermath of the tragic attack on the embassy compound in Benghazi that cost  four Americans their lives, there has  been much  discussion  in  Congress  about Benghazi. But too much of it, in  my view, has been focused on trying to  play the blame game than trying to  talk about what we should do to minimize the chance of such an incident  happening again.  We have seen attacks on embassies.  From the attack on the U.S. Embassy  in Beirut in the 1980s, to attacks on  embassies in Africa in the 1990s, we  have seen this before. But what we  ought to be talking about in this body  and in the House is how to make our  embassies safer  instead of trying to  play a blame game.  I want to bring in this speech one  fact  about  embassy  security  that  should trouble us a lot, and especially  us in the Senate. Of the 182 countries  in the world that have United States  Ambassadors, 54 of the U.S. Ambassador posts are currently vacant. Nearly 30 percent of the ambassador posts  in the world—where the U.S. Ambassador goes to represent us—are currently vacant. Ten of the posts are vacant because the White House has not  forwarded a name to the Senate, which  is responsible for the consent to those  nominations. One of those 10—Syria—  has not been forwarded because of security reasons. Twenty-one posts are vacant because the White House has sent  nominees but the nominees are pending  in the Foreign Relations Committee,  where I serve. The chairman of the  committee,  Senator  is  doing all he can to move those through  but is facing some pretty significant  opposition, often from members of the  committee. And 23 of the positions are  vacant because they have gone through  the Foreign Relations Committee, they  have received overwhelming votes of  support, but they are being held here  on the Senate floor with no action on  the Senate floor, often for a very long  period of time.  Let me tell you about those 23 nations. The ambassador to the nation of  Djibouti, which is a critical partner in  Africa for the United States in counterterrorism operations—his nomination has been pending in the Senate for  67 days; for the Czech Republic, the  nomination has been pending  for 95  days; for the Bahamas, the nomination  has been pending for 122 days; for the  State of Kuwait, in the Middle East—a  critical area—the nomination has been  pending for 179 days; for Bosnia and  Herzegovina, 200 days; for Hungary, 215  days; for New Zealand, 223 days; for  Iceland, 223 days; for Zambia, 270 days;  for the Gabonese Republic, 270 days; for  the  Islamic Republic of Mauritania,  pending here in the Senate, 272 days;  for the Kingdom of Norway, 272 days;  for Jamaica, 272 days; for the Kingdom  of Lesotho, 312 days; for the Republic  MENENDEZ,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:37 Jun 18, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17JN6.040 S17JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2014

She was a member of Our Lady of Mount  Carmel Catholic Church in Niles, a founder of  the Tri-County Association of Nursing Home  Social Workers, past President of the American Committee on  Italian Migration, and an  active member of the local Democratic Party,  among many other community organizations.  Toni was honored numerous times for her  outstanding service,  including her work with  the Diocese of Youngstown. For her work in  Democratic politics she received  the Joseph  A. Marino Democrat of the Year Award. She  was recognized for her community activism by  the Ohio House of Representatives  for her  dedication to Shepherd of the Valley and she  received  the Carmen DeChristofaro Service  Award for all she did to better the lives of the  people of Niles.  Toni enjoyed entertaining and hosting gatherings at her home and backyard pool where  she took great pleasure in feeding and serving  all who visited.  Preceded in death by her husband Gregory  A. Landolfi, Toni will be deeply missed by her  daughter Jennie Louise Landolfi of Niles, her  son Attorney John Louis Landolfi, his wife  Christina and her  three grandsons, Johnny,  Dante and Marco Landolfi of Columbus, her  siblings Pete Cervone  of Austintown, Pat  Bonanno and Rose (Dominic) Sarno of Niles,  her sisters-in-law Rose Raschilla of Youngstown and Mary Jane (Jim) Botsko of Gallatin,  TN, many nieces and nephews and her beloved neighbors.  Mr. Speaker,  it gives me great pride  to  honor the life of Toni Landolfi. I will always remember the tremendous support she provided  to me throughout my career. She had class  and lived with a deep and abiding faith and an  amazing Grace.  I extend my most sincere  condolences to Toni’s entire family. Her contributions to this community will not be forgotten. Northeast Ohio is a better place because  of her service and her life.  f  IN MEMORY OF RON FLORIAN  HON.

316,,113,-0.408,122,2014-06-17,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take this opportunity to recognize and honor  Mr. Robert F. Ecklond, a veteran of both  World War  II  and  the Korean War. Mr.  Ecklond originally enlisted in the United States  Navy as a Seaman Apprentice, completing  Boot Camp in Sampson, New York and advanced technical training at the Construction  Training Center  in Davisville, Rhode  Island.  He served in the Pacific Theater during World  War II with the 20th Special Naval Construction Battalion Seabees. Mr. Ecklond was  present at Red Hill Seabee Camp in Hawaii  during V–J Day on September 2, 1945. He  was honorably discharged in September 1946,  having attained the rank of Petty Officer 3rd  Class.  Following  his  discharge,  Mr.  Ecklond  showed his continued dedication to the U.S.  Armed Forces by  joining  the United States  Naval Reserve. When he was called to serve  during the Korean War, Mr. Ecklond honored  his country by returning to active duty, serving  in Korea from April 1950 to July 1953.  This year on Memorial Day, Robert Ecklond  was celebrated by the Honor Flight Network, a  non-profit organization  that seeks  to honor  America ’s  veterans  for  the  sacrifices  they  made for our country. As part of this recognition, Mr. Ecklond was  flown  from Florida  to  Washington, DC, affording him the opportunity  to visit and reflect at the National World War  II Memorial.

317,,113,0.453,129,2014-06-17,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Delta Airlines on  the 85th anniversary of its founding on June 17, 1929.  Delta is one of our Nation’s oldest and largest commercial passenger airlines. From Delta’s  founder, C.E. Woolman,  to  its current  CEO, Richard Anderson, and with thousands  of loyal employees over the years, they have  built one of the world’s finest airlines. In a difficult and sometimes turbulent industry, Delta  has survived many challenges over the past  decades.  Originally established as a crop dusting operation, it was later founded in Monroe, Louisiana and has grown  to a world-class passenger airline  that now boasts more  than  80,000 employees and serves nearly 165 million passengers annually. Traveling  to more  than 300 destinations worldwide and with recent mergers and acquisitions, Delta now  holds a position as one of the largest domestic  U.S. airlines. Over the years, as one of the  first U.S. airlines to carry passengers, Delta’s  innovation and leadership has led to industry  firsts like domestic inflight Wi-Fi and TV broadcasts.  Delta is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia  and serves hundreds of U.S. cities and flies to  59 countries in six continents. In Florida, Delta  serves many of our communities and provides  employment for thousands of workers. Across  the country, several of my  family members  and friends have retired and some continue to  work for Delta. Travelling frequently over the  years, I have met hundreds of wonderful people who work very hard  to keep Delta customers flying and their company successful in  business.  As the former Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee  and  the House  Transportation  Committee, it has been my honor to work with  many officials and employees and  it  is my  pleasure to congratulate each of them and the  Delta Airlines Family on this occasion. I know  my colleagues  join me  in saluting a great  American business and all the fine people at  Delta Airlines on this significant milestone.  f  A TRIBUTE TO TONY GWYNN: A  MAN OF UNRIVALED SKILL AND  EXEMPLARY CHARACTER  HON. SCOTT H. PETERS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  HUNTER,  Tuesday, June 17, 2014  ",2014
318,,113,-0.175,129,2014-06-17,Mr. PETERS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I,  along with my  fellow members of  the San  Diego Delegation  including Representative  DAVIS, Representative  ISSA, Representative  and Representative VARGAS,  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to  the  life of Mr. Tony  Gwynn, a celebrated batting champion in the  Major League Baseball Hall of Fame and beloved San Diego Padre. For over 30 years,  Tony’s enthusiasm for baseball and life itself  was a source of goodwill for our national pastime and for all San Diegans. He will be sorely  missed by the many people he inspired to play  the game and by the many lives he touched  on and off the baseball diamond.  Tony Gwynn was a baseball  legend. The  15-time All-Star led the Padres to two World  Series appearances. In his career, he accumulated 3,141 hits over 20 seasons, earning a  career batting average of  .338  that  is 18th  best all-time. He also received a record-tying  eight National League batting titles in addition  to winning five Gold Glove Awards in recognition of his defensive skills. Gwynn was elected  to the Hall of Fame in 2007, his first year of  eligibility.  Gwynn’s dedication  to  the sport was only  matched by his love for San Diego, earning  him the nickname, ‘ ‘Mr. Padre.’ ’ While Gwynn  had the option to play elsewhere, he loyally  spent his entire career  in San Diego. Following his  time as a player  in  the major  leagues, he remained in San Diego to dedicate the remainder of his life to coaching at  his alma mater, San Diego State University.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the utmost respect  that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in paying tribute to the  life of Tony Gwynn, an outstanding athlete and  exemplary citizen, friend, and family man. His  love of the game, tireless dedication, genial attitude, and uplifting presence will be missed.  f  MARKING THE RETIREMENT OF  CHUCK LOVELESS  HON. NANCY PELOSI  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 17, 2014  ",2014
319,,113,-0.491,129,2014-06-17,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to  the distinguished career of a  steadfast  champion  for working men  and  women, Chuck Loveless. For decades, Chuck  has stood as a guardian for working families  in America—a tireless leader who has been at  the center of some of the most important policy debates and struggles in the last 20 years.  He leaves the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees with an enduring legacy of leadership and action, and a  long record of battles fought and won for the  middle class, the backbone of our democracy.  A native of Pennsylvania, Chuck earned a  Master ’s Degree in political science from the  University of California, Berkeley, and a  law  degree from Georgetown University Law Center. A man of  faith and principle, he has  poured his heart and soul into a career of advocating for working people.  As Director of Federal Government Affairs  for AFSCME, Chuck has always been a steadfast partner in our efforts to build a stronger,  fairer, and more prosperous America  for all  people.  He and AFSCME led the fight against President Bush’s proposal to privatize Social Security. He was on the front lines in the budget  wars to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social  Security from Republican cuts. And he was an  invaluable force in passing the historic Affordable Care Act  that  is providing newfound  health security, and  the personal and economic freedom that comes with it to millions of  hard-working Americans.  Most recently, Chuck has devoted himself to  the nationwide effort  to  raise  the minimum  wage, and renew emergency unemployment  insurance  for  the millions of Americans who  worked hard, played by  the  rules, and  lost  their jobs through no fault of their own.  Yet perhaps most impressive is the personal  commitment he has maintained throughout his  positions of  leadership —from his active  involvement  in his church  to caring  for  those  with AIDS as a volunteer at  the Whitman-  Walker Clinic.  As he enters the next chapter of his life, I  join with many others in thanking him for the  many years of energy and determination he  has given AFSCME and our nation. We know  that his achievements will make a difference in  the  lives of Americans  for generations  to  come. Congratulations on your long and illustrious tenure at AFSCME, and good luck in all  your future endeavors.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLATION  TO EXTEND SECTION 181 OF THE  TAX CODE  HON.

321,House,113,0.422,17,2014-06-26,Mr. WITTMAN.," Madam Chair, I have  an amendment at the desk.  ",2014
322,Senate,113,0.585,73,2014-06-26,Mr. RUBIO.," Madam President, there  is a topic I would like to discuss before  we leave for the Fourth of July recess  and return to our States. One is an  enormous story in my home State and,  in  particular,  in my  hometown  of  Miami, and that is the ongoing crisis in  Venezuela. I have been talking about it  for the better part of 3 months with regard to what is occurring there. It is  pretty straightforward. There is an authoritarian government  in Venezuela  that has cracked down on the people in  Venezuela, has crushed any sort of political dissent or tried to crush any  form of political dissent. If a person is  an outspoken critic of the Venezuelan  government, they either wind up in jail  or in exile.  In fact, the President of Venezuela,  someone who won a fraudulent election  just a year and a half ago, has now  begun to turn on people in his own  party when they dare to criticize him.  But the evidence is clear. First of all,  the Venezuelan economy today is a disaster. The state of the Venezuela economy today is increasingly reminiscent  of what is happening in Cuba: shortages of basic items, the inability to  buy a bar of soap or toilet paper or  toothpaste. The shortages are extraordinary.  We are talking about one of the richest countries in the hemisphere—a nation blessed with a talented and educated population and with natural resources, and particularly oil—and this  guy in charge of that country has ruined Venezuela and its economy. That  in and of itself is worthy of condemnation.  But what is even more apparent is  how he has cracked down on political  dissent in Venezuela. We have documented how over 40 people have now  lost their  lives  in protests on Venezuela—by  the way,  protests  that  began when a student was sexually assaulted at a university. They protested  the lack of security, and the security  forces of Venezuela responded—not by  going after the assailants but by going  after  the  student  protesters. Since  then,  opposition  leaders  have  been  jailed, Members of the opposition in  the Parliament have  been  removed  from their seats, and Venezuela continues to spiral out of control.  There have been gross human rights  violations in Venezuela at the direction of the Venezuelan Government by  organisms of the Venezuelan Government and extragovernmental organizations as well.  So in light of what is happening in  Venezuela, and in light of the fact that  so many people who live in Florida are  impacted deeply by what is happening  in Venezuela—because they are originally  from there, because they have  family there or because they conduct  business there or because they care  about what  happens  in  our  hemisphere—because of all of these things,  not only have I been talking about this  issue on the Senate floor but we began  to take action.  The first thing we did was we passed  a resolution from this Senate—and I  thank my colleagues; it passed unanimously—condemning  these  human  rights violations. I know sometimes we  sit around here and wonder: What is  the point of these resolutions?  They matter. I cannot tell you how  many people are aware of what we have  done here in the Senate, just speaking  out and condemning these violations  and making it very clear whose side we  are on. We are on the side of the democratic aspirations and the rights of the  people of Venezuela.  The second thing we did is we worked  through the process here because unlike the way Maduro runs his government in Venezuela, here we have a republic and this Senate is an important  part of that republic. We filed a bill to  sanction individuals—not the government, not the country—individuals in  the Venezuelan Government  responsible for these human rights violations.  In fact, in the committee I named 25 of  them. That piece of legislation—that  law—sanctioning the  leaders  in Venezuela passed the committee almost  unanimously with bipartisan support.  Let me take a moment to thank Senator MENENDEZ, the chairman of that  committee, for his leadership on this  issue and my colleague from Florida  BILLNELSON for his leadership on this  issue, even though he is not on the  committee. When we held a hearing on  the issue of Venezuela, he went to the  hearing and he attended an event we  did in Miami with the Venezuelan community to talk about this reality.  That bill passed out of our committee. In addition to passing out of  this committee, a very  similar bill  passed out of the House under the leadership  of  Congresswoman  ROS-  LEHTINEN. Both the Senate and the  House—and they passed it off the floor  of the House.  So the Venezuelan sanctions bill is  ready for action here on the floor of  the Senate. Knowing that it was a noncontroversial issue, that there is almost unanimous support for it, I have  attempted to pass this bill by something we  call  unanimous  consent,  which basically means that the cloakrooms call the respective offices and  they ask all of the Members: We are  going to try to pass this bill. Do you  have an objection? The reason why we  do it that way is so we can save time so  we have the time available to debate  these other issues that are before us—  especially on an issue that is not controversial. We pass a lot of law around  here that way.  Unfortunately, there have been some  objections—one from each side. I am  happy to report that one of those two  objections has been removed. It came  from the Democratic side. The majority removed their objection. So it appears this bill is ready to move forward, but for the objection of one colleague of ours, who has the right to object, and who, quite frankly, has objections to it that he believes strongly  about and we are respectful of.  What I am asking for at this point  is—given  that  objection—when  we  come back from the recess, I am hoping  that one way or another we will get a  chance to vote. This is an issue that  virtually every Member of the Senate  but for one or two—at this point it appears one—is supportive of. I hope we  can pass it because it is important. It  will matter. This is not sanctions, for  example, like the ones we have seen in  the past on other countries. These are  extremely targeted. These are targeted  against individuals in the Venezuelan  Government who have directed or carried out gross human rights violations.  They will be impactful because many  of these people in the Venezuelan Government who  are  conducting  these  human rights violations actually spend  their weekends in the United States.  They  fly  on  the  private  jets  they  bought with  stolen money  to  the  United States to stay in their fancy  condominiums or their mansions. They  shop at our stores. They parade up our  streets. And  then Monday morning  they go back to work full time violating human rights.  So these sanctions will matter. These  human rights violators  in Venezuela  have investments in the United States.  In fact, when they steal money from  Venezuela, often times they use straw  companies and straw purchasers to invest that money in our economy—predominantly  in Florida, but also  in  other places.  There is no reason in the world why  they should not be sanctioned for what  they have done. There is no reason in  the world why we should not be going  after these individuals for what they  have done.  One of the cornerstones of our foreign policy must always be the protection of human rights anywhere in the  world where they are challenged or oppressed. This gives us an opportunity  to speak in a clear voice in a part of  the world that, quite frankly, both parties have been guilty of neglecting. I  have spent plenty of time around here  talking about what is going on in Syria  and what is going on in Iraq, and that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:28 Jun 27, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G26JN6.055 S26JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2014
323,Senate,113,-0.249,80,2014-06-26,Mr. COONS.," Madam President, something  important, something unusual,  something worth noting happened this  week,  happened  yesterday  in  this  Chamber that I don’t want to let pass  without a few moments of comment.  Yesterday a broad bipartisan majority of this Senate came together to  pass the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.  First, I congratulate Senators MURRAY, ISAKSON, HARKIN, and ALEXANDER  who led so capably on this bill. Senators MURRAY, a Democrat of Washington, and ISAKSON, a Republican of  Georgia, spent years working through  the details, policy, and language, and  months making sure that they got this  bill to a point where the Senate and  the House in a bipartisan, bicameral  way could adopt legislation.  What is this about? It is about something simple, important, and powerful:  investing in America’s workforce so we  can compete with anyone around the  world in the 21st century.  This is an area I have focused on a  lot here in the Senate which I believe  is critical to our Nation, our competitiveness, to strengthening our middle  class, and to growing good jobs.  In manufacturing, it is a core challenge for us to ensure that our workers  have the training employers are looking for, and that our manufacturing  companies are globally  competitive.  Manufacturing is important to America, to our future, to our middle class,  to our communities, and to our families because it pays well, it drives innovation, it contributes greatly to other  sectors in our economy and in communities.  That  is why a  few months ago  I  launched the Manufacturing Jobs for  America initiative that has brought together dozens of Senators. We initially  pulled together Democrats from across  my caucus to introduce 34 bills, some  of the best and broadest ideas we could  bring to the table about how to accelerate America’s recovery of employment and steady growth in manufacturing. Roughly half of these bills are  bipartisan.  Part of the goal of this Manufacturing Jobs for America initiative was  to put good ideas out on the floor and  get them  in the mix as we debate  things going forward. So I wish to take  a moment today and celebrate that the  ideas of many of our partners in this  campaign, ideas drawn from many of  the bills that are part of this initiative,  ended up being important parts of the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity  Act that was passed this week.  Let me briefly touch on the five most  important who contributed ideas that  were embedded in this bill that passed.  First, the Adult Education and Economic Growth Act which was sponsored by Senators REEDand BROWN. In  our rapidly changing economy, ensuring we can train Americans of all ages  for all jobs is critical. Senator REED’s  bill takes an important step in that direction  by  investing  in  adult  education, expanding access to technology  and digital literacy skills and improvFRANKEN,  ing the coordination of State and local  programs.  A bill that was endorsed by the National Association of Manufacturers is  the AMERICA Works Act, sponsored by  Senators HAGANand HELLER.  Another challenge we face is ensuring employers can quickly recognize  whether a worker has the skills they  need. So Senator HAGAN’s bill helped  solve this by ensuring we prioritize  programs that invest in training that  delivers portable national and industry-recognized  credentials. This  encourages  job  training  programs  to  match the skills of workers with the  needs of local employers, training individuals for the jobs currently available  in their communities right now.  A third bill that contributed importantly to this bill that was enacted  here yesterday, adopted by the Senate  yesterday, was the Community College  to Career Fund Act, sponsored by Senator FRANKEN and Senator BEGICH.  Senator FRANKEN came to the  floor  yesterday and gave another passionate,  important floor speech in support of  these ideas. It is something that as I  presided—and I have been with Senator  FRANKENin caucus and have heard him  speak many times. It is about equipping workers with the skills they need  by investing in partnerships between  our community colleges and our employers.  Senator  Senator  BEGICH, myself and others have seen  this work in our home communities.  We  have  seen  community  colleges  learn from manufacturers what today  are the actual relevant modern manufacturing skills they need and then deliver customized training courses that  make a difference in the skills, in the  lives, in the college affordability and  access of those who seek to join today’s  manufacturing workforce.  The  fourth  bill,  the  On-the-Job  Training Act, cosponsored by Senators  SHAHEENand COCHRAN, contributes to  the idea that we need to invest in on-  the-job training. Because of Senator  SHAHEEN’s leadership on this bill, we  will now make new and important investments so workers can learn what  they need to do in the job that needs to  be filled, rather than in an academic  setting and then search the skills that  may match the skills they learn. On-  the-job training in this bill sponsored  by SHAHEENand COCHRAN is an important  contribution  to  modernizing  America’s workplace skills.  The last, the SECTORS Act, cosponsored by Senators BROWNand COLLINS,  is a provision that helps meet the fundamental challenge of connecting our  schools with our businesses by requiring State and local workforce investment boards to establish sector-based  partnerships.  With all of these bills there is an important and common theme. In the 21st  century, rapid economic change is a  given. In order to compete, in order to  grow our economy and grow employment, in order to be productive and to  have a successful and growing workforce, we need to be able to adapt as  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:28 Jun 27, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A26JN6.020 S26JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2014
324,Senate,113,0.552,101,2014-06-26,Mr. INHOFE.," Madam President,  I  wish to remember the life and sacrifice  of a remarkable young man, Army SPC  Dylan J. Johnson. Dylan died 3 years  ago today, June 26, 2011, of injuries suffered from an improvised explosive device in Diyala Province, Iraq, in support of Operation New Dawn.  Dylan was born November 07, 1990, in  Tulsa, OK. His father Jeff Johnson said  Dylan ‘‘had aspired to military service  for years and dressed as a soldier for  Halloween six years running.’’ After  Dylan  graduated  from  Jenks High  School, he joined the military in August 2009, largely inspired by the men  on both sides of his family who served  with the military during World War II  and Korea.  After completing basic training at  Fort Knox, KY, Dylan was assigned to  the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st  Cavalry Division in Fort Hood, TX.  Specialist Johnson departed on Memorial Day 2011 for his first overseas  deployment and arrived in Iraq June 2.  On June 26, 2011, Dylan tragically died  of  injuries he sustained when  insurgents attacked his armored vehicle  with an  improvised explosive device.  One other soldier in the vehicle was  killed alongside of Dylan.  ‘‘Dylan possessed a kind spirit and  was a bit reserved  in my world  literature  class,’’  said  teacher,  Ron  Acebo. ‘‘We all ache for the loss of this  young life and grieve with his family.  As teachers, we all hold hopes and  dreams  for our students. We do not  know what he could have achieved but  we are humbled that he had made the  supreme sacrifice for his country. . . .  and that  is how he will be remembered.’’  A memorial service was held July 6,  2011, at Kirk of the Hills Church in  Tulsa, OK and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on August 9,  2011.  At a ceremony on his birthday  in  2013, the State of Oklahoma dedicated  to his memory the bridge on U.S. 75  across Polecat Creek,  just  south of  Main Street in Jenks, OK. A sign reading ‘‘Specialist Dylan Johnson Memorial Bridge’’ was  emplaced  on  the  structure, and his father asked those  gathered  to  remember  Oklahoma’s  other fallen soldiers when they cross it.  Dylans’s military honors include the  Purple Heart,  the Bronze Star,  the  Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the  Iraqi Campaign Medal with Combat  Service Star.  In addition to his father, Dylan is  survived by his mother Joy Sehl; his  stepmother Lynda Johnson; two sisters, Alexandra Johnson and Kathryn  Sehl;  and  two  stepsisters, Brittany  Dinan and Brooke Dinan. All are of  Tulsa, OK.  Today  we  remember  Army  SPC  Dylan J. Johnson, a young man who  loved his family and country and gave  his life as a sacrifice for freedom.  SPECIALISTJORDANM. MORRIS  Madam President, I now wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army SPC Jordan M. Morris. Along with 4 other soldiers, Jordan died August 11, 2011 of injuries he sustained from an improvised  explosive device in Kandahar Province,  Afghanistan, in support of Operation  Enduring Freedom.  Jordan was born in Elk City, OK on  February 12, 1988, and later moved to  Ripley, OK. While attending Ripley  High School, he was a member of the  baseball team, National Honor Society,  4–H, and  served as Student Council  president. He was  concurrently  enrolled and graduated from the Oklahoma School of Science and Math. As  an active member of the Hillcrest Baptist Church, he was very involved with  the youth group and enjoyed spending  time serving others on various mission  trips.  After graduating as class valedictorian from Ripley High School in 2006,  he fulfilled a dream he had from the  age of 8 as he was accepted to the U.S.  Military Academy at West Point. Jordan spent 4 years at West Point, majoring in mechanical engineering. Friend  Caleb Eytcheson said Jordan ‘‘wanted  to be the best, and he knew West Point  is where  they  trained  the best. He  wanted to serve his country,’’ he said.  Jordan joined the Army in January  2011, serving as an infantryman. After  completing training at Fort Benning,  GA he was assigned to 1st Battalion,  32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade  Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division,  Fort Drum, NY. On May 5, 2011, Jordan  deployed to Afghanistan.  Doug Scott, assistant principal of  Ripley High School said Morris was intelligent, had a great sense of humor  and was very popular in school. ‘‘He  showed his unselfish  side by going  overseas,’’ Scott said.  Jordan’s baseball coach, Donnie Hoffman said: ‘‘The world is not as good a  place, when you lose people with the  character that he was. The legacy he  leaves behind was the way he led his  life, the character, the discipline, the  dedication, the honor.’’  Jordan was buried August 20, 2011 at  Palmer Marler Funeral Home in Stillwater, OK.  Jordan  is survived by his parents  Brett and Nita (Faber) Morris of Stillwater; two brothers Levi James and  Jesse Isaac Morris of Stillwater; grandparents Wilma Faber, of Tulsa, James  and Patricia Morris, of Broken Arrow;  numerous aunts, uncles, cousins and  friends, as well as his  former West  Point classmates and fellow soldiers in  the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th  Mountain Division.  Today we remember Army SPC Jordan M. Morris, a young man who loved  his family and country, and gave his  life as a sacrifice for freedom.  SPECIALISTJOSHUAM. SEALS  Madam President, I also wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army SPC Joshua M. Seals. Specialist Seals died August 16, 2011 of non-combat injuries at  Forward Operating Base Lightening in  Paktika Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  He was assigned to the 1st Battalion,  279th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry  Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma National Guard.

325,,113,0.633,150,2014-06-26,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to celebrate the 60th anniversary of The Arc  Gateway. For more than six decades, The Arc  Gateway and its dedicated staff have served  those in Northwest Florida with developmental  disabilities, providing them with increased opportunities and numerous first-class facilities to  learn, work, play, and reach their full potential.  Like so many great organizations  in  this  country, The Arc Gateway started out as a  grassroots movement  to address an unmet  community need. Pearl Nelson —whose son,  Chris,  has  Down  Syndrome—sought  resources to help her son and family, but found  that no such organization existed in Northwest  Florida. So, she placed an advertisement  in  the paper to find parents of children with special needs and form a support group. Thus,  The Arc Gateway was born. Together, these  parents drafted a constitution, opened a one-  room school house, and became members of  the state and national Arc.  Over the years, The Arc Gateway saw the  changing needs of  the  local community and  responded with a number of new programs to  meet a range of important priorities. From this  environment,  the Pollak Activity Center and  Pollak Rehabilitation Workshop were created  to give adults with developmental disabilities  places to continue to learn and grow. The Arc  Gateway also realized the necessity of early  intervention for children and, in 1974, began  the  Infant Stimulation Program. Three years  later,  the Pearl Nelson Center expanded  to  become the Pearl Nelson Preschool for children ages  two  through  five. Another critical  need that arose in the community was residential support programs, and The Arc Gateway, once again, stepped up to meet these  needs and established the Women’s Residential Training Center.  Today, The Arc Gateway has grown from its  humble beginnings to serve nearly 1,000 children and adults. They also provide an extremely  impressive array of services  to  the  community, including: the Pearl Nelson Child  Development Center, which provides early  intervention and pediatric services; the Pollak  Training Center, where adults can participate  in education classes, computer courses, and  art instruction, in addition to job training; community based employment opportunities and  services that connect people with local job options where they can succeed and enrich their  lives;  the Senior Adult Program at Bayview  Senior Center, where senior citizens with developmental disabilities can access health, social, and  leisure activities; as well as supported living and in-home support services to  help individuals function in their own homes,  and group homes that provide a great environment for support and companionship.  On behalf of the United States Congress, it  is an honor for me to recognize the tremendous success of The Arc Gateway over its 60-  year history. Thanks to the tireless efforts of  its staff, volunteers, and parents, The Arc  Gateway has grown  from a small support  group to an irreplaceable community staple. It  is a shining example of what can be achieved  when a community comes  together  to meet  unaddressed needs. My wife Vicki and I congratulate The Arc Gateway on 60  incredibly  successful years and wish them all the best as  they continue to serve the Northwest Florida  community for years to come.  f  RECOGNIZING HUGH RALSTON  HON.

With over a decade of service as the Ventura County Community Foundation’s (VCCF)  President and Chief Executive Officer, Hugh  Ralston oversaw  the  foundation  increase  its  assets by one million dollars. This growth in  resources included the purchase of the VCCF  nonprofit center, the expansion of irrevocable  planned donations and philanthropic contributions throughout the community, and a tenfold  increase in its annual scholarship support that  have benefitted hundreds of Ventura County  students. With an annual distribution amount  of $1.3 million, VCCF plays an incredible supportive role for our region’s students and nonprofit organizations.  It is powerhouse foundations like the Ventura County Community Foundation that empower the greatest efforts for change and benefits that spread all across our community and  nation. The work that VCCF has done, with  Hugh Ralston at the helm, has been duly recognized as being in compliance with national  standards, the highest form of peer review for  U.S. Community Foundations and  the only  form of accreditation within  the U.S. Philanthropic community.  In the past decade, Hugh has secured partnerships with prominent  local organizations  which support veterans,  farmworkers, social  justice advocates, medical students, professionals, and many other communal groups.  During his  time as  the head of  the VCCF,  Hugh  established  the  annual  Community  Leaders Awards and the biennial President’s  Awards which create networks and recognition  for Ventura County leaders who do countless  work with their nonprofits.  Community  leaders  like Hugh  exemplify  Ventura County’s unsurpassed leadership. Although Hugh will be stepping down from his  position as President and CEO of Ventura  County Community Foundation, his legacy at  VCCF and his immense impact on the community will continue  to  inspire  the  future of  nonprofits and local philanthropy.  Hugh Ralston has been an amazing force in  our region. The efforts that he has made for  students,  non-profit  organizations,  and  the  working community have ensured a remarkable investment in the future and deserve an  innumerable level of gratitude.  I graciously thank Hugh for his unwavering  commitment and dedication  for  the past 11  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:02 Jun 27, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K26JN8.006 E26JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P V 5 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2014

This day serves as an important opportunity to  urge everyone to get tested. I would like to  thank all of the advocates, care coordinators,  and healthcare providers, both in my community and around the country, for their tireless  work  in serving  the HIV-positive community  and  raising awareness of HIV  issues more  generally.  There are over one million people of all  ages, ethnicities, and sexual orientations  in  the United States living with the HIV virus, and  South Florida has one of the highest HIV infection rates in the country. Sadly, nearly one  in six HIV-positive individuals do not know that  they are infected, which means that they could  be unknowingly spreading the virus. We simply must close this gap so that we may improve health outcomes  for  those  living with  HIV and protect against future infections.  HIV does not discriminate—it impacts people old and young, gay and straight, and of all  nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. To highlight this critical issue, I will be hosting a call  to action in my district. I hope that everyone  will take this opportunity to get tested for HIV  and to ask their friends and family to do the  same.  Again I would like to thank the advocates,  care coordinators and healthcare providers in  South Florida and around the country for their  tireless work  in preventing, detecting, and  treating HIV. I wish them the best as they pursue this daunting but important endeavor.  f  A TRIBUTE TO EDWARD J. NEVIN,  JR. ON THE OCCASION OF HIS  100TH BIRTHDAY  HON. ANNA G.

Curtis enlisted  in  the Marine Corps after  graduating High School at  the age of 17  in  order to serve his country in Iraq. After boot  camp and SOI training he was assigned to the  3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, which  is a battalion-level infantry unit composed of infantry  Marines and support personnel. In February of  2004 his battalion was deployed in Iraq and  was a part of the initial invasion of Fallujah.  After his tour in Iraq, Curtis helped train new  Marines  for combat until he retired  in 2007.  The battalion which Curtis was a part of was  the most deployed battalion in the Iraq War.  At a young age Curtis Allred showed an admirable commitment to serve our country and  I am very thankful for patriots like him. It is my  pleasure to recognize his efforts and achievements before the House of Representatives. I  wish him all the joys in life he so rightfully has  earned.  f  HONORING MR.

329,,113,0.491,157,2014-06-26,Mr. ROTHFUS.," Mr. Speaker, we  rise  to  honor  the memory  of Mr. Charles Henry  ‘Chuck’ ’ Noll of Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Mr.  Noll passed away on June, 13, 2014 at the  age of 82. Chuck Noll was born in Cleveland  on January 5, 1932, but he will be remembered best in Pittsburgh: the city that he transformed through his legendary coaching of the  Pittsburgh Steelers.  A Pro Football Hall of Famer, Mr. Noll led  the Pittsburgh Steelers  to  four Super Bowl  championships  in  twenty-three seasons. He  holds the record of being the only coach to  win four Super Bowl trophies, a feat the team  accomplished between 1975 and 1980.  This achievement did not come without perseverance. Mr. Noll began his football career  as a linebacker and guard for the Cleveland  Browns, where he played until he retired at  twenty-seven. He  then dedicated his  life  to  coaching,  eventually  becoming  the  then  youngest head coach in NFL history when the  Steelers hired him on January 27, 1969.

330,,113,0.348,164,2014-06-26,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and pay  tribute  to James Pitts, who  passed away on Thursday, June 19, 2014. As  one of the key researchers in understanding  the dangers and repercussions of air pollution,  his contribution to the state of California, and  the world, will not be forgotten. James will be  truly missed, as a dynamic and passionate advocate, educator, mentor and friend.  Six months after James was born  in Salt  Lake City on January 10, 1921 to Ester and  James N. Pitts, the family moved to Los Angeles.  It was not until James’ studies  in high  school at Manual Arts High School  that he  found his passion for chemistry. He took this  enthusiasm  for science  to  the University of  California, Los Angeles, where he graduated  with a bachelor’s in chemistry in 1945 and a  doctorate in chemistry in 1949. Following his  graduation, James’ passion for teaching began  to  take shape.  In 1954, James began as a  founding professor at  the University of California, Riverside, focusing his research on fundamental photochemistry. James  led  the efforts  to establish  the Statewide Air Pollution  Research Center at  the University of California, Riverside and served successfully as  its director for eighteen years.  James began his air pollution research  in  the 1950s during a time when the nature and  dangers of smog were still unknown. Through  James’  findings, he was able  to  influence  groundbreaking Southern California air policy  and clean air regulations  that drastically  improved the state’s environmental health, and  the health of California  residents. The  research carried out by his team provided much  of the scientific basis of California ’s forward-  thinking policies and regulations which have  been widely adopted both nationally and internationally. Throughout his tenure, James also  managed to find time to co-author nearly four  hundred scientific works, and became such an  authority  in  the scientific world  that he was  constantly visited by scientists, politicians and  international  leaders  from around  the globe.  His extensive work in this field earned him numerous accolades  from  the United States  Congress, the California State Assembly, the  South Coast Air Quality Management District,  the State Air Resources Board, and the Coalition for Clean Air.  James Pitts was an energetic advocate who  made a  true difference  in  the state of California and through his efforts, he ultimately impacted the world for the better. As an educator  at both University of California, Riverside and  University of California, Irvine, his enthusiasm  for chemistry was contagious. James instilled  many of his students with an unrelenting desire to improve the environment and prepared  these future generations of scientists to better  the world for many years to come.  James will always be remembered  for his  incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions  to the community, and love of family. James  will also be remembered  for his  love of  the  outdoors. James took advantage of everything  the environment had to offer, which was clearly reflected  in his  life’s work. James  is survived by his second wife, Barbara Finlayson-  Pitts and his three daughters from a previous  marriage, Linda Lee, Christie Hoffman, and  Beckie St. George as well as his former wife,  Nancy, six grandchildren and their families. I  extend my condolences to James’ family and  friends; although James may be gone,  the  light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.  f  THE  INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  COURTS  AND PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE  VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ACT  HON.

333,,113,0.503,11,2014-07-03,Mr. CULBERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Houston Jewelry, a Houston family-  owned and operated business since 1866,  which has specialized  in diamonds and  fine  jewelry since 1953. A true ‘ ‘Texas Treasure,’ ’  this jewelry store can trace its history all the  way back to the family’s general store on Main  Street. The Donsky-Solomon family is now in  its  fifth generation of active management of  the business.  The history of this family store mirrors that  of Texas itself. What started out as a frontier  general store in the young, burgeoning town of  Houston, grew and matured to become one of  ‘America’s Best Couture Jewelers’ ’ and a multiple winner of the Better Business Bureau of  Houston’s Award for Excellence. Like the city  of Houston, from humble beginnings, the store  owned by  the Donsky-Solomon  family has  now earned national and international recognition. From  the sale of staple and  fancy dry  goods to fine jewelry through catalog and online sales, each generation has enhanced the  business it inherited. Weathering storms, economic busts, and national depressions, Houston Jewelry has been a steadfast testament to  the power of determination,  innovation, and  family bonds. Their contributions  to Houston  are unquestioned, and I wish them continued  success.  f  FAREWELL REMARKS FOR AMBASSADOR TATOUL MARKARIAN  HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.

334,,113,-0.402,11,2014-07-03,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  and  thank  Ambassador  Tatoul  Markarian for his service as the Ambassador  of  the Republic of Armenia  to  the United  States.  A distinguished diplomat,  the Ambassador  has a  long career  in public service, having  represented  the people of Armenia both at  home and around the world. Prior to his current position, he served as the Deputy Minister  of Foreign Affairs, Special Representative of  the  President  of  Armenia  for  Nagorno  Karabakh negotiations and as Ambassador to  the Mexican States. Additionally, he served  previously  from 1994 –1999 as  the Deputy  Chief of Mission for the Armenian Embassy in  Washington.  Before entering the Armenian Foreign Service, Ambassador Markarian  served  in  the  newly-independent Armenia’s  legislative and  executive branches.  I am proud of the work we have been able  to  accomplish  together while Ambassador  Markarian has been stationed in Washington  for  the  last nine years. Together, we have  fought together for Congressional Recognition  of the Armenian Genocide, and foreign aid assistance  to both  the Nagorno Karabakh Republic and Armenia. As the founder and Co-  Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, I have had the honor of working  closely on these issues for more than twenty  years.  Today,  the U.S.-Armenian  relationship  remains critically important. Armenia has been a  crucial ally in a strategic region of the world by  extending  robust  support  for  the U.S.-led  peacekeeping  deployments  in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and Kosovo. Additionally, they have cooperated with  the United States on a broad  range of regional and security challenges. This  relationship  has  been  stewarded  and  advanced by Ambassador Markarian during his  time in Washington.  Ambassador Markarian has dedicated his  life’s work to our shared goals and the people  of Armenia. I would like to offer my sincere  thanks  to him  for his service here  in  the  United States and offer both him and his family the best of luck as they move forward on  to their next diplomatic posting.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  CITY  OF  LOGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AS A  PURPLE HEART CITY  HON.

335,,113,-0.306,11,2014-07-03,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, on this, the eve  of the anniversary of American Independence,  it is fitting that we recognize not only the role  of the founders in freedom ’s birthplace, Philadelphia, but that we salute those who have,  ever since that declaration of freedom in 1776,  fought  in battle after battle and  in war after  war to secure our freedoms. On that day of  days celebrating America’s freedoms, like all  days when freedom reigns, we should honor  those who have  so  selflessly  served and  made such extraordinary personal sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, more than a year before independence was  declared, General George  Washington was appointed Commander  in  Chief of the Continental Army. His leadership  was born of our War for Independence, and,  to this day, General Washington remains a revered figure for the soldier in the field. And for  so many reasons, the General still warmly resides in America’s hearts and minds. Among  our Nation’s highest honors stands one enjoying almost universal recognition and holding a  distinguished reverence by those both inside  and outside the ranks of our dedicated military  services.  Its pedigree stretches back  to  the  legendary commitment General Washington  had made to his troops.  Above all, the Purple Heart symbolizes the  sacrifice made freely for this country, given for  each of us and for future generations. Here in  our Nation’s Capital on the office wall of West  Virginia ’s Third Congressional District hangs  one of my most cherished recognitions, a citation from the Military Order of the Purple Heart  of  the United States of America recognizing  my service to the Order. Each year, I am honored  to welcome West Virginia members of  the Order  to my office and  to discuss with  them issues of importance.  Many times I have had the high honor of  presenting the Purple Heart to my fellow West  Virginians. Without exception,  they are as  humble in accepting this award as they were  meritorious  in  their actions  for which  it was  granted. Here, Mr. Speaker, is found the true  heart of the American character.

I believe that this permanent extension  is necessary to ensure the Internet remains accessible for all Americans.  Madam Speaker, the Internet economy  is growing and changing every  day, and this pro-growth  legislation  will support the vibrant online marketplace of goods and ideas by preventing  State and local tax policies from creating barriers to access.  Americans use the Internet every day  to communicate, to work, and to get  an education. They shouldn’t have to  pay an unnecessary and unfair tax to  do so.  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman  GOODLATTE for his work on this important bipartisan bill. I urge all my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’  ",2014

338,House,113,-0.404,19,2014-07-15,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.,"  I  thank Mr.  POLISfor yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule for H.R. 5021. This  closed rule prevents an opportunity for  us to address the larger issues related  to passing a long-term surface transportation reauthorization, and that is  what Mr. POLIS and Mr. WELCH are  talking about. I agree.  The constituents that I represent in  North Carolina feel that it is critical to  extend the highway trust fund. This  bill is only one piece of what must be  done to strengthen our Nation’s infrastructure and economy.  The need to pass surface transportation reauthorization funding is extremely critical. MAP–21 expires at the  beginning of October. At  the  same  time, each day brings us closer to a  highway trust fund shortfall and risks  putting major transportation projects  on hold and stalling our economy.  b1345  The North Carolina DOT has  indicated that the highway trust fund insolvency would jeopardize 108 projects  and 20,000 jobs across my State.  Eastern North Carolina remains one  of the poorest districts in the country  despite the economic resurgence many  other areas of the country have seen.  Strengthening infrastructure helps encourage  economic  development,  increase commerce and improve tourism.  We cannot afford to halt construction,  growth, and progress. We must find a  way to provide consistent and robust  transportation funding. We need a fix  to the reauthorization act.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this  closed rule so that we can have a larger  conversation about the long-term surface transportation reauthorization.  ",2014
339,House,113,0.275,33,2014-07-15,Mr. BARLETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of this legislation that will  keep our highway trust fund solvent  until we agree on a long-term solution.  If we fail to act, the money to fund  surface  transportation  projects will  soon run dry. That could result in the  stoppage of more than 7,000 projects.  We would lose countless jobs across the  country, and  in my home State of  Pennsylvania as well.  I have always supported a highway  bill of a least 5 years or more, but in  the absence of one, I support this proposal to give us time to work out a  longer-term funding solution. We need  a plan that will meet our transportation needs while also providing contractors and builders the guidance they  need to invest in equipment and employees.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’  on this important piece of legislation.  ",2014

342,House,113,0.703,47,2014-07-15,Mr. YOHO.," Mr. Chairman,  in 2010,  this body passed the Hiring Incentives  to Restore Employment Act, the HIRE  Act. Included in that measure was the  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,  or FATCA.  FATCA requires U.S. citizens living  abroad to prepare tax returns that include both non-U.S. income and non-  U.S. financial accounts. Additionally,  FATCA requires financial institutions  in other countries to report on assets  held by American clients to the IRS.  If those institutions do not supply  that information, they would be subject to a 30 percent withholding tax. In  a recent report, nearly 77,000 institutions have agreed to hand over that information to the IRS.  The unintended consequences of this  law are affecting over 7 million Americans living overseas. Due to the additional reporting burden, many institutions are simply denying access to our  citizens.  Simply put, added regulations from  the Federal Government are putting  our citizens at a competitive disadvantage around  the world, and  foreign  firms now view our citizens as too  much of a hassle and a liability to hire,  making America less competitive.  One of the solutions to this would be  to switch from a citizen-based taxation  to a territorial or to simply repeal  FATCA.  The U.S. citizens who live and work  abroad are our Nation’s biggest spokesmen for our America and our way of  life and what America stands for. They  represent our country in areas of the  world that typically see Americans in a  skewed light. We, as those in government, should give them every opportunity  to  succeed  throughout  the  world.  However, we have so many stories  like the American living in Australia,  where her husband is an Australian citizen and they share a mutual bank account, but they have to comply with  IRS rules, and she has no income; or  the gentleman from Thailand who has  retired. He worked for a U.S. company  for the last 15 years, and he has to  abide by U.S. tax laws, even though he  has been over there and he resides outside of the U.S.  What Fidelity Mutual told him is we  can no longer accept your money and  invest because you live outside of the  U.S., but you are a U.S. citizen.  Mr. Chairman, this is unacceptable.  We  in government should do everything possible to bring certainty to our  citizens, regardless of where they live,  and as a sign of a true great Nation, it  is the ability for the Nation’s citizens  to  travel  and work wherever  they  choose in the world, without being disadvantaged by their own government.  I look forward to working with my  colleague from Florida.  ",2014
343,House,113,-0.313,54,2014-07-15,Mr. HECK of Washington.," Mr. Chairman, I offer this bipartisan amendment  to carry forth an important issue of  public safety to provide  legally-constituted marijuana businesses access to  banking services. To do otherwise is to  render them an all-cash sector of the  economy, which is fraught with peril.  If you  supported  the Rohrabacher  amendment to the Commerce-Justice  and  Science  Appropriations  which  passed clearly, then you will support  this as well. It brings forth the terms  and conditions of the Department of  Justice and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.  Yesterday morning, on the very front  page of USA Today was an article setting forth the dangers of all-cash businesses  in our States  that have approved legally marijuana-related businesses. In the words of the Attorney  General:  You don’t want just huge amounts of cash  in these places. They want to be able to use  the banking system. It is a public safety  component. Huge amounts of cash, substantial amounts of cash  just kind of  lying  around with no place  for  it to be appropriately deposited is something that worries  me, just from a law enforcement perspective.  b1830  If you support public safety, if you  supported the Rohrabacher amendment  to the Commerce, Justice, and Science  bill, you will support this amendment  as well. In the interest of public safety,  you will do this. Because in the words  of the Department of Justice, the two  most important terms and conditions:  keep marijuana out of the hands of  children and keep cash out of the hands  of gangs and the cartels. To oppose this  amendment is to support that, and I  know you don’t want that.  So, I urge you in the strongest terms  to support this amendment, this bipartisan amendment, as was adopted earlier on  the Commerce, Justice, and  Science Appropriations bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  POINTOFORDER  ",2014

345,Senate,113,-0.294,96,2014-07-15,Mr. HEINRICH.," I rise to speak on the  pending nominations.  I  appreciate  the majority  leader  scheduling this vote to confirm Mr.  Norman Bay to be a member of the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  FERC is one of the lesser known but  perhaps one of  the most  important  independent agencies  in the Federal  Government. It has jurisdiction over  interstate transmission of electricity,  oil, and natural gas, as well as licensing of hydroelectric power.  I believe Mr. Bay will be an outstanding member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I urge all  of my colleagues to support his nomination today.  Since 2009 Mr. Bay has been the Director of the Office of Enforcement at  FERC, where he has gained extensive  experience in the regulation of energy  markets. The Office of Enforcement is  responsible for market oversight and  surveillance and for implementing the  antimanipulation authority Congress  enacted in the Energy Policy Act of  2005. This authority provided FERC  new tools to combat the type of market manipulation that produced the  devastating power crisis a decade ago  across the West.  Under Mr. Bay’s  leadership, FERC  has increased transparency in its work,  while bringing a number of enforcement actions that have helped protect  the  integrity of the energy markets  and provided $300 million in relief to  consumers—$300 million back into the  pockets of energy consumers.  He is a graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School and has  had a long and distinguished career of  public service. Before joining FERC, he  taught law at the University of New  Mexico. He also served as an assistant  U.S. attorney and in 2000 was nominated by the President to be the U.S.  attorney for the District of New Mexico. He was confirmed in that position  by the full Senate by unanimous consent.  Mr. Bay  is an outstanding public  servant with extensive experience  in  the field of energy markets. I am confident he will  judiciously  implement  FERC’s  statutory  responsibility  of  oversight of our Nation’s energy infrastructure,  competitive markets, and  reliability.  At his confirmation hearing in May,  members of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee had a chance to  question Mr. Bay extensively on his  work at the FERC and his views on regulatory policy. Senator Pete Domenici,  a former chairman and longtime member of the energy committee from my  home State of New Mexico, spoke at  the hearing in strong support of Mr.  Bay’s nomination. Senator Jeff Bingaman, another former chairman of the  energy committee from New Mexico,  wrote a letter in support of his nomination.  The Senate must give consent to the  President’s nominees to be members of  the FERC. The Senate is fulfilling that  responsibility with  this vote  today.  However, there should be no misunderstanding—Congress gave the President  alone the responsibility of designating  a member of the Commission to be the  Chairman of the Commission. The law  enacted by Congress in 1977 remains  very clear: The President, and not the  Senate, determines who will serve as  Chairman of the Commission.  I believe Mr. Bay will be fair, balanced, pragmatic, and a consensus-oriented member of the FERC. He will decide cases on the merits, based on the  facts, based on the  law and on the  record.  I am pleased to support the nominations of both Commissioner LaFleur  and Mr. Bay to be members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I  hope the Senate will vote today to confirm them both.  I yield the floor.  ",2014
346,Senate,113,-0.635,124,2014-07-15,Mr. BOOKER.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce with my colleague  Senator DEANHELLER, legislation that  would extend a critical and innovative  program for our nation’s veterans. Senator HELLERand I urge our colleagues  to consider The Assisted Living Program  for Veterans with Traumatic  Brain Injury Extension, AL–TBI, Act  which authorizes the continuation of a  Veterans Health Administration program that provides intensive care and  rehabilitation to veterans with severe  brain injuries.  Thanks  to  this program, veterans  with  traumatic brain  injuries more  quickly re-adjust to their day-to-day  lives—from making dinner for others,  to fixing a faucet, to doing yard work.  AL–TBI consists of privately run group  homes around the country where veterans are  immersed  in therapies  for  movement, memory, speech, and gradual community reintegration. Veterans  in these homes benefit  from 24-hour  team-based care. There are about twenty of these homes in New Jersey that  have yielded  impressive results. Nationally, several dozen veterans have  been rehabilitated from severe injuries  that are notoriously difficult to treat.  This program is working to help a  generation of veterans with traumatic  brain injuries and so many older veterans that have been suffering for decades. Since 2001, more than 265,000 U.S.  troops suffered traumatic brain injuries, according to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. While most  were mild concussions, over 26,000 men  and women  veterans  suffered  from  moderate or severe head wounds. Advances in medicine keep alive soldiers  with head wounds  that might have  killed them in previous conflicts. However, the ability to cure these injuries  has not kept pace. Innovative, effective  programs must be supported by Congress in order to give our veterans the  care they need and deserve.  But unfortunately, as the program  nears the end of its 5-year authorization, veterans across the country are  being told that they need to prepare to  move out of  the  facilities  in September. I have heard from a veteran in  New Jersey, who was told he will need  to be out of the program on September  15 and worries he will be out on the  street. He has made tremendous gains  with the AL–TBI program. He has rekindled his relationship with his son.  He is able to do basic math again. But,  he has a lot more to do to get his independence back. We cannot leave him  and other veterans like him out in the  cold.  The VA offers no alternative program  that replicates the comprehensiveness  of the rehabilitative care, the benefit  of providing care in a residential setting, and the positive impact on veterans of sustained, longer-term care.  This is a proven program that does  not require new funds, and I urge my  colleagues in the Senate to join Senator HELLERand myself in supporting  this critical piece of legislation for our  Nation’s veterans.  By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr.  BURR, Mr.  ISAKSON, and Mr.  WICKER):  S. 2611.

347,Senate,113,0.394,15,2014-07-21,Mr. CORKER.," Mr. President, I thank  the leader for her comments and her  ability to build consensus around the  reauthorization as she did in the committee.  This is the fifth time since 2008—I  have been here since January of 2007—  that we have done a temporary extension. It is an absolute embarrassment.  Not only do we not get the benefit of  the economic growth that would come  from people knowing there is a program in place where they can enter  into long-term contracts and they can  buy construction equipment, in addition to that, this is a tremendous problem of absolutely being generational  theft.  I will get to those comments, and I  thank the Senator from Delaware for  his leadership and for being here on the  floor. I will be  fairly brief and will  yield the floor for him.  I think if every Senator were asked if  they were opposed to using budget gimmicks, they would say yes. I am sure  the Presiding Officer would say the  same. They say the budget should not  be used as an offset to pay for spending. Time and time again, Congress  avoids the tough decision and instead  throws our kids under the bus so we  can tell people back home that the legislation was passed and paid for. I have  long been against the disgraceful practice of spending money today and paying for it in the future. It is shameful,  it  is  irresponsible, and  it  is generational theft. Yet here we are this week  looking for a way to pass a bill that  would pay for spending that is already  happening by using a blatant budget  scheme called pension smoothing.  Pension  smoothing  is  one  of  the  worst kinds of budget gimmicks.

348,Senate,113,-0.255,22,2014-07-21,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. President, I wish to  honor Vance Home Gun, an emerging  leader in Montana and member of the  Confederated  Salish  and  Kootenai  Tribes.  As I travel around Indian Country in  Montana, I see a lot of challenges that  still need to be addressed, but I also see  a lot of cause for hope. Vance Home  Gun embodies that hope.  Vance was first introduced to a Salish language camp at the age of 11. Inspired by elders and other community  members, Vance resolved himself to become a fluent Salish speaker and to encourage his peers to get involved in the  preservation of the Salish language.  Vance has taken a  leadership role  within his tribe to revitalize Native  languages  through  his  organization  called Yoyoot Skwkwimlt, or Strong  Young People,  that utilizes peer-to-  peer methods to teach language and  culture.  I also want to congratulate Vance on  receiving a scholarship to attend the  University of Oregon this coming fall.  On behalf of all Montanans, I wish him  luck and look forward to his return  home when he finishes his studies to  continue making a difference for Montana and his tribe.  Since joining the Senate 5 months  ago, I have cosponsored two important  pieces of legislation that promote and  preserve Native languages for generations to come.  I know that support for comprehensive and culturally-relevant language  programs will set our Native children  on a path for success in school and life  and allows them to reach their full potential.  Vance encapsulated the urgency behind  Native  language  preservation  when he stated,  ‘‘Time is of the essence, and our young Native people are  the key to revitalizing our language.  Helping them is revitalizing our identity.’’  It will take leaders like Vance to implement these vital language programs  for the benefit of cultural preservation  and revitalization.  I stand with Vance to help preserve  the Native languages and traditions for  generations to come.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

349,House,113,-0.204,9,2014-07-31,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I enter  into the RECORDthe story of a 17-year-  old Guatemalan boy who received asylum because a gang killed his father  and they were threatening him.  Cesar, a 17-year old boy from Guatemala,  lost his father to gang violence at the age of  4. For 13 years, Cesar was harassed by the  same gang who killed his father. When he refused to join the gang, he feared for his life  and fled the country, swimming across the  Rio Grande to cross the border. He was  granted asylum, loves school and hopes to  attend college.  Cesar—Asylum  Cesar, from Guatemala, was four years old  when his father was killed by gangs in their  community. The gang members were never  arrested and continued to live in the town.  They started harassing Cesar when he was  very young and never stopped. He was very  scared but there was no way he could get  away from them.  By the time he turned 17, Cesar could not  stand the gang harassment any more. The  gangs were trying very hard to get him to  join and he was very afraid he was going to  be killed. He decided to make the journey to  the United States. He said was very hard;  sometimes he didn’t think he would survive.  He swam across the Rio Grande to cross the  border. A pro bono attorney KIND matched  him with from Kirkland & Ellis helped him  gain asylum. He loves school and wants to  attend college.  ",2014

352,House,113,-0.455,37,2014-07-31,Mr. FARR.," Thank you, Madam Ranking Chair, for yielding.  I rise, Madam Speaker, on this bill  with great concern. I am bringing a lot  of passion to this debate because I lived  in the barrios like the ones the children are coming from when I was a  Peace Corps volunteer in Latin America, very violent barrios.  Look, this is not a border crisis. It is  not a border security issue. This is a  humanitarian crisis, and it is caused by  problems on both sides of the border.  Our country has a lot at fault here because we have not  addressed  comprehensive immigration reform, which  means we have 11 million people living  in the United States undocumented.  They are essentially incarcerated in  this country. They are not allowed to  go home because the minute they go  home and try to get back to the United  States, they get arrested, and they are  not allowed to ever return, or they are  barred for 10 years from returning.  So what happens, Madam Speaker?  They have been living here for years  and years. They have children that  they left because there were job opportunities here, and those children are  now  living  in places that are really  dangerous, and all of a sudden, yeah,  things have changed. They have got to  get out.  These countries are ranked number  one, four, and five of the highest murder rates in the world. They leave them  because there are real, serious humanitarian crises. They are showing up on  our border. They are not  sneaking  across the border.  There  is nobody having to go out  there for these kids trying to sneak in.  They are  throwing  themselves—help  me, help me find my relative, my dad,  my parent, my mom—in this country.  What does this bill do? It doesn’t address the humanitarian problems at either end. It hires more cops and puts  military in there, National Guardsmen.  Now, if that is such a great idea, why  is California—with probably the busiest border in the world with Mexico—  not putting its National Guard down  there? Our Governors and our mayors  don’t think it is necessary.  Madam Speaker, why are we putting  more money in for National Guard? We  don’t need  the National Guard. We  need Red Cross—it is a humanitarian  crisis—Red Cross. No, we are putting  more and more money for arms and  more money for military and cops. I  don’t think that is the right answer.  We are also doing something really  dumb. We are stripping a law now that  says when we give money to these  countries—by  the way,  before  you  spend this money on your cops and on  your military, you have got to vet  them. We have a human rights standard. This bill throws that out.  You don’t have to do that now. We  are going to give you $40 million of  American  taxpayer money, and you  don’t have to do anything to abide by  human  rights. Now,  that  is  really  dumb, and I don’t think American taxpayers want their money spent that  way.  Madam Speaker, I am going to call  upon my colleagues here not to come  down here and think of themselves in a  partisan way or an election year way,  but come to this floor when you have  to vote on this bill and think of yourself as a parent, as a neighbor.  A kid has knocked on your door, and  you go to the door and say: Oh, my God  he is crying, or she is crying. You say:  What  happened? They  say:  In my  house, they are raping people and killing people, and I am running away.  This bill says: Oh, what is your address? I will take you home.  Don’t vote for it.  ",2014
353,House,113,-0.225,37,2014-07-31,Mr. CUELLAR.," Madam Speaker,  I  support  full comprehensive  immigration reform, but today’s vote on this  supplemental appropriation bill is to  provide funding to ICE, Border Patrol,  and other agencies to deal with the humanitarian crisis on the border, an  area that I represent, an area where I  live, an area where 42,000 out of the  58,000  unaccompanied  kids  have  crossed.  The policy change in this bill is to  get rid of a loophole in the 2008 law  that the smugglers in Central America  and Mexico have taken advantage of.  All due process and legal protections  are left intact under this proposed bill.  You will see under a CRS report that  compares the current law to today’s  bill, you will see that the same due  process and the same legal protections  are left intact. In fact, I respectfully  ask my colleagues  in opposition  to  show me specifically where there is due  process and  legal protection that  is  taken away out of the bill. I yet have  heard where it does this.  Madam Speaker, I have also asked  my colleagues  in opposition respectfully to sit down with me and offer  their alternative solution or their legislative proposal to this border crisis  and have yet to hear those solutions.  In this appropriation bill, we have to  provide  the  funding  to  the Federal  agencies to provide an early border,  but we can no longer afford to play defense on the 1-yard line called the U.S.-  Mexico border. We need to play defense  on the 20-yard line, and this is why  working with  the Central American  countries and working with Mexico to  address the core issues and to fix and  to fight these smugglers is vital.  I want to thank the men and women  on the border that have defended our  homeland, and I want to thank the border communities, the churches, and the  nonprofits that have done so much to  help these folks at the border. In fact,  I want to thank the chairman for allowing a provision for the border communities to seek reimbursement  for  the allowable expenses under this bill.  We cannot leave Washington today  without putting the resources and the  policy change to address the border crisis. We are sent here to address not the  easy problems, but to address the hard  problems.  ",2014

367,Senate,113,0.844,86,2014-07-31,Mr. CRUZ.," Madam President, I wish  to briefly explain to people watching  the back-and-forth that just occurred  what is going on here, because it is  easy to not understand everything that  is happening. There are three things  going on here:  No. 1, what we are unfortunately seeing is the Senate holding one bill hostage in order to try to force through  another unpopular bill.  There are two bills concerning the  Internet. The first is the Internet Tax  Freedom Act. That has been in place  for over a decade. It has had bipartisan  support. It has been championed by the  Senator from Oregon who has been an  outspoken and passionate advocate of  making sure that when you and I go  and sign up for the Internet, we don’t  face taxes for getting Internet service,  and it has worked very well. That law  has always been an area of bipartisan  agreement.  But there is a second law that has  been proposed  in this body but not  passed. The second law is the Internet  sales tax, what its proponents call the  Marketplace Fairness Act. The Internet sales tax is not focused on taxing  someone  just  for signing up to the  Internet. Rather, the people being punished by the Internet sales tax are all  the  small businesses  trying  to  sell  their wares online, and there are a  number of Senators who very much  want to impose taxes on those small  businesses in 9,600 jurisdictions nationwide.  What is happening here, right now, is  even though no one has serious objection to the Internet Tax Freedom Act,  we are, unfortunately, seeing our colleagues from the Democratic side of  the aisle hold that bill hostage in an effort to try to force through the Internet sales tax.  I would note the reason my friend  from New Hampshire had no choice but  to object to the 2-month proposal is the  2-month time period was not picked  out of a hat. Two months means the  Internet Tax Freedom Act would expire  during a lameduck session. And why is  that? Because in a lameduck session  there are a bunch of Members who have  been defeated, who aren’t going to face  voters ever again. A lameduck session  is  the  session most  likely  to  raise  taxes.  So why is it there is an effort to extend this just 2 months? So when the  Internet Tax Freedom Act expires in  the  lameduck,  the Members of  this  body who lost their election and are  immune  from  democratic  accountability will all come together and say:  OK, now let’s pass the Internet sales  tax. We shouldn’t be holding the Internet hostage to the rapacious desire of  tax collectors.  A second point I want to make about  what is going on here—this is about  discriminatory taxes, not about  federalism.

(HERO  FL), upon receiving  the Small Business Administration’s 2014 Regional and State of Florida Small Business Exporter of  the Year  Award. It is an honor to represent Carlton and  his  thriving export company,  located  in  the  Fourth Congressional District of Florida. Small  businesses, like HERO FL, are the backbone  of this country and are job creators that are  revitalizing our nation ’s economy.  HERO FL began in 2008, when Carlton, his  father Leslie, and uncle George, decided  to  take advantage of  the opportunities  that  the  expansion of JAXPORT had to offer. Expanding on  their already successful commercial  landscaping business, Carlton saw an opportunity to branch out internationally, exporting  machinery and other materials to construction  and mining industries across the globe. And  so, HERO FL was born.  HERO FL began specializing in worldwide  exports  of  components,  spare  parts,  and  heavy machinery to mining and earthmoving  industries. The company’s ability  to deliver  hard-to-find parts quickly and efficiently to remote mining  locations  throughout  the world  has deservedly garnered a lot of attention.  In addition to the prestigious Small Business  Administration award, HERO FL was recently  honored with the President’s ‘ ‘E’ ’ Award for its  efforts  to expand national exports. Created  under President John F. Kennedy,  the  ‘E’ ’  Award recognizes people,  firms or organizations that make major contributions in U.S. exports. Today,  the  ‘E’ ’ Award  is  the highest  recognition any U.S. entity can  receive  for  noteworthy export promotion efforts.  Due to HERO FL ’s success, today, 100 percent of its revenue stems from export sales  and  from 2010  to 2013, HERO FL ’s sales  grew an astounding 344 percent. This is a true  American success story and should serve as  inspiration for all small business owners. I am  proud that the First Coast can claim Carlton  Smith and his prosperous company as  its  own.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and Members of the  House of Representatives join me in this very  special congressional salute to Carlton Smith  and everyone at HERO FL.  f  HONORING  THE  MAJOR  JOSHUA  MARINE CORPS  SERVICE  OF  S.

My father happened to be from California—and I myself was born and raised in California—  went to the  local  farm bureau and  caused a great disturbance because  they started putting Japanese into internment camps, and he actually stood  up in that meeting and said, I don’t see  any Germans  serving  in  internment  camps.  It was an unjust thing. Not only were  they  interned,  their  property was  seized. We have never had a black eye  in our history of the United States  such as we had during that period of  time.  I just hope people in America realize  it can happen again. We have to be  very aware of what we actually have  from people when they are under stress  or when they are under, they think, attack by fellow Americans.  So, I compliment you on this legislation. I did have an individual—actually,  three  individuals—from Alaska  that I know of that served on that isKILMER land during that period of time. So  again, I compliment you, Mr. KILMER,  for your work on this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  ",2014
372,House,113,-0.587,34,2014-09-08,Ms. FUDGE.," I thank you for yielding.  I want to thank my colleagues, Congressmen JEFFRIESand HORSFORD, for  leading today’s conversation on a problem that America must acknowledge,  come to terms with, and address.  I  want to thank them for their leadership. As  a  freshman member, Mr.  HORSFORDhas been outstanding. It is  my pleasure to serve with you.  Mr. Speaker, in communities across  our Nation, many believe that police  officers, sworn to protect and serve, are  instead disturbingly and violently attacking citizens without just cause.  We have heard stories of individuals  being shot to death when there is clearly no threat to an officer’s safety. We  have seen peaceful protestors and journalists on the job arrested, having cans  of tear gas shot at them and guns suited for military combat pointed at unarmed citizens.  Over the past few months, cell phone  videos  and  pictures  have  surfaced  showing a policeman kicking subdued  civilians in the head, repeatedly punching a woman in the face on the side of  a highway, and placing a man in an illegal choke hold when there appears to  be no resistance to arrest.  Last year in Cleveland, one of the  cities I represent, 13 officers fired 137  shots into one car, killing two unarmed  individuals, and both occupants of the  car were shot more than 20 times.  The startling images we saw of the  police response to civil protest in Ferguson, Missouri, were in stark contrast  to the citizens exercising their constitutional right to be heard. Police  met peaceful protestors with a force intent on silencing their voices. This excessive use of force often provokes animosity instead of building the cooperation needed to combat violence.  The trust between law enforcement  and citizens required to keep our community safe is being eroded by the uncertainty of motives and biases behind  the actions officials take, often against  those who are powerless yet pay for  them to protect them. Instead of keeping the peace, these actions incite tensions where there should be opportunities for understanding.  This type of activity must stop. Community policing can only be effective  when citizens and leaders, community  law enforcement and elected officials  work  together, not against one another, to address violence and unrest.  Transparency, accountability, and responsibility must be at the nexus of  this relationship.  b1945  Because of Ferguson, our Nation and  the world have  seen what happens  when these principles are ignored or  disregarded.  I applaud the Department of Justice  for initiating full civil rights investigations into this case and others that  have resulted in the deaths of civilians  at the hands of law enforcement. I also  applaud the citizens of Ferguson for realizing that their community belongs  to them and that it is up to them to decide with whom they will work to lead  it.  Just because  the  cameras are no  longer rolling in Ferguson, the recent  tragedies we have witnessed there, in  Staten Island, and in other American  cities have shown that we cannot keep  turning a blind eye to what is going on  between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  Members of the Congressional Black  Caucus remain committed to working  with our colleagues on the local, State,  and Federal level to improve the policies and practices of law enforcement  officials across this country so that  safety, trust, and confidence can be restored where it has been broken.  I want to especially congratulate my  colleague, Mr. CLAY, for all of the work  that he did during the Ferguson situation and will continue to do. I am as  proud of him as I can be of anyone, and  I certainly am going to be supportive  of his efforts.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot move  forward  together without  figuring out  what must be done so that what happened  in  Ferguson  never  happens  again.  ",2014

376,,113,-0.233,90,2014-09-08,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the Village of Chicago Ridge,  Illinois,  which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this  month.  The history of Chicago Ridge  is  indeed  unique as  its beginnings coincide with The  Chicago World’s Fair, which  in 1893 commemorated  the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival  in  the new world.  Trainloads of dirt, brought out by way of the  Wabash  railroad  for  the construction of  the  fair,  formed  the  ridges  from which Chicago  Ridge takes its name.  Settlement increased with the establishment  of rail yards in Chicago Ridge and in 1914 the  village was  incorporated. The newly  incorporated government moved quickly  to make  investments  to  improve  infrastructure  and  transportation, paving  the way  for economic  growth.  The  village and  its  residents also host  RidgeFest—an  annual  summer  celebration  that draws thousands from the Chicago metropolitan area to enjoy live music, fireworks, and  time with family and friends.  Today’s Chicago Ridge owes much to the  steady  leadership provided  for almost  four  decades  by  Eugene  ‘Gene ’ ’  Siegel who  served as mayor from 1975 until his retirement  in  2013. Mayor Siegel  guided  the  town  through a revitalization and population boom.  He established a full-time fire department and  led the development of a public works facility  and municipal complex. Gene Siegel ’s accomplishments during his  tenure as Mayor provided  the  foundation  for Chicago Ridge  to  flourish for years to come. Chicago Ridge now  prospers  under  the  leadership  of Mayor  Charles Tokar who previously served 24 years  as Village Clerk and 14 years as a trustee.  I am proud to represent the Village of Chicago Ridge. I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring all of the citizens of the village as  they celebrate  the 100th anniversary. May  they enjoy  this centennial celebration and  I  look  forward  to many more years of growth  and prosperity.

Commander Erik Franzen began his naval  career  in 1991 after graduating  from San  Diego State University with a Bachelor of Arts  degree  in Liberal Studies and was commissioned through the NROTC program.  In 2010, Commander Erik Franzen reported  onboard the Naval Air Facility (NAF) El Centro  as  the Executive Officer. He  later assumed  command of the installation on July 1, 2013  and spearheaded several  infrastructure  improvements  to NAF El Centro. These enhancements included a complete remodel of  the Naval Exchange Building and the Take 5  coffee shop, an overhaul of the sports complex, installation of artificial turf on the sports  field and sundry improvements to workspaces  throughout the base.  As a result of Commander Erik Franzen’s  guidance and leadership, NAF El Centro has  increased in mission capability, improved customer  service  to  visiting detachments and  seen a tremendous boost to the overall morale  of  the  base.  I  applaud Commander Erik  Franzen for his distinguished service to NAF  El Centro, the Imperial Valley, and the nation.  f  REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOE  SCHNEIDER  HON.

378,,113,-0.315,97,2014-09-08,Ms. DUCKWORTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the life of Joe Schneider. The  recent emotion and debate surrounding immigration in the U.S. has detracted from some  great  stories about  those  immigrants who  helped  to  found and shape  this country.  I  would like to share a story about one of those  immigrants.  Joe Schneider was born  in Kernei, Yugoslavia in 1929. While his father was off fighting  in World War II, Joe led his displaced family  on a journey throughout Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and ultimately Vienna, Austria. As  refugees,  the war years were extremely challenging and although he lost a leg  at age 15, he never lost his desire or ability to  support and lead his mother and four younger  siblings.  His  family was given  the opportunity  to  leave Austria and arrived in the U.S. as immigrants in 1951. Joe was extremely proud of  his German heritage but his love for this country was something he never stopped  talking  about. Without speaking a word of English and  missing a leg he set out to start working as a  tailor. He often talked about living in the land  of opportunity and how it afforded anyone and  everyone  the chance  to start and own  their  own business. He finally lived his dream when  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:33 Sep 09, 2014 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K08SE8.012 E08SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s ‘         ",2014
379,,113,0.661,104,2014-09-08,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker,  two hundred  years ago, on September 14, 1814, Francis  Scott Key and  two other Americans, one a  prisoner of the British whose release Key had  been commissioned to negotiate, waited anxiously  for  the outcome of  the battle begun  nearly 24 hours earlier. Although Key had secured the release of Dr. William Beams, they  were detained by  the British overnight because  they had overheard  the British attack  plans.  During the rainy night, Key had witnessed  the bombardment of Fort McHenry, and observed that the fort ’s smaller ‘ ‘storm flag’ ’ continued to fly. At dawn, Key was inspired by the  American victory and  the sight of a  larger  American  flag, with  fifteen stars and  fifteen  stripes flying triumphantly above the fort. This  flag  remains  on  public  display  in  the  Smithsonian ’s National Museum of American  History.  The whole event  inspired Key  to write a  poem, titled ‘ ‘Defence of Fort M’Henry.’ ’ It was  soon set to music and performed to an enthusiastic public audience as ‘ ‘The Star Spangled  Banner ’ ’  less  than a month  later.  In 1931,  Congress adopted it as the national anthem of  the United States.  Orange County, California, which makes up  most of the 39th Congressional District I represent, is home to one of Francis Scott Key’s  descendants. George Key,  the great great  grandson of the author of our national anthem,  is a resident of San Clemente and a member  of the ‘ ‘greatest generation.’ ’ A veteran of both  World War II and the Korean Conflict, Mr. Key  has honored his heritage by leading efforts in  his own community to honor the flag that inspired his ancestor.  Mr. Key is known as ‘ ‘The Flagman of San  Clemente. ’ ’ Even at 90 years of age, he continues to work with local schools, the Daughters of  the American Revolution,  the Boy  Scouts, and others, teaching them U.S. history  and how  to properly dispose of American  flags. He collects  tattered  flags  from drop  points in the city and arranges for their proper  disposal. Along with a colleague, he created a  program to honor veterans and their families  by  flying  flags over San Clemente City Hall  when the veterans pass away.  I am pleased to recognize the 200th Anniversary of  the  ‘Star Spangled Banner,’ ’ and  the legacy of the Key family in honoring our  nation’s flag.  HON.

Established  in 1939,  the Tucson Arizona  Boys Chorus was formed by Eduardo Caso, a  teacher and singer in Arizona recovering from  tuberculosis. The choir quickly rose to prominence, starring in early national radio and television broadcasts, and even performing at the  1950 Chicago World ’s Fair.  The Chorus continued to grow, aggressively  traveling to all corners of the globe, a mission  that continues  to  this day. They have performed in over 25 different countries, visiting  every continent except Antarctica. From Tucson to the former Soviet Union, from the Vatican to Super Bowl XXX, this extraordinary institution  has  continuously  embodied  those  qualities that make southern Arizona such a  treasure.  Vital to the Chorus’ mission is the development of  its members  through concentrated  character growth. These  young men  learn  core values such as leadership, responsibility,  sincerity, integrity, reliability and honor.  Under the direction of Dr. Julian Ackerley,  the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus shares the  values and traditions of southern Arizona with  the world. I congratulate the Tucson Arizona  Boys Chorus on 75 years of excellence and  wish them the best for the next 75 years to  come.  f  HONORING CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATES  OF TABLE ROCK LAKE  HON.

385,House,113,-0.656,45,2014-09-15,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only in  opposition to this legislation but to a  process that has been conducted in secret and in bad faith.  Tonight, the House will debate two  legislative packages  that have been  brought to the floor over the objections  of the minority and without regard for  due process or the opportunity for robust debate.  Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: these  measures are being advanced  for no  other reason than political gain.  The bill we consider presently is H.R.  5405, a newly created package  that  combines 11—11—separate Republican-  authored  bills. These  complex  and  wide-ranging measures have been hastily merged together and rushed to the  floor for a vote. The expedited process  in which  the Republicans have  engaged, over my objections, have denied  Members  the opportunity  to debate  how  these pieces will  interact with  each other and the problems that may  occur as a result.  Keep in mind that H.R. 5405 is so far-  reaching that it amends the Securities  Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, the  Securities Exchange Act,  the JOBS  Act, the Bank Holding Company Act,  and the Investment Advisers Act, not  to mention that many provisions interact with the Dodd-Frank Act.  With this omnibus proposal touching  so many different aspects of our directives  and  securities  laws, Members  ought  to have  the  chance  to offer  amendments on the floor and debate  whether this laundry list of provisions  is the right approach.  b1945  Again, this is a substantial piece of  legislation with the package requiring  three separate reports by the SEC and  another robust cost-benefit analysis.  Keep in mind that the majority is  placing all these new rule-writing and  reporting requirements on the SEC at  the same time that they are denying  the Commission the funding they need  to do their job efficiently and be the  tough sheriff for Wall Street that we  need them to be.  I, for one, oppose this last-minute attempt  to circumvent  the  legislative  process. At the eleventh hour, it seems  the majority is using all the tricks at  their disposal to prove to the American  people that they are more than the do-  nothing Republican Congress. I think  the American people are smarter than  that.  Again, I think the American people  would  agree  that Members  of  this  House should be afforded the opportunity to discuss what is in these packages, offer amendments, and have a robust debate on these bills.  Tonight, in a mad dash for political  victory, that fundamental element of  democracy will be thwarted; furthermore, the chairman has broken with  the tradition of a bipartisan suspension  vote process by putting  forth more  than  15 pieces of  legislation  in exchange for one Democratic bill. This is  just unacceptable.  Unfortunately, as with flood insurance  legislation,  the Export-Import  Bank, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, the ideological wing of the  Republican Party is unable and unwilling to work together to get things done  for our Nation’s citizens.  I am dismayed that they continue to put partisan interests ahead of job creation,  certainty for our businesses, and the  democratic process.  Mr. Speaker, to preserve the principle of fairness for the minority and to  ensure  the democratic process  continues as it has for centuries, I am, indeed, opposing this legislation as well  as  the  Insurance Capital Standards  Clarification Act that we will consider  shortly.  I believe that if gone unchecked this  type of legislating could increase and  soon become commonplace. We must  not circumvent our time-honored traditions for political gain.

402,,113,-0.234,101,2014-09-15,Mr. PETERS of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to congratulate the Michigan/Ontario  Council of Bishops of the Church of God in  Christ,  Inc. (COGIC), as  they celebrate 100  years of fellowship.  Founded in 1897 by then-Elder Charles Harrison Mason, the COGIC arose from humble  beginnings—holding  its  first meetings  in  the  living room of one of its members. Driven by  a desire to better fulfill the tenants of their believes in the Gospel, Bishop Mason and his  followers embarked upon a spiritual journey to  grow closer  in  fellowship  through  the  teachings of Jesus Christ. Over the decades of the  new century that soon followed, COGIC grew  and prospered, with new congregations being  formed across the United States. Among the  many jurisdictions formed, was the jurisdiction  for the State of Michigan.  Established in 1914, the COGIC jurisdiction  for the State of Michigan was formed under  the leadership of Elder W.G. Johnson. Under  his leadership and the leadership of successors, the COGIC quickly expanded in Michigan, with several  jurisdictions being  formed  within the first decades of its founding. Over  its 100-year history,  the Canadian/Michigan  Jurisdiction of  the COGIC has grown  to  include 8 sub-jurisdictions within Michigan and  Ontario comprised of nearly 90 congregations  across  the region—including many  in Michigan’s 14th Congressional District.  In the Greater Detroit region, COGIC congregations not only serve as houses of worship where members of  the community can  create a deeper connection with  their  faith,  they bring together devoted community members in the tenants of service to our community. From food pantries to youth development  and education, COGIC congregations are engaging communities  in Greater Detroit,  the  State of Michigan and across North America  to answer the calls of our friends and neighbors in their time of need. So many of these  programs support  families  in  times of crisis  and afford  them  the opportunity  to confront  those crises and move forward to overcome  those obstacles.  Mr. Speaker, over the past 100 years, the  members of COGIC in Michigan have not only  grown deeper in their covenant to their faith,  but have channeled  their  faith  into strengthening lives, families and communities across  the State—much as  their counterparts have  done in others states across our nation. I congratulate  the Michigan/Ontario  Council  of  Bishops and  the members of COGIC congregations across the Canada/Michigan Jurisdiction  for achieving  this great milestone  in  their fellowship and look forward to their continued efforts  to strengthen  the communities  which they call home.

404,,113,-0.35,15,2014-09-19,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  proudly submit the Urban Agriculture Production Act.  Across America,  too many of our urban  neighborhoods are absent stores where community members can purchase fresh, healthy  foods. There are more than 23 million individuals residing in these so called ‘ ‘food desert’ ’  neighborhoods, where  there are no stores  within one mile in which they can buy healthy  food.  Without healthy options, people are forced  to eat unhealthy, processed,  junk  food, because that is all that is available and affordable. The Urban Agriculture Production Act is  a step to correct this unacceptable trend.  I am pleased to recognize and support the  growing resurgence of locally grown and produced product. I see it in my own community  at the Sustainable Local Foods and Frederick  Douglass Center Association Community Garden, of Toledo, Ohio.  Individuals, non-profits, and co-ops are stepping up and taking action to address the challenge of access to healthy food, by developing  local food sources and community gardens to  provide  fresh, affordable produce  throughout  underserved communities. Not only are  they  growing product  to provide  to communities  though,  they are engaging and encouraging  community  participation  all  throughout  the  process. They are teaching community members how to farm.  As the ancient proverb says, ‘ ‘give a man a  fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man  to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.’ ’ And  so goes my bill, the Urban Agriculture Production Act.  The measure will encourage economic development in underserved communities by furthering the mission of local farming. It provides  programmatic  funds  to educate people on  health and wellness, supports marketing and  development networks, and will inspire communities to create self sufficient food production systems to stimulate community development and healthy eating options.  All throughout our urban communities there  are an abundance of unused land and space  that are conveniently located to neighborhoods  that are ripe for agriculture development. We  must support and encourage the means to development these plots so they become local  sources of wholesome food options.  Communities  that  lack  access  to  fresh  produce are facing growing epidemics of obesity  related diseases. We must get serious  about the increased incidents of preventable  disease  in  these communities. Prevention  is  paramount, and encouraging a balanced diet  while also providing access to healthier foods  is an obvious solution.  Farmer’s Markets, greenhouses and other  community agriculture initiatives can help diversify American food production so we rely  less on imports and create American jobs that  cannot be outsourced. My bill will spur the development and expansion of community agriculture in nontraditional agricultural production  areas across this great nation.  Mr. Speaker, urban farming and food production is a viable solution to support healthier  dietary options and improve overall health of  urban  communities. The Urban Agriculture  Production Act  is  the appropriate means  to  further develop alternative, urban agricultural  production and to help meet all communities’  food production needs of the future.  f  HONORING INDIANA REGIONAL  MEDICAL CENTER  HON.

405,,113,0.375,15,2014-09-19,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the 100th anniversary of Indiana  Regional Medical Center in Indiana, Pennsylvania. It is a milestone in this wonderful community hospital’s long history of providing exceptional healthcare services to the people of  Indiana County and surrounding areas.  Resting  in  the heart of western Pennsylvania, Indiana offers the perfect blend of history, progress, industry, scenery, culture, and  charm. When Indiana Regional Medical Center  first welcomed  the public  in November of  1914, it was a 40-bed facility with 13 private  rooms. From the time of its opening, the hospital’s mission has been to serve the community with quality, progressive, compassionate  patient care.  Over the years, this nonprofit institution has  grown to become the county’s sole full-service  health care provider. Throughout its many renovations, expansions  in services and continued advancements  in knowledge and  technology, Indiana Regional Medical Center has  remained unchanged in its commitment to the  community. It truly lives by its mission to serve  the health care needs of every life it touches  with compassion,  respect and dignity. The  hospital and its people certainly have made a  difference in making Indiana County a better  place  to  live, and  they continue  to have a  positive impact on the region.  I wish  to  thank  Indiana Regional Medical  Center’s dedicated staff, Board of Directors  and CEO Stephen Wolfe for their commitment  to quality healthcare. I congratulate them and  the  residents of  Indiana County and  surrounding communities on this important anniversary  for  their  local hospital.  I’m proud of  having such an outstanding facility in the 9th  District, and wish  Indiana Regional Medical  Center continued success in the next one hundred years and beyond.

406,,113,-0.385,22,2014-09-19,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  Jerry Deal who  is  retiring after serving  for  eight years on  the Burlingame City Council,  the last four as Vice Mayor, and for 13 years  on the Planning Commission, three times as  the Chair. His work on the Planning Commission earned him the nickname ‘ ‘Father of Design Review.’ ’ Jerry’s commitment to his beloved home community and public service has  benefitted the city of Burlingame and the quality of life of its residents.  As an architect, Jerry has used his training  and skills to inform many of his public policy  decisions. He was instrumental in the transformation of Burlingame Avenue and the building of the new Safeway, roof garden, pocket  park and retail and office spaces. As a business owner himself and a member of the Burlingame Economic Development Committee,  Jerry helped  foster a business-friendly environment. His pragmatism and humor, essential  to any good architect, have allowed him to be  effective  in  leading  the public and his colleagues.  Due in part to Jerry’s leadership, the library  was saved and Burlingame still maintains its  own police department. Jerry is also a tireless  advocate  for  children, promoting and protecting our schools and developing additional  recreational fields.  Jerry’s passion for community service began  with a seat on the Board of Directors of the  San Francisco Repertory Company, and as a  board member of the free Shakespeare in the  Park  festival. During his  time on  the Burlingame City Council he was involved in a long  list of issues and committees. In addition to  the already-mentioned Economic Development  Committee, Jerry served as a liaison between  the city and the Burlingame Chamber of Commerce. He has one of the better attendance  records at Chamber functions, and he listened  closely when  the Chamber made  important  suggestions  to  improve  the quality of  life  in  Burlingame. He was also a member of  the  Fire Advanced Life Support (ALS) Joint Powers Authority, a public—private partnership  launched in 1977 to provide improved emergency medical care to Burlingame citizens.  It isn’t just the citizens of Burlingame who  trust Jerry Deal to be fair and insightful. Jerry  was elected by San Mateo County’s 20 mayors to serve on the SamTrans Board of Directors overseeing  fixed-route and para-transit  bus services in San Mateo County. The county’s mayors also elected him to serve as Vice  Chair of the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers  Board which owns and operates Caltrain. The  Caltrain Board of Directors appointed Jerry as  its representative on the Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA), the body responsible for  overseeing the new Transbay Transit Center,  a rail extension for Caltrain and High-Speed  Rail and adjacent  transit-oriented developments  in downtown San Francisco. As you  can surmise from this list, Jerry is smart, self-  effacing, and  is passionate about  improving  the quality of life for all Bay Area residents directly impacted by city planning, housing and  transportation.  Jerry’s expertise, enthusiasm and effectiveness have left an indelible mark on the city of  Burlingame which he has called home for over  35 years. He and his wife JoAnn Johnson-  Deal, a teacher at Franklin Elementary School,  have five children and ten grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor Jerry Deal, the  Vice Mayor of Burlingame, a proud resident  and a dear friend, for over two decades of outstanding public service. He will be leaving us  shortly to move to Oregon, but his legacy will  live on in the beauty of Burlingame, in its architecture, in its family-focused activities and  lifestyle, and in the example of fairness that  Jerry exhibited during his time in public office.  We will say  farewell  to a  friend of decades  who has etched his mark on decades yet to  come.  f  HONORING JON C. FOSTER  HON.

Hermine is  part of ‘ ‘America ’s Greatest Generation,’ ’ and  this amazing milestone deserves  to be honored.  Hermine was born on August 4, 1914,  in  Hammond,  Indiana. During World War  II,  Hermine  joined  the U.S. Army and served  three years in the Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service). She  worked as a storekeeper in a hangar.  In 1945, Hermine married Leonard Reiring,  and they built their lives together in California.  They lived in San Diego and Burbank before  settling in Madera in 1964. Hermine and Leonard raised three children together, and today,  Hermine has eight grandchildren and 16 great-  grandchildren. Each day, Hermine ’s family has  the pleasure of learning from a woman who  has many special memories and  life experiences to share.  The City of Madera has benefitted greatly  from Hermine’s efforts and service to the community. In addition to working at the Madera  County Administrator ’s office, Hermine was  also a member of the Women ’s Improvement  Group, the Historical Society, and she volunteered as a docent for the county library. Staying active  in  the community  is  important  to  Hermine as she still  loves  to participate  in  bake sales and volunteer at her church.  Hermine’s generation set an example for the  coming together and establishing of our country in the 20th century. We have all been very  fortunate  to  live and build  from  the  investments and many sacrifices made by Hermine  and others from her generation.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to honor Hermine Reiring as she  celebrates this very exciting time in her life.  Her service to the Madera community and the  entire nation deserves to be commended.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF MARY E.  SINOPOLI  HON.

408,,113,0.221,43,2014-09-19,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Wilderness Act.  President Johnson signed  the Wilderness  Act in 1964 to permanently protect some of  America’s most beautiful wild places. The Act  has so far protected 757 wilderness areas, accounting for a total of 109 million acres.  The National Wilderness Preservation System—comprised of four federal agencies—was  established  to monitor  and  protect  these  untrammeled spaces. In Pennsylvania alone,  the NWPS has designated more  than 9,000  acres of wilderness,  including  the Allegheny  Islands and  the Hickory Creek wilderness  areas. These protected lands are void of construction,  roads and permanent  structures.  Wilderness lands are also void of any logging  and mining activities.  The NWPS not only protects  the resident  wildlife and natural ecosystems, but  it also  supports outdoor recreation activities and jobs.  Wilderness areas provide tremendous opportunities for hiking, camping and fishing. Yet we  are just visitors to these lands.  Mr. Speaker,  the Wilderness Act and  the  National Wilderness  Preservation  System  have helped  to protect our nation’s  last remaining unspoiled  lands and waters  for  the  past 50 years. I celebrate the Wilderness Act  and  look  forward  to  the excellent work  the  NWPS will continue  to do  in  the years  to  come.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  OAKLAND  COUNTY COMMISSIONER MATTIE  MCKINNEY HATCHETT FOR HER  DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE  PONTIAC COMMUNITY  HON.

409,,113,-0.416,50,2014-09-19,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Speaker, this year marks the  40th anniversary of  the  founding of Project  Children.  Since its founding in 1974, Project Children  has brought over 22,000 children  from both  Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland to America, uniting them with over  15,000 American host families for a summer  of peace and a lifetime of friendship. Summer  vacation in the United States has given these  children a break from the conflict and politics  of their country and a chance to experience  what many might take for granted during their  youth.  Denis Mulcahy and his brother Pat founded  the program together after they immigrated to  New York. A retired member of the New York  City Police Bomb Squad, Denis  is  truly  the  heart and soul of Project Children. His extraordinary dedication to peace and understanding  has made a tangible difference in the lives of  many in the U.S. and in Northern Ireland, and  to the peace process on the island.  A nonprofit all-volunteer organization,  the  program has  fostered countless  friendships  among communities  in Northern  Ireland,  Ireland, and America. Project Children along with  host families, coordinators, fundraising volunteers, benefactors, and alumni here  in  the  United States have played a pivotal role in the  growth of this organization.  Project Children has had a tremendous impact on  the peace process along with U.S.  and Irish relations. This group is one of the organizations that laid the community-wide foundation for the Good Friday Agreement, while  continuing  to serve as an example of  the  power of peace and reconciliation efforts at  the grassroots level—as well as the power of  individual  leadership  exemplified  by Denis  Mulcahy.  During my time as a member of Congressional Friends of Ireland Caucus, I have been  fortunate enough to be a part of many significant achievements in implementing peace in  Northern Ireland. I have seen firsthand what  organizations like Project Children have done  to offer hope and a better life for future generations. Without  this organization ’s commitment  along with  the  leadership  of Denis  Mulcahy, many young men and women from  Northern Ireland would not have the quality of  life they have today. Congratulations to both  Project Children and Denis Mulcahy on  this  momentous occasion.  f  CALIFORNIA 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT’S WOMEN OF THE YEAR  HON.

410,,113,-0.313,50,2014-09-19,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Mr. Speaker, the success  of our districts and the livelihood and future of  our communities relies heavily on the devotion  and service of those who go above the call of  duty, willing to devote their time and energy to  improving  society and  the  lives of people  around  them. This  fall,  through my 2014  Women of the Year awards, I have made an  effort to recognize, honor, and celebrate the  vital contributions of outstanding women in my  district.  Each of these women exemplifies sacrifice  and devotion. These civic leaders have helped  improve  their communities  in various ways,  and  are  compelling  advocates  for  critical  issues  including education,  flood protection,  environmental stewardship, and the arts. They  promote healthy communities, organize events  to promote world peace, and raise community  awareness  to  end  bullying. They  are  all  women  in California’s Third Congressional  District who have succeeded in bettering their  communities and  the  lives of  those around  them—living proof that when women succeed,  America succeeds.  Throughout  our  history,  America’s  foremothers have made great strides in securing  their equal  rights and equal  treatment  under the law. And while we have come so  far, there is still work to be done. We stand on  the shoulders of giants, but  that does not  mean we  should  cease  to  reach  further.  Thanks to these women and others like them,  I see our communities reaching further every  day.  Pat Ash (City Councilwoman and preservationist; Williams—Colusa County): Pat Ash,  the current mayor of Williams, has served as  a Williams City Council Member for many  years.

Through her membership on the city council and in CBW, Pat has played a crucial role  in beautifying vacant areas, including a parcel that was annexed into the town square  park. An outstanding example of Pat’s leadership and generous spirit is her preservation  of the aging Masonic Hall in town. Pat recently purchased it herself, thus maintaining  its historic value to the city and county.  Under Pat’s sustaining leadership CBW recently arranged for a mural to be painted on  the Masonic Hall, adding local interest and a  festive atmosphere to this popular park. On  June 7th, the mayor hosted a mural dedication ceremony that featured Governor Jerry  Brown and relatives of W.H. Williams, founder of the town. Through her creativity and  tenacity, Pat has been instrumental in organizing Williams’ Summer Concerts  in the  Park series featuring local musicians. The  venue offers the community a place to mingle and for nonprofit groups to hold fundraisers. In further testimony to Pat’s enduring appreciation for her city, she has written  a book illustrating the influence of Western  Europeans settling in Williams. Pat’s fellow  citizens appreciate her efforts to preserve  and showcase the city’s history.  Marci Coglianese (Municipal law attorney,  former city official, land use advocate; Rio  Vista—Solano County): Marci Coglianese,  past mayor and council member for the City  of Rio Vista, has practiced municipal and environmental law for more than 25 years. Her  achievements  in  furthering good  land use  planning, and environmental and risk management practices for the Delta are extraordinary. Marci  represented  the League of  California Cities on the State Floodplain  Management Task Force and on the public  advisory committee to update the California  Water Plan. She has been instrumental in  protecting  Solano  County  farmland  and  served as co-chair of the Delta Levees and  Habitat Subcommittee of the Bay Delta Public Advisory Committee. She is an active  member of the Rio Vista Army Base Steering  Committee.  Marci has always been a vocal and staunch  advocate for fairness and for racial and gender equality in local government. After assuming office she was notable for her openness in listening and responding to the needs  of her constituents of every political stripe  and economic status. A person of the highest  integrity and forthrightness, Marci sets an  exemplary standard for all in political office,  from the smallest village to the national  capitol. Despite serious illness and family  trauma, she has maintained a manner of  openness, grace, and humor toward even her  most bitter opponents. Marci Coglianese is  greatly loved and admired by all who know  her.  Deborah Eernisse (Fitness instructor, mentor, and volunteer; Davis—Yolo County):  Deborah’s outstanding trait is her ability to  build community with diverse groups of all  ages, particularly around fitness and health.  In Davis she has built a supportive community of older adults who remain active and  engaged in their own health and happiness.

It is about energy  independence. It is about a working relationship with our friends. It is about  lessening our dependence upon giving  people  in other countries  in  foreign  lands our money that they don’t always use  in our best  interest.

412,Senate,113,-0.123,57,2014-11-13,Ms. HEITKAMP.," Thank you, Mr.  President. I want to thank my very  good friend MARYLANDRIEU for everything she has done for our country, for  her State, for her tenacity, and for her  willingness to shepherd this through at  a very critical time.  We  talked yesterday on  the  floor  about how important it is to send the  right messages to the American public.  A lot of people will say, well, they pick  this agenda or this agenda. They just  want us to start working together. And  they want us to turn on the television  and watch C–SPAN and say, there they  are  in  the  sandbox  again,  fighting  about things that don’t matter to the  American public. You know, picking  fights with each other, bad-mouthing  each other, as opposed to working together.  It is a little tough right now, because  I think that if we are going to set the  tone today, yesterday, today and in the  days that follow during this lameduck,  the tone that will establish the relationships and the courtesies we are  going to have going forward in the next  Congress, we need to make sure we are  communicating when the tone goes a  little wrong.  To me, I have fought this issue. I  have been  in  favor of the Keystone  Pipeline ever  since  I  looked, and  I  somewhat famously likened it to caring about a reality TV show that has  nothing to do with people’s lives, and  wondering why we care so much about  Keystone, because  it doesn’t have a  whole lot to do with carbon. It doesn’t.  Keystone Pipeline is about transportation of oil. That oil is going to get  transported,  it  is going to get produced, and it is going to move. It is  going to move on rail or it is going to  move on pipe someplace. When you  look at all the studies that have been  done, the environmental studies, you  turn it around 100 different ways, you  come to the same conclusion, that the  Keystone Pipeline makes an incredible  amount of sense.  It is a job-ready project, shovel-ready  project, with good trade union  jobs.  That is something you don’t see every  day in America. New things coming—it  will help us transport 100,000 barrels of  oil. That is less than 10 percent of what  we produce every day but it will take,  as my senior Senator said, a lot of unit  trains off the rails so we can move  grain, and it will be state of the art in  terms of the quality of the pipeline. I  have seen the pipeline. I have seen the  oil sands. I have been there. We are  headed  for North American  energy  independence if we don’t get in our own  way.  Keystone has  taken a  role  larger  than life, and it has been this hot button issue that doesn’t belong in this debate. It should have been approved, in  my  opinion,  years  ago,  absolutely  years ago. It has taken us longer to  analyze Keystone  than what  it has  taken us to beat Hitler—by far, almost  50 percent more time spent analyzing  the Keystone Pipeline.

413,Senate,113,-0.119,64,2014-11-13,Mr. DONNELLY.,"  Mr.  President,  today I wish to recognize and honor the  extraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Indianapolis, IN Metropolitan  Police Officer Perry Renn. Dedicated,  loyal, and above all compassionate to  those in need, Officer Renn served with  the  Indianapolis Metropolitan Police  Department, IMPD, for 21 years.  On Saturday, July 5, 2014, Officer  Renn responded to a report of shots  fired on the northeast side of Indianapolis, the district where he was a patrolman throughout his career with IMPD.  When Officer Renn arrived, he joined  another IMPD officer already on the  scene, and they approached a group of  individuals standing in a nearby alley.  As they approached the group, one of  the individuals brandished a gun and  began shooting at the officers. Despite  the fact that he was wearing a protective vest, Officer Renn was struck by  the gunfire. After additional officers  arrived and detained the shooter, Officer Renn was transported to Eskenazi  Hospital in critical condition. Sadly,  despite the best efforts of his fellow officers, EMTs, and medical personnel,  Officer Renn,  51,  succumbed  to his  wounds.  A native  of  Indianapolis,  IN  and  raised  in Phoenix, AZ, Officer Renn  joined the U.S. Army after graduating  from high school. For the majority of  his 10-year enlistment, Perry was stationed in Fort Bragg, NC with the 82nd  Airborne Division as a paratrooper and  jumpmaster, completing more than 100  jumps. He achieved the rank of staff  sergeant and was awarded achievement  and commendation medals during his  tenure. Perry was stationed in Korea  for 2 tours, spent 18 months in New  York City as a recruiter, and served in  Operation Urgent Fury, the military  conflict in Grenada in 1983.  Officer Renn was awarded two Medals  of Bravery  during  his  career with  IMPD, in the years 1999 and 2003. Prior  to becoming a police officer, he worked  at the Marion County Sherriff Communications Department as a dispatcher  and control operator. In 2011, Officer  Renn received a letter of commendation for his efforts to assist individuals  after a stage collapse at the Indiana  State Fair injured 58 and killed 9 people. Always seeking to help those in  need, Officer Renn chose to serve in a  district on the northeast side of Indianapolis because he knew it was an area  of the city where many citizens would  need help.  Officer Renn is survived and deeply  missed by his wife of 25 years, Lynn  Sappenfield-Renn;  mother  Phyllis  Renn; father David Renn (Tina); sister  Sherri Jones (Michael); five nieces; two  nephews; four great nieces; four great  nephews; numerous aunts, uncles and  cousins; the Indianapolis Metropolitan  Police Department family; and his beloved pets.  Officer Renn loved his work, and he  gave his life to serve and protect the  citizens of Indianapolis. Although he  would have never thought of himself as  a hero, Officer Renn demonstrated his  character daily by conducting himself  with  courage,  bravery,  compassion,  honor, and integrity. Thus, he was a  true American hero—in his everyday  life as a police officer, husband, and  community member—and in his final  call to duty. Let us always remember  and emulate the shining example this  stalwart, modest yet brave man set for  us, and honor him for his selfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens.  May God welcome him home and give  comfort to his family and friends.  f  REMEMBERING MASTER  SERGEANT JOSEPH B. SMRT  ",2014
414,,113,-0.433,85,2014-11-13,Mr. HUFFMAN.," Mr. Speaker, we rise today  in memory of Frank Alexander Grant III, who  passed away on September 16, 2014 in his  Altadena home following a battle with cancer.  A natural  leader and mentor  to others both  professionally and privately, Mr. Grant was a  model of achievement and a positive  force  within the local community.  Frank Alexander Grant III was born in Eureka, CA on December 7, 1942, and grew up on  the Yurok  Indian Reservation, where he attended grammar school and high school. After  graduating as high school valedictorian, Mr.  Grant went on to receive a B.S. and M.S. in  civil and sanitary engineering  from Stanford  University. On graduation day  in 1966, he  married Carole Susan Magnus. Mr. Grant  served his country in the U.S. Army Medical  Service Corps stateside for two years before  earning a Ph.D. in engineering at University of  California Berkeley in 1972.  Frank Grant worked  for over 30 years at  MWH Global,  an  international  engineering  firm, managing large projects throughout California and abroad. Following a very successful  career at MWH Global, Mr. Grant retired as  the company’s Senior Vice President. He built  his own cabin along  the Klamath River and  was an active member in the Yurok community. Mr. Grant provided economic development advice to the tribe in addition to his involvement  in other community organizations  and pursuits in both Northern California and  the Pasadena area.  Mr. Speaker, Frank Alexander Grant  III  leaves behind a  legacy of professional and  personal achievement and community engagement  that will not soon be  forgotten.  It  is  therefore appropriate  that we pay  tribute  to  him  today and express our deepest condolences to his wife Carole; sons Frank IV and  Philip; grandchildren Frank V, Andrew, Eva  and Naomi; brothers Zane Grant Sr. and  James Jackson Jr.; and step-mother Elinor  Grant.  f  RECOGNIZING BEN NICHOLSON  HON.

415,,113,0.332,85,2014-11-13,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  in  recognition of Ben Nicholson,  who left the Appropriations Committee staff in  October after more  than 12 years of distinguished service. Ben started his career serving our Nation  in 1992 when he  joined  the  U.S. Coast Guard, serving for 10 years before  joining the Appropriations Committee staff in  2002. Since that time, Ben has worked on various subcommittees, and for several chairmen,  ultimately becoming the Clerk and Staff Director of the Homeland Security Subcommittee in  2011.  As the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have had the honor and pleasure of  working closely with Ben. He is professional,  he is reliable, he is dedicated, and he gets the  job done,  regardless of  the circumstances.  Ben is a born leader and a Patriot. He holds  himself accountable to a code of the highest  standards. He efficiently manages his staff,  not by micromanaging but by setting an example and empowering them to make informed  recommendations. He  is affable,  thoughtful,  determined  to make a difference, and calm  under pressure.  As we all know, congressional staff work  long hours, and often sacrifice weekends and  holidays in order to keep this esteemed institution  running. This  inevitably  takes a  toll on  personal commitments, and nothing means  more  to Ben  than his supportive and  loving  family. In his new employment, Ben will hopefully have more time to spend with his lovely  wife, Anna, and their son, Tim. I have said before, and I will say again, the Appropriations  Committee has the best staff on Capitol Hill.  And Ben Nicholson  is  the epitome of  that  statement.  Congress,  the House,  the Appropriations  Committee, and I will surely miss Ben’s contributions and leadership; but we thank him for  his service and dedication and we wish him  well now and in the future.

MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 13, 2014  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York.  Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the bipartisan Nazi Social Security Benefits Termination  Act of 2014 along with my colleagues Representatives  JASON CHAFFETZ,  LEONARD  LANCE,  STEVE COHEN,  JAMES MCGOVERN,  KATHYCASTOR, PETERKING, HANK JOHNSON,  DAVIDCICILLINE, KEITHELLISON, PATRICKMURPHY, STEVE ISRAEL, DEREKKILMER, and JACKIE  SPEIER.  I commend Sens. BOBCASEY and  CHARLESSCHUMER for introducing the Senate  companion.  After the conclusion of World War II, thousands of people who participated in Nazi persecution  fled  to  the United States and  lied  about their pasts to gain U.S. citizenship. The  Department of Justice has successfully identified and deported hundreds of these individuals over more  than  three decades. There  were, however, individuals who left the country  of  their own accord before being  issued an  order of  removal, which would have  terminated all federal benefits, including Social Security. Without  this order, eligibility  for  these  benefits remained intact and these individuals  collected millions of dollars in federal benefit  checks.  The Nazi Social Security Benefits Termination Act of 2014 would require the U.S. Attorney General  to notify  the Social Security  Commissioner to terminate benefits for any individual who has  renounced  citizenship or  been denaturalized on the grounds of participation in Nazi persecution. In the event that  the Department of Justice identifies Nazi war  criminals still residing in the U.S., it may initiate  its denaturalization process as normal,  and this rule change would allow benefits termination at  the end of  that process. The  measure also  requires an annual  report  to  Congress from the Department of Justice on  the number of  individuals  it has determined  are disqualified  for Social Security benefits  under this new legislation as well as the number of active investigations against Nazi war  criminals it continues to pursue.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation  that would  finally put an end  to  this  grave misuse of federal dollars. After decades  of paying out benefits to Nazi criminals who  slipped through our justice system, it is past  time to correct this injustice.  f  HONORING THE UNITY COUNCIL  HON. BARBARA LEE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 13, 2014  ",2014
417,,113,-0.686,92,2014-11-13,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the Unity Council’s 50th Anniversary. For five decades, the Unity Council  has continued to enrich our community’s quality of life by helping families build wealth and  assets  through sustainable economic, social  and neighborhood development programs.  In 1964, what started as a political action  group soon evolved into a social services assistance program  to aid Latinos  in Oakland,  California’s Fruitvale district. In their new capacity,  the Unity Council created Oakland ’s  first Spanish-speaking employment office and  worked with Oakland city officials to create the  first Latino library, now known as the Cesar E.  Chavez Branch Public Library. By 1967, the  organization had become  incorporated as a  nonprofit organization and service agency. In  the years that followed, the Unity Council became a powerful catalyst for pervasive social  change.  During the 1970s, the Unity Council created  a business advisory committee composed of  Clorox,  Pacific  Bell,  PG&E,  Kaiser  Permanente  and  Safeway;  formed  the  Fruitvale Community Development District; initiated a small Latino business loan and assistance center; and built Las Casitas,  the  first  ever Latino-built housing development in Oakland.  The 1980s brought challenging times for the  Unity Council, which nearly resulted in the organization’s demise. Fortunately, broad-based  community support, strategic business partnerships, and a drastic reorganization allowed the  Unity Council  to  rebuild  its  reputation and  once again establish itself as the voice of the  Fruitvale district and of Latinos in Oakland.  Starting in the early 1990s, the Unity Council expanded its Head Start Program from 18  children  to 117, and offered early childhood  development  services,  health  and  nutrition  education, advocacy, and social services. Currently, the Head Start Program and the more  recent addition, Early Head Start Program,  serve a total of 608 low-income families.  In 1995, the Unity Council began its Fac¸ade  Improvement Program, designed  to provide  business and property owners matching grants  of up to $10,000 to fund rehabilitation projects.  By 2005,  the Fac¸ade  Improvement Program  had completed 120 projects and  leveraged  $220,000 of grant dollars into millions of dollars  in contributions  from stakeholders. That  same year, the Unity Council received funding  to launch the Fruitvale Public Market, a 7,000  square  foot business  incubator  space designed to promote the local economy and create high quality and sustainable jobs for neighborhood residents. As a result, the Fruitvale  commercial district went from 30–40 percent  vacancy to less than 1 percent vacancy, and  became the second largest revenue producing  commercial area in the city of Oakland.  One of  the Unity Council’s biggest milestones is the Fruitvale Transit Village. The nationally  recognized Fruitvale Transit Village  opened in 2003 with 47 housing units as well  as offices for several major community organizations. Earlier this year, the Unity Council received state funding that will allow the addition  of 275 affordable and market-rate rental units  to the Fruitvale area. After 50 years, the Unity  Council remains  the most relevant voice  for  the Latino community in the East Bay.  Therefore, on behalf of the residents of California’s 13th Congressional District, I thank the  Unity Council  for  the countless contributions  and never-ending commitment to our communities.  I wish  the Unity Council another  fifty  years of continued success.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  INTER-  CHURCH COUNCIL OF GREATER  NEW BEDFORD  HON. WILLIAM R.

This year, First Church of Newport News (Baptist) in Newport News, Virginia  is celebrating its sesquicentennial, and I would  like to take a moment to reflect on the history  of  this esteemed  institution and  its contributions to the greater Newport News community.  First Church of Newport News  (Baptist)  holds the distinction of being the first form of  organized religion  located within  the original  city limits of Newport News. In fact, it predates  the city by 32 years, having been originally organized in 1864 as First Baptist Church by the  Reverend Thomas Poole of  Isle of Wight  County. The small wood  framed church  located under what  is now  the 28th Street  Bridge was a spiritual home for many slaves,  freed  by  the  Emancipation  Proclamation,  whose only exposure to Christianity had come  from their previous masters.  Under Reverends Carr and Cooley,  the  church moved its location to 23rd Street and  Jefferson Avenue  and  continued  to  grow.  Under Reverend William H. Dixon  in 1897,  planning and construction began on the new  church building that would house the church  for most of the 20th century. The impressive  structure would include a steeple that was believed to be the highest in Newport News and  was a landmark on the city skyline for decades.  A church is more than its building, and First  Baptist’s ministry in Newport News continued  to expand under Reverends Harris, Taylor and  VerDate Sep 11 2014  06:39 Nov 14, 2014 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A13NO8.055 E13NOPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s ‘         ",2014
420,House,113,-0.312,3,2014-11-19,Mr. VELA.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  bring attention to the massacre of 43  students in Mexico.  Edmund Burke said:  All that is necessary for the triumph of  evil is that good men do nothing.  On September 26, students  from a  teacher training college visited Iguala,  Mexico, to participate in a protest. According to media reports, the students  were arrested by police  forces and  handed over to a criminal gang. Their  burned bodies have  reportedly been  found discarded in a river.  As The Washington Post  yesterday:  reported  The demand to find the students and punish those responsible for their disappearance  has broadened into a more diverse fury about  corrupt  politicians  and  their  drug-trafficking cronies.  Mexican prosecutors have  formally  charged former Iguala Mayor Jose Luis  Abarca in the disappearance of the students. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated  incident.  In  the  last  several  months, three constituent families of  mine have been touched by murder in  northern Mexico.  I again call on the United States  State Department to ensure that the  Mexican Government thoroughly investigates these atrocities and that those  responsible be brought to justice and  prosecuted to the fullest extent of the  law.  The crises of human smuggling, drug  smuggling, and  illegal migration do  not begin or end at the border. Resolving these matters requires that we address issues of economic development  and cartel violence in Mexico and that  we address the demand for narcotics in  the United States, along with eliminating the presence of cartels in an estimated 1,000 U.S. cities.  The leaders of the State Department  in Washington, D.C., need to understand that this  is one of the most  pressing  foreign  policy  issues  confronting our Nation. Otherwise, evil  will indeed triumph.  f  INCREASE OF VIOLENT ATTACKS  IN ISRAEL  ",2014

This  legislation approves an amendment, as the chairman said, to the  United States-United Kingdom Mutual  Defense Agreement.  I want to begin by thanking Chairman EDROYCE for his bipartisan leadership on this legislation, which I am  proud to cosponsor.  b1530  Since 1958, the U.S.-U.K. Mutual Defense Agreement has underpinned cooperation between our two countries  on defense-related nuclear technology.  The U.K.  is  the only country with  which we share this sensitive nuclear  technology. It reflects the special relationship that binds our countries together.  Every 10 years, this agreement has  been extended to stay up to date with  new technologies and build new areas  of cooperation. Now, normally, these  extensions go into effect automatically  60 legislative days after the updated  agreement  is submitted to Congress.  However, this agreement will lapse on  December 31, before we reach that 60-  day mark. If that were to happen, the  revised agreement would have to be resubmitted in the next Congress, the 60-  day clock would reset, and, most importantly, there would be no legal authority to continue defense-related nuclear work with the U.K. for some period of time.  What would that mean?  First, the regular scheduled transfer  of nuclear material between the U.S.  and the U.K. would grind to a halt.  Secondly,  ongoing work  on  submarine  propulsion would  be  interrupted, which would affect the deployment of our ally’s nuclear deterrent.  Thirdly, exchange of sensitive information that benefits both of our nations would be delayed, including information related to threats from other  countries.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this  agreement to lapse. Passing this bill  will protect these critically important  defense programs with one of our closest allies.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important bill. I just want to reiterate  the importance of passing this bipartisan, noncontroversial  legislation to  ensure that there is no lapse in the  U.S.-U.K. Mutual Defense Agreement.

When I started on Ways and Means, I  just came quickly to appreciate his  willingness to share his vast wealth of  knowledge on  trade  issues, big and  small. Even though he was no longer  an elected official, I was always struck  by Bill’s  just endless willingness to  give of himself, of finding ways to advance the cause of free trade and economic freedom throughout the world.  I think it is important to note that  historically in Congress, trade has always been a bipartisan issue, Republicans  and Democrats working  together;  and  throughout  his  career,  Bill’s  constructive work  across  the  aisle exemplified the best of this ideal.  Everyone knew he was open to new  ideas, was a straight shooter, respected  others, and worked hard to get people  to come and arrive at a consensus.  Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, Bill was  elected to do a job, and he just wanted  to get things done. And, boy, did he get  things done in the trade world. From  working on GATT, the Uruguay Round,  normal trading relations with China,  NAFTA, and helping set the foundation  for the World Trade Organization, Bill  was at the center of the trade world as  a respected Member of Congress and as  a thought leader on international trade  when he retired from public life.  The truth is Bill Frenzel believed in  economic freedom. He believed in our  right to buy, sell, and compete around  the world with as little government interference as possible. He believed families should have choices, but no government anywhere should decide what  is on that grocery shelf and what price  you paid for it. That was your choice.  That was your economic freedom.  He knew  that while America was  free, we would see so many ‘‘America  need  not  apply’’  signs  around  the  world; and he knew if we tore them  down and gave our American businesses  and workers—our Minnesota  businesses and workers—a chance to  compete,  in  fact, we would not  just  grow customers around the world, we  would grow jobs here at home. So his  leadership on trade, his fingerprints on  all things trade can be found not only  here in the United States but in foreign  capitals around the world where his  counsel was sought by many and he  was respected by all.  Mr. Speaker, Bill’s contributions to  our Nation and to this body will always  be remembered, and he leaves a towering trade legacy on which we can all  build economic prosperity for generations to come. I hope his family understands how special he is that so many  of us who you may not have known before, we all consider ourselves Bill’s  fans and friends.  ",2014
424,Senate,113,-0.266,108,2014-11-19,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased to  introduce, along with  Senator PORTMAN, the Combat Human  Trafficking Act of 2014.  Human trafficking is estimated to be  a $32 billion criminal enterprise, making it the second largest criminal industry in the world, behind the drug  trade. Many steps need to be taken to  combat this problem. But we cannot  escape this simple truth: without demand  for the services performed by  trafficking victims, the problem would  not exist.  The bill we are  introducing today  would reduce the demand for human  trafficking, particularly the commercial sexual exploitation of children, by  holding buyers accountable and making it easier for law enforcement to investigate and prosecute all persons who  participate in sex trafficking.  Sex trafficking is not a victimless  crime. In the United States, the average age that a person is first trafficked  is between 12 and 14. Many of these  children continue to be exploited into  adulthood. A study of women and girls  involved in street prostitution in my  hometown of San Francisco found that  82  percent had  been physically  assaulted,  83 percent were  threatened  with a weapon, and 68 percent were  raped. The overwhelming majority of  sex trafficking victims are American  citizens—83 percent by one estimate  from the Department of Justice.  I am encouraged that Federal, State,  and local law enforcement agencies are  taking steps to combat human trafficking. Between January and June of  this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered 168 trafficking victims and arrested 281 sex traffickers in  ‘‘Operation Cross Country.’’  I commend these efforts, but more  needs to be done to target the perpetrators who are fueling demand for trafficking crimes—the buyers of sex acts  from trafficking victims. Many buyers  of sex are  ‘‘hobbyists’’ who purchase  sex  repeatedly. Because  buyers  are  rarely arrested, much less prosecuted,  the demand for commercial sex continues unabated.  Without  buyers,  sex  trafficking  would cease to exist. As Luis CdeBaca,  the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for the  Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, noted, ‘‘[n]o girl or  woman would be a victim of sex trafficking if there were no profits to be  made from their exploitation.’’  The Combat Human Trafficking Act  of 2014 would address this problem, by  incentivizing federal and state law enforcement officers to target buyers and  providing new authorities to prosecute  all who engage in the crime of sex trafficking.  First, the bill would clarify that buyers of sex acts from trafficking victims  can be prosecuted under the  federal  commercial  sex  trafficking  statute.  This provision would codify the Eighth  Circuit’s decision in United States v.  Jungers, which held that this statute  encompasses  buyers,  in  addition  to  sellers. Despite this favorable ruling,  there is no guarantee that other courts  will follow this precedent.  Second, the bill would hold buyers  and sellers of child sex acts accountable  for their actions, even  if they  claim they were unaware of the age of  a minor victim. At times, it can be difficult for a prosecutor to prove that a  buyer was aware of the victim’s age.  Successful cases can require the child  victim  to  testify  to  this  fact,  subjecting  the  victim  to  re-traumatization. The bill would draw a clear  line: if you purchase sex from an underage child, you can be prosecuted. Period.  Third, the bill would grant  judges  greater flexibility to impose an appropriate term of supervised release on sex  traffickers. Current  law contains an  anomaly: a person convicted of violating the commercial sex trafficking  statute or attempting to violate the  statute may be subject to a  longer  term of supervised release than a person who is convicted of conspiring to  violate the statute. Conspiring to traffic underage children is as serious as  attempting to commit this crime and  should be punished the same.  Fourth, the bill would require the  Bureau of Justice Statistics to prepare  annual reports on the number of arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of  sex traffickers and buyers of sex from  trafficked victims in the state court  system. Very little data is available on  the prosecutions made under anti-trafficking laws. This provision would provide additional data and  encourage  state and  local governments  to  increase enforcement against sellers and  buyers of sex from trafficked victims.  Fifth,  the  Combat Human  Trafficking Act would ensure that training  programs for federal and state law enforcement officers include components  on effective methods  to  target and  prosecute the buyers of sex acts from  trafficked victims. This would equip  prosecutors with the tools they need to  target buyers, encouraging prosecution  of these perpetrators.  Sixth, the bill would authorize federal and state officials to seek a wiretap to investigate and prosecute any  human  trafficking-related  offense.  Under current law, a federal law enforcement officer may seek a wiretap  in an investigation under the commercial sex trafficking statute, but not  under a number of other statutes that  address human trafficking-related offenses, such as forced labor and involuntary  servitude. Similarly, a  state  law enforcement officer may seek a  wiretap to investigate a kidnapping offense, but not an offense for human  trafficking, child sexual exploitation,  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:59 Nov 20, 2014 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A19NO6.029 S19NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2014
425,,113,-0.381,122,2014-11-19,Mr. CARTWRIGHT.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise to honor the exceptional work of Fethullah  Gu¨len. Mr. Gu¨len has long stood as a pillar of  peace and humanity and as a model for opposition in the face of rising dictatorship.  A  respected member of  the Pennsylvania  community, Fethullah Gu¨len has worn many  hats throughout his life. A vocal leader of the  Turkish civic movement, Mr. Gu¨len has been  forced to live in a self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania for fear for his safety.  The  founder  of  the  ‘Gu¨len Movement,’  Fethullah Gu¨len has long been a voice of reason in a world of turmoil. Widely known as a  highly-respected  leader, he has encouraged  Turkish citizens to vote for those who are respectful  to democracy and  the  rule of  law,  rather than one party or another. He has consistently promoted a moderate blend of Islam  in a  time of growing radicalism and  is well  known  for his global network of educational  establishments, extending to over 140 countries. His views promote a tolerant Islam, emphasizing hard work and education, as well as  building  bridges  between  the Muslim  and  Western world and science and religion.  While the global community looks to Turkey  with both growing concern and enduring hope,  it is my honor to commend Fethullah Gu¨len for  his  tireless efforts  to promote  the  ideals of  peace, democracy, an educated electorate,  and the human rights of the Turkish people.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF EARL  SMITTCAMP  HON.

426,,113,-0.366,129,2014-11-19,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 85th Anniversary of the founding of the Daughters of Penelope, the leading  international women ’s organization dedicated  to promoting  the  ideals of ancient Greece.  Founded, November 16th 1929 in San Francisco, California  the Daughters of Penelope  was established  to  improve  the wellbeing of  women  through community service and volunteerism. Especially, I would like to honor the  Daughters of Penelope District 5 who  represent chapters in New Jersey for their tireless  efforts to improve the lives of women across  our great state.  Nationally, one example of the great work  done by  the Daughters of Penelope can be  found  in  the Penelope House, a shelter  for  battered women in Mobile, Alabama. The Penelope House  focuses on  the prevention of  domestic violence through education and public awareness. The Penelope House helps victims of intimate partner violence to gain social  and economic independence through shelter,  counseling, and advocacy.  Clearly,  the Daughters of Penelope deserves our  recognition and support as  they  continue  to expand  the opportunities, status  and well-being of women and  their  families  around  the  globe. Congratulations  to  the  Daughters of Penelope on  reaching such a  milestone and I look forward to continuing to  see the charitable efforts of such a dedicated  group of people.  f  RECOGNIZING THE FRESNO AREA  HISPANIC  FOUNDATION  FOR  BEING NAMED 2014 CHAMBER OF  THE YEAR  HON.

427,House,113,-0.428,34,2014-12-01,Mr. CARSON of Indiana.," I have to acknowledge my colleague, my  friend,  my brother, and leader, not only nationwide but internationally, but especially in Brooklyn, for his boldness, his  tenacity, Mr. Speaker, his  intestinal  fortitude, and his ability as a sitting  Member of Congress  to  still  speak  truth to power, Congressman JEFFRIES.  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express  my deepest condolences to the Brown  family, who lost their son far too soon.  As a parent, I can only imagine their  pain and grief, Mr. Speaker. No parent  should have to go through such an ordeal.  As a young African American man, I  can relate to the frustration being felt  on the streets of Ferguson and streets  across our country. The history of this  great Nation, Mr. Speaker, past and  present, is plagued with incidents of  bigotry and discrimination in our justice system. Racial injustice continues  to afflict our communities, and with  each incident like this one, old wounds  are reopened. The feelings felt in Ferguson are real and cannot and should  not be discounted.  Mr. Speaker, many right now  feel  abandoned by our justice system or unfairly singled out for suspicion. These  are very legitimate concerns that cannot be  ignored or overshadowed by  those who have turned to violence.  Now, as a former police officer, Mr.  Speaker, I want to say I do respect our  system of justice, but I also recognize  the shortcomings. We certainly have a  long way to go to guarantee our country’s children of color are protected  equally under  the  law  in every  instance, every neighborhood, and all  across this great Nation. Mr. Speaker,  no community should have to doubt  whether justice has prevailed when a  decision like this one has been handed  down.  We must not  let Michael Brown’s  death be in vain. That would be a disgrace. That would be a tragedy. Today,  our Nation is still struggling to heal.  But this cannot truly happen until we  honestly assess how justice is provided  across our country.  This process starts with peaceful protests, yes, but it ends with lasting reforms  that  protect  all  Americans  equally, Mr. Speaker. This will not be  easy or quick. But what is clear is that  this march toward a better, more equitable country must begin with a unified front.  Now through this tragedy we should  bring about lasting change. And so tonight on that note, I want to ask, Mr.  Speaker, all of my colleagues, my fellow Americans, to stand with the Congressional Black Caucus to make this  dream a reality.  ",2014
428,House,113,-0.438,34,2014-12-01,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank Mr. JEFFRIES for calling this  Special Order tonight.  Let me say to America, whenever a  law  enforcement  officer  shoots  and  kills an unarmed citizen in this great  country, America has a problem.  I  want us to be very careful that we  don’t become distracted and not address the issues.  I know that we in the Congressional  Black Caucus make sure that we don’t  get  involved  in motion, commotion,  and emotion and no results, and that is  what  this  is all about because  the  things that we are talking about is trying to bring about change, not just for  our young people today, but for generations yet unborn.  Let me just briefly state that I am  very pleased with what the President  did today. I think it is a step in the  right direction, the effort to get body  cameras, 50,000 of them, and to establish a task force.  Right after Ferguson happened,  I,  along with a hundred other  leaders,  wrote to the President, and we just  asked  for certain things, and I will  name them, and then I will yield back  because I know we have limited time.  We asked that DOJ develop a training  for  law enforcement officers  to  counteract racial bias, renewed focus  on  diversity  hiring  and  retention  among law enforcement professionals,  grants  to  support  engagement with  youth in the communities these officers serve, call for the demilitarization  and reduction of excessive weaponry  among community police departments,  call for DOJ oversight of law enforcement practices, and increased accountability through national standards for  investigation  into  cases of  inappropriate police behavior.  We in the Congressional Black Caucus will continue this  fight. To the  Brown  family, you have our condolences, but we know that you want to  make  sure  that  change  is  brought  about. We promise you that we are  going to do everything in our power to  make that happen.  ",2014

432,House,113,-0.611,19,2014-12-10,Ms. CLARKE of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, I want to thank the distinTON guished ranking member from the District of Columbia, Ms. HOLMESNORTON,  for yielding me this time, and I want to  thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  CHAFFETZ) for his leadership on these  very important matters of homeland  security.  I rise today in support of S. 1691, and  I am pleased that today we are considering legislation containing language I  introduced earlier this year to address  fundamental  cyber workforce  challenges at the Department of Homeland  Security. Important parts of my bipartisan bill, H.R. 3107, the Homeland Security  Cybersecurity  Boots-on-the-  Ground Act, are included in the measure we are considering today.  The cyber workforce  language  included in S. 1691 generally does two important things. First, it grants special  hiring authority to DHS to bring on  board topnotch cyber recruits. The Department desperately needs a more  flexible hiring process with incentives  to secure talent in today’s highly competitive cyber skills market. Second, it  requires the Secretary of the Department to assess its cyber workforce to  give Congress and the Office of Personnel Management a clearer picture  of the needs and challenges that DHS  faces  in carrying out  its  important  cyber mission in helping protect both  the dot-gov and dot-com arenas.  Importantly, the bill also directs the  Comptroller General to analyze, monitor, and report on the implementation  of DHS cybersecurity workforce measures.  Today, many of the Department’s top  cyber positions are filled by nonpermanent contractors, and DHS reports having difficulty competing with other executive branch agencies and the private sector for talent. In an effort to  address DHS’s cyber workforce challenges,  the Department  asked  the  Homeland  Security  Advisory  Committee to assemble a task  force on  cyber skills to provide recommendations on the best ways DHS can foster  the development of a national cybersecurity workforce and DHS can improve  its capability to recruit and retain cybersecurity talent.  The legislation I introduced sought  to address a number of the task force’s  key recommendations, as does this bill,  S. 1691. Cybersecurity is a complex mission for the Department and requires a  wide range of talent at all levels. Given  the urgent nature of the DHS’ recruitment efforts, it is essential the Department have at its disposal certain hiring  authorities and training procedures in  place.  Before I close, I would like to acknowledge that there is a lot of interest on our side of the aisle to make  progress on cybersecurity. Hopefully,  in the coming days, old jurisdictional  squabbles can be laid aside for the betterment of the country, as was done on  this bill, and again, the Oversight Committee can work with the Homeland  Security Committee  to  bring  forth  critical cybersecurity  legislation. We  need to put in place legislation to advance the ball with respect to protecting Federal civilian networks and  codifying DHS’ role.  b1245  ",2014

At the outset, let me  thank Chairman HENSARLING; Chairman NEUGEBAUER; Ranking Member  WATERS; my good friend, Mrs. MALONEY  from New York; and also Senator SCHUMER.  As the gentleman from Georgia said,  this has been a long and winding road,  but we have arrived at a compromise  which I believe is worthy of the support of all Members of this body, certainly those of us who strongly support  TRIA.  I have been a  supporter of TRIA  going back now 12, 13 years because  after 9/11, we realized it was absolutely  essential that TRIA be enacted for not  just New York to be rebuilt, but also so  that construction be allowed to go forward anywhere around  the  country  where there could be a risk of a terrorist  attack which  is why Major  League Baseball, the NFL, NASCAR,  and virtually every large university in  the country supports TRIA.  Now, Mr. Speaker, this  is a compromise, and it is a compromise where  all of us can find some fault with it,  but the bottom line is the essence of  TRIA has been sustained, and as we go  forward,  it  is  essential,  I believe—  strongly believe—that it be extended.  Let’s make  it clear there has not  been 1 cent of Federal money expended  on TRIA, but during the 13 years it has  been in effect, we have had billions of  dollars in construction, jobs, and revenues coming into the Federal Government. There is also not one Federal  employee  involved  in  administering  TRIA.  Mr. Speaker, we are where we are,  and 6 years to have that certitude is  absolutely essential. I respect those on  the other side who may have objections  to added provisions in the bill. I would  just say: let us keep our eyes on the  prize. For those of us who realize how  important TRIA is, we are never going  to get all we want. I happen to fully  support the provision for end users, but  even if I didn’t, I would still support  this bill because it is so essential.  Mr. Speaker, let me just also say in  closing that in addition to those I have  mentioned,  let me also acknowledge  Congressman  for  the  outstanding work that he has done on this  from the day he  first came to this  body.  In closing, I urge all Members, both  parties and both Houses, to support  this bill. It is a solid piece of legislation, and all of us can be proud for voting for it.  ",2014

Specifically, I support H.R.  634, the Business Risk Mitigation and  Price Stabilization Act that is included  as a part of this larger effort.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 634 provides critical regulatory relief to end users, the  market participants, businesses, and  job creators that use derivatives to  manage the risks they face in their  daily operations. For example, farmers  who need to hedge against the volatility of crop prices and manufacturers  who need to hedge against the rising  input costs of fuel use derivatives as a  part of their business plans.  During  the  consideration  of  the  Dodd-Frank Act, Congress clearly intended to exempt end users from some  of the most costly new regulations,  such as margin requirements. Margin  requirements needlessly divert working capital away from job-creating production and investment; however, the  CFTC has narrowly interpreted the law  which has negatively  impacted  end  users and their bottom line.

439,House,113,-0.512,103,2014-12-10,Mr. BECERRA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the legacy of public service for two  of our departing colleagues, Rep. GEORGE  MILLERand Rep. HENRYWAXMAN.  I have had the pleasure of serving alongside  Reps. MILLER and WAXMAN for over  twenty  years and it is with great respect and admiration that I say goodbye to them as colleagues,  friends and brothers-in-arms.  Since 1975, HENRYand GEORGEhave not  only served  the people of  their districts but  also our nation as champions of progressive  democratic ideals and stewards for the tenets  established by our founding fathers. Their legacy as effective  legislators  is virtually unmatched in the House of Representatives and  serves as a reminder  that constructive work  can lead to positive results in this legislative  body.  GEORGEand HENRY together claim responsibility for enacting some of the most important  legislation  that has come before Congress  over the last century. HENRY’s leadership on  the Clean Air Act, the Ryan White CARE Act,  the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program  or  the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act are only a few examples of  his passion and dedication. GEORGE’s leadership on the California Desert Protection Act,  the Davis-Bacon Act, and  the Fair Minimum  Wage Act were a result of his endless tenacity  and compassion.  I will always  remember how  instrumental  each of them was in securing the enactment  of the Affordable Care Act; what seven presidents could not accomplish over so many decades, President Obama principally accomplished because of  the  relentless efforts of  each of them.  Whether we  found ourselves  in  legislative  foxholes or at the vanguard of new ideas and  solutions, we were always in it together for the  American people. Their efforts were always  led by the desire to serve the best interests,  ideals and policies for our nation.  Mr. Speaker, many are called to public service, but  few  leave  legacies  that endure  the  way  that Rep. HENRYWAXMAN and Rep.  GEORGEMILLER’s legacies will endure. As they  move on to the next stage of their lives, with  their health intact and their heads held high,  let us be thankful that we had these champions of American democracy and patriots for  America’s freedom for forty years.

440,Senate,113,-0.194,159,2014-12-10,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I wanted to rise very briefly because I know  Senator CHAMBLISS is about to give his  farewell speech. I commend my dear  good friend the Senator from Georgia  for his service.  I am going to stay  through his speech, but I know there  will be others who will probably rise  afterwards  to give accolades, and  I  wanted to be first in line to salute him  for his service, his  friendship to so  many of us in this body, and my personal good wishes  for his  future.  I  know  there will be others  later;  I  thought for a change I would get a  word in first.  I yield the floor.  ",2014
441,Senate,113,0.782,166,2014-12-10,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I wish  to spend a few minutes to talk as in  morning business. I am not going to  offer a unanimous consent request, but  I am putting the majority leader on notice that I will do that before we leave  today or  tomorrow or whenever we  leave.  Yesterday the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator CARPER, and  I, thought we cleared all holds on the  Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act. I wish  to give a little history about that because for 2 years the House and Senate,  in conjunction with the committees,  have been working on this bill. The history goes back to a bill that was passed  with President Obama, myself, Senator  MCCAIN, and Senator CARPER, and it  was  the  Federal  Financial  Transparency  and  Accountability  Act,  usaspending.gov. It was the first start  towards transparency in terms of how  and where we spend our money.  Quite  frankly, as we got that bill  through Congress, with we heard the  same thing  from OMB that Senator  REID is representing today. President  Bush and his OMB Director didn’t want  that bill. They didn’t think the American people ought to know where their  spending was going. They didn’t think  the American taxpayer ought to have  the right to hold us accountable to  know where we spent the money, on  which programs, and how.  Interestingly, under Republican leadership, we passed that bill against the  wishes of the OMB Director of the Bush  administration, and that bill became  law. The President has touted that bill  as the first in a long line of transparency which his administration has  embraced—the idea that the American  people  ought  to know where  their  money is being spent.  Since that time, we passed the DATA  Act, which will move us towards better  quality  in terms of usaspending.gov,  and then we have the Taxpayers Right-  To-Know Act, which the majority leader objected to yesterday.  Here  is what the Taxpayers-Right-  To-Know Act says. It says the taxpayer  has the right to know how many programs we have  in each department,  how much spending is going on in each  program, and where the money is being  spent.  It  is pretty simple, straightforward stuff that we ought to know  about our government.  The question that I am asking is,  Why would anybody in this body object  to us knowing where our money  is  being spent? Why would anybody  in  this body object to knowing how many  programs each agency has? Why would  anybody in this body object to coordinating with all the transparency things  that we have done thus far and make it  so that 2 years from now the American  people can actually see where their  money  is being spent, how much  is  being spent on each program in each  State and at what location.  If somebody can give me an honest  explanation and a  logical reason  for  why we wouldn’t want to do that, I will  take that, and I will not offer another  unanimous consent request. But the  answer from OMB is that it is too hard  to work. It is not too hard to work.  That is exactly what the Bush administration said when we said we are going  to  have  the  transparency  act  and  usaspending.gov. They said it was too  hard, and we can’t do it. We can do it.  The American people are owed that  explanation, they are owed that transparency,  and  this  administration,  through its claims of being the most  transparent administration should step  forward and release this hold.  So before we leave here, I will offer  the unanimous consent request again.  If it is objected to, we will know that  it has nothing to do with reality. It has  nothing to do with honesty,  it has  nothing to do with integrity, it has  nothing to do with truth, it has nothing to do with being transparent with  the American people, and it has everything to do with the Federal Government saying that it is just too hard to  be honest with the American people to  allow them to see where we are spending the money.  I find that is really unacceptable for  us, as Members of the Senate. For a  Member of the Senate to stand up and  say, I object to doing that, tells us that  we have a long way to go on much,  much bigger problems if we are going  to play the game just because something is a little bit tough to do, and we  are going to fall for complaining that  we just can’t get it done.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",2014
442,Senate,113,-0.351,166,2014-12-10,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, first, I  wish to salute my friend and colleague  from Oklahoma.  I don’t agree with  probably 80 to 90 percent of what he  says, but I really respect him. He is a  person of integrity who really cares.  When you shake his hand and make a  deal, a deal is done, which is a rarity  around here, and we wish him the best.  Today I rise to discuss the recently  released report by the Senate Intelligence Committee. As a representative  of one of the most targeted cities in  the world, I feel compelled to speak  about this report. I want to say clearly  that I am troubled by many of its findings.  First, the many members of the CIA  and the intelligence community selflessly serve this Nation and put their  lives on the line. They are patriots who  are committed to protecting and serving America, keeping her safe  from  those very real enemies who are actively seeking to do the unspeakable in  terms of harm. We owe the members of  the CIA and  the  Intelligence Committee their due recognition and gratitude. We salute them for protecting us.  In many cases, they risk their lives to  protect us and our freedom.  But as with many institutions in our  society, be it part of the government or  part of the private sector, transparency  and accountability for mistakes are an  essential part of the process that preserves the balance in our democracy.  The fact of the matter is this report  lays bare some very troubling activities on the part of the CIA. It warrants  a close examination. When we find the  conduct  of  the CIA  to  be  grossly  counter to the Nation’s ideals, we must  reckon with that and make sure we  never go back to the days when our  government sanctioned torture.  Here, I agree with my colleague and  friend from across the aisle, Senator  MCCAIN. He has been an unimpeachable  voice on this topic, and has said time  and again that these actions were torture, and that torture besmirches the  honor of this great Nation.  I also agree with the remarks made  by Vice President JOEBIDEN, that only  a great Nation and only an open and  free society can forthrightly take ownership of their mistakes, find ways to  change those policies, and move positively forward on both the domestic  and international levels.  It is doubtless this report contains  lessons that our intelligence community must take to heart—for their goal  must be to protect our Nation without  sacrificing what it stands for.  Before I go any further, I wish to recognize the many years of hard work,  diligence, and courage—yes, courage—  on the part of my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and their staffs  for putting this report together.  I particularly wish to recognize my  dear friend and colleague, the chair of  the Senate  Intelligence Committee,  DIANNEFEINSTEIN, for her work with  VerDate Sep 11 2014  09:18 Dec 11, 2014 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10DE6.079 S10DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2014

444,,113,0.593,236,2014-12-10,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, there is no  one like Texas Congressman RALPHHALL.  Congressman RALPH is  the oldest  serving member of Congress, the oldest perHALL son to ever serve in the House of Representatives,  the oldest person ever elected  to a  House  term and  the oldest House member  ever to a cast a vote. Mr. HALL is also the last  remaining Congressman who served our nation during World War II.  And  for all of  these accomplishments,  I  would  like  to  thank and congratulate RALPH  one more time for his service to the country  and his leadership in the Texas Congressional  Delegation.  Born in Fate, Texas on May 3, 1923, HALL  did not know of his successful  future which  was ahead of him. At the age of 19, HALLenrolled into the U.S. Navy where he served as  a  lieutenant and combat aircraft carrier pilot  from 1942 to 1945 during World War II.  After serving  for  three years, HALL then  went on  to  finish college and  received his  LL.B.  from Southern Methodist University  in  1951. He was admitted to the Texas Bar, and  practiced law in Rockwall.  Mr. HALLalso participated in the business  side of Rockwall where he took part in serving  as President/CEO of Texas Aluminum Corp.,  General Counsel  of Texas Extrusion Co.,  Chairman of Lakeside News, Inc., and was a  founding member of Lakeside National Bank  in Rockwall where he currently serves as  Chairman of the Board.  RALPHhad the calling to serve Texas in the  political arena  in Texas politics, a combat  sport. So he began his public service  from  1950  to 1962 when he served as County  Judge of Rockwall County, Texas. Mr. HALL  also served as President of the State Judges  and Commissioners Association  in  1958 –  1959.  From 1962 to 1972, Mr. HALLwas elected  and served as a Texas State Senator where  he served as President Pro Tempore in 1968–  1969.  Congressman RALPHHALLwas first elected  to serve the 4th District of Texas in the U.S.  House of Representatives  in 1980 and has  been re-elected to each succeeding Congress.  On November 27, 2012, Congressman HALL  became the oldest member in the U.S. House  of Representatives to ever cast a vote. The  following month, on December 25, 2012, he  became the oldest-serving Member of the U.S.  House of Representatives in recorded history.  Congressman HALLalways ensured to serve  his people and made sure  their voice was  heard on different  issues  throughout Congress.  A noteworthy quote Mr. HALLoften said was  ‘I’d rather be respected at home than liked in  Washington.’ ’ RALPH is a hardcore Texan with  the unique knowledge of understanding all  people from the rich and famous to the infamous and downtrodden.  He was a proud conservative democrat and  personally knew  the  likes of LBJ, Speaker  Sam Rayburn, Muhammad Ali, baseball great  Mickey Mantle, war veteran Audie Murphy,  Senator  John  F. Kennedy,  Ted Williams,  President Ronald Reagan, Texas Governor  John Connally, Texas Governor William ‘ ‘Bill’ ’  P. Clements, Jr., Texas Governor Ann Richards,  Texas Governor Rick Perry, Curtis  Cokes, General Tommy Franks, Lieutenant  General  Tom  Stafford,  astronauts  Gene  Cernan, Buzz Aldrin, Neal Armstrong, U.S.  Representative Ray Roberts, U.S. Senator  Phil Gramm, famous aviator Claire Chennault,  President  George  H.W.  Bush,  President  George W. Bush, U.S. Senator JOHNCORNYN,  U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, T. Boone Pickens, H.  Ross Perot, Red Adair, Bo Derek, Chuck Norris, Ted Williams, Tom Hanks and The  Ink  Spots.  He works well with both Republicans and  Democrats, but he ‘ ‘got religion, ’ ’ in 2004, and  became a Republican. Never  forgetting his  Democrat  roots, he  commented,  ‘Being a  Democrat was more fun.’ ’  RALPHHALLalways has a story and a new,  but often used joke. He runs 2 miles a day  and certainly symbolizes the best of the Greatest Generation.  RALPHHALL’s service and  leadership has  shaped him into an important role model that  members of  the Texas Delegation  in Congress, on both sides of the aisle admire. His  dedication and love for his public service illustrates how success is attainable when mixed  with hard work and determination, along with  a love of America and of course, Texas.  And that ’s just the way it is.  f  HONORING THE KING INSTITUTE  HON. BARBARA LEE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  JACKIE SPEIER ZOE HONDA,  Wednesday, December 10, 2014  ",2014
445,,113,0.737,243,2014-12-10,Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and career  of Mr. John A. Miller, Jr. for his 41 years of involvement with AnMed Health System and  with  the  local community  in South Carolina.  John began his career with AnMed Health in  1973, eventually becoming its Chief Operating  Officer (COO) in 1978 and serving as its Chief  Executive Officer  (CEO)  from 1998  to  the  present.  I have appreciated  John’s expert  views on healthcare policy and economic development over the years.  Anchored by AnMed Health Medical Center  in  downtown  Anderson,  South  Carolina,  AnMed Health is one of the largest employers  in South Carolina’s Third Congressional District with over 500 physicians and nearly 4,000  employees. The 690-bed, not-for-profit health  system  is one of  the state’s  largest not-for-  profit independent health systems and serves  South Carolina, Georgia, and North Carolina.  AnMed Health also serves as a local hub of  medical education, partnering with institutions  such as Clemson University, Anderson University, The Medical University of South Carolina,  and AnMed Health’s own Family Medicine  residency program  in  the  training of  future  healthcare professionals, which has graduated  over 300 family doctors since 1975.  John began his career with AnMed Health in  1973 after graduating  from  the University of  North Carolina at Chapel Hill, serving in the  U.S. Navy and completing a Masters of Health  Administration from Duke University. John has  also received an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Anderson University. John’s career in healthcare now spans nearly 41 years  as does his  involvement  in  the Anderson  Community and across  the  region. He has  served in numerous leadership capacities with  a number of local, regional, state, and national  organizations,  including  the Anderson Area  Chamber of Commerce,  the Anderson Area  YMCA, the Anderson County United Way, Innovate Anderson, Hospice of the Upstate, Upstate South Carolina Alliance, Ten at the Top,  Leadership South Carolina, and the SC Chamber of Commerce.  During John’s tenure at AnMed Health, he  has led AnMed Health from a community hospital  to a comprehensive health system, encompassing  five hospitals, a modern cancer  center, a comprehensive home care division, a  Level II trauma center, a cardiac and orthopedic center, three outpatient surgery centers,  a  family medicine  residency program,  two  minor cares, two retail pharmacies, and a network of physician practices. John’s knowledge  and understanding of the changing healthcare  landscape and his ongoing dedication to the  organization and the community have ensured  the continued  realization of AnMed Health’s  founder Jennie Gilmer’s vision to bring comprehensive and quality healthcare to the Anderson  community. While  at  the  helm  of  AnMed Health, he has continued to encourage  the achievement of the gold standard for the  health system by  lending support  to AnMed  Health in its achievement of Magnet designation for nursing excellence by earning Top 100  recognitions by organizations such as Thomas  Reuters and Becker’s Hospital Review, U.S  News and World Reports Best Regional Hospital, and numerous accreditations  from  the  Joint Commission and other national organizations.  John has contributed to the advancement of  the healthcare  industry on a  local, regional,  state, and national  level over  the past  four  decades by serving in a leadership capacity  with such organizations as the American Hospital Association,  the American College of  Healthcare Executives,  the South Carolina  Hospital Association, and many others. While  he is leaving his leadership post, he will still  remain active with AnMed Health and various  national and local organizations. I know that  John will always be there to offer much needed counsel to those in need. Mr. Speaker, on  behalf of the 3rd District of South Carolina, I  wish  to express our deepest  thanks  to Mr.  John A. Miller, Jr. for his significant contributions to AnMed Health, the local and regional  communities, and healthcare overall.
