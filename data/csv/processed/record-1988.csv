0,Senate,100,-0.598,7,1,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, in  the next several weeks, Congress will  be considering  fundamental changes  in financial law. We will be revisiting  the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.  Fortunately, the fourth estate has  covered this issue in some detail and  our Nation's editorial writers have de voted considerable time to the subject.  Today,  I submit for  the RECORD  a  number of editorials from Texas news papers. The Dallas Morning News, for  example, dedicated a three-part series  to the argument that reform is neces sary, and  that  this  reform  requires  that the monopoly enjoyed by security  firms-an unintended effect of Glass Steagall-must be busted.  I ask unanimous consent that the  editorials be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the edito rials were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 7,  1987]  THE NATION'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM Is A MESS  Ask any American to name top problems  facing the nation, and it's a good bet the  words ""financial system"" will not be ut teredunless perhaps the respondent  is a  banker.  Yet, if reform of the financial system is  not quickly undertaken, the nation could be  flirting with a near-term collapse of that  system and, in the slightly longer term, loss  of world leadership in financial services.  Consider:  One in 10 U.S. banks-1,484 to be precise is considered by the Federal Deposit Insur ance Corp. to be in ""trouble.""  One in five savings and loans is considered  to be in ""deep trouble"" by the Federal Sav ings and Loan Insurance Corp.  No U.S. bank remains among the world's  10 largest, and only three remain among the  top 20. The world's seven largest banks are  Japanese. A single Japanese securities firm,  Nomura,  is  responsible for  financing one third of  the entire national debt of  the  United States.  Some of  this nation's largest banks are  threating to return their bank charters and  either become state banks outside the Fed eral Reserve system or to stop being banks  and become financial  institutions without  the right to either gather deposits or make  commercial loans.  Unregulated subsidiaries of non-financial  firms such as Sears and General Motors  raised their share of the U.S. credit from 9  to 19 percent in the last 10 years.  Although a topic even less sexy and more  complex than tax reform, reform of the na tion's financial system must become a  top  agenda item for the new Congress. Congress  should: a> define the activities that may be  undertaken by various types of financial in stitutions and the markets they may serve;  b> determine to what degree market forces  will be allowed to shape the future of the fi nancial system; and c> redesign the financial  regulatory system to meet the radically al tered structure of the industry.  From the Great Depression until the mid1970s, the nation's financial ""central differ ent institutions <commercial banks,  invest ment bankers, thrifts and insurance compa nies) existed  to do  specific  jobs without  treading  on  each  others'  territory,  and  where non-financial concerns were prohibit ed from financial services altogether. Banks  were not allowed to pay interest on demand  deposits  <checking  accounts),  and  the  amount of interest that could be paid on  time deposits was fixed by the government  (by Regulation Q>. It wasn't too difficult to  pay a fixed low rate for deposits, loan them  out to creditworthy borrowers, and show a  profit.  But over  the past decade,  this ""central  nervous  system""  has  undergone  severe  shocks. The first shock came when market  interest rates shot far above levels the gov ernment allowed depository institutions to  pay for time accounts. Hundreds of billions  of dollars in savings fled banks and thrifts  for vehicles such as ""money market mutual  funds,"" which were created by securities  firms  and offered near-checking  account  convenience with high  rates of  interest.  Congress responded by ""deregulating"" inter est  rates. Almost overnight, banks were  taken  from  a  protected and predictable  status to the fierce disciplines of the mar ketplace.  This  deregulation  has  forced  banks to compete (pay higher prices> with a  variety  of  non-bank  entities  for  capital  while  institutions  from Sears  to Merrill  Lynch have continued to encroach on bank ers' turf by offering additional  traditional  banking services.  Another shock arrived with those comput er  technologies that turn money into elec trons and send  them whizzing about  the  globe <and across state boundaries) at the  speed of  light,  thereby greatly  thwarting  government efforts  to control  the money  supply, capital flow or exchange rates.  A final shock occurred when a variety of  bad debts began to crash in on banks and  thrifts. The first round hit the big multina tional  lenders when  falling  commodity  prices undermined the ability of many for eign governments <Mexico, Brazil, Poland>  to repay hundreds of billions in loans. Other  U.S. banks were hit when loans to energy  concerns and farmers went sour.  Thrifts <which primarily use savings from  small investors and channel them into mort gage  investments> got  into  trouble when  they found themselves having to pay high  market rates for deposits while their loan  portfolios were primarily low-interest, long term mortgages. To get more money into  the thrifts, Congress allowed 20 percent of  their deposits to be  invested in non-mort gage  investments  like  commercial  real  estate. Lacking the expertise to make wide ranging loans, many savings and loan insti tutions poured billions into bad deals.  The financial system has done the best it  could to adjust. But it has had to do so with out much guidance from Congress or even  those regulatory agencies currently charged  with managing  the system. This has oc curred because Congress  has deadlocked  over whether  the government should act  forcefully  to maintain  the walls between  types of financial institutions, between com merce and finance, and between states, or  whether to encourage the rapid metamor phosis of the financial  institutions toward  large, nationwide, diverse enterprises guided  more by the demands of the market than  the visions of regulators.  Whatever the merits of available options,  the most unacceptable option  is  inaction.  Government must provide  the framework  for the nation's financial nervous system. If  it fails to do so, it courts disaster as individ ual savers and investors lose confidence in  the system, as Americans turn to foreign al ternatives to meet their money needs and as  experimentation  increasingly  defies  the  ability of  regulators  to assure safety and  soundness.  [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 8,  1987]  THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UNCHAINED  The United States'  financial  system  is  being called on to do an increasing number  of jobs:  Finance large multinational corporations  as well as smallto medium-sized businesses.  Provide venture capital for ideas that still  are gleams  in entrepreneurs' eyes. Keep  thousands of governmental entities funded.  All this and still supply credit to individual  consumers in a wide range of income brack ets.  At the same time, the U.S. financial indus try is as much under siege from Japanese  and European competitors as are other in dustries. And, as with other industries, the  foreign competition operates with far fewer  constraints. Japanese and most European  banks  labor under  far  fewer  restrictions  than do U.S. banks, and some may even  engage in ""merchant"" banking (equity own ership for investment purposes). Many for eign banks are not required to maintain spe cific amounts of reserves.  U.S. financial institutions are caught be cause populist  laws  build walls between  types of institutions, between state markets  and between commerce and finance. At the  same  time,  the  international marketplace  demands  large,  sophisticated  enterprises  able to offer a wide variety of financial serv ices and products at the lowest possible cost.  Historically, many Americans  have been  leery of nationwide financial conglomerates  and  a  concentration of  assets  in  fewer  hands. But we must now accommodate our selves to new realities. If the U.S. financial  industry  fails  to serve  the world market place,  foreign  institutions will-at great  profit. That will mean a continued wither ing of U.S. financial muscle and a growing  ",1988
1,Senate,100,0.322,20,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, Senators  have made many memorable speeches  in this Chamber but 71 years ago this  week a President of the United States  delivered an important address, from  the rostrum before us. At 1 p.m. on  January 22, 1917, President Woodrow  Wilson was escorted into the Chamber  by a committee of Senators, and took  a seat to the right of Vice President  Thomas R. Marshall, the presiding of ficer.  At that time the First World War  was raging in Europe, with England,  France, and Russia combatting Ger many and Austria. The United States  had maintained its neutrality-Wilson  had  just won  reelection under  the  slogan: ""He Kept Us Out Of War"" but  German  infringements  upon  United States neutrality rights were  increasingly  pressuring  the Nation  into war. On this day, however, Presi dent Wilson addressed the Senate, ""as  the council associated with me in the  final determination of our internation al obligations,""  to outline his vision  for permanent peace in the future.  Wilson took the bold step of calling  for a  ""peace without victory."" This  was difficult  to propose  in wartime,  but he argued  that ""victory would  mean peace  forced  upon  the  loser  It would be accepted in humilia tion, under duress, at an  intolerable  sacrifice, and would leave a sting, re sentment,  a  bitter memory  upon  which terms of peace would rest, not  permanently, but only as upon quick sand. Only a peace between equals can  last."" The warring powers, of course,  ignored and ridiculed Wilson's propos als, and even the United States forgot  them as soon as this Nation entered  the war  in April 1917. When World  War I ended, not by ""peace without  victory,"" but with the total defeat of  Germany,  the  resulting  peace was  built upon the quicksand that Wilson  had predicted,  leading  to a Second  World War just 20 years later.  .

5,Senate,100,0.055,33,1,Mr. STAFFORD.," Mr. President,  I  stand before the Senate to recognize  the outstanding contribution the Na tional Geographic Society has made to  this country. In its charter statement,  the National Geographic Society sets  out for  itself the  task of  increasing  and disseminating geographic knowl edge. The society has taken up  this  mission  in earnest, achieving respect  and admiration for it's outstanding ef forts  to promote geographic literacy  among the citizens of our Nation.  Attaining geographic literacy for all  the citizens of our Nation is a crucial  goal, a goal we are far from reaching.  At hearings held last fall, we learned  that knowledge of geography is woe fully lacking among school-aged chil dren. As  a  consequence, my  good  friend Senator BRADLEY and  I orga nized a successful campaign to declare  November 15-21 as Geography Aware ness Week. During that time activities  promoting  geography  literacy were  carried out across our Nation. Geogra phy Awareness Week is a good begin ning, but it is not nearly enough. In  the past 10 years geography as a sub ject of study has all but disappeared  from American  classrooms.  In  the  mind of this Senator, geographic illit eracy is a stumbling block to achieving  economic competitiveness and a threat  to our environmental well-being.  Recognizing  the need  to  increase  awareness of geography, Gilbert Gros venor, the president of National Geo graphic  is steering the society on a  long-range program of geography edu cation. Educational  efforts  are not  new to that organization. National Ge ographic has earned a  reputation of  being America's premier promoter of  global understanding through educa19-059 0-89-2 (Pt. 1)  ",1988

PROVIDING FOR JOINT SESSION  OF CONGRESS-STATE OF THE  UNION ADDRESS  ",1988
7,House,100,0.426,46,1,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  going to introduce a bill today which  could go a long way to cure the budget  sickness  that overcomes  this House  every single year. It would call for if  the Congress should fail  to adopt a  budget by its deadline of September 30  that the next day automatically would  be  reenacted  the  previous  year's  budget. No more the continuing reso lutions of 30 days creating another  crisis within that 30 days, no more the  pressure  of  checks  that would  be  forced not to be delivered by the Gov ernment because of a  deadline not  met, no more the spectacle of a Presi dent of the United States forced  to  sign an unacceptable budget because  of the threat of a shutdown of the  Government  operations  throughout  the world, no more the crisis, never  ending,  that besets  the Congress of  the United States.  I  know  that one  thing militates  against passage of this bill, and that is  that it makes sense. But I hope that  we can overcome that illness of ours so  that  this country can be put on a  straight basis for a budget process.

8,,100,0.378,72,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to  bring to the attention of my colleagues the re tirement as president of the Greater Ventura  Chamber of Commerce of my constituent, Jim  Clark.  Jim has been a resident of Ventura since  1970 and a member of the Chamber of Com merce since 1979. Since  that  time he has  served as chairman of the Governmental Af fairs Committee and was elected a director in  1984,  vice  president  1985,  president-elect  1986 and president of 1987.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Jim's term as president was marked by a  30-percent  increase  in membership, making  the Ventura Chamber the largest in numbers  of business members  along  the California  coast between Los Angeles and San Francis co. Additionally he was responsible for estab lishing the award-winning ""Ventura Business""  as the Chamber's monthly newsletter, keeping  the members abreast of current and future ac tivities of  the organization. Revisions  to  the  city's  smoking  and  sign  ordinances were  achieved, mainly  through his efforts, and he  spearheaded efforts which led to the justifica tion  for a 4-year university  to be  located  in  Western Ventura County and selection of Ven tura as the first choice for a site on which to  build it.  Mr. Clark is a native of Ashland, OH and a  graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. Shortly  after graduation he married Suzy also of Ash land. His Navy career included tours on carri ers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers as  well as schooling at  the Naval Postgraduate  School in Monterey, giving him a postgraduate  degree. Duty in Washington, DC followed and  then he was assigned to duties at the Naval  Weapons Systems Engineering Station at Port  Hueneme, CA. While  there he headed  three  departments  and was  responsible  for  the  design, construction and  testing of a 95-foot  remote-controlled Anti-Ship Missile Defense  Test Boat which survived all  range weapons  threats and continues to this day to serve as  a drone launching vessel for the Pacific Mis sile Test Range. At his  retirement  from  the  Navy in 1976, he had served the third longest  tour of duty ever at Port Hueneme.  Mr. Clark embarked on a career  in  real  estate after his retirement from the Navy and  opened  his own office, Tugboat Realty  in  1981. He is a member of the Ventura Board  of Realtors and was a director from 1983 to  1985, serving as the board's secretary/treas urer in 1985. In addition, he was a director of  the California Association of Realtors in 198485 and continues to serve as a trustee of the  Ventura board's political action committee and  has been recognized nationally for his political  action involvement.  Yachting and boating activities take up most  of Jim's spare time. He  is a member of the  Ventura Yacht Club and served on its board of  directors  from 1982  to 1987 and was  the  club's  commodore  in  1985.  He  currently  serves on no less than seven regional, state wide, national and  international boating and  yachting organizations. He  is 1988 commo dore of  the Association of Santa Barbara  Channel Yacht Clubs, president of District 16  of the  International Order of the Blue Gavel  (the Past Commodore's Club). He is an officer  or member of numerous other boating organi zations and  in 1980 was awarded  the Yacht  Club and Ventura Port District's prestigious  Merril C. Allyn Award  for outstanding service  to  recreational boating. Other activities and  awards are simply too numerous to mention.  In 1987, Jim and Suzy returned to Ashland,  OH, where Samaritan Hospital awarded him  and his  family  its Award  for Excellence  in  Medical Care at its 75th anniversary celebra tion. The hospital was originally given  to  the  city by Clark's grandfather, J.L. Clark.  Jim's other  leisure activities  include  culture, gardening, and wine  tasting. He  rose  is a  January 25, 1988  member of  the Consumer Tasting Panel of  Mirassou Winery, one of California's oldest  family-owned wineries. He is also a judge and  life member of the International Chili Society.  He judges chili at country fairs and conducts  chili cookoffs and declares chili to be his and  America's favorite meal.  Please join me  in wishing Jim many more  years of his chosen activities and best wishes  to him and his lovely Suzy.  A CONGRESSIONAL SALUTE TO  D.C. STUDENTS  HON. WALTER E. FAUNTROY  OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 1988  ",1988
9,,100,-0.082,85,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a  pleasure  to pay tribute today to  the Chester  Newell Area Chamber of Commerce. I had the  privilege of addressing this organization and it  became clear to me then that special recogni tion was in order.  Residents of Chester, WV, are clearly  in  good governing hands as  this group of offi cials exemplify the epitome of loyalty, concern  and  understanding. Mayor Roy Cashdollar  though only in office for 18 months, has done  an excellent job, as have the board members.  The Chester Newell Chamber of Commerce  represents their constituents well and it is with  great pride that I pay tribute to them today.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  A TRIBUTE TO COMMISSIONER  EDWARD J. MUHL  HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 1988  Mr. CARDIN, Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to Maryland's insurance commis sioner, Edward J. Muhl, who will be honored  for his years of outstanding public service at a  banquet in Baltimore on January 29.  Ed Muhl was appointed commissioner of in surance on June 1, 1983, after serving 18  months as deputy commissioner and acting in surance commissioner. His appointment came  at a critical  time  for  insurance  regulation  in  Maryland, which,  like  the rest of the Nation,  was facing a liability crisis.  It was my privilege to serve  in  the  legisla ture and observe  the skillful diplomacy of  Commissioner Muhl. Without his negotiating  skills, the outcome of health insurance, work men's compensation, tort reform and medical  malpractice issues might have been resolved  quite differently. Ed  is a quiet and effective  negotiator, committed to the fair resolution of  problems.  As  a  regulator, Commissioner Muhl  bal anced the interests of both the consumer and  industry. During his tenure, consumer informa tion was greatly improved, as were the proce dures for appealing a commission decision.  The State of Maryland has been  fortunate  to have such an outstanding public servant  and  I have been fortunate to have Ed as my  constituent, my consultant of my Health Advi sory Committee, and my friend. Although we  are sorry to lose Ed to North Carolina, he has  left us a very proud legacy.  TRIBUTE TO THE YOUNGSTOWN  MAENNERCHOR  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.

11,Senate,100,0.382,98,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  it  is  with regret that I rise in opposition to  S. 557 as it is currently drafted. I hope  my colleagues understand that my de cision  to  oppose  this bill was not  reached easily, nor does  it evidence  any lack of commitment on my part to  guaranteeing civil rights for all Ameri cans. Rather, my concerns reflect the  view that we can rectify the problems  flowing from the decision of the Su preme Court in Grove City versus Bell  without  imposing  and  expanding,  without limitation, the Federal Gov ernment's power over churches, syna gogues, private and religious schools,  the private sector, and States and lo calities. Simply labeling a measure a  ""civil rights"" bill does not negate our  responsibility to understand its ramifi cations or draft it carefully.  I hope my colleagues will indulge me  as I provide some background on this  issue, because it is critical that we un derstand the current state of the law,  and the ramifications of this legisla tion. I assume that the rhetoric will be  quite impassioned during the next few  days, but I hope that the fallowing ob servations will be taken for what they  are-legitimate concerns  that we do  not destroy one set of civil rights in  order to guarantee others.  The simple fact is that, unless we ad dress legitimate concerns such as the  coverage of churches and synagogues,  religious  tenets and abortion, S. 557  may never be able  to move through  the other body.  It will certainly be vetoed by  the  President, and that veto will be sus tained, in my opinion. And for yet an other session we will have done noth ing to correct the legitimate concerns  confronting title IX, or those who be lieve in title IX; and I happen to be  one of  them. We could have solved  this problem  in 1984 had we had a  simple overrule of the Grove City case.  This is the political reality that we  are facing  today. Mr. President,  the  four statutes amended by this bill pro hibit discrimination on certain bases,  ""any program  or  activity  receiving  Federal financial assistance."" That is  the present state of the law.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  1964 bans discrimination on the basis  of race, color, or national origin. Title  IX of the Education Amendments Act  of 1972 bans discrimination on  the  basis of sex, but it is limited to educa tion programs or activities  receiving  Federal financial assistance.  Section 504  of  the Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  bans  discrimination  against persons with handicaps; and  the Age Discrimination Act of 1975  bans discrimination on  the basis of  age.  The plain language of these statutes  together with  their  legislative histo ries  demonstrates  that  Congress  always  intended  the scope of  these  statutes to be ""program specific,"" as  the Supreme Court correctly deter mined  in  the Grove City decision.  Indeed, the words ""program or activi ty"" would appear, by common sense,  to mean something less than an entire  institution.  Congress has often been criticized  for its ambiguity or its mistakes in leg islative drafting, but I do not think it  made such a wholesale mistake as to  expect  the entire country  to  think  that the term ""program or activity""  was a synonym for an entire school, a  school system or a State.  Title IX  itself makes  reference  to  ""an educational  institution"" and de fines  the  term ""educational  institu tion"" as broader than a program < 20  U.S.C. section 1681(c)). In all honesty  we have to admit that Congress knew  how  to  cover an entire  institution  whenever one part of it received Fed eral aid, but declined to do so in the  antidiscrimination provision of  these  laws.  Moreover, in section 904 of title IX,  Congress prohibited discrimination on  the basis of blindness or vision impair ment ""in any course of study by a re cipient of Federal financial assistance  for any education program or activity       ."" 10 U.S.C.  section 1684. Here,  Congress clearly banned discrimina tion on the basis of blindness through out the institution by using the word  ""recipient""  in  the  statute  itself-in  stark contrast  to  the more discrete  term ""program or activity"" used in the  antisex  discrimination  provision  of  title IX and in the other three stat utes. Congress clearly knew how  to  provide institutionwide coverage under  these statutes and declined to do so.  Thus, it is important to realize that  references by the proponents of S. 557  to the long standing interpretation of  these  laws  are  inaccurate.  Indeed,  while some lower courts did rule that  these statutes covered an entire insti tution whenever any part' of the insti tution  received  Federal  aid, many  other Federal courts ruled, as the Su preme Court did,  that  the statutes  were program specific. And, the trend  in  the  lower courts  leading  to  the  Grove City decision by the Supreme  Court was certainly in that direction.  In Simpson v. Reynolds Metals Co.,  629 F.2d 1226 <7th Cir. 1980), a case  brought under section 504 of the Re habilitation Act before Grove City was  decided, the Court said:  The statute does not, as plaintiff seems to  contend,  generally  forbid  discrimination  against  the handicapped by  federal assistance. Instead, its terms appar ently require that the discrimination must  have some direct or indirect effect on the  recipients of  handicapped person in the program or ac tivity receiving federal financial assistance.  To be actionable,  the discrimination must  come  manifest itself in a handicapped individual's  exclusion from the program or a diminution  the operation of the program or  in  of the benefits he would otherwise receive  the program. 629 F.2d at 1232 <italic  supplied).  from  The Court went on to note that it  could find nothing in other parts of  the act to show ""an intent by Congress  that section 504 impose a general re quirement upon recipients of Federal  grants  not  to  discriminate  against  handicapped employees who are not  involved in a program or activity re ceiving such assistance."" 629 F.2d at  1233. Thus,  in Simpson,  the  court  ruled that an employee at one of the  defendant's plants could not assert a  section 504 claim by virtue of a f eder ally assisted  job-training program at  the plant because the employee was  not  a  participant  in  that program.  Thus, coverage did not even extend to  the entire plant, let alone the entire  company.  Likewise,  in Bachman v. American  Society of Clinical Pathologists, 577 F.  Supp. 1257 <D.N.J. 1983), 1 year before  Grove City, the court made an identi cal finding under a section 504 action:  It is not enough ... to show that a person  has been discriminated against by a recipi federal  funds. Plaintiff must also  show that she was subject to discrimination  ent of  under  the program or activity for which  gram-specific  those funds were received.  . .. Section 504  of  the Rehabilitation Act  imposes a pro requirement  limiting claims  brought pursuant to this section to those  programs or activities which are federally  funded. 577 F. supp. 1262-1263 <emphasis  supplied).  Here, a nonprofit medical associa tion received approximately $50,000 jn  Federal aid to conduct three seminars  on alcohol abuse and to publish the  proceedings of the seminar. The court  ruled that such Federal aid does not  subject  to coverage  the association's  board  of  registry, which  develops  standards and procedures  for entry  and promotion in medical laboratories  and certifies and registers those who  meet  competency  requirements,  in cluding  the use of an examination.  Had  the court  ruled otherwise,  the  standards  for  certifying clinical pa thologists would have been subjected  to an equality of result rather than  equality of opportunity analysis by  Federal agencies and courts.  In Brown v. Sibley, 650 F.2d 760 (5th  Cir. 1981 ), a case involving a business  operated by  the state,  the Court of  Appeals for the fifth circuit held:  [Oln the basis of the language of section  504 and its legislative history, and on the  strength of analogies to Title VI and Title  IX, we hold that it is not sufficient, for pur poses of bringing a discrimination claim  under section 504, simply to show that some  aspect of the relevant overall entity or en terprise receives or has received some form  of  input from  the federal  fisc. A private  plaintiff in a section 504 case must show  that the program or activity with which he  or she was involved, or from which he or  she was excluded, itself received or was di rectly benefited by federal financial assist",1988
12,Senate,100,0.687,111,1,Mr. SYMMS.," There may be many  differing views in this body as to the  validity or merits of the FCC cross ownership rules, and I believe there is  room for a difference of opinion. How ever, I think few members of this body  would support the concept that those  rules should be selectively manipulat ed by Congress to stifle targeted cate gories of speech, amounting to blatant  legislative censorship. After all,  the  first amendment says that ""Congress  shall make no law       abridging the  freedom of speech of the press.""  But in the waning hours of the last  session, unbeknownst to most of us, we  did pass a law ""abridging the freedom  of the press."" There is simply no other  way  to describe what  the anti-Mur doch amendment did.  Some may argue that the Murdoch  measure was simply designed  to en force  rigorously  the cross-ownership  rules. But this argument fools no one.  When the Supreme Court upheld the  cross-ownership rules in a 1978 deci sion, it emphasized the importance of  FCC discretion in applying the rule.  The Justices stressed that ""waivers are  potentially available"" where enforcing  the rule could lead to closing down a  newspaper.  But  the  anti-Murdoch  measure  deliberately  removes  that  critical  discretion  for  the manifest  purpose of censoring the views of two  newspapers. Waivers were barred pre cisely because  the Murdoch papers  needed such a waiver.  A more blatant example of targeted,  content-related censorship would be  difficult to imagine.  Mr. President, the Grove City legis lation is the first piece of legislation  that has come before the Senate this  session. This makes it the only avail able vehicle  for as much as several  weeks to cure the damage done by last  year's amendment.  I  therefore urge  adoption of my amendment.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and  nays on the amendment.  ",1988

I also ask unanimous consent that  my statement appear with the other  opening statements on S. 557.  ",1988
15,Senate,100,-0.396,163,1,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President,  I  am  proud to rise as a cosponsor of this leg islation which will facilitate the ability  of adult adoptees and their birth par ents to locate each other through the  creation of national adoption registry.  The  concept  of  contact  between  adult adoptees and their birth parents  is an emotional one. There are those  who argue that such contact consti tutes a violation of the privacy rights  of both birth parents and adoptees as  well as being a threat to the parental  rights of the adopting family. There  are also  those who argue  that  the  right of adult adoptees  to get some  level of information about their birth  parents  is  absolute. This  legislation  goes to neither extreme. It is a sensi tive response to the needs and desires  of all parties. It balances  the right  that all of us have to privacy with the  understandable desire that all human  beings have to know more about who  they are and where they come from.  The distinguishing characteristic of  this legislation is simple: It establishes  a national registry in which, upon re quest, the names of birth parents and  adult adoptees are placed. The exist ence of such a registry allows for the  possibility of matching adult adoptees  and birth parents and allowing them  to contact each other if they desire to  do so. While the legislation establishes  a national  registry, names of adult  adoptees and birth parents are placed  in the registry only if the parties re quest that they become a part of the  system. As  a  result, matches made  through  the  registry  require  the  mutual and voluntary consent of both  the adult adoptees and the birth par ents.  This bill does not-does not-create  open records. This bill does not-does  not-create a situation  in which un willing contact is possible. All this bill  does is facilitate the possibility of con tact if, and only if, both adult adoptee  and birth parent make an active effort  to allow  that contact  to  take place.  Each  party must  voluntarily  place  their names in the registry and, as a  result, a match can only be made if  both parties desire it.  Mr. President,  this legislation does  nothing more than respond to reality.  There are similar voluntary registries  in some States and the experience we  have had with them proves that the  system does protect the rights of all  parties. Unfortunately,  such  State based  systems  are  restricted,  by  nature, to the geographic boundaries  of the State; since we are a mobile so ciety, that limitation reduces the utili ty of State-based system. In addition,  Mr. President, the plain truth is that  without a national registry, both adult  adoptees and birth parents are en gaged  in private  searches  for  each  other-searches which do not recog nize  the privacy rights of the other  party. It is my hope that the failure of  one party to indicate a willingness for  contact by placing their name on the  registry will discourage such freelance  searches and, as a result, help protect  all parties from contact which  they  may not desire.  Let me conclude these remarks, Mr.  President, by paying a special tribute  to Senator LEVIN and his staff. I know  that they have been working on this  legislation for close to 10 years now. I  am absolutely convinced that the op position to this legislation is based on  a failure to understand the extraordi nary  protections which  have  been  built into it. And I am also absolutely  convinced that when this legislation is  adopted-as I hope  it will be-adult  adoptees and birth parents and every one who cares about this issue, will ap plaud the Senator for Michigan and  his staff for  their persistence,  their  dedication, and  the creative and re sponsible way in which they have ad dressed this issue.

16,Senate,100,-0.123,163,1,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, many  Americans  desperately  search  for  years and sometimes for decades at  great economic expense to find their  biological  parents,  siblings,  or chil dren. The problems associated in the  search for lost relatives are unfortu nate and often times unnecessary. For tunately, however, the pains associat ed with the search for a  lost family  member are replaced by the joys of  being reunited.  Several States, including Louisiana,  have made admirable attempts to fa cilitate the reunion of those who have  been separated from  their  relatives.  Many of  these  reunions occur as a  result  of  a  State-by-State  registry.  Every State does not have a registry,  thus, gaps exist that have prevented  the establishment of a comprehensive  national registry.  Today I am pleased to be part of an  effort that will attempt to facilitate  the reunion of perhaps thousands of  Americans who  have  lost  track of  family members. This effort includes  the establishment of a 3 year demon stration project through which biolog ical parents and adult adoptees, and  ",1988

19,House,100,-0.362,189,1,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, some of  my colleagues favor Contra aid. Some  of my colleagues favor the peace proc ess, but I do not know a single Member  of Congress who favors waste of tax payers' dollars,  and  the  record  of  Contra aid in this administration is a  record of waste and profiteering.  Last year, as a  result of a Federal  audit, we determined that half of the  humanitarian aid we had sent nomi nally to the Contra forces in Nicara gua ended up in one grocery store in  Honduras,  a  street  corner  grocery  store  in Tegucigalpa, owned by  the  generals in the Honduran army. We  were  not  quite  sure we  got  our  money's worth  in  this humanitarian  assistance.  Last year Secretary of State Shultz  testified  before  the House Budget  Committee and assured me personally  that he could account for the $27 mil lion  in Contra aid which American  taxpayers sent down  before.  there  the year  D 1445  lacl~ of  I exchanged several letters. I do not  have the stack of them to rap on the  podium here as the President did with  the CR the other night. But I wish my  colleagues could see them because as  they would read them they would find  out the Secretary of State could not  provide that information. As the GAO  reported, our State Department has  shown an utter disregard for spending  controls  and  accountability  when it comes to Contra aid.  is  becoming  increasingly  clear  that our Contra aid is being monitored  by Johnny Carson's infamous book keeper ""Loose-Leaf Maurice.""  Now the President wants us to throw  another $36 million in Contra aid into  the dense jungle of waste and profit eering. We cannot afford to waste an other penny of the taxpayers' dollars  to perpetuate Contra folly in Nicara gua. It is time to give peace a chance  and stop squandering tax dollars on  the Contra effort.  It  LEGISLATION TO AMEND  LOW  LEVEL  RADIOACTIVE WASTE  POLICY ACT  <Mr. COLEMAN of Texas asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1988
20,House,100,-0.402,189,1,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Speak er, I appreciate the opportunity to ad dress the House in support for legisla tion  I  am  today  introducing which  would amend the 1980 Low Level Ra dioactive Waste Policy Act.  This bill would add a section to cur rent law which delegated to the States  responsibility for disposal of low-level  radioactive waste within their respec tive  jurisdictions. A majority of  the  States have formed regional compacts  which then assume control over the  site selection process for  location of  waste disposal facilities as well as all  other tasks associated with the oper ation of the disposal facilities. The for mation  of  these  regional  compacts  must be approved by  the Congress  through legislation.  The State of Texas has elected not  to join a regional compact and has cre ated the Texas Low-Level Radioactive  Waste Disposal Authority to provide a  plan for the disposal of  its low-level  waste.  The effort of the authority in Texas  to select a suitable location for the dis posal facility have raised strong con cerns among west Texans,  the area  most likely to play host to such a facil ity,  in  that political and budgetary  considerations  appear  to  have  had  more  influence  in  the site selection  process than scientific or engineering  factors.  At the present  time,  two  locations  have been selected, both in Hudspeth  County and both  in my district. A  neighboring county, El Paso, has filed  suit  against  the  authority  alleging  that both sites do not meet the siting  criteria spelled out in State law. An in junction has been placed on the au thority preventing any further work  on these two sites while the Texas Su preme Court decides the merits of the  suit. Only last week the Texas court  ruled against the county thus clearing  the way for the final designation of a  site and, in turn, spawning a new cycle  of litigation in the State court system.  My legislation would essentially du plicate language which is contained in  a 1983 agreement between the United  States and Mexico on cooperation for  the protection and  improvement of  the environment in the border area.  The agreement, which was signed by  the Presidents of both countries, pro vides generally for mutual cooperation  in preventing or reducing sources of  pollution in their respective territory  which affect the border area of the  other. The border area is defined as  the area situated 100 kilometers-or 60  miles-on  either  side  of  the Rio  Grande.  The 1983 agreement, and my bill,  recognize the need for both countries  to act  responsibly  in respecting our  shared border area environment. Cer tainly, the location or a low-level dis posal facility within the defined area in this case an international waterway  that  is  fed by  several  surface and  ground  water  sources,  the  Rio  Grande-violates  the  intent  of  the  agreement and poses a risk to the nat ural resource H.R. 791  seeks to pro tect.  Congress has only recently begun to  recognize the need to agressively safe guard against ground water contami nation. With this legislation, Congress  would be demonstrating an apprecia tion for the role we all must play in ac knowledging  the  interdependence  which so characterizes our border area  environment.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am aware of  the  general  unwillingness  of  some  within this House to revisit an issue the  disposal  of  low-level  nuclear  waste-which many  feel has already  been disposed  of. The  situation  in  Texas  underscores,  at  least  in my  mind, that Congress cannot afford to  duck its ultimate responsibility for the  threat posed  to our population by  problems associated with the disposal  of such waste when this problem is the  direct result of policies pursued at the  Federal level.  I am hopeful that testimony devel oped during committee consideration  of  this  bill would  articulate more  clearly  the need for a more careful  monitoring of the actions of the States  in addressing this problem.

Indeed,  it  is a re sounding  statement of why  all Americans  should care about what  is happening many  thousands of miles away on the ""roof of the  world.""  I would  like to place his outstanding  remarks in the RECORD  for the benefit of my  colleagues:  ""And God created man in His image, in  the  image of God He created him.""  I've  never met Tibetans; Never tasted their food;  do not know what  language  they speak;  Never walked through their villages; Never  studied  their culture;  the names of  their  cities do not come easily to my lips and their  national anthem I've never heard played.  But I do know this:  ""When God created that very first human  being, He scooped up soil from all four cor ners of this world. He took that earth-with  all of its colors, the red and brown and black  and yellow and white-and said: 'You're en titled to live and none to make you afraid.  And you don't have to be all the same color,  speak the same language, eat the same food,  worship the same God or think the same  thoughts.'""  No, I've never met a Tibetan-but he's my  brother. He's entitled to  live. That is his  right. I know that. The same God that cre ated me, created him. I know that! And I  know one more thing from the experience  and  the history and  the  teaching of my  people; to be indifferent to the fate of my  Tibetan brother will condemn him and to be  indifferent to his anguish condemns me; To  be neutral condemns him and to be neutral  to his suffering condemns me. To be silent condemns  the Tibetan  to a  cultural and  spiritual death-to be silent, to be silent condemns me.  JANET CHAMPNEY POSS  HONORED  HON. BRUCE A.

A graduate of Wheelock College, Jan con tinued her studies at Boston University and  Columbia University, where she also held a  number of administrative positions. She  later  married Eliasz Poss, a senior engineer at Si korski Aircraft.  Jan  is a leader of the Democratic Party in  Guilford. In that role, we have worked together  on many causes  large and small. Her help  was a key part of my success in my first cam paign  for Congress in 1982 and each of my  subsequent runs for reelection. She is a com mitted activist in  the struggle  for peace and  justice here at home and around the world.  Jan  is also well known  in Guilford  for her  volunteer work. She has been  involved  in a  wide range of volunteer activities for the past  23 years, and  is Guilford's ""Best Volunteer.""  She chaired the Little Folks Fair, the Shoreline  Unitarian-Universalist Society, and  the East  Shore Adult Day Care Center. In addition, Jan  has served as the chairman of  the Guilford  Human Services Council and the Youth Serv ices Bureau. And the list goes on.  Jan was a founding member of the Guilford  League of Women Voters. She was also a  founder of  the Guilford  ""A Better Chance""  Program, which sponsors  inner-city children  and provides  them with  the opportunity  to  attend several years of school  in Guilford,  away from the crime and poverty often associ ated with inner-city schools. Finally, Jan was a  founder and part-time manager of the ""Hole in-the-Wall"" second-hand clothing store. This  store was originally started  to  finance  the  Interfaith Housing Board, of which she is now  the executive director, but presently helps  fund the ""A Better Chance"" Program.  Mr. Speaker, the people of Guilford and its  surrounding communities owe a debt of grati tude  to Jan Poss. Her commitment and un flagging energy in her efforts to  improve the  lives of  the people around her are  truly  re markable. But most important,  I am proud to  call her a  true and dear  friend, and  I take  great pride  in sharing her accomplishments  with my colleagues today.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. DAVID E.  FARKAS  HON.

27,,100,-0.404,280,1,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay  tribute  to Dr. David E. Farkas, my good  friend  and  a  leader  in my  community.  I  became acquainted with David and developed  a lasting  friendship with him some 30 years  ago at Camp Ramah where his endless gen erosity and strong leadership abilities were al ready apparent.  David will be honored on January 31, 1988,  by the Los Angeles Hebrew High School at a  gala dinner/dance at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  The Los Angeles Hebrew High School pro vides a meaningful secondary Jewish educa tion to thousands of students in nine branches  throughout the Los Angeles area. A graduate  of Hebrew High, David has worked  tirelessly  January 27, 1988  for this fine institution in many leadership posi tions  for  the past  16 years. He  currently  serves on the board of directors as president elect and scholarship chair.  David has given generously of his time and  resources to Jewish educational institutions to  provide Jewish youths with  the best possible  educational opportunities. Among his past ac tivities are service as  the vice president of  Camp Ramah, a member of the Young Lead ership Cabinet of UJA, a board member of  Heschel Day School, and a board member of  Adat Ariel.

MONUMENTS COMMISSION AND  KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL PASS  MUSTER  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
28,,100,-0.318,280,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, for almost 6 mil lion men and women who sacrificed a part of  their lives fighting for the cause of freedom in  the Korean war,  the journey home has been  an incomplete one. While many individuals re turned  from  the  fray  to  rejoin our Nation  in  peace as they had  joined our Nation in war,  over 60,000  individuals  remained behind  in  Korea, dead or missing.  For  those 60,000 who served  their nation  admirably,  the  journey home ended halfway.  Those 60,000 went to Korea but did not return  from Korea.  There is an opportunity to remember those  who served and sacrificed as well as  those  who served and returned.  In the 99th Congress, I was pleased to have  authored  legislation establishing  the Korean  War Memorial. As a symbol, the memorial will  honor the ultimate sacrifice, that is, self-sacri fice so that others may live.  In  the 1 OOth Congress,  I am pleased  to  have  introduced  additional  legislation  that  would bring closer to home here on the Mall  ",1988
29,,100,-0.339,293,1,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, as one member  who since 1981 has been sponsoring legisla tion to impose swift and certain penalties on  those convicted of hate crimes.  I wish  to  again urge that final congressional action be  completed on legislation passed by this House  which would be an  important  first step  for ward, H.R. 3258 which I was proud to cospon sor.  In addition the report released yesterday by  the Anti-Defamation  League of B'nai B'rith  makes this an even more compelling cause.  Their report makes the disturbing conclusion  that anti-Semitic incidents in the United States  increased 12 percent in 1987 reversing a 5year downward trend according to this morn ing's New York Times.  The total number of incidents for 1987 was  1,018 a staggering rate of more  than  two a  day  for  the whole year. These  incidents of  anti-Semitic incidents include two types: van dalism against Jewish institutions and property  and harassment threats and assaults against  Jews and Jewish property. Typically acts of  vandalism  outnumber  the  harassment  and  threat type of incidents and 1987 was no ex ception. There were 694 acts of vandalism  and 324 harassments, threats and assaults.  Tragically, New York State again  led  the  States with 207 incidents. New York also led  with acts of harassment, threats and assaults.  It  is  important  to note  that an  increased  number of State  legislatures, 29  in all have  adopted stricter  laws aimed at curbing  reli gious or ethnic vandalism. Yet there remains  to this date no Federal legislation to deal with  the problem of religious and ethnic violence.  H.R. 2538 proposes a graduated series of  penalties for those who commit these heinous  acts against religious persons and or property.  This would  include  life  imprisonment for any  such incident that results in death.  There are far too many acts of violence and  vandalism occurring against people of all reli gions. Just two nights ago, Cardinal O'Connor  of the Archdiocese of New York had his per sonal residence broken into by a knife wield ing individual who threatened one of the cardi nal's housekeepers. It was the second forced  entry into the residence in the past year. We  read about too many religious buildings being  defaced. We even hear too much about dese cration of cemeteries.  It is time  to act and we must do so.  It is  tragic that these acts occur but they do. We  cannot ignore them because our inaction will  only encourage more such acts in the future.  293  At this time  I wish to insert an article from  the New York Times highlighting  the B'nai  B'rith report.  [From the New York Times, Jan. 27, 19881  REPORT SHOWS 12-PERCENT RISE IN ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS  Anti-Semitic  incidents  in  the  United  States increased 12 percent in 1987, revers ing a  five-year downward  trend, the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith reported  yesterday.  At the league's New York headquarters,  its national director, Abraham H. Foxman,  called the results ""disturbing."" He said that,  paradoxically, the increase had come in a  period of vigorous  local  law enforcement  and statutory efforts against crimes of bias  as well as a  recent Federal crackdown on  hate groups.  The 1,018 reported incidents in 1987 and  the percentage of increase from 1986, how ever, were less than those of 1981, the last  year the annual audit found a significant in crease in anti-Semitism in this country.  In 1981,  there were 1,324 reported  inci dents. That was the third year in a row that  the number of  incidents was more  than  double the previous year's.  694 VANDALISM INCIDENTS  The league divided the incidents into two  types: vandalism against Jewish institutions  and property, and harassment, threats and  assaults against Jews and Jewish property.  Historically,  incidents of vandalism have  largely outnumbered harassments,  threats  and assaults and that was the case last year.  The number of incidents of vandalism last  year was 694, ranging from swastika daub ings to arson and pipe bombings. This was  an increase of 17 percent over the 594 inci dents reported in 1986. The sharp increase,  the audit said, largely reflected a 121 per cent increase in such incidents in California.  The audit found some of the more serious  vandalism was carried out by members of a  neo-Nazi hate group who call  themselves  the Skinheads. The group's activity  last  year, particularly  in California,  the audit  said, brought the number of anti-Semitic in cidents  attributable  to  organized  hate  groups to 20. In recent years, no more than  one or two vandalism incidents have been  attributed to such groups.  The number of harassments, threats and  assaults was 324 last year, a 4 percent in crease over the 312 such incidents reported  in 1986 These included 16 assaults last year,  compared with 11 the year before. Most of  the harassments and threats came  in the  form of hate mail and telephone calls.  NEW YORK'S BREAKDOWN  New York,  the state with  the highest  Jewish population, led the nation with 207  vandalism incidents, up from 186 in 1986. Of  the 91  incidents reported last year in New  York City, Brooklyn had the most, with 37,  followed by Manhattan, with 27.  Outside the city, Nassau County had the  most  in  the  state,  followed  by Suffolk  County, with 41. The remaining 55 counties  in the state had a combined total of 15 inci dents.  California had the second highest number  of vandalism incidents, 137, up from 62  in  1986.  Florida was  third, with 64,  followed by  New Jersey, with 43. The 1987  totals for  both states, however, were down from 1986.  Connecticut was ranked 20th, with 6 inci dents, one more than the year before.  ",1988
30,,100,-0.429,306,1,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to a Brooklyn native son, who has  recently been appointed  to one of the most  important positions in the Catholic Church. A  few weeks  ago,  the Holy Father  named  Bishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua to be archbish op of Philadelphia.  It is with great pride that I point out to my  colleagues  that Archbishop Bevilacqua was  born and educated in Brooklyn. He began his  religious  instruction at Brooklyn's Cathedral  College and  later attended  the Seminary of  the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, NY.  The Archbishop's towering and diverse intel lectual strengths are evidenced by  the  fact  that he has also earned a dqctorate in Canon  Law at the Gregorian University in Rome, an  advanced degree  in political science at Co lumbia University, and a doctorate in civil law  at St. John's University.  Mr. Speaker, throughout my career in public  service, in the New York Assembly and in the  Congress,  I have had  the immense pleasure  of working directly with Archbishop Bevilacqua  on a number of critical issues. The Archbishop  served Brooklyn's Catholic community with  distinction,  first as director of  the diocese's  migration and  refugee  office and  then as  Brooklyn's auxiliary bishop. He  is one of the  Nation's authorities on  refugee and human  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  rights matters and has always provided me  with expert counsel on these important issues.  Several years ago, Archbishop Bevilacqua  left the Brooklyn diocese to assume the role  of bishop of Pittsburgh. Aithough he moved  away from our city, the Archbishop will never  cease to be a beloved member of the Brook lyn family. Now that he is moving to another  great city  in Pennsylvania,  I'm sure my col leagues will  join the people of Brooklyn and  me in extending to Archbishop Bevilacqua our  most sincere congratulations and best wishes  for a productive and inspiring career as arch bishop of Philadelphia.  THE  POSTAL  SERVICE  VANTAGED  BUSINESS  CUREMENT ACT OF 1988  DISAD PROHON. MICKEY LELAND  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
31,,100,-0.596,306,1,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  last year  the  Postal Service  released  its  comprehensive  statement on postal operations.  In the midst  of pronouncements about the Postal Service  complying with this act or that regulation, was  the startling revelation  that in 1986, only 5.9  percent of all contract dollars went to minority  businesses. This is a dramatic decrease from  1985 when 1 O percent of all Postal Service  contracts went to minority businesses and the  lowest percentage since 1981. In terms of dol lars and cents, this is a drop from $237 million  spent with minority businesses in 1985, down  to $186 million in 1986. This is appalling.  In stead of building on a record that was improv ing  incrementally,  the Postal Service  has  taken a huge step backward.  The Postal Service's disappointing  lack of  involvement with disadvantaged business con cerns, those small businesses that are owned  and controlled by minorities or women, is forc ing me to introduce legislation today mandat ing that every year, at least 1 O percent of all  contract dollars be spent with such disadvan taged business concerns.  We should not have to legislatively mandate  that the Postal Service give more than token  consideration  to minority and women owned  businesses. The Postal Service, however, has  resisted previous efforts to encourage, even  cajole them into being more receptive to mi nority contractors. As part of the Federal Gov ernment, the Postal Service should be a posi tive role model for the Nation. Unfortunately,  when it comes to providing equal opportunities  for all,  regardless of race or sex,  the Postal  Service exhibits, to put it mildly, a lack of com mitment.  I cite as an example  the  fact  that  nearly half, 49.7 percent, of all EEO cases  filed with the EEOC by Federal employees are  filed by Postal Service employees. And be lieve me, my colleagues, I am seeking legisla tive means of changing  this sad state of af fairs also.  The  legislation  that  I  introduce  today will  bring  the Postal Service  in  line with existing  Federal policy. Section 8(a) of the Small Busi ness Act authorizes Federal programs that en courage and assist small minority businesses  in contracting with  the Federal Government.  January 27, 1988  Recent  court  cases,  including a  landmark  case before  the Supreme Court, considered  the provisions of section 8(a) and the proce. dures and constitutionality of this statute were  upheld .  The legislation that I introduce today will not  result in additional costs to the taxpayers nor  postage rate payers. This measure stipulates  that in every fiscal year, the Postal Service is  required to set goals for contracting with dis advantaged business concerns. These goals  cannot be  lower  than 1 O percent, nor can  actual contract dollars spent with disadvan taged business concerns drop below 1 O per cent without sanctions being imposed on the  Postal Service. For women owned and con trolled businesses, the goals and actual dollar  amount must be at least 5 percent each fiscal  year.  I want to make clear that this bill does  not represent a limit on  the extent to which  the Postal Service may contract with disad vantaged business concerns. Quite  the con trary. We have set a minimum standard with  which  the  Postal  Service must  at  least  comply. To accomplish this, the Postal Serv ice must reevaluate  its policies, and change  them where necessary, so that they are more  conducive to minority businesses and encour age minority participation. I suggest the Postal  Service start by removing some of the many  procedural roadblocks to contracting with the  Postal Service and  launch serious efforts to  solicit minority business participation.  Finally, this bill  is comprehensive, covering  all aspects of contracting with disadvantaged  business  concerns,  including  solicitation of  bids and proposals, the responsibility of prime  and subcontractors, the use of inventions, pat ents and licenses, research and development,  payment to the covered businesses, penalties  for misrepresentation of minority or small busi ness status and a required annual  report to  Congress on compliance with the statute. To  see that the legislation is carried out to its full est, the bill also contains a provision that cre ates an Office of Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization.  It is time the Postal Service joined the rest  of  the Federal Government  in working  to  assist and encourage the growth of small, mi nority and women owned and controlled busi nesses. It is good public policy and helps the  businesses  involved,  the economy and  the  Postal Service. I encourage my colleagues to  support this measure.  A NATIONAL NETWORK OF  FREE COMMUNITY PHONES  HON. RON WYDEN  OF OREGON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
32,,100,-0.318,306,1,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago  the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co.  kicked-off  a  unique  program  to  help  the  needy. It's called the Community Connection,  and consists of free telephones for local serv ice at 14 centers around Oregon. Located at  senior  citizen  centers,  community  centers,  public assistance offices, and  the  like,  these  free phones have already been hailed as a  ringing success.  ",1988
33,,100,0.017,319,1,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  since  early November, many of the Nation's news papers have collectively devoted a consider able  amount  of  editorial  attention-mostly  negative and completely unjustified-to  the  effort to upgrade the Veterans' Administration  to a Cabinet-level department.  Curiously, many of these editorials share an  entirely  too coincidental similarity  in words,  phrasing, and clicMs,  that suggests a con certed  effort  to  prevent  this  long-overdue  action.  I have  to wonder why when such a  move is in the best national interest, involves  insignificant costs, does not expand govern ment, and affords the Nation's defenders the  deference they have earned. Why would edi torial boards oppose it?  Perhaps Butch Joeckel, executive director  of  the Washington headquarters of  the Dis abled American Veterans, has hit upon one  reason for this media opposition. I would like  to share with my colleagues his thoughts on  the matter:  A DIVISIVE PEN  In the month after the House Committee  reported the bill on November 10 giving the  VA Cabinet rank, the Post published more  than a dozen articles, letters and columns  on the proposal. Three of the Post's four  editorials  against  the measure  appeared  before the Senate Committee's December 9  hearing  on  it.  Predictably,  the  paper's  report of that hearing headlined criticism of  the proposal despite  its virtually unques tioned likelihood of passage.  The unique intensity of the Post's cover age alone, not counting an indirect swipe at  the idea in an editorial about the Dallas  Cowboys,  invites attention. But the more  widespread editorial commentary provoked  by the legislation is more important to con sider.  We have found expressions of opinion in  about twenty newspapers <of some 1700 dai lies nationwide) during  the same month,  from cities that include New York, Wash ington, Philadelphia, Detroit and Atlanta.  All but one <from Waco, Texas> have op posed Cabinet status for the VA.  In addition to this rather remarkable uni formity of view,  the same  reasoning and  even phraseology recur with surprising fre quency. More than half of the editorials, for  example, condemn support for the proposal  by reference to ""special interest"" lobbying  for a larger share of the budget, and more  than half use the word ""clout"" to identify  the villain.  We would not be shocked to discover that  certain editorial  rooms have spoken with  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  each other about the matter. Nor are we  surprised to observe behavior that seems at  least to be conscious parallelism if not con certed action. Our concern  instead begins  with the hypocrisy suggested in the hostile  commentary.  The double standard is best illustrated by  the Post's second editorial <Nov. 25, 1987),  asserting that supporters of the bill claim  ""with a wink""  that it won't increase the  budget, when ""of course"" the Post knows  that isn't true. So much for the integrity of  the President, 399 House members and vet erans' organizations to which belong some  seven million Americans.  The Post then expects its own arguments  to be accepted at face value when, after  paying lip service to the ""special obligation""  owed veterans (as do three-fourths of the  editorials we have read), it goes on to wave  the  flag of deficit  reduction and declare  that at some point, that obligation expires.  Why should the Post's pious handwringing  over  the deficit be  accepted as  its  real  agenda any more than the Post accepts as  genuine the rationale of the bill's support ers?  A clue to what this double standard may  conceal is contained in the Post's first edito rial <Nov. 12, 1987), which says the budget  problem will ""only get worse"" as World War  II veterans become eligible for benefits by  reason of age <current average: 65). The ref erence has more than demographic signifi cance, because it begs comparison with the  unmentioned, new generation of veterans  from the Vietnam War <average age: 40).  The significance of the generational issue  is threefold. First, the different experience  of the two wars produced different attitudes  that have been a crucial element of the divi siveness that has adversely affected veter ans' affairs for the last decade. Second, no  one can doubt the professional skepticism  bred in the media by the government's in formation policy during the Vietnam War.  Third, the Vietnam generation  is now as suming leadership in America's institutions,  including the media.  Our theory is that for powerful historical  reasons, certain like-thinking press leaders  may be perpetuating the divisions of the  Vietnam War by unconsciously working out  their generational conflicts in the forum of  veterans' affairs. At least, continuation of  those divisions can be the effect of the mon olithic reaction of newspapers so far moved  to comment on a Department of Veterans  Affairs.  The country has lived enough with the  image of Vietnam veterans popularized by  those who profit financially from extreme  stereotypes, pitted against  the  twin Goli aths of an ungrateful society and an insensi tive generation of earlier veterans by those  who profit  ideologically  from seeming  to  occupy the moral high ground.  President Reagan supports Cabinet status  for the VA partly out of a desire to honor  Vietnam veterans and Congressman Mont gomery believes the move will help heal the  wounds of the Vietnam era. Both are World  War II veterans. Every veterans' organiza tion  representative who  testified  at  the  Senate hearing on the bill, all of whom sup ported it, was a Vietnam veteran.  It is time to reflect the reality that Viet nam veterans are welcomed, not  to  say  treasured, part of the national mainstream  and that, in the critical area of veterans' af fairs, the older generation and the younger  are mutually reaching across the vanishing  divisions to face a united future.  We hope  that 1988-twenty years from  the Tet Offensive-will see  the establish319  ment of a Cabinet department in recogni tion of this truth, and as an occasion for  turning pens as well as swords into plow shares.  CHARLES E. JOECKEL, Jr.,  December 14, 1987.  Mr. Joeckel, a combat-disabled Vietnam  veteran, is executive director of the one-mil lion-member Disabled American Veterans.  A FAREWELL TO NANCY PIGMAN  HON. ROBERT GARCIA  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
34,,100,-0.559,319,1,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman of  the Subcommittee on  International Finance,  Trade, and Monetary Policy, I would like to ac knowledge the career of Ms. Nancy S. Pigman  in public service which spans 34 years-14  years  in Congress and 20 as Congressional  Relations Officer  for  the U.S. Export-Import  Bank.  Ms. Pigman joined the Eximbank in August  1967. She headed  the Bank's congressional  relations staff and was Eximbank's legislative  liaison with the U.S. Congress. Her job includ ed monitoring all  legislation directly affecting  or of interest to the Bank, responding to myr iads of requests for information from Members  of Congress and congressional committees,  and preparing appearances of Bank officers  before Congress.  Before  her  career with  Eximbank, Ms.  Pigman was an  intern  in  the office of U.S.  Congressman Jacob K. Javits of New York  and appropriations and legislative assistant to  U.S. Senator Leverett Saltonstall of Massa chusetts.  Thursday, January 28, 1988, will be Ms. Pig man's last day at the Eximbank but a begin ning of a new phase in life-retirement. Con gress will be  losing a valued  friend and  re source. Ms. Pigman was of top caliber among  the  congressional  relations officers of  the  Federal agencies. Having worked both  for  Congress and  the Bank, Ms. Pigman knew  well how to keep harmonious the relationship  between Congress and  the Eximbank. Many  of us who have dealt with her have truly bene fited from her thorough understanding of Ex imbank's  programs  and  the  congressional  process.  I congratulate  her  for her dedication  to  public service and would like to thank her for  a job well done.  I along with the subcommit tee members and staff will miss her dearly  and wish her Godspeed.  FREE WORLD LOSES GREAT  ALLY  HON. RICHARD K.

36,Senate,100,0.056,332,1,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President,  I  thank my colleague from Utah, Sena tor HATCH, for yielding time.  I rise not only as a cosponsor of the  amendment before us, but as one who  supports the general principles of the  Civil Rights Restoration Act. In light  of  the Supreme Court's decision  in  Grove City, there is a clear need to  strengthen and expand coverage of  the four civil rights statutes banning  various forms of discrimination in pro grams and activities that receive Fed eral funds.  With this said, however, I am also  troubled by several aspects of this bill,  including  its  impact on first amend ment rights as they relate to religious  liberty. Our country was founded on  principles of diversity and pluralism,  particularly with regard to the free ex ercise of religious beliefs as guaran teed by the Constitution. As currently  drafted, this bill does not adequately  protect these rights.  Let me explain. Title IX of the Edu cation Amendments of 1972, which I  voted for, prohibits gender discrimina tion in educational programs or activi ties  receiving  Federal  funds. That  title, however, contained an exemption  for educational institutions which are  ""controlled by  a  religious organization."" Under this exemption, an educa tional institution may seek an exemp tion from  the provisions of title IX  where application of that title ""would  not be consistent with  the religious  tenets of such organization."" Many  private religious colleges and universi ties teach fundamental religious prin ciples on such topics as marriage, chas tity, and abortion. Some religious edu cational  institutions, while believing  that educational and other opportuni ties  for men and women should be  fully  and completely  available,  also  teach  that  particular  distinctions  based on gender are both natural and  religiously significant. While this may  not be the viewpoint of any Senator,  surely we  all  support  the  right of  those institutions to follow the tenets  of their religion.  In 1972, the vast majority of these  religious  schools were directly  con trolled  by  church  denominations,  catholic dioceses and other religious  organizations. The current exemption  was adequate to protect each school's  first amendment right to the free ex ercise of their religious beliefs. I em phasize that was in 1972.  However, the form of association be tween these religious entities and their  private colleges and universities has  evolved over the past 16 years. And I  doubt if there are many Senators here  that are  fully  acquainted with  this  evolution. Today, many of these edu cational institutions, while still hold ing to their religious beliefs and doc trine, are controlled by lay boards and  have  additional  sources of  funding  beyond the religious organization.  Mr. President,  it  is pretty obvious  with the economics of private colleges  today,  that  they must  look beyond  those  denominational  constituencies  for sources of funding. They could not  exist if they did not.  The  ""religious  tenets""  exemption  from application of title IX, as pres ently worded, does not reflect this cur rent form of relationship in these in stitutions. Accordingly,  the ""control""  test for application of the exemption  no longer affords adequate protection  for religious values under title IX. The  current exemption must be amended  to reflect the changed nature of reli giously oriented institutions.  The amendment before us restores  full protection of religious values by  providing an exemption from title IX  based on  religious  tenets not only  when the institution is controlled by a  religious organization, but also when  an  educational  institution  ""closely  identifies with the tenets of"" that reli gious organization.  Keep in mind that we do not seek to  ""loosen"" this exemption. I am an ada mant supporter of the full application  of all civil rights laws. After 37 years  in public life,  I  think that record is  pretty well established. But I do not  share the fear that this amendment  in  will somehow create a loophole result ing  in widespread discrimination  education. This  amendment  simply  seeks to restore fully the constitution al protection of the free exercise of re ligious beliefs in religious educational  institutions,  therefore satisfying  the  intent of Congress when  it adopted  the ""religious  tenets"" exemption  to  title IX in 1972. The amendment will  protect  important nondiscriminatory  principles embodied  in  title  IX and  other civil rights statutes.  Let me remind my colleagues what  this amendment will not do. It is very  limited in scope and does not allow a  college to unilaterally claim a blanket  exemption from all  title IX require ments. There must be a policy or poli cies embodying a particular religious  tenet and a particular title IX regula tion  regarding gender discrimination  in conflict before the exemption will  apply. We still hold the control over  this, Mr. President, under  this act.  Title IX coverage will properly apply  to all other aspects of the institution's  activities.  Further, under the regulations pro mulgated by the Department of Edu cation, a college must still apply for  the exemption. The Department of  Education reviews each exemption re quest submitted, and grants or denies  the request based on the facts present ed. The Department of Education re tains  jurisdiction  to  investigate any  complaints or concerns raised regard ing the school's connection with the  particular religious organization, or if  there is concern about the legitimacy  of  the religious  tenet articulated by  the school.  Nor does the amendment permit an  educational  institution  to claim pro tection for differentiation on the basis  of race, handicap, or age. These civil  rights statutes are fully applicable.  Finally, the exemption is only avail able to schools which are ""controlled""  by a religious organization or ""closely  identified with the tenets of a particu lar religious organization."" The  lan guage places reasonable limits on the  class of eligible religious organizations.  Let me repeat, Mr. President, that  this amendment does not abrogate the  intent of title IX; but rather, reflects  the  actual  structure  of  religious  higher  education. The  amendment  strikes  a  constitutional balance be tween the need to promote the princi ples of equal rights, while allowing for  the legitimate exercise of religious lib erty.  Let  us  remember  that  the  first  amendment guarantees religious liber ty as well as free speech and other  rights.  This amendment has the support of  many organizations, including the U.S.  Catholic Conference, the National As sociation of Independent Colleges and  Universities, the Christian College Co",1988

38,Senate,100,0.196,358,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President,  I  obviously would like some time at the  end to rebut whatever is said. I will  not be given that.  The  issue before us  is simple, and  that is whether the U.S. Senate wants  to leave up to the Federal courts and  the regulatory agencies the possibility  of  requiring hospitals,  colleges, and  universities to fund or perform abor tions when abortions are contrary to  the moral sentiments or religious sen timents of  those organizations. It is  very simple.  The  characterization  by  Senator  METZENBAUM  is absolutely erroneous.  There is no element of discrimination.  This does not have anything  to do  with Roe versus Wade. The question is  not whether a woman has the right to  an abortion, but the right to pick a  hospital to give her an abortion or to  have it paid for by a hospital or insti tution or has a physician that is con trary to the basic principle of abor tion.

As I said, we have this last resort pro vision  that says  if they have  fewer  than  15  employees,  then  they  can  ref er the person to another provider  where the facilities are accessible. So  we leave plenty of room in there for  the mom and pops who absolutely do  not want to build that ramp, who do  not want to provide the facility to help  a handicapped person to shop in that  store. They can ref er them down the  street to someone else who has such  accessibility. That is not too much to  ask in our society.  In 1964, we passed the Civil Rights  Act  in  this country. We said people  could not discriminate on the basis of  race, religion, sex, or national origin.  In 1973, we passed the National Reha bilitation Act, section 504, which the  Senator is amending, extending those  rights to handicapped people but only  to those who are recipients of Federal  aid.  I will go the Senator one better: We  have to extend the same Civil Rights  Act of 1964 that applied to individuals  of this country on the basis of sex, re ligion,  race,  and national origin  to  handicapped people, too. We are not  doing that here.  We are saying  that under section  504,  those  small  amounts  of  civil  rights we give to handicapped people  in terms of accessibility in our society,  we  are going  to assure  those  civil  rights.  To back off with an amendment like  that we back down on our commit ment to handicapped people to equal  treatment in our society. It is a step  backward that no one in this Senate, I  am sure, wants to take.  EXHIBIT 1  CONSORTIUM  FOR  CITIZENS WITH  'DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,  January 28, 1988.  DEAR SENATOR: The undersigned member  organizations of  the Consortium for Citi zens with Developmental Disabilities strong ly urges you to reject Senator Humphrey's  proposed amendment  to  the Civil Rights  Restoration Act which would exempt small  providers  from  compliance  requirements  currently in place under Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As representa tives of many of America's 36 million citi zens with disabilities, we find it most discon certing that Congress would consider limit ing already existing protections in the proc ess of restoring those which were lost.  Senator Humphrey has wrongly charac terized  the  requirements embodied under  the Section 504  regulations  as  ""burden some"", somehow failing  to  recognize  that  those very regulations do in fact provide for  an extremely flexible small provider excep tion. This exception has anticipated the po tential difficulties which might be faced by  a small provider, and provides for a variety  of options which will allow the recipient to  comply with program accessibility require ments. In fact, since their inception in 1977,  the existing regulations have so well met  the  intent of Congress and  the needs of  small providers, that they have been direct ly incorporated into the Civil Rights Resto ration Act under Section 4.  In enacting the Rehabilitation Act fifteen  years ago, Congress understood the signifi cant barriers faced in our society by persons  with disabilities and sought to assure that  at least those segments of society which had  access to the resources of the federal gov ernment would not engage in the continuing  discrimination  against  and  exclusion  of  America's largest minority. It is unaccept able to permit any recipient of federal funds  to  engage  in  the  discriminatory  actions  which would be permitted under Senator  Humphrey's proposal.  Senator Humphrey's amendment  is not  only unnecessary, it will roll back the clock  on  the  progress  already made. We  are  asking you today to reaffirm your support  of those protections which Congress has al ready extended to our nation's citizens with  disabilities.

40,Senate,100,-0.397,371,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, Senator  HUMPHREY'S  amendment  to  exempt  ""small providers"" from any responsi bility to provide access to persons with  physical handicaps is another response  to apprehensions rather than reality,  and I urge my colleagues to reject it.  When  the  section 504  regulations  were promulgated by HEW  in 1977,  small providers were given alternatives  to  making  expensive  structural  changes in their facilities. The regula tions for all  recipients require ""pro gram accessibility""; structural changes  are frequently not necessary to ensure  that the program or activity is avail able  to  individuals with handicaps.  The regulations  for small providers,  those with fewer than 15 employees,  are even more flexible. To avoid signif icant costs to small, low-budget provid ers,  the  regulations provide another  alternative; if small providers cannot  make their programs accessible, they  may ref er individuals with handicaps  to other providers which are accessi ble.  The bill responds to concerns that  have continued to be raised by those  who are not familiar with the flexibil ity of the existing regulations. S. 557  includes the small provider exception  from the regulations to indicate clear ly  that small providers are not  re quired to make significant structural  alterations to their existing facilities.  They can provide the services through  ",1988
41,Senate,100,0.589,384,1,Mr. HUMPHREY.," I thank the Sena tor for that response.  Inquiring fur ther, is it the Senator's understanding  that this amendment does nothing to  change the current laws regarding rea sonable accommodation as it applies to  individuals with handicaps who cannot  perform the duties of the job?  ",1988
42,Senate,100,-0.319,384,1,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President,  this  amendment would undo  the United  States Supreme Court's decision  in  School Board of Nassau County versus  Arline, which held  that  individuals  with contagious diseases  are handi capped within the meaning of section  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  and are therefore protected from dis crimination based on  their medical  condition.  The factual question posed in Arline  was narrow: Are employees suffering  from  contagious diseases  subject  to  automatic termination, without regard  for any actual incapacity or risk of in fection? The Court's answer was corre spondingly clear: Groundless fears do  not alone justify terminating an em ployee with a contagious disease.  The question in Arline surfaced in  the Supreme Court because, in adopt ing the Rehabilitation Act, Congress  had given statutory protection to the  handicapped without enumerating the  specific conditions  to which  the act  would apply. Of course, Congress cus tomarily acts by categories; groups are  as central to the legislative process as  cases are to the courts. Still, it is easier  to articulate a general principal than  to apply it in a threatening situation  or uphold it in a difficult case.  The Rehabilitation Act was needed  and  passed  because  human  beings  often harbor an unreasonable dread of  diseases and disorders. It is precisely  because AIDS  is surrounded by  this  same unreasonable and unwarranted  fear and distaste  that the Supreme  Court's decision was  sensible. The  logic of  the Rehabilitation Act de mands that we make no distinctions  where no reasonable grounds for dif ferentiation exist.  In adopting an amendment contrary  to  the Arline  decision,  we  would  embody the prejudices that we over came and precluded in the Rehabilita tion Act. However, a number of un pleasant realities pertaining to AIDS  give us additional reasons to reject the  proposed amendment.  Some of us, and many Americans,  seem  to  feel  that we  can confront  people with AIDS as adversaries or en emies and forcibly control the spread  of AIDS. I don't believe that would be  morally acceptable, but even if it were,  it is impossible. We will control AIDS  only through cooperation, education,  and respect.  By September 18, 1987, the Center  for Disease  Control  had  reported  51,361 cases of AIDS, and it was clear  then that many cases had not been  properly diagnosed or reported. The  Public Health Service estimates that  more than 270,000 cases of AIDS will  be diagnosed by 1991. According to the  CDC,  there may be as many as 100  people who carry HIV, the virus that  causes AIDS,  for  each person with  AIDS. An estimated 25-50 percent of  those who are HIV positive may devel op AIDS within 5 to 10 years.  I hope that we will not resort to har assing and rejecting people who have  been exposed to AIDS. In any event, it  is clear that we do not have the capac ity to identify and control the millions  of people who may become contagious  with AIDS, half of whom may never  display any symptoms, and most of  whom would not be eager to be diag nosed and subjected to discrimination.  A program of contact tracing, for ex ample, would become impossible under  such circumstances. A  threat of  im prisonment is not likely to be very eff ective against someone who has been  diagnosed with AIDS, even if our pris ons were equipped to hold numbers of  fatally ill individuals.  Only with the trust and cooperation  of those who suffer from AIDS, can  we  continue  to seek effective  treat ment for AIDS, and to discover treat ments that prevent antibody-positive  individuals  from developing  the dis ease.  Even if our compassion fails us in  the  face of AIDS,  I hope  that our  powers of reason will still allow us to  recognize the realities that must dic tate our response to AIDS. It is futile  to call for measures that cannot beef fective and simply reflect our most un worthy reactions to AIDS, drug users,  and homosexuals. Further, we would  generate panic and cruelty  that we  could never extinguish.  Instead, we  must commit ourselves  to a  realistic  and balanced approach to AIDS. We  can begin by rejecting  the proposed  amendment.  ",1988
43,Senate,100,-0.214,397,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  the Chair and I thank my friend from  that great State where he served with  such great distinction as the attorney  general.

RESPONSE OF SENATOR BYRD  AND  SPEAKER WRIGHT  TO  THE  PRESIDENT'S STATE OF  THE UNION  ",1988
44,Senate,100,-0.326,397,1,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  on last Monday evening, January 25,  1988,  the President  of  the United  States delivered  to  the Congress  a  message on the State of the Union. By  tradition, the party not occupying the  White House is afforded the priviledge  to respond to the President's address.  It was with  great  pride  that  I  watched, as did other West Virginians,  the Democratic view of the State of  the Union. Along with the Speaker of  the House  of Representatives,  JIM  WRIGHT, my distinguished and  able  senior colleague,  the majority leader  of the U.S. Senate, Senator ROBERT C.  BYRD, stated their view of the State of  the Union to America.  Mr.  President,  I  commend  the  leader, and Speaker WRIGHT, for their  fine  remarks  to  the people of  this  country.  I ask unanimous consent that Sena tor BYRD'S and Speaker WRIGHT'S re marks be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  re marks were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER ROBERT c. BYRD DEMOCRATIC VIEW OF THE STATE OF THE  UNION  The state of the union has changed dra matically  since my boyhood  in  the coal  fields of West Virigina. I grew up in the De pression yearsand came to Washington as  Harry Truman was leaving office. I've seen  America in distress. And I've seen us at our  best-innovative, forceful, generous.  I've  learned a  thing or  two about  the  greatness of America and what holds us to gether. I've learned how quickly adversity  strikes-the stock market crash of '29, Pearl  Harbor,  the death of John Kennedy-and  how our country struggled back each time  to renewed vision and strength.  I've also learned that predictions of the  future more often bear the glitter of hope  than the tarnish of reality.  Tonight House Speaker Jim Wright and I  will take a  look at the state of the union  from a different perspective. We will ex plore what government has done-and what  it must do in the future. Our assessment of  America will be  tougher  than  the Presi dent's. But it's anchored to the same faith  in our peopleand the same hopes for the  future.  I'm  a  Democrat whose  politics were  shaped in an era of hard times-from the  small world of coal mines and company  stores.  Back then my foster father earned  two  dollars a day as a miner. Our life was as  spare as it was close-knit. As a small commu nity we hung  together-and endured. We  had our disappointments and our sorrows.  There was no such  thing as unemploy ment compensation, or social security. Our  horizons were limited-and our choices few.  I graduated as valedictorian of my high  school and was lucky to get a job pumping  gas at $50 a month.  But out of that grim time came a Presi dent and a government that lifted the spirit  of America. Never before-or since-has this  nation been galvanized by such force.  We came out of World War II with a new  confidence-and a  new promise. For  the  first time my people-working people-had  some security against deep poverty. We had  better working conditions in the mines. The  elderly didn't have to turn to their children  to take them in.  Looking back, we did the obvious. We rose  to the crises of our time. Yet, for me, the  images remain-and with  them  the  truth  that government is best measured by how  well it responds to the peoples' needs.  Since then I have watched this nation and its government-seek its way through a  changing maze of economic and political cir cumstances-from Medicare  to  the Great  Society. The anguish that was Vietnam. The  arrogance that was Watergate. The promise  that was Camp David.  Then dawned the Reagan years-and the  profound experiment. If the Roosevelt and  Truman presidencies were born of necessity,  the presidency of Ronald Reagan was born  of  ideology-and  a  technicolor  view  of  America and our people.  It opened with the promise to get govern ment off our backs. It offered the mystical  formula of ""supply side"" economics which  claimed  that a huge buildup of military  spending and enormous tax cuts for corpo rations and the rich would lead to a bal anced budget in three years. It was an Ad ministration  that sought to make us feel  good with images of ""morning in America.""  It was a time when the President and his  presidency became separated in our minds.  As a man, Ronald Reagan has withstood  physical pain with grace. He has carried the  nation's grief at times of loss. He has always  been at ease with his beliefs. A man who can  touch the nation's humor-and make us feel  better than we sometimes should.  As  President,  his  greatest  victory  has  come at the negotiating table. The arms re duction  treaty,  though  limited  is a mile stone on the road to a safer world.  But his political victories have not always  been national triumphs.  The dark side of the Reagan years has  only begun to loom. Instead of a balanced  budget, he has presided over a doubling of  the national debt in seven years. Our record  budget and trade deficits-once just abstract  numbers-have now forced the government  to default on its most fundamental prom ises-like education and health. We have  surrendered economic leadership in markets  around the world.  Our nation has been sharply divided on  the question of Central America. The secret  arms-for-hostages deals stand in direct con tradiction to our given word not to deal with  terrorists. The cases of cronyism and abuses  of power  for  personal  gain  continue  to  mount in Washington's courtrooms.  We've come  to  the end of an era. The  ""feel good""  slogans have gone  flat with  time. We've  learned  that bravado  is not  leadershipthat  ideology  is no substitute  for common sense.  The time has finally come for us all to  face the hard truths that once gave us our  self-reliance  and world  leadership. Hard  work-on the job and in the classroom. Pay  as you go-no free lunches, no running away  from the bills due. Helping those in need but not those with greed.  It was right here on the Senate Floor that  Congress worked with Franklin Roosevelt to  help end the Depression-and to win a war.  ",1988
45,Senate,100,-0.301,410,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  since June 1981, over 28,000 people  have died of AIDS. One-quarter of  these deaths, 7 ,000 people, have result ed from intravenous drug use. Accord ing to the Centers for Disease Control,  between 50 and 60 percent of intrave nous drug users, as many as 335,000,  are infected with the AIDS virus.  The AIDS virus  is spread through  the interaction of bodily fluids. This  occurs when a needle used  to inject  heroin is used by another individual to  do  the  same. That needle has  the  blood of  the  first user, which  the  second user is exposed to when using  the same needle. This is the primary  way in which AIDS is spread among  intravenous drug users.  It is not only the intravenous drug  users themselves that are contracting  AIDS. They are spreading AIDS  to  their sexual partners and children. All  these people will die; 53 percent of all  AID-related deaths in New York City  occur among intravenous drug users.  As many as 350 children have died al ready from the AIDS virus contracted  from their mother, and the number of  children born with the AIDS virus is  growing daily. According  to a  study  conducted by Dr. Lloyd Novick, 1 out  of every 60 newborns  in New York  City are born with the AIDS virus.  Children are dying. Mothers and fa thers are dying. We are witness to this  and seem powerless to stop it.  But we are not powerless.  We have the means to reach these  people, break their habit, and stop the  spread of AIDS.  This is not the first time intravenous  drug use has threatened to wipe out a  good number of people in our society.  In 1969, when I was a Special Assist ant for Urban Affairs  for President  Nixon, the crisis was heroin, a narcotic  derived from the poppy plant. At that  time, poppy plants were grown primar ily in Turkey, processed into heroin in  Marseilles,  and  then  smuggled  into  New York.  In order  to cut off  the supply of  heroin, I persuaded the President to  provide  financial  assistance  to help  Turkish farmers make the transition  from a poppy-based to a more general  agricultural economy. With our help,  the program to eradicate illicit poppy  production succeeded and the French  Connection  collapsed,  creating  a  severe  shortage of heroin  in  every  major drug center in the country.  It worked. Heroin use  in all our  cities went down. Crime went down.  But now poppy production has moved  to Pakistan, Burma,  and Thailand.  Iran and Syria have replaced France  as heroin processing centers. We have  had some cooperation with these coun tries to stop poppy production but not  enough. In the last decade, heroin use  has reemerged, and with the onset of  AIDS, has become even more destruc tive.  Just last year, in an effort to control  the  growing  problem, Congress  en acted a major antidrug abuse law. It  authorized $1.7 billion for prevention  and treatment of illicit drug use and  research into ways of breaking drug  addiction, most  notably with  sub stances known as narcotic antagonists  which block nerve endings so that the  effects of narcotics cannot be felt by  the user. But the Reagan administra tion, less than 4 months after the en actment of this much touted piece of  legislation, proposed a $900 million cut  in antidrug abuse programs. Fortu nately, Congress was able  to restore  some of this money, but not nearly  enough.  The bill I introduce today, the Intra venous Drug Abuse and AIDS Preven tion Act, was introduced by Congress man RANGEL on September 16, 1987. As  chairman of the House Select Commit tee on Narcotics, Congressman RANGEL  has led the long and difficult battle  against drug abuse. I have been privi leged to work with him in the past and  am proud to do so again.  This bill seeks to attack this problem  where it lives. It provides $100 million  for  the  Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services  to make grants for  nonprofit organizations for treatment  services to intravenous drug users; 75  percent of these funds will go to areas  with a high incidence of drug use and  AIDS. The  remaining 25 percent of  funds will go  to areas which have a  low incidence of AIDS but a high inci dence of drug use and therefore have  the potential for widespread AIDS in fection.  In addition, $50 million is authorized  for demonstration projects to reduce  the incidence of AIDS in infants and  to care for infants infected with AIDS.  These funds could be used to provide  prenatal care for women who are in travenous drug users, services to par ents of infected children, foster care  for children with AIDS, counseling,  education  and  testing  services  for  women at risk for AIDS by virtue of  drug use or sexual contact with drug  users, and pregnant women  infected  with the AIDS virus.  Lastly, $50 million  is provided for  grants  for outreach and counseling  programs to prevent intravenous drug  use among minority groups. We have  appropriated $14 million specifically  for outreach AIDS education to mi nority communities. Too little.  The  responsibility  is  clear:  If we  don't inform our citizens of the dan gers of drug use in and of itself and its  direct link to the spread of AIDS, we  fail in our duty as public officials and  as fellow human beings.  I ask unanimous consent that an edi torial  in the January 23, 1988, New  York Times entitled, ""Contain AIDS  by Treating Addicts"" be printed in the  RECORD.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill and ask unanimous consent that  the text be printed in the RECORD  in  full.  There being no objection,  the bill  and  the  letter were ordered  to be  printed in the RECORD, as follows:  s. 2014  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION J. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Intravenous  Substance Abuse and AIDS Prevention Act  of 1988"".  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds that:  < 1) More  than 38,000 cases of acquired  immune deficiency syndrome <AIDS) have  been reported  to  the Centers for Disease  Control, and more than 270,000 such cases  are expected to be reported by 1991.  (2) Intravenous substance abusers are the  second largest group in the United States  that has AIDS. Of the cases of AIDS report ed to the Centers for Disease Control, 17  percent are attributable to intravenous sub stance abuse and such abuse was a  risk  factor in an additional 8 percent.  (3) HIV <the virus causing AIDS) is trans mitted among intravenous substance abus ers through the use and sharing of needles,  syringes, swabs, or other drug-related imple ments that are contaminated with blood in fected with HIV.  < 4) HIV can be transmitted rapidly among  intravenous substance abusers in a given ge ographic area. Once a group of intravenous  substance abusers becomes exposed to HIV,  such abusers become the primary source for  heterosexual  transmission  and  perinatal  transmission of HIV.  ",1988
46,,100,-0.404,449,1,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  this Saturday,  January 30, 1988, our colleague from Massa chusetts, BARNEY FRANK, will be honored by  the  Japanese American  community  for his  outstanding work on  redress  legislation. This  honor comes as no surprise,  for BARNEY'S  tireless work as chairman of the Subcommit tee on Administrative Law and Governmental  Relations was crucial to the development and  eventual passage of H.R. 442, the Civil Liber ties Act of 1987.  BARNEY'S outstanding efforts on behalf of  this legislation add to a lengthy list of his con tributions  to  the  cause of civil  rights and  human dignity. His  involvement  in  the civil  rights movement, his career in the Massachu setts House  of Representatives,  and  his  record  in Congress distinguish BARNEY as a  foremost advocate  for  justice and  fairness.  BARNEY FRANK has established himself as a  passionate and articulate defender of the prin ciples which have made the United States the  great Nation it is today.  Mr. Speaker, by  forcing Japanese Ameri cans into internment camps, the United States  Government strayed from its pursuit of liberty  and  justice. We are  fortunate, however,  to  have a colleague like BARNEY FRANK to help  this Nation straighten its course.  19-059 0-89-15 (Pt. 1)  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  SAN FRANCISCO GIRLS CHORUS  IS CHOSEN TO PERFORM  IN  HUNGARY  HON.

60,Senate,100,0.491,553,1,Mr. HECHT.," Mr. President,  it  is  with great honor that I rise today to  pay  homage  to  a  fellow Nevadan  whose dedication  to  the practice of  medicine and  the people of Nevada  will not soon be forgotten. Dr. Mary  Fulstone was born in Eureka, NV,  in  August 1892  and moved  to Carson  City, NV, with her  family  in 1896  where  she  graduated  from Carson  High School in 1911. Through the per sistence of Mary's classmates, she was  persuaded to seek a career in medicine.  Mary received her M.D. from the Uni versity of California at Berkeley  in  1918. In 1919, she married Fred Ful stone  and  later moved  to  Smith  Valley, NV, and began her life at the  Fulstone sheep ranch.  Women physicians, Mr. President,  were  indeed rare in the early 1920's  whereby the community of ranchers,  miners, and  Indians were somewhat  taken aback by her presence in this  scarcely populated area. The commu nity soon grew accustomed  to  their  new physician and quickly came  to  love her as one of their own. Dr. Mary  soon  found herself examining more  than 50 patients a day in Smith Valley  and the Yerington area, often making  housecalls by horse and buggy. Dr.  Mary was best known for her profi ciency in delivering babies. She deliv ered approximately 5,000 babies in her  65 years of service in medicine.  During  these deliveries, Dr. Mary  was well known  for having  fathers  present during births, long before this  practice was considered the norm. She  would often ask the ranchers to aid  her in the deliveries, thus furthering  the role of the father during the birth  process.  Mr. President, Dr. Mary, a mother of  five, also held a teaching degree which  was a tremendous tool in dealing with  people on a personal level. She served  24 years on the Smith Valley School  Board and 12 years on  the Nevada  Board of Education.  Through her great sense of charity,  she was often known to pay for the  medical expenses of the less fortunate  as well as performing medical services  free  of  charge  for  those without  means.  Her awards have  included Nevada  Mother  of  the Year  in  1961  and  Nevada Doctor of the Year in 1963. As  a member of the Soroptimist Interna tional, she received the organization's  Women's Achievement Award in 1975.  The Lyon Health Center in Yerington  dedicated a new wing of their facility  in 1963 to her, where she herself spent  time after back surgery in 1975 and  1978. In the late 1970's, she was inter viewed by all the national television  networks  including  news  programs  such as CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and others.  A plaque at  the entrance  to  the  Lyon Health Center sums up the atti tude of Lyon County residents toward  Dr. Mary Fulstone,  Dedicated  to  our Dr. Mary Fulstone,  whose medical skill and helping hand have  protected and guided  us  through many  years: a faithful wife,  loving mother, and  philanthropist to all mankind.  Though this Senate Chamber could  not begin to hold the number of indi viduals brought into this world by Dr.  Mary, I am sure, that were they here,  their applause would be deafening for  this great lady, who for 65 years, un selfishly  dedicated  herself  to  the  people of N evada.e  NATIONAL VOCATIONAL  EDUCATION WEEK  e ",1988
61,Senate,100,-0.426,553,1,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr.  President,  as  many of my colleagues are aware, next  week is National Vocational Education  Week. I would like to rise today to ex press my continued support for  this  very important program.  This  year's  theme  is  ""Vocational  Education:  the Competitive Edge,""  which I believe is highly appropriate.  Strengthening and maintaining educa tional programs is essential for meet ing important national goals, especial ly the goal of improving our ability to  compete in the world economy. Voca tional education programs can help us  reach that goal by making sure that  each individual can fully develop his  or her God-given talents and capabili ties. Developing highly skilled workers  and retraining the existing work force  to meet new needs is essential if we  are to strengthen our national com petitiveness.  Three fourths of today's jobs require  vocational or  technical  skills. Voca tional education is a fundamental part  of  this Nation's employment-related  education and  training programs. In  my State of Michigan, there are over  300,000 students enrolled in vocation",1988

111,Senate,100,0.304,644,1,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr.  President,  this  afternoon the Committee on Foreign  Relations met to discuss Senate Joint  Resolution 243 pursuant to the con tinuing resolution to provide addition al authority and assistance for Nicara guan  resistance. Mr. President,  the  committee did hold a meeting. The  distinguished chairman of the commit tee is here with me presently. It is my  understanding that a majority of the  committee members were not present  in the room during the course of that  meeting. Rule IV of the Senate For eign Relations Committee rules insists  that ""A majority of the membership  of  the committee shall constitute a  quorum for reporting any measure or  recommendation  to  the  Senate.""  Stated another way,  the committee  rules say no measure or recommenda tion shall be ordered reported from  the committee unless a majority of the  committee members  are  physically  present.  Mr. President,  rule XXVI of  the  Senate-I cite page 971 of the Senate  procedures-it provides that:  The vote of any committee to report a  measure or matter shall require the concur rence of a majority of the members of the  committee who are present.  On that same page, 971, in the next  paragraph, it says:  The Chair has ruled that a report not au thorized by the concurrence of more than  one-half of a majority of the entire mem bership of the committee, exclusive of prox ies, cannot be received by the Senate upon  objection.  Therefore, Mr. President,  I  ask a  point  of  parliamentary  inquiry.  I  would  like  to ask  the Chair  if  the  Chair  is prepared  to discharge  the  committee inasmuch as the committee  report was filed without a quorum.  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.  ",1988
112,Senate,100,0.078,670,1,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, recently  a  customs  fraud  case has  surfaced  which has grave implications for the  safety of American children. Today's  fraud involves the deliberate misclassi fication of flammable children's sleep wear, made  of  cotton but  dubbed  ""playwear,"" which has been purposely  redesigned  to  circumvent U.S. Cus toms regulations and Consumer Prod uct Safety Commission CCPSCl codes.  The magnitude of the danger is diffi cult to quantify due to the fact that  infant  wear  is  categorized  with  women's and girl's clothing when en tered. However, as the details involved  with this fraud clearly indicate, trage dy for American children may soon  emerge  unless we  take  immediate  action on this matter.  The  consumer movement  in  this  country was galvanized  in  the  late  1960's by the growing number of se verely burned children due to flamma ble clothing. A mother's horror of  watching her  child,  clad  in cotton  playwear, suddently burst into flames  after  the child's arm passes over a  burning candle or after contact from a  spark jumping from a fireplace cannot  be  described. Concerned Americans  acted. The result was a CPSC regula tion  established  in  1971 which  re quired chemical treatment for all chil dren's sleepwear. After this nonflam mable  treatment  agent,  Tris, was  found  to be carcinogenic,  the CPSC  determined that only 100 percent poly ester materials would meet the strin gent CPSC standards for nonflamma bility of children's sleepwear.  Children's clothing manufacturers in  the United States have complied with  the 100 percent polyester regulation  since 1971, and the number of chil dren's  deaths  caused  from burning  dropped from an average of 60 per  year in 1970  to an average of 2 per  year in 1982. More recently this pro tective measure for American children  has been  threatened by 100 percent  cotton  ""playwear""  imported  from  GA TT signatories and others hoping  to cash  in on  the projected rise  in  American birth rates.  The CPSC Enforcement Policy on  Children's Sleepwear,  published  in  May 1986, is currently being used by  foreign children's clothing manufac turers as an industrial blueprint to cir cumvent CPSC regulations. Some de signers have successfully imported 100  percent  cotton  children's sleepwear  after originally receiving a restraining  order on their garments simply by al tering their designs to avoid applica tion of CPSC restrictions. Others bla tantly advertise  this playwear with  promotional receiving blankets which  match the clothing. These Japanese  and French exporters are clearly vio lating article XX of the GATT which  states  that signatories must comply  with national measures designed  to  protect human health.  Mr. President, this fraud is a classic  example of misrepresentation to Cus toms officials at U.S. borders made all  the worse by the concomitant viola tion of CPSC regulations and the obvi ous danger to children's lives. This is a  case where foreign manufacturers de liberately  produce what Americans  consider dangerous and have banned,  then export  these products  to  the  United States by fraudulently-for ex ample-misnaming  sleepwear  as  playwear. A private right of action for  customs  fraud,  as  included  in  the  Senate version of the trade bill, would  help us combat these dangerous and  pernicious practices.   A DESPERATE WINTER FOR  ROMANIANS  e ",1988
113,Senate,100,0.508,670,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  today, Washington, DC, is experienc ing something of a mid-winter heat  wave. However, the people of Romania  have no such luxury. In fact, due to a  government  decree  that went  into  effect nationwide on November 10, the  use of electricity and gas has been re duced by 30 percent. This means that  most Romanians are  living  in  flats  where  the  temperature  rarely  rises  above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It is im portant  to  remember  that during a  similar shortage last year, there were  widespread reports of many babies and  senior citizens dying due to the cold.  Energy is not the only item in short  supply.  In  mid-December,  West  German Foreign Minister Hans-Die trich Genscher met with Romanian  President Nicolae Ceausescu about the  hardships  being  suffered  by  the  230,000 ethnic Germans living in Ro mania. At the time, he offered to pro vide food aid to Romania to alleviate  some of the most severe food short ages since World War II. According to  a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  report, ""Bread is being rationed at 300  grams a day and few staples are available or affordable."" The difficulties  are being compounded by the impact  of wage cuts.  Instead of accepting  the generous  West German offer of assistance, Cea usescu refused assistance and has even  cut off delivery of packages mailed  from outside the country. According to  an Associated Press wire story dated  December 31, 1987, citing the Essen,  West Germany newspaper,  the New  Ruhr,  ""Two CWest German]  trucks  loaded with food supplies were turned  back at the Romanian border in recent  days. The newspaper said it was the  first time such a private shipment has  been refused entry into the shortage struck Communist Balkan  country.  Romanian Communist party officials  have rejected West German Govern ment offers of emergency shipments  of food and other supplies.""  The ethnic Germans are not  the  only people in Romania being denied  assistance. According to Laszlo Harnos  of  the Hungarian Human Rights  Foundation, many here in the United  States who ship packages to their rela tives in Romania have had them re turned  in recent months. He points  out, that the people of Romania will  be very cold and hungry this winter.  As sad and as terrible as it is to hear  about  the plight of  the Romanian  people, there is something that we in  the United States can do. First, an  amendment has been attached to both  the House and Senate trade bills that  would  suspend  most-favored-nation  trade status to the Romanian Govern ment for 6 months. The purpose of  the suspension is to show the Roma nian regime of Nicolae Ceausescu that  the American people expect Romania  to live up to its human rights obliga tions that have permitted it to receive  MFN status in the past. I encourage  the trade conferees to push forward  on  this amendment  to make certain  that it is included in the final trade  bill package.  In addition, we can all do something  today to indicate our support of the  Romanian people during this particu larly difficult time.  Earlier  this  month,  the  Czech  human  rights organization, Charter  77, called on all Europeans to stand in  solidarity with their brothers in Ro mania. It is a very unusual statement  for Charter 77  to make since it goes  beyond the borders of Czechoslovakia.  However,  its members felt  that the  Romanian people were  suffering  to  such an extreme degree that they mer ited the attention of the world.  Charter 77 has asked  that others  join with the Romanians  in turning  down their thermostats to 10 degrees  Celsius, or 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and  light their homes with no more than  two 40-watt light bulbs. By doing so,  word will get through to the Roma nians  that  they are not alone, but  ",1988
114,,100,-0.023,696,1,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, the  people of Pittsfield, MA, elected Charles L.  Smith as their mayor. He has served with dis tinction for four consecutive terms through a  period of profound growth and change in his  beloved hometown. During his tenure, Mayor  Smith brought to fruition such major projects  as:  the Vicon  resource  recovery plant,  the  Krofta water-filtration system, Taconic Busi ness Park, Westwood Business Center and  the final development of parcel 3. Completing  any one of these projects would be outstand ing legacy for any mayor, but Charlie did them  all and Pittsfield is a better place because of  him.  But Charlie wasn't just a big projects mayor.  He knows  that a good mayor must run and  maintain a compassionate and efficient admin istration and that he must make time to per sonally deal with  constituent problems. He  must also plow the roads, pick up the garbage  and fill the potholes, services you never hear  about until something goes wrong. But with  Charlie, very little went wrong.  Those that know Charlie best know that he  is a dedicated public servant, family man and  above all else, his own person. As a public  servant, he has served long and well as a city  counselor and city council president. As family  man he and his lovely wife Pat raised 7 beau tiful children of their own as well as an aston ishing 60  foster children. As his own man,  Charlie never created a political machine be cause he wanted to do all the work himself, in  the hands on style  that  is his outstanding  characteristic.  For all his productive life Charlie has cared  and worked for others. He is a man of infinite  patience, dedication, and compassion-he is  a  fine public servant. But Mr. Speaker,  last  year Charlie decided not  to seek  reelection  but rather  to seek new goals  in  the private  sector. I know it was not an easy decision for  Charlie, but if he pursues his new career  in  the same manner in which he has lived his life  he will find only happiness, friendship and sat isfaction. I know I speak for all the people of  Pittsfield when I say congratulations for a job  well done and good luck in your new career.  NATIONAL SALUTE TO  HOSPITALIZED VETERANS  HON. G. V.

115,,100,-0.644,696,1,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, the continuing  controversy over Contra aid has obscured the  tragic reality that this administration has also  been undermining  the  implementation of the  Arias peace plan in El Salvador.  Last year United States military and eco nomic aid  to  the current Government of El  Salvador exceeded that nation's entire annual  budget. This military aid has resulted in perva sive killing and destruction, and a resurgence  in death-squad and other  terrorist activities,  with the tacit approval of the army and certain  elements in the Government.

116,Senate,100,0.342,709,1,Mr. GRASSLEY.," I thank the distin guished ranking minority member for  yielding 3 minutes to me so that I can  tell this body that I am very pleased to  support President ,Reagan's choice of  Judge Anthony Kennedy  to  the Su preme Court.  One week ago in the Judiciary Com mittee,  I announced my reasons for  supporting Judge Kennedy's nomina tion. I will not repeat that rationale  here. Instead, I should like to focus on  a related and important issue, one that  is particularly relevant in the wake of  the Bork, Ginsburg,  and Kennedy  nominations.  That issue is the role the Senate Ju diciary Committee has permitted the  American Bar Association to play in  the Supreme Court nomination proc ess.  As my colleagues know, I am not a  lawyer. Those of my many colleagues  who are lawyers know the ABA as an  association representing about half of  the country's practicing attorneys.  But the Judiciary Committee-with  the executive branch as  its accom plice-has permitted the ABA a  role  that far exceeds its rightful influence.  The ABA's standing committee on  the Federal Judiciary currently con ducts an evaluation process which pur ports to be an objective assessment of  professional competence-but, in prac tice, has become quite vulnerable to  partisan politics.

119,Senate,100,-0.188,735,1,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, I rise to  support  the nomination of Anthony  Kennedy to be a Justice on the Su preme Court of the United States.  I do not object to the nomination of  judicial conservatives to the Supreme  Court. I tend to believe that the Presi dent is entitled to nominate those that  share his philosophy, and I have voted  for judicial conservatives in the past.  When I voted against the nomination  of Judge Robert Bork, I opposed him  not because he was a judicial conserva tive, but because I had serious ques tions about his views on fundamental  constitutional issues: The interaction  between  the powers of Government  and individual liberties and the role he  sees for the Court in protecting indi vidual rights guaranteed by our Con stitution. I concluded that his view of  the Constitution leads to a much more  cramped and narrow view in many im portant areas including civil rights and  the right to privacy. These views had  no place on the Highest Court of the  land responsible for the interpretation  of the Constitution.  In contrast, I feel very comfortable  with  Judge Kennedy's fundamental  views on the Constitution and the role  it plays in our society. During his con firmation hearing, he stated:  I do not have an overarching theory, or a  unitary  theory  of  interpretation.  I  am  searching * * * for  the correct balance  in  Constitutional interpretation.  When commenting directly on the  Constitution and the role of the Su preme Court in applying its provisions,  he said:  ",1988
120,Senate,100,0.575,761,1,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, today  I  join with my colleague from Louisi ana, Mr. BREAUX in introducing legisla tion to revise and extend the Aquatic  Resources Trust Fund, which is com monly known as  the Wallop-Breaux  Fund. The  trust  fund evolved  from  legislation enacted almost 40 years ago  to aid  in  research and management  programs  for  fisheries. The original  program,  the so-called Dingell-John son Fund,  imposed an excise tax on  iishing tackle and dedicated the reve nues to sport fish restoration projects  managed by State  fish and wildlife  agencies.  The program was funded by fisher men, and the revenues were dedicated  to the specific goal of improving the  fish  populations  in  our  lakes  and  streams. A successful and popular pro gram, the Dingell-Johnson Fund was  subject to demands which exceeded its  revenues. So, efforts were begun about  10 years ago to expand the fund. In  addition to increasing the tax on fish ing tackle, a new excise tax on fishing  boats was also considered. After some  controversy, a proposal was developed  by JOHN BREA ux, as a member of the  House Merchant Marine and Fisheries  Committee, to utilize a portion of the  motorboat fuel  tax for an expanded  sport fish program. As a member of  the  Senate  Finance Committee,  I  sponsored this proposal in the Senate.  The new program, the Aquatic Re sources Trust Fund, or Wallop-Breaux  Fund, was enacted into  law  in 1984.  The new fund included two specific ac counts, the sport fish restoration account and the boating safety account.  The accounts are true user funded ac counts, and  involve no general reve nues. The sport fish  restoration ac count  is  funded by  the  fish  tackle  excise tax, and as I mentioned earlier,  is dedicated to projects undertaken by  State fish and wildlife agencies. The  boating safety account  is  funded by  the motor-fuel excise tax, and is used  for boat safety programs run by the  States and the U.S. Coast Guard.  When Congress enacted the Wallop Breaux Fund  in 1984,  the proposal  contained a specific set-aside from the  fuel tax for the Boat Safety Program.  The first $45 million in fuel tax reve nues was reserved for the Boat Safety  Program. Any collected funds above  that amount would go  to  the Sport  Fish Restoration Program.  Two years ago, after extended dis cussion among the user groups, it was  suggested that the funding allocation  for boat safety programs be increased.  Congress responded favorably  to the  request, and revised  the $45 million  set-aside to $60 million as an amend ment to the Coast Guard authoriza tion bill. Last year, approval was again  given to the funding increase. The leg islation we  are  introducing  today  would make permanent the higher al location. We would thus avoid having  to amend the program every year to  provide an allocation agreed to by ev eryone.  Our bill would also reauthorize the  program for 10 years. Last,  the bill  would revise the list of in-kind contri butions the States can make to meet  their matching funding requirements  under the act.  The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund  is an example of a user funded pro gram which  serendipitously  has  a  public benefit. The changes we are  proposing today will only make a good  program better. I would urge my col league to join in supporting this legis lation.e  By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself,  Mr. DOLE, Mr.  SHELBY, Mr.  BOND,  Mr.  MATSUNAGA,  Mr.  CHAFEE,  Mr.  CHILES,  Mr.  SYMMS,  Mr.  BURDICK,  Mr.  HEINZ, Mr. METZENBAUM, Mr.  GRAMM,  Mr.  GLENN,  Mr.  DURENBERGER, Mr. KERRY, Mr.  GARN,  Mr.  PRYOR,  Mr.  WEICKER, Mr.  SANFORD, Mr.  McCAIN, Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr.  WARNER,  Mr.  CONRAD,  Mr.  LUGAR,  Mr.  STENNIS,  Mr.  QUAYLE, Mr. WIRTH, Mr. STAF FORD, Mr. EXON, Mr. McCLURE,  Mr. SARBANES, Mr. THURMOND,  ",1988

123,House,100,-0.07,787,1,Mr. JACOBS.," Mr. Chairman,  last  night our friend, Howard Baker chas tised the networks. He said for substi tuting their judgment for  the Presi dent's judgment about which of the  President's speeches was news.  Now I am very fond of Mr. Baker. I  just hope he has not been hanging  around with the leader of Russia, Gor bachev too much, because certainly in  the Soviet Union the politicians decide  whether  their speeches are news or  not. The news people follow suit.  Nonetheless, I must say the Presi dent has convinced me. First of all, the  President says he wants no new Feder al spending. Consequently I must cast  my district's vote  against  this new  Federal spending.  Second, the President describes the  Contras as the freedom fighters. Now  when you consider the fact that the  supreme military commander of  the  Contras  is one Enrique Bermudez, a  top military officer of the Somoza dic tatorship, you might think the Presi dent misses the mark, slightly, by call ing his organization freedom fighters.  But you  just do not understand the  term.  In fact, the Somoza national guard  has been fighting freedom for decades.  Therefore, I do not fault the President  for calling them freedom fighters.  I hear it said that the Washington  Post favors this legislation. I hear it  said that the Miami Herald favors this  legislation. Whoopee. Now  let us see  who  is against  this  legislation. The  American public by more than a 2-to-1  margin. And why? Because they know  that the history of the U.S. interven tion  in other people's countries and  other people's civil wars  is all about  the same, it follows suit also. First the  guns and then the sons.  And always  the pledge, when  the  fuse  is lighted that it will not reach  the dynamite, that young men will not  have to go.  Why do the young men go in every  case? And then we decide later what a  blunder  the Spanish-American War  was, what a blunder Vietnam was; the  very notion that the tip of the Asian  tail could wag the world. What foolish ness. Or as Barbara Tuchman has put  it so eloquently  in  the  title of her  great volume, ""What Folly"".  The answer is rather subtle to the  American public I think. It is because  the officials  in Washington, particu larly  those enshrined  in  the White  House, acquire an egoistic interest in  the position,  the erroneous position  they had taken before.  The French learned their lesson and  Mr. Johnson did not learn their lesson.  Mr. Johnson  learned his  lesson and  Mr. Nixon did not learn Mr. Johnson's  lesson.  The  ego  ""pride goeth before  the  fall,"" not of the President but of 18year-old kids dying an unspeakable  horror in jungles and in marshes.  Will Rogers said it about the very  country we are talking about now. He  said of Nicaragua ""The United States  will send in the Marines to any coun try where we can get 10 people  to  invite us.""  Finally,  the President has made a  concession in his speech last night. He  has proposed that the Congress can  share the complete power the Consti tution gives the Congress in the first  place to decide about military action  in other countries,  to declare war,  which we have  in effect,  if actions  speak louder than words, done in the  case of Nicaragua.  He says that later the Congress can  vote on whether the Sandinistas are  good guys, whether  the Sandinistas  have achieved at least the level of a  democracy where a White House aide  threatens  the  news  people  of  this  country if they will not do what the  politicians say in terms of interpreting  what the news is.  Now how many people in this House  are going to want to cast a vote to say  the Sandinistas are good guys? How  many people in this House think the  Sandinistas are good guys? How many  think they are not Marxists? That is  one of the slickest things a Hollywood  writer ever thought of yet.  Nobody will vote that way, nobody  thinks the Sandinistas are good guys.  Nobody thinks Castro is a good guy.  Nobody  thinks Gorbachev  and  his  outfit are good guys. And there are a  couple of us or more in the House, in cluding my friend Mr. BURTON  from  Indiana and myself who do not think  Communist Chinese are good guys, not  at  least good  enough  to  violate  a  United States statute and receive from  this country nuclear technology with out agreeing at least to what would  happen to the plutonium waste which  can be made  into military weapons.  The President wanted to do that; Mr.  BURTON did not want to do that, I did  not want to do that and I am happy to  say others voted against that.  So the question is, Are we going to  repeat the same folly of the past? The  answer I hope will be ""no.""  ",1988

125,House,100,0.387,787,1,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of House Resolution 444  to ap prove the President's request for aid  to the Nicaraguan Contras.  I  firmly believe  that if there ever  ~as a time to vote ""yes'', a ""yes"" vote  on the Contra aid,  then the  time  is  now; here today in this place, in this  hallowed Chamber, a symbol of a free  people.  My colleagues, in the 10 hours that  are allocated to debate this measure, I  am sure that every aspect of this issue  will be  thoroughly and exhaustively  debated.  0 1200  However, I do not want us to be so  consumed in the details of this impor tant subject as to miss the overall pic ture. So allow me to off er a broader  perspective.  When discussing United States aid  to the Nicaraguan Contras, we often  hear opponents of this assistance use  this phrase: ""Give peace a chance.""  Well, we here  in Congress need  to  fully understand  that peace  is not  merely the absense of war; true peace  can only be enjoyed in a land where  freedom and liberty abound.  Our Founding Fathers clearly un derstood this and were willing to risk  all that they had in pursuit of freedom  from tyranny. Having just celebrated  the bicentennial of our Constitution  last year, I am amazed at how many  Members here today seem to have for gotten this inescapable fact. What we  should be pursuing in Central America  is freedom, for where there is freedom,  peace will also be present. Therefore, I  say, give freedom a chance and vote to  support aid to the Contras.  Let me say  to my colleagues that  over 210 years ago in a little country  called the United States there was a  cry  from  the halls  in Philadelphia  saying, ""Give me  liberty or give me  death.""  ",1988
126,House,100,0.556,813,1,Mr. SHUMWAY.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  We have heard several times in the  debate  today and before today from  those who oppose continued funding  for the Contras in Nicaragua that we  should vote for peace and  therefore  vote to end United States support for  the Contras freedom fighters in that  country.  I  suggest  to you what we  really need to vote for is peace and de mocracy. I think a vote for these twin  goals would fulfill the United States  policy as we have had it for the past  several years.  We should make no mistake about  the fact that the Sandinistas have cre ated  an  expansionistic  Communist  regime in Nicaragua which is a threat  to its neighbors.  I recall a couple of years ago when  we were visited by President Duarte of  El Salvador, hearing him  say very  clearly that as long as there is a Com munist-Marxist  nation  in  Central  America  he  felt  that  there would  never be peace  in  that part of  the  world. It is no secret that Nicaragua  has a massive army which  is well equipped by the Soviet Union. In fact,  last year the Soviets spent for military  aid to the Sandinistas some $450 mil lion. Here today we are debating an  escrowed account of only $3.6 million  in military aid.  We have heard from Major Miranda,  who recently defected, that the Soviet  Union will continue  its buildup and  massive military assistance to the San dinistas.  The policy we pursued thus far has  worked. It has brought the Sandinis tas to the bargaining table. They have  made  concessions. They promise  to  make more reforms to see us stop our  aid to the Contras in that country.  Now is not the time to change that  policy, it is in fact time to continue it,  to keep their feet to the fire, to contin ue to push not just for peace in Cen tral America, but peace and democra cy.  I hope that my colleagues will join  me in not sending the Contras to the  bargaining table empty handed.  I urge the Members to vote ""yes"" for  peace and democracy.  ",1988
127,House,100,-0.27,813,1,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I believe all of us, Republi cans, Democrats, Contra aid support ers and Contra aid opponents want to  see  a  basically  similar outcome  in  Nicaragua. We want to see the 2.8 mil lion people of Nicaragua able to live in  peace. We want to see them able to  live respectable and decent lives where  they have the freedoms that we enjoy  in the United States. We want to see  the people of Nicaragua  lift  them selves out of the poverty that so many  of them are subjected to. In sum, we  want  to see  them able  to  lead  the  kinds of lives that so many of us in the  United States take for granted. Lives  that are full of happiness not terror,  freedom rather than oppression, and  prosperity instead of poverty.  Our  debate  today  then  centers  around how we in the United States  can foster and promote these goals in  ",1988
128,House,100,0.262,826,1,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  assume we  are  going  through  this exercise  today because  we are trying to convince a handful of  our colleagues who are supposedly un decided to decide in favor of the way  we speak.  Let me give two reasons why an un decided Member of Congress ought to  vote  for  aid  to  the Contras  this  evening. First, aid to the Contras  is  working. We see that it has brought to  the bargaining table something they  said they would never do, negotiate di rectly with the Contras.  The Sandinistas  have  also made  some modest, albeit modest attempts  to make some changes in their society.  Why are they doing that? Not out of  the goodness of their heart, but be cause  the pressure  that the Contra  forces are putting on them is forcing  them to do that.  The second reason is without aid to  the Contras  there  is  absolutely no  reason for them to continue to negoti ate. There is no reason for the Sandi nistas to try to deliver on the promises  that they for 8 years now have failed  to perform and live up to, since 1979,  to the people of Nicaragua.  I say we must negotiate from a posi tion of strength. And  the only way  that we can negotiate from a position  of strength is to continue to have an  there  for  available  escrow  account  lethal aid.  How can anybody who has heard  Major Miranda, who was a very high  assistant to Ortega, the Defense Min ister, who has defected to this country  and has stated  that he knows  that  these people do not want democracy,  he knows what the Sandinista leader ship stands for and he knows the rea sons that all of this window dressing  and so-called democratization is going  on is for the purpose of cutting off aid  to the Contras, that their audience is  the 435 Members of the House of Rep resentatives.  This is a person who was in a high  command. Why will we not listen to  him? Why will we not heed his warn ings?  We had a bipartisan hearing  the  other day regarding this issue and Mr.  Miranda spelled out all  the reasons  why Members of this House ought to  be voting for aid to the Contras this  afternoon.  We hear a lot about giving peace a  chance. My  colleague  from Florida  just said give peace a  chance. You  know,  the same kind of peace  that  they have today in Cuba; they are not  at war, they are at peace.  I say give democracy a chance. The  only way to give democracy a chance is  to go ahead and support aid  to the  Contras with an escrow account as the  President has offered us to do today.  ",1988

130,House,100,-0.487,826,1,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today to join with my colleagues who  oppose the President's request for ad ditional Contra aid.  I have been to the region. I have met  with the leaders of the Central Ameri can countries, the leaders of the oppo sition  groups,  the  leaders  of  the  church and the trade unions. As many  of you have, I have seen firsthand the  conditions under which  the  people  must live in these countries. And you  know that a vote for Contra aid will  only bring more misery, more poverty,  more war  to  the people of Central  America.  The American people have expressed  their  sentiments  for  the  initiative  taken by the peoples of Central Amer ica and their leaders. Under the leadership efforts of Costa Rican Presi dent Oscar Arias, they have set their  own peace agenda. It is not the admin istration's plan. It is not the Soviet  Union's plan. It is a plan written and  signed by  the  leaders of  the region  who are working to set their own desti ny. The Central American Presidents  are taking a major risk for peace, and  we must support them.  That is a point that the administra tion just doesn't seem to understand:  That Central Americans are capable of  taking charge of Central America. In stead, the administration seeks to pro long the war and frustrate the peace  process. The military focus of the ad ministration only makes more difficult  the  task  of  the Central American  Presidents.  Providing  additional  Contra aid now will destroy their ef forts.  President Arias talks about the need  for measures  to promote democracy  and peace through dialog and negotia tion. ""Democracy,"" he says, ""cannot  be achieved by bullets but only by bal lots."" His peace plan reflects this posi tion.  And what does  the administration  off er as an alternative  to  the Arias  peace plan? There is no evidence that  the administration even has a  sus tained and coherent policy for Central  America. Many  slogans  have  been  used-peace, freedom fighters, U.S. se curity  interests-but none  of  these  catchwords appear as an  integrated  element of an overall strategy.  The President's policy response is to  throw more money at the problem. He  is now asking Congress to approve a  $36.2 million Contra aid package, a  package that is touted as being rela tively modest. But let's take a closer  look at the numbers. His request is for  $3.6 million in lethal military aid and  $32.6 million  for so-called nonlethal  assistance. The President tells us that  this amounts to 90 percent nonlethal  and 10 percent  lethal aid. However,  the measure  that we are voting on  today also includes $20 million for an  aircraft replacement fund, and an esti mated $12 million for electronic and  radar equipment for surveillance. Fur thermore, the amount of true humani tarian aid in his package, that is aid  for food, shelter, clothing, and medi cine, only amounts  to $7 .2 million.  This brings the total cost of the pack age  to $68.2 million  f <;>r  a  4-month  period. That  is  an animal  total of  $204.6 million, more th3>µ  the Contras  have ever gotten before.  \  The administration wabts-all -this  money, but they have not presented  any plan for achieving specific objec tives  in Central America. We have  heard about peace, freedom, and de mocracy for Nicaragua. We have heard  feverish statements about threats to  our national security.

I  would like to review some of the les sons of history.  If we go back to the Bolshevik revo lution, the Communists did not imme diately seize power then. There was a  struggle  for a number of years be tween the Red army and the White  army, the Red army eventually win ning out. If we look at the years since  then, not a  single country that has  gone Communist chose to do so in free  elections. The choice has always been  by force. If we look at the success of  these Communist countries, we cannot  point to one that has been an econom ic success. They are all economic fail ures, and these economic failures are  scattered here and there throughout  the world.  ",1988
133,House,100,-0.455,852,1,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today to express my opposition to ad ditional United States military and  nonlethal aid to the Nicaraguan Con tras. I strongly urge my colleagues to  vote against  the President's aid  re quest.  Money is a fungible resource, a re source which can be expended to free  other forms of financial assistance and  other resources. Assistance to the Con tras can be compared  to a personal  budget. Bills must be paid. If a person  is given money for his rent, he is then  able to use his funds to purchase other  goods.  In  the case of  the Contras,  what will  these additional funds ac complish? They will  free up other  funds and resources for the purchase  of weapons. Furthering aid at  this  time will only serve to extend a bloody  war and place the resolution of this  conflict further away from the eager  grasp of the Nicaraguan people.  During my years as a minister,  I  have worked hard to rebuild my com munity, to take a piece of land and to  raise a building out of rubble, to re store commerce to areas where busi nesses were afraid to locate and to in still faith in people to believe in them selves,  their  community,  and  their  country. Coming from  that environ ment,  it  is  difficult  for me,  as  a  member of Congress, to understand an  administration  that  favors  a  policy  which destroys the communities of a  nation, destabilizes  its economy, and  murders its people.  During the time the United States  has aided the Contras there have been  over 50,000 casualties. This is what we  as a nation have to show for the $276  million  in  assistance  that we  have  given to the Contras. Money is a finite  resource, especially in these times of  budgetary restraint, a resource which  we have squandered on a bloody and  misguided policy. For $276 million, in  my community and across the Nation,  we could have built low-income hous ing, helped families to receive health  care, and helped to educate our chil dren. Having said  this,  I must ask,  which is a better allocation of our re sources?  In which example has our  country been better served? We must  question  the  intensity  and  focus  placed by the administration on a fail ing Central American  policy, when  that same administration's economic  policies are in a shambles.  The issue of funding to the Contras  brings  to mind several  fundamental  issues. Are we  really  a  ""peaceful""  nation, devoted  to self-determination  and the rule of law or are we a nation  that seeks to oust governments that  we disagree with instead of encourag ing democratization. If our goal is to  establish democracy, why do we then  not make the same efforts in Chile,  Paraguay, South Africa, or  in Haiti  that we have made in Central Amer ica.  If our goal is to block a Soviet base  in Central America, why doesn't Presi dent Reagan negotiate directly with  the Soviets, as Gorbachev recently in dicated he is prepared to do, or open a  dialog with the Cubans or the Sandi nistas?  For the past 7 years our country has  been  sponsoring an  insurgent  force  which has  limited popular  support.  What government would willingly ne gotiate away its power or authority to  a small violent minority? I do not be lieve that the Contras are interested  in participating with the Sandinistas  in the political process.  The greatest threat to our democra cy does not come from Communist na tions to the south but from within our  own borders. The greatest danger our  country faces comes not from an eco nomically ravished, war torn Central  American country, but from cities and  towns across this Nation where a gen eration is coming to see drug traffick ing as their only hope for economic  enfranchisement, a country where the  poor go hungry and have no shelter,  people are inadequately educated, and  businesses cannot prosper. These are  the forces that will tear this country  apart, not the Sandinistas in Nicara gua.  This most recent administration aid  request helps to provide a framework  for  the destruction of  the Central  American peace plan. By granting ad ditional military aid to the Contras we  are fueling opportunities and reasons  for the Sandinistas to reject the Cen tral American peace plan with which  they are earnestly trying to comply.  Any aid that helps to keep an army in  the field is ultimately lethal, regard less of administration claims  to  the  contrary. The  use  of  any United  States-supplied goods ultimately  as sists in killing Nicaraguans.  I believe  that  the administration's  goal is to help the Contras to achieve  an unreasonable solution to an inter nal conflict. The Congress will ensure  the continuation of the war and the  slaughter if we approve additional aid  for the Contras today.  Let us today set upon a road toward  stopping the violence and death the  Contra war brings to Nicaragua. Let us  work toward honoring the agreements  made by the Central American peace  accords. Let us respect our allies  in  Central America as equals. Vote ""no""  on the President's aid request.  ",1988
134,House,100,0.122,852,1,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Chairman,  the genius of  the Arias  peace plan is that it requires that si multaneously nations open up  their  political process  and guarantee  the  right of political opposition and, si multaneously, close off the opportuni ty or the right for military opposition.  The negotiations now going on be tween the Sandinistas and the Contras  are all about opening up and guaran teeing the right of political opposition  to the Nicaraguan opposition parties  and,  by  extension,  to  the Contras  when they return to their native land.  The policy that we adopt here today  should be  the policy  that best sup ports these negotiations. To determine  what  that policy ought  to  be, we  should  look very  concretely at  the  ",1988
135,House,100,-0.553,865,1,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr.  Chairman,  this evening we  are poised on  the  threshold of a momentous decision for  the Americas. There are few choices  we make in this Chamber where peace  and war hang  in  the balance. This  27th vote that we will cast tonight on  Contra aid is that kind of vote.  The Reagan administration's policy  has evolved from one of covert assist ance to the Contras to overt, multimil lion dollar assistance  for  the single  purpose of overthrowing  the Sandi nista government, one that we diplo matically recognize, by military force.  And now they claim that aid to the  Contras is needed to keep the pressure  on for negotiations. But that policy ig nores the new reality in Central Amer ica, that the Central American govern ments themselves have taken extraor dinary steps  toward regional self-de termination by backing the Arias plan,  the Guatemala peace accords, and sup porting that plan for peace.  The prestige of the Nobel Prize for  Peace is the driving force for peace in  the region, not arms to the Contras;  yet, peace and  the Arias plan will  never have a  chance, never have a  prayer unless we cut off the military  aid and stop the fighting. We need to  create a climate for real negotiations  to take hold, negotiations by those in  the region who are most affected by  their outcome.  We will not achieve peace using the  Contras as our agents; we will become  peacemakers by supporting  the one  clear steady vision, the regional vision  for peace: the Arias plan.  Cutting off military  aid may not  guarantee the success of negotiations,  but continuing the military aid will  assure their failure.  ",1988
136,House,100,0.03,865,1,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  debate all day today has centered on  the theme of where we have been in  regard to aid  to the Contras. Those  who oppose aid have talked about the  alleged inadequacies of the Contras as  a fighting force  in Nicaragua. Those  who  support  aid have  taken much  solace from the fact the headlines no  longer talk about the battles in El Sal vador, of  the  imminent  fall of  the  democratic government in El Salvador  to an insurgency sponsored from Nica ragua.  Instead,  the  headlines  talk  about battles now on the home turf of  that  aggressive  force  in Nicaragua.  Those who support aid to the Contras  indeed take much solace from the fact  that the fighting in El Salvador has  given way to fighting now where that  aggression emanated from  in Nicara gua. The debate  is not really about  where we have been in regard to aid to  the Contras, the debate is where we  are going from here.  Where are we now and where do we  go? I have heard a strange argument  tonight. The  argument  is  that we  ought  to  let  the Central Americans  settle their own business, let us stay  out of it. If they cannot settle it prop erly,  if  they cannot contain Daniel  Ortega and the Communist Sandinis tas, well then we will send the Marines  in, they will mop it up and clean it up.  It is a strange argument, folks, be cause it ignores the fact that it is Cen tral Americans who are dying in Nica ragua, fighting for freedom there, not  Americans;  it  is Central Americans  who are containing Daniel Ortega's ag gressive tendencies in the region; it is  Central  Americans  dying  in  the  Contra fighting forces to keep Daniel  Ortega and his alleged plan to build a  600,000 man fighting force from over taking  that  region.  It  is Americans  who have to die in place of those Cen tral Americans  if we do not support  them in their efforts.  So  tonight when we ask ourselves  where do we go from here, we ought  eminently to ask ourselves what is this  Nation's best self-interest? I submit to  you we ought to ask ourselves a tough  question: Is it better for us, is it in our  self-interest  indeed  to continue sup port for those Central Americans who  are fighting for their own freedoms,  who are containing that Communist  force in Nicaragua, is it better for us  to continue our support for them and  to ensure that peace indeed can come  to El Salvador and  the democracies  that are peaceful  in the region  like  Honduras  and Costa Rica  have  a  chance to grow and flourish; or is it in stead in our Nation's best self-interest  to abandon those forces  in the field  and to trust Daniel Ortega to do the  right thing in the peace process?  I  suggest  to you  that  if we dare  make that second choice, if we aban don those forces in the field, that one  day the alternative discussed  in this  Chamber, sending the American boys  and girls in, sending our Marines in,  will be the awful fateful choice that  will face this Nation.  I  have  four  young  boys,  two  of  whom are  talking about military ca reers.  I am proud of  them for  it.  I  hope one day that they pursue those  careers. But I would hate  today  to  have on my conscience that we made a  decision to send those boys  to  their  death in defense of liberty when today  19-059 0-89-28 (Pt. 1)  we can count on the Central Ameri cans fighting for their own liberty.  Support aid to the Contras.  ",1988

138,House,100,-0.292,891,1,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I am going  to vote for the President's requested aid pack age for the Contras.  My vote  for aid  today can be understood  only in its proper context. This debate, unfor tunately, has not reflected  that context. We  have reduced a tremendously complex topic United States policy toward Nicaragua-to a  false simplicity. With my vote  this evening,  I  will be  labeled  ""pro-Contra."" My colleagues  who vote against the President's package will  be  labeled ""anti-Contra."" Under the terms of  this debate-across the country and  in  this  Chamber  today-those are  the only options  available to us. We are one or the other; we  are up or down; we are yes or no; we are pro Contra or pro-Arias peace plan. Both sides of  the debate have cooperated to establish this  false dichotomy, with even President Reagan  last night describing today's vote as an ""up or-down"" one.  Yet all of us know, or should know at any  rate,  that those terms are not real. This vote  isn't a referendum on whether we approve of  the Contras, or whether we dislike war, or how  strongly we disapprove of communism. This  vote answers none of  those questions. This  vote  today  is more subtle  than  that.  It  is a  judgment call. All  it says about us is whether  we  think the specific plan sent to us by  the  President will advance our respective goals in  Nicaragua. Each of us, or course,  is  free  to  use  this  vote  to  proclaim  himself  ""pro Contra,""  but  I prefer  to avoid using easy  labels and will discuss briefly why I think this  package today serves our best interests.  Since the  fall of Somoza in 1978 and  the  amost immediate repudiation of United States  overtures to the Sandinista regime, the United  States has had  roughly  four policy options  toward Nicaragua. We could give  the Sandi nistas very wide latitude, permitting them any  domestic and foreign policy activities short of  direct military attacks on the United States or  our allies. The other extreme would be an uncompromising effort to  topple  the Sandinista  regime. The third option allows the Sandinis tas  to retain  internal political control but for bids  them  from engaging  in activities  that  threaten the stability of the Central American  democracies. The  fourth option allows  the  Sandinistas  to  retain  immediate control over  the government apparatus, but requires them  to move down the road to democracy.  I reject  the  first option as a fairly obvious  and substantial threat to the security interests  of the United States as well as our moral and  ideological interests in furthering the cause of  democratic government. While  I wouldn't be  upset to see  the Sandinistas  fall,  I reject a  policy of  forcing  their departure on practical  grounds: I don't think the Sandinistas can be  ousted without direct military  intervention by  the United States, and our interests in Nicara gua are not sufficient to justify direct interven tion. The third option is not really an option in  the long-term sense. Communist dictatorships  are  inherently didactic and  repressive and a  stable peace cannot come  to a  repressive  Nicaragua.  That  leaves  the  fourth  option,  which  I endorse: Allowing  the Sandinistas to  retain immediate control over the government  so long as they do not threaten the improving  structure of democracy  in Central America  and continue to take steps toward democracy.  The package sent  to us by  the President  advances this goal. If you do not support that  goal, you are free to criticize the package: It is  an antagonistic gesture against unlimited San dinista independence on the one hand, and it  is grossly insufficient to pose a serious threat  to  the very existence of  the Sandinistas on  the other hand.  If, however, you support a  containment policy against  the Sandinistas,  you will have a difficult time explaining a vote  against this package.  In considering  this vote,  I start with  two  basic premises: First I believe that an unchal lenged  and  unfettered  Sandinista  regime  would disrupt democracies in Central America  and generally cause mischief  in our hemi sphere. Second, and even more obvious, the  Contras don't like the Sandinistas and would  prefer to expel  them. The goal, then, of con taining the Sandinistas can be achieved only  by carefully negotiating the implicit tension be tween my two premises: If we give nothing to  the Contras they disappear as an effective op position  to  the Sandinistas, who,  I believe,  would  immediately lose  their sudden  interest  in democratization and peace talks. If we give  too much to the Contras, they, in turn, lose in terest in peace talks and decide that perhaps  they should go for broke, as it were.  The terms of the aid package maintain that  tension. The amount is sufficient to keep the  Contras together as an organized opposition,  but it is not enough to give them illusions of a  purely military victory or to give the Sandinis tas immediate fear of a purely military defeat.  The placing of the $3.6 million in lethal aid in  an escrow account  is a deliberately nonpro vocative act. Only with extreme disingenuous ness could the Sandinistas cite $3.6 million in  escrowed military aid as a reason to pull out  of the peace process.  Mr. Chairman, I am on a short list of repre sentatives  labeled  ""swing votes"" on Contra  aid. I don't much care for that appellation, but  for the reasons I discussed earlier,  it's better  than being called pro-Contra or anti-Contra.  I  am not pro-Contra and I am not anti-Contra: I  simply judge each vote on its likely effects in  advancing the peace process. By that stand ard, I must vote yea today.  ",1988
139,House,100,-0.502,891,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Chairman, today we vote  on the future of Central America.  The choice has never been clearer.  We can support the Guatemala peace plan,  or we can support the Contras.  We can support a policy of peace, or a  policy of war.  We can wallow in the failures of the past, or  move ahead with hope for the future.  While Congress is looking to the future, the  administration is dredging up failures from the  past.  ADMINISTRATION DOUBLE-TALK  The administration has not given us much  success in Nicaragua. They have given us a  lot of double-talk.  The President says that the Contras have a  strong support in Nicaragua. And then he says  that they will disappear unless they get Ameri can money.  The President says that Nicaragua is a to talitarian dungeon, whose people  yearn  to  throw  out  the  Sandinistas.  And  then  he  charges that the Sandinistas are going to give  guns to 600,000 people. That's a fifth of their  population.  That's  every Nicaraguan male  from 18 to 35.  So it's a totalitarian dungeon that is going to  arm its inmates.  The Reagan administration says the Sandi nistas are Communists. Then  they say  the  Contras are really Sandinistas.  Remember when President Reagan solemn ly  assured  us  that  the Contras were  not  aiming  to overthrow the Nicaraguan Govern ment-they were really kind of border patrol?  After 6 years of film-flam, Congress is get ting a little skeptical.  CONTRA AID REQUEST  The administration  is claiming credit  for a  democratic  tide  in  Latin America. But  the  Reagan administration is 0 for 2 on democra cy in our hemisphere.  Under Elliot Abrams,  the Reagan adminis tration has dropped the ball on democracy in  Haiti. They dropped the ball on democracy in  Panama. And  they were  in  the process of  losing the game in Nicaragua, until the peace  plan sent them to the sidelines.  And now they're trying  to  tell us  that they  are concerned about democracy in Nicaragua,  and that's what they want funding for the Con tras.  To follow Henry Kissinger's criticism of this  policy, where is the policy?  Is this Contra aid request part of an achiev able policy, or  is  the administration simply  asking for whatever the traffic will bear?  The lessons of the history of Central Amer ica policy are: The administration will ask for  whatever it can get, and  they will say what ever they have to to get it.  And  if we defeat this request, history does  not assure us that the Reagan administration  is a good loser.  When Congress  defeated Contra  aid  in  1985,  the administration declared a national  emergency and imposed an embargo on Nica ragua. When Congress defeated Contra aid in  ",1988

And  this Congressman be lieves  liberty  in our hemisphere has  been temporarily murdered by a close  vote in this House this evening.  Now I am not going to spend much  time castigating anybody by name on  the majority side of the aisle. They  gerrymandered  themselves  in  my  State into a majority so that one man,  long dead, can laugh about the results  of this vote because in 1982 when I  was gerrymandered out of my seat on  my first 6-year go-around,  the Con gressman, long dead, who did it to me,  said that he would change seven seats  in California; and he did. We were 22to-21 when  that  lame duck  session  ended in December 1982 and when we  reconvened  a  few weeks  later,  less  than 3 weeks later, the California dele gation was not 22-to-21. We picked up  two new seats and they went to liber als. The new count was 28 to 17, an 11vote spread. And what did we lose this  vote by  tonight? Five votes. If they  shifted from ""no""  to ""yes""  it would  have been 216  to 214. And you, Mr.  Speaker, could not have voted to break  a tie. Five votes.  When my good friend from Califor nia, Mr. BERMAN,  told me this morn ing, they were hoping deliciously that  the margin of defeat would be buried  in Republican votes, and it is. Twelve  Republicans voted against their Presi dent. One of them ate up a half hour  in the Oval Office in the last few days  and  then had  a  former President,  Gerald Ford, spend another 30 min utes on the phone with him wasting  his time, wasting Ford's time. And this  is  this gentleman's first vote against  Contra aid.  Now when  the President had  tai lored a package that sounded for all  the world to me like the Mccurdy plan  named after DAVE MCCURDY, of Okla homa a year ago, and when the Presi dent  finally moves  to  the Mccurdy  plan, McCuRDY moves away from  it.  Here are five Republicans that I think  could win by 70 percent in their dis trict if they change their vote because  their district  loves  them and  they  would not care. Mr. BoEHLERT, who got  Dan Mitchell's seat  in upper New  York State, Mr. AMO HOUGHTON, who  just for  the first  time voted against  the President on Contra  aid, Mrs.  CLAUDINE SCHNEIDER, of Rhode Island,  beloved, wins with  70  percent  and  could  do whatever  she wants; Mr.  TAUKE, a BusH cochairman of Iowa. I  am a cochairman of BusH in Calif or nia so this kind of stings a little bit.  The  fifth one  is  PAUL HENRY who  holds Gerald Ford's seat in Michigan  that Ford held for 25 years.  Now there is hope, and I hope the  Ortega brothers are not laughing in  their designer glasses tonight, because  at least 9 of these 12 Republicans have  told me-I polled them on the floor  before  the vote-they  told me  that  they will switch their vote in an in stant  if Ortega screws around with  this peace process and does not start  releasing these political prisoners. And  I know at least 30 people on the other  side of the aisle, because their careers  are at stake, that would switch in a  minute if Ortega tries to screw up this  peace process.  Now  let me  tell you a  little story  that the great lady, who was once one  of the shining lights-of this delibera tive  body,  the  incomparable Claire  Booth Luce told me a few years ago at  the International Hotel off of Scott  Circle.

173,,100,-0.028,943,1,Mr. BARNARD.," Mr.  Speaker,  today,  on  behalf of Mr. PARRIS and myself, I am pleased  to  introduce  the Thrift Charter Enhancement  Act of 1988. This bill is intended to increase  the attractiveness of thrift institutions, particu larly troubled thrifts, to a wide range of poten tial  investors and  thus enhance the value of  thrift charters.  Its central  thrust would be  to  remove certain onerous features of thrift regu lation that are now reducing the desirability of  thrift ownership and preventing new acquisi tions of failing and healthy thrifts alike. The re sulting private  investment  that could be ex pected from enactment of the bill would inject  much needed capital  into  the  thrift  industry  and significantly help the FSLIC to find buyers  for  troubled  institutions. The  following  are  some of the reasons such a result is especial ly important at this time:  The amount of capital raised by last year's  Competitive Equality Banking Act is  likely  to  be insufficient to meet FSLIC's needs in deal ing with the industry's failures.  The healthy portion of the thrift industry will  not be able to bear any additional insurance  burden without creating a substantial addition al incentive to leave FSLIC.  A bailout of the FSLIC by the U.S. Treasury  would be extraordinarily unpopular,  if not im possible, politically.  A merger of the FSLIC with the FDIC would  be politically unpopularneither the thrift nor  the  banking  industry  supports  such  an  action-and would produce a single fund that  might well be  insufficient  to protect against  potential  losses of  the  two  industries com bined.  The investment of additional private capital  would reduce the costs to FSLIC associated  with  the disposal of failed  thrifts, reduce the  number  of new  failures,  and  sustain  the  growth necessary to increase FSLIC premium  receipts. The Thrift Charter Enhancement Act  of 1988 proposes only modest changes  in  thrift status, but they are designed specifically  to attract new investors and to keep current  investors  interested  in  thrift ownership. The  following are some examples of the bill's pro visions.  Debt  issuance and affiliate  transaction  re strictions would be relaxed for thrifts and thrift  holding companies so  they more closely re semble those governing banks and bank hold ing companies.

179,Senate,100,0.352,1034,1,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, let me  join in the commendation paid Sena tor Boren, the chairman of the Senate  Intelligence Committee, by my junior  colleague, the Senator from Arizona.  While I am admiring Democrats on  the floor, and I admire many, let me  say that I also join in the observation  made with considerable eloquence ear lier today by the senior Senator from  Texas who,  to paraphrase what he  said, finds it bizarre that in a virtually  parallel situation we have no doubt  about the wisdom of spending many,  many  times more  funds  than  the  paltry sums  that we  supply  to  the  Contras in order to support freedom  fighters in Afghanistan.  The parallels are obvious. In both  situations we have a Communist op pressor  being  resisted  by  freedom  fighters  seeking  to  take back  their  own land and to restore to it the kind  of freedom that should be the birth right of all men everywhere but clear ly is not.  There is, of course, a significant dif ference that the senior Senator _from  Texas spoke upon, and that is that Af ghanistan  is  halfway  around  the  world, whereas here on our doorstep,  literally within walking distance, we  have in Central America a war going  on that has produced a flood of refu gees who are literally able to walk to  the United States.  ",1988
180,,100,-0.598,1125,1,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President,  I  am  introducing  today, with Senator  GARN, a  joint resolution calling for a  Presidential proclamation of ""National  NHS/NeighborWorks Week""  begin ning June 5, 1988.  This  resolution  seeks  to  increase  public  awareness  of Neighborhood  Housing Services [NHS], and its part ners, the Mutual Housing Associations  and Apartment  Improvement  Pro grams. These NeighborWorks partner ships are the largest network of volun teers-based,  nonprofit  corporations  working to revitalize older neighbor hoods in the United States.  The  resolution  honors  the  thou sands of citizen volunteers who have  contributed their time and energy to  NeighborWorks;  and  recognizes  the  active  cooperation of  thousands of  businessmen and hundreds of  local  in  Neighbor government  officials  Works activities.  NeighborWorks partnerships are ini tiated and funded locally. They have  been organized  in 137 cities and 297  neighborhoods  across  the  country.  Over 3,000 businesses and  local gov ernments contribute some $16 million  yearly to NeighborWorks activities. It  is estimated that over $4 billion has al ready been invested in rehabilitating  and developing NeighborWorks' neigh borhoods.  Rehabilitation  objectives  have been successfully completed  in  more than 60 neighborhoods.  Mr. President, preserving  the Na tion's housing  is a national priority.  Reinvesting in older neighborhoods is  good budget and social policy. Over a  decade ago, I introduced legislation es tablishing a Neighborhood Reinvest ment Corp., to promote neighborhood  renewal  through  local  action. The  local-action  neighborhood  reinvest ment  program  begun  in  1977  has  become, in little more than a decade,  NHS/NeighborWorks in 137 cities and  297 neighborhoods.  That's a success story that needs to  be recognized-and fostered. I urge my  colleagues  to  join me  and Senator  GARN in designating the week of June  5, 1988, as ""National NHS/Neighbor Works Week.""  ",1988
181,,100,0.495,1125,1,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  today  Senator PROXMIRE and I are introduc ing a  joint  resolution calling  for  a  Presidential proclamation of National  Neighborhood  Housing  Services  NeighborWorks Week during the week  of June 5-11, 1988.  The purpose of the resolution is to  heighten  public  awareness  and  in crease  private  sector  support  for  Neighborhood  Housing  Services  [NHS] and  its affiliated partnership  organizations,  Apartment  Improve ment Programs and Mutual Housing  Associations,  which  are  rebuilding  America's  lower  income  neighbor hoods through public/private partici pation. The resolution will also honor  those volunteer partners who have  contributed countless hours of work  and financial resources to their local  NHS.  The NeighborWorks network is the  largest  neighborhood-based  network  of public/private partnerships at work  revitalizing  neighborhoods  in  our  country  today. NeighborWorks part nerships are working in 237 neighbor hoods in 137 cities, which along with  60  self-reliant neighborhoods, house  nearly 3 million people. The  track  record of the NeighborWorks network  has been  impressive. Over 14 years,  the NHS partnerships have generated  more than $4 billion in reinvestment  fo!:.;..ittte  rehabilitation  and  develop ment of America's low-income housing  stock.  Each NeighborWorks partnership is  a locally controlled, nonprofit corpora tion managed by a volunteer board of  directors, composed of residents, busi ness representatives, and local govern ment officials. Each partnership is lo cally funded by private sector institu tions and the local government. More  than 3,000 businesses and local govern ments are contributing  to  the oper ations of  their  local NeighborWorks  partnerships at an annual level of $16  million.  In 1978 Senator PROXMIRE  and  I  coauthored the legislation creating the  Neighborhood  Reinvestment  Corp.  which helps local communities develop  Neighborhood Housing Services Pro grams and provides  technical assist ance. It has been very rewarding to see  the expansion and success of  these  programs.  As a former mayor and a member of  the Housing Subcommittee,  I  have  had the opportunity to witness their  work first hand. In Salt Lake City for  instance, one of the critical features of  the Neighborhood Housing Services  revitalization strategy has been com munity  involvement.  In  response  to  youth unemployment and  the prob lems that result when young people  aren't involved  in meaningful activi ties,  the  local NHS established  the  West Side youth project which has de veloped trade and employment skills  in over 100 young people. It has pre sented a positive image of the youth  on the West Side and helped reduce  neighborhood  tensions and negative  stereotypes. The youth have been in volved in short-term, meaningful work  projects and have had direct contact  with local residents through the per formance of jobs and services. I under stand this project is going to be nomi nated for several national awards and  will serve as a pilot in other areas of  the country.  Keeping  NeighborWorks  partner ship organizations strong and enabling  them  to  serve  additional  neighbor hoods requires a steady renewal of this  local government and private sector  support.  ""National  Neighborhood  Housing  Services/N eighborWorks  Week""  will  strengthen  this  local  public/private partnership and I invite  my colleagues to join with us in sup port of this resolution.

184,,100,0.23,1229,1,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  pay my respects to Donald L. Rogers  not only for his contributions to bank ing but also for his integrity and trust worthiness. Don Rogers died on Janu ary 18 at which time he was president  of  the Association of Bank Holding  Companies, approaching the 30th an niversary of the association under his  leadership.  Don Rogers grew up in Steubenville,  OH,  attended Miami University  in  Oxford, OH and was graduated from  the College of Law of Ohio State Uni versity  in Columbus. At Ohio State  University he became active  in  the  Young Republican Club and started a  lasting  friendship. After his  admit tance to the bar, Don Rogers  joined  the staff of the Senate Banking and  Currency Committee in 1953 as associ ate counsel, later to become counsel.  His  sponsor was Senator  John W.  Bricker of Ohio,  the second ranking  Republican. However, a great part of  his work was for the Subcommittee on  Banking of which Democratic Senator  A. Willis Robertson, of Virginia was  chairman. The staff of  the Banking  Committee worked together in a pro fessional manner in assisting Senators  from both sides of the aisle. Don typi fied that type of the highest prof es sional duty. He worked on legislation  where he was credited with the recodi fication of the Federal banking laws  which was contained in the proposed  Financial Institutions Act of 1957 as  passed by the Senate though killed in  the House. It was however later en acted in separate bills. Don Rogers did  the Senate staff work on the major  piece of legislation-the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956.  Don became the executive director later president in 1976-of the Associa tion of Bank Holding Companies  in  October 1958, 5 months after its orga nization. It has been written that this  was a case of a job finding a man, not  a man  finding  a  job. Don Rogers  brought to the association his exper tise,  honesty,  and  dedication,  and  made the association his career. Over  the past three decades the association  under his leadership has earned the  respect of Members and staff of the  Congress, the White House, The Fed eral Reserve and the agencies of the  executive branch.  I  shall miss  his  counsel  and his  friendship. To his lovely wife, Helen, I  extend my deepest condolences.  At this point in my remarks, I am in cluding a statement by John R. Petty,  chairman of the Association of Bank  Holding Companies, in the RECORD:  STATEMENT BY JOHN R. PETTY  Don Rogers, more than any other individ ual, has been associated with the success of  the bank holding company movement in the  United States. From his tenure as Counsel  to the Senate Banking Committee <1953-58)  to the present day, Mr. Rogers' encyclopedic  knowledge of the Bank Holding Company  Act and related statutes has been legendary.  Whenever any signifiant question on  the  subject has arisen in Congress or the regula tory agencies over the years, government of ficials, members of Congress,  and other  Washington  insiders have  turned  to Don  Rogers for guidance and enlightenment.  Don's integrity, foresight, and leadership  have been vital components in fashioning the  constructive evolution of the financial serv ices industry, in which bank holding compa nies play a central role. His advocacy of ex panding the base of the industry to allow  for a broader array of products and services  to be offered on a widespread geographic  basis was of genuine benefit to consumers  and small businessmen, and will continue to  benefit the American public as those poli cies are further implemented.  At  the same  time, Don Rogers presided  over the growth of the Associaton of Bank  Holding Companies, nurturing its evolution  from a group of 11 members in 1958, when  bank holding companies were a rarity and  were viewed with suspicion in many quar ters. Today, the association's 125 members  account for almost 75% of the nation's do mestic banking assets, and the bank holding  company has become the dominant form of  banking structure.  As  President  of  the Association, Don  helped  fashion  forward-looking  legislative  and regulatory policies for the Association  and for bank holding companies generally.  Positions  the Association  took  over  the  years with his leadership have proven pro phetic and correct. In 1980, at the Associa tion's Annual Meeting in Williamsburg, Vir ginia, the members voted a historic policy  regarding interstate banking, which includ ed a proviso urging members to enact state  reciprocal banking statutes. The fruits of  this policy are all around us in the form of  dozens of state laws that permit bank hold",1988
185,House,100,-0.569,1242,1,Mr. OWENS of New York.," Mr.  Speaker,  as  a moral  leader  in  the  world and as a symbol of democracy  for millions, the United States can ill afford to ignore the electoral process  which  brought  Leslie Manigat  to  power. We cannot excuse its flaws and  indicate that in spite of that process,  Manigat may be worthy of our support  after all. We cannot ignore the fact  that Manigat was brought to power by  murderers, by thugs, by the kingpins  of the Haitian drug industry.  If Manigat was truly democratic, he  would not have participated in elec tions marked by bribery, by ballot box  stuffing and repetitive voting, by elec tions that were controlled and orches trated by soldiers. His participation in  this farce gives credence to those who  say that Manigat is a mere puppet of  the military, that his function will be  to put a democratic face on a militari ly run, totalitarian regime.  Haiti's influential Roman Catholic  Church has not  accepted Manigat.  They refused  to accept and endorse  his election.  Another candidate  in  the election,  Hubert de Ronceray, insists that he is  the  real winner and  that he  is  the  President of parts of Haiti. The door is  open for civil war in Haiti.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  United States should suspend all aid  to Haiti, not only should the United  States not restore the aid that it cut  off, but it should suspend all aid and it  should  sever  its  diplomatic  ties  to  Haiti. We should recall our Ambassa dor  to Haiti. We should reverse our  policy, the policy where we have acted  in  collusion with  the  army. That  should be reversed and we should say  to the world that we really believe in  democracy. We  really  understand  what has been going on in Haiti the  last  years. We  understand why  Haiti  is  the poorest country  in  the  Western Hemisphere. We understand  how the people of Haiti have been op pressed  and beaten  down. We  are  ready to recognize that this is a scan dal which exists just 90 miles from the  shores of the United States.  The United States should recognize  that it understands that here is a for eign policy which has set the stage for  the decent people of Haiti,  for  the  young people who have dreams,  for  the young people who have led the re sistance. We have set  the stage for  them  to go nowhere else except  to  communism.  Young people whose names we do  not know today, the dreamers whose  names we do not know today in those  neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince and  in the various outlying provinces who  offered such great resistance  to  the  Duvaliers and were really responsible  for  the  final departure of Duvalier,  the same young people who  led the  strikes  against  the military  junta,  those are the young people who in des peration will turn to communism.  Haiti  is  only  90 miles  from  the  shores of the United States, but Haiti  is even closer  to Castro's Cuba. We  have had a  long history  in Haiti of  people  rejecting  communism,  no  matter how bad  things have been.  They have  rejected communism  re50  peatedly. There  is  no Communist  Party, no Communist movement of  any significant size.  We are fools if we think that that is  going to continue. We are fools if we  think human beings out of despera tion will not turn to whoever offers  them some way out. We are going to  reap  the  terrible  fruit of what our  State Department has done in collu sion with the military junta in Haiti.  We can  reverse our policy. We can  refuse  to  recognize Manigat as  the  legal elected President of Haiti. We  can cut off all aid. We can recall our  Ambassador  to Haiti. We  can  take  steps now to right these wrongs.  D 1415  We can take steps now to restore our  own  image  in  this hemisphere. We  should demand the electoral council  which the military junta illegally dis banded  last November be  reinstated  and that it be allowed to hold general  free elections that are fair and free  and not rigged.  If Leslie Manigat is the professorial  genius who loves democracy, if that is  the image that he wants to promote,  then let him be daring enough to pro mote that image by calling for free  elections. Let him supervise them, let  him restore the electoral council, let  him supervise fair elections,  let him  compete with his opponents, let him  indicate to us that he is not a murder er and a criminal and that he does not  belong with the people who put him in  power.  Haiti will be  free sooner or later.  Haiti has now inherited a legacy from  the martyrs of November 29. They will  never allow another 30 years of op pression. One way or another,  the  people of Haiti are going to be free,  and are going to have freedom. I hope  that the United States will be a part ner in that effort.

Despite this tragedy, America has de cided  to  reward  this  festering destiny with  treaty after broken  treaty and appeasement  ad nauseum.  Two lessons should be garnered from histo ry. First,  that the Soviets have not extended  their empire 1 inch since the beginning of a  treaty-less  Reagan  administration;  and  second, that peace will never be found in the  dry ink on parchment paper. Peace is a char acteristic of the human spirit.  Mr. Speaker,  the  following  letter  to  editor sets forth clearly this latter lesson:  [From the North County <CA) Blade Tribune, Dec. 11, 1987]  the  A PURE ILLUSION  EDITOR:  All this talk about summit, glasnost (pub licity), and treaties, obscures the fundamen tal and continuing differences between a  collectivist and a free man as they define  themselves,  structure  their  environment  and their institutions.  A free man ""is endowed by his Creator  with      Liberty,"" or the ability to choose.  A collectivist is allowed some privileges by  his government.  A free man experiences freedom, the op portunity to make choices.  A collectivist is told what to do.  A free man's government exists  guard his natural rights.  A collectivist serves his government.  A free man is the base unit of value as an  individual.  A collectivist is valuable only as he is a  useful member of the group.  Unless  and  until  collectivism  defines  human nature in natural, or Jeffersonian,  or biblical  terms <man:  the choicemaker),  such cosmetic and image-oriented activities  as glasnost <USSR) or ""peace treaty"" <Nica ragua and Afghanistan) are pure illusion in tended for control purposes.  Remember, peace is not a cause   an effect.  to safe it's      JAMES FLETCHER BAXTER,  Carlsbad.  ~-~-.. - l;   ......... --    EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  THE  NATIONAL  HISTORICAL  PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS  COMMISSION AMENDMENTS  HON. JACK BROOKS  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 9, 1988  ",1988
187,,100,-0.407,1333,1,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker,  today, along  with Congressmen  GLEN  ENGLISH,  FRANK  HORTON, and AL McCANDLESS, I am introduc ing  the National Historical Publications and  Records Commission amendments of 1988.  This bill will make minor amendments to the  statutory provisions which establish  the Na tional  Historical  Publications  and  Records  Commission [NHPRC] as an entity of the Na tional Archives and Records Administration. It  also will authorize funding for NHPRC's grants  program for the next 5 years.  With the bicentennial of our Constitution just  past, it is appropriate that we should consider  this  legislation. That celebration reminded all  of us how important our Nation's documentary  heritage  is  to  the understanding of how our  Government works. The NHPRC was created  in  the act  that established  the National Ar chives in 1934, with the mission of leading the  efforts  to preserve and publish our Nation's  historical documents. For the past 24 years,  the NHPRC's Grants Program has supported  projects across the Nation that have kept his torical records from being lost through the rav ages of time and neglect.  The  legislation  I am  introducing  today has  two parts. The first part makes minor changes  in the NHPRC's operational structure, as codi fied in Chapter 25 of Title 44, U.S.C.; it gener ally tracks a legislative recommendation  that  was transmitted to the Congress by the acting  archivist on September 30, 1987.  The second portion of  the  legislation au thorizes appropriations to the NHPRC for the  next 5 years.  It provides for authorizations of  $5 million  annually-the  current  authoriza tion-for fiscal years 1989 and 1990, $8 mil lion annually for fiscal years 1991 and 1992,  and $1 O million annually for fiscal year 1993.  This will allow the Congress to assess and ap propriate funds for NHPRC's important work in  light of prevailing overall budgetary conditions.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to  support this legislation. It will help ensure that  future generations will have a full understand ing of our Nation and its heritage.  UPGRADING THE DIRECTOR OF  THE CENSUS BUREAU TO EX ECUTIVE LEVEL IV  HON. MERVYN M. DYMALLY  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 9, 1988  Mr. DYMALL Y. Mr. Speaker, I recently intro duced a bill, H.R. 3896 which amends title 5,  United States Code to upgrade the position of  the Census Bureau Director  from executive  level V to executive level IV.  The present executive level position of the  Census Bureau Director, who is appointed by  the President with the advice and consent of  1333  the Senate, is not commensurate with the au thority  and  responsibilities  exercised within  and on behalf of  the Department of Com merce by that official.  It was set in the early  1960's before legislation expanded the activi ties and roles of the Census Bureau.  The work of  the Census Bureau  in  recent  years  includes  the decennial, economic and  agricultural census. The data collected  from  these censuses are used in public and private  planning, including such matters as tax policy  and Social Security. Additionally, many Feder al agencies rely on the Census Bureau for key  statistical surveys, analyses, and training.  The role of the Bureau, however, is not re flected in the level now accorded the position  of its Director. A comparative analysis of func tions and responsibilities at the various levels  of the executive schedule found in the Depart ment of Commerce and  its level  IV positions  shows clearly that the Census Bureau Direc tor's responsibilities are comparable to those  of other Commerce Department level IV posi tions.  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons  I urge that  the position of Director, Bureau of Census,  should be raised from a level V to a level IV  of  the executive schedule  found  in  title 5,  United States Code, section 5315.

191,,100,0.217,1450,1,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  submit for my colleagues attention the text of  my  recent Washington Report, which was  printed in the January 28, 1988 edition of the  News/Voice. It addresses the issue of special  interests which Congress and the administra tion must courageously deal with if our budget  deficits are to be reduced and controlled:  THE MOST IMPORTANT SPECIAL INTEREST OF  THEM ALL  How many of these abbreviations do you  recognize: ADA, ACU, ANEC, CFA? If you  can't identify them don't feel badly. These  public interest groups and scores of others  are best known in Washington. There they  work to influence Congress on issues of con cern to them, including, of course, the fund ing they favor.  Virtually  every  special  interest  in our  nation now has an organized lobby to pro mote its goals-and I do not use the term  ""special  interest""  in  a  pejorative  sense.  ""Special  interests""  are  the handicapped,  educators, union members, businesses, veter ans,  and many others. Congress has  re sponded well to their concerns, but in doing  so we have lost the bottom line and have  February 16, 1988  failed to add up the burden this places on  our economy and on the American people.  Every lobbying group advances a compel ling argument  that  its cause  is  just, and  therein lies the problem. As our society has  grown in size and complexity, demands for  federal  funding have  far outstripped our  economic resources. In the scramble for a  piece of those resources, individuals have in creasingly sought political power by identi fying themselves as members of a particular  interest group-seniors, veterans, business,  students-rather than Americans in a larger  sense.  Reflecting that political power, Congress  has become a battleground, where victories  for those specific interests often supersede  the larger concerns of the nation. Our fed eral budget process in particular is regularly  ignored and abused; again  this year,  the  Congress produced a massive and shameful  omnibus continuing resolution <CR) to fund  the entire federal government that contains  everyone's  favored  spending. You've no  doubt heard of some of the pet projects in  the latest $603 billion CR, which according  to Newsweek ""was passed in such haste that  the Office of Management and Budget is  still trying to find all  the special interest  baubles hidden in the fine print of its thou sand pages.""  Special interest pressure was never more  evident than during November's overwhelm ing House vote to create a cabinet-level post  for veterans. As the vote rolled up, everyone  around me on the House floor said it was a  terrible  idea  . . .  but  practically  every  member voted for it.  Why? Because the Congress is gripped in  the craven fear of special interests. In par ticular, members are wary of  the ratings  these  groups  regularly  release  reporting  whether a member was ""right"" on selected  votes. These fears of receiving an unfavor able rating or report have undue influence  on the way many members vote.  Although it was difficult, I voted against  the VA cabinet-level proposal. My vote was  not anti-veteran in any way, but rather a  vote against expanding the cabinet with a  new department at a  time when deficits  have reached crisis proportions. I think of  myself as second to none when it comes to  supporting our veterans; I respect the com mitment  they made  to our country and  probably represent more veterans than most  other members of Congress. But faced with  massive deficits, the need to control federal  spending must be the higher priority.  Following that vote, I said that it's time  for courage, time to end business as usual in  Washington and risk offending the lobbyists  in order to come to grips with the crisis that  is upon us. But in our political system, that  means the American people must demand  that change. They must send a message to  Congress:  ""Get our  budget  and  deficits  under control. If necessary, I'm willing to  freeze or trim my favorite program as long  as everyone else is willing to do the same.""  While the many interest groups that rep resent our diverse society will always be a  force on Capitol Hill, their influence should  be tempered by larger concerns. We cannot  forget that while we may be Social Security  recipients or veterans or businessmen or  government employees, before anything else  we're Americans-the most important ""spe cial interest"" of them all.

193,,100,-0.044,1463,1,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker,  last week, Dr.  Stephen H. Schneider, the head of the Nation al Center for Atmospheric Research's climate  system program, presented  to members and  staff an overview of the level of current scien tific understanding of  the greenhouse effect.  He  emphasized  that  the mechanisms  of  greenhouse heating of  the atmosphere are  well understood and that scientists agree that  if carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  continue to be released at current levels, an  increase in global temperature is inevitable.  Researchers however, disagree as  to  the  extent, rate and effect of future  temperature  increases. Such  increases will  depend,  of  course, on many factors, but especially on the  level of fossil fuel use. Researchers generally  predict, however,  that we have already com mitted ourselves to an increase in temperature  of 1.5-4.5 C in  the next 100 years. Possible  effects of  this  increase  include shifts  in  the  world's grain belts, coastal  flooding and  in creased mortality due to heat.  Dr. Schneider explained that natural climac tic variations have occurred  throughout  the  history of the Earth. The danger of man  in duced greenhouse warming, however,  is not  only  in  the change  itself, but  in  the  rate of  change. Given time, man, undoubtedly, would  adapt  to a warmer world.

Dr.  King's dream, which had become our  own, seemed even more unattainable.  In the 20 years since that event, our  citizens have worked hard to realize  many of Dr. King's goals. And we  have,  in  fact,  made  substantial  progress. We all enjoy greater civil  rights since 1968.

However, my purpose  in speaking  now on the House floor is to pay trib ute  to  a  longtime  friend of mine,  George Kerby Jennings, who died Jan uary 26 at age 84 at his home  in  Murray, KY.  Kerby  Jennings  published  the  Murray Democrat newspaper with a  fear less style of  journalism-winning  majy honors-for more than 35 years.  He  also  published  a  history  of  Calloway County, KY, in 1980.  Kerby Jennings served with distinc tion as an outstanding State repre sentative in the Kentucky General As sembly from 1946-50.  The only political campaign Kerby  Jennings lost was a contest for  the  U.S. House of Representatives in the  early 1940's against then-Congressman  Noble  J. Gregory, of western Ken tucky.  From 1956 to 1960, he was a member  of Calloway County Board of Educa tion. During this time, he never ac cepted any compensation for his serv ices,  turning the money back  to be  used for purchasing school lunches for  needy students. He also was  instru mental  in getting  the parking  lots  paved at many of the county schools.  In recognition of his efforts to estab lish park sites along the Calloway and  Marshall County shores of Kentucky  Lake during this time, a lengthy trail  alongside  the  lake  is named  in his  honor, the Kerby Jennings Trail.  In this effort, he went to Knoxville,  TN, and secured from the Tennessee  Valley Authority an allotment for 18  easement locations.  Among  the park  areas  and boat  launching sites established along this  trail were the Happy Chandler Park,  the Harry Lee Waterfield Park on Jon athan Creek, at Cypress Creek and  Pine Bluff.  Survivors are his wife, Mrs. Dorothy  Jennings; three daughters, Mrs. Doris  Frazer, Chattanooga, TN, Mrs. Jane  Gresham, Taylor, MI, and Mrs. Edna  Kerby Merrell, Murray; two sons. O.J.  Jennings  III, Shelbyville, KY,  and  Edwin Hagen Jennings, Murray.  His 13 grandchildren are Dorisanne  Conners, Gene Dale, <Chip> Steely Jr.,  Caroline Kerby Starks, James Hagen  Jennings, John Kerby Jennings, Shaw nee Gay Hill, Renee Grace, Cory  LeeAnn Jennings, Dorothy Ann Mer rell, Shellie Perusse, Monica Nichols,  Mike Gresham, and Mark Gresham.  Also  surviving are 13 great-grand children and 1 brother, Charles Jen nings, Imperial, CA.  One  daughter, Dorothy Caroline  Jennings, died in 1942.  My wife Carol and I extend to our  friend Dorothy  Jennings  and  the  other members of the Kerby Jennings  family our sympathy and best wishes.

211,Senate,100,0.2,188,5,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to join as a cosponsor of  legislation  introduced  by  Senator  DURENBERGER calling for the establish ment of 25 rural long-term care dem onstration projects. The purpose of  these projects  is  to provide specific  data on the most effective means for  delivering  long-term care services  to  elderly persons living in rural areas.  Today, people who  require assist ance  in conducting routine activities  due to chronic conditions often find it  difficult to obtain the help they need.  Not only are appropriate services  in  short supply, but they are also beyond  the means of many Americans. No  matter how hard one has tried to plan  for the future, it becomes nearly im possible for most to meet the costs of  continuing care year after year after  year.  As our older population grows, par ticularly in the 85-plus age group, the  need for quality long-term care serv ices will become even more pressing.  Given these concerns, it is not surpris ing that there is growing attention to  the inadequacies in current long-term  care arrangements. A number of legis lative proposals have been put  for ward, and Congress will undoubtedly  be taking action in this critical area  over the next few years. I think it is  terribly important that we do so.  The demonstration projects author ized by Senator DURENBERGER'S legisla tion would off er important guidance  as to how we best structure any long term care program to meet the needs  of the rural elderly. Currently, there  are over 500 rural counties in which at  least 15 percent of the total popula tion is comprised of individuals age 65  and over. A  substantial number of  these counties are located in my State  of Kansas, so I am very much aware  that programs which work well  in  urban areas do not always make sense  for rural America.  Too many times in the past, the re alities of life  in rural America have  been ignored in the design of Federal  legislation. The special problems faced  by rural hospitals under the Medicare  prospective payment system is but one  of many such examples.  I believe that careful evaluation of  the  broad  range  of  demonstration  projects envisioned by this legislation  will allow us to avoid this kind of prob lem in the development of long-term  care legislation. These demonstrations  will encompass the full range of sup portive services. Because most of these  services are not covered under existing  Federal programs, the demonstrations  will also give us a better sense of the  costs involved.  Meeting long-term care needs poses  many complex questions. In the ab sence of solid information, it will be  extremely easy for rural interests to  get lost in the shuffle. The legislation  introduced today helps assure that we  will have a basis  for designing pro grams which make sense for the rural  elderly, and  I hope  the Senate can  move promptly in approving it. e  By Mr. PROXMIRE (for him self, Mr. RIEGLE, Mr. DODD, Mr.  WIRTH, Mr.  DOMENICI, Mr.  CHAFEE, Mr. BOND, Mr. STE VENS, and Mr. McCAIN):  S. 2256.

214,,100,0.336,253,5,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation to amend the tariff sched ules of the United States to increase the tariff  on bone chinaware. This proposed increase is  necessary to ensure the successful attempt of  an  infant U.S.  industry  to enter  the bone  chinaware market  in  the United States. No  U.S. company is currently manufacturing bone  chinaware in the United States. The Pfaltzgraff  Co., of York, PA, a U.S. manufacturer of din nerware and accessory items made of earth enware, has made the decision to change that  situation by establishing U.S. manufacturing  operations producing bone chinaware.  The Pfaltzgraff Co., is currently manufactur ing, but has not yet begun the sale of, bone  chinaware in its factory in Pennsylvania. In at tempting  to  gain  a  foothold  in  its  home  market, Pfaltzgraff is confronted by the pres ence of numerous low-priced imports of bone  chinaware with which  they must be competi tive  to establish a U.S. industry in  this  field.  The very  low prices at which many of those  imports are sold-prices in many cases below  Pfaltzgraff's cost of production-raise con cerns as to the ability of this infant industry to  become established.  For example,  in  1987  imports  of  bone  chinaware from Japan accounted for 45 per cent of all bone chinaware  imports, making  Japan the single  largest exporting country of  this product. Despite  the dramatic exchange  rate  fluctuations which have occurred  in  the  value of the dollar vis-a-vis the yen, the Japa nese bone chinaware producers are continu ing  to  sell  bone  chinaware  in  the United  States at  roughly  the same prices at which  bone chinaware was sold several years ago.  Other countries with a significant presence  and name-recognization  in  the U.S. market  are also selling bone chinaware at very  low  prices in the United States.  These circumstances make  it very difficult  for any U.S. company to enter the bone china ware market. The Pfaltzgraff Co., is one of the  few U.S. producers of earthen dinnerware that  has continued as a viable company  in  the  United States despite the impact of low-priced  imports on its business operations. Pfaltzgraff  is a well-run, modern, and efficient company.  Unfortunately, when competing with very low priced and often unfairly traded foreign goods,  even modern and efficient companies such as  Pfaltzgraff have difficulty being competitive in  their home market.  To assist in the success of Pfaltzgraff's ef forts to establish a new American industry and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to create additional jobs in the United States, I  have proposed  this  tariff increase. The  initial  tariff increase would permit the Pfaltzgraff Co.,  a period of time to establish a sales base  in  this market, and the ultimate tariff level would  ensure that Pfaltzgraff could maintain its com petitive posture in the United States.  The legislation that I have proposed would  raise the current tariff on bone chinaware of 8  percent to a level of 35 percent ad valorem.  This  rate would  be  gradually  reduced  in  stages over a period of 7 years, to result in a  26-percent ad valorem rate of duty at the end  of that period of time.  The 35 percent  rate proposed  is  the rate  currently applicable to imported hotel and res taurant chinaware. Prior  to 1980, both bone  chinaware and hotel and restaurant chinaware  were governed by  the same  tariff category  and subject to a 17.5-percent rate of duty. As  of January 1, 1980, this category was divided  into two items. The rate for institutional china ware was increased to 47 percent, from which  it has been gradually reduced  to  its current  level of 35 percent. The rate for bone china ware, however, was reduced to 16.3 percent  in 1980, from which it has been continually re duced to its current level of 8 percent. Thus, a  significant disparity exists in the rates applica ble to the institutional chinaware and the bone  chinaware.  The ultimate  rate of duty of 26 percent  which is proposed to result at the end of the 7  year period of time is the rate of duty currently  applicable to chinaware sold in sets at a value  not over $56.  I believe this is a realistic per manent tariff on bone chinaware  in  that the  bone chinaware category, unlike the category  for non-bone chinaware sold  in sets,  is not  subdivided into a low and high end of prices  with varying tariffs for each subdivision. There fore,  imports of bone chinaware at very  low  prices equivalent to a set sold at not over $56  would all be classified under the same  tariff  number. These low-priced imports will provide  significant competition  for Pfaltzgraff  in  the  long-term in its efforts to compete in the bone  chinaware industry. Accordingly, it is reasona ble  to make  the permanent  tariff on bone  chinaware equivalent to the rate applicable to  low-priced non-bone chinaware, which  is 26  percent ad valorem.  To assist  the efforts of a U.S.  industry  to  establish operations and  to be competitive  with foreign goods, I urge my colleagues to fa vorably consider this proposed legislation.  RAIL LINE PRESERVATION AND  EMPLOYEE PROTECTION ACT  HON.THOMASJ.TAUKE  OF IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 30, 1988  ",1988
215,,100,0.27,253,5,Mr. TAUKE.," Mr. Speaker, last week I intro duced legislation to equitably resolve the cur rent uncertainties surrounding the creation of  regional railroads. The Rail Line Preservation  and  Employee Protection Act, H.R.  4261,  strikes a balance between the legitimate con cerns of railroad employees who face job ter mination and the  interests of the sellers and  purchasers of new regional railroads.  6229  Before describing  the content of my bill,  I  would first like to offer my perspective on how  we arrived where we are today.  In  the years  leading up to 1980, the railroad industry was  suffering the negative effects of cumbersome  Federal  regulation. Nearly 25 percent of  the  Nation's railroads had  fallen  into bankruptcy  and much of the rest of the  industry was  in  deep financial  trouble. In an effort to reduce  operating  costs,  railroads attempted  to  re structure  their  light density  lines. However,  Federal  laws  required  labor protection pay ments whenever a railroad attempted to con solidate, merge, or abandon a rail line.  In response to the stiff labor protection re quirements, railroads embarked on a strategy  of abandoning service  in order  to abandon  lines. By driving business off  light density  lines, railroads could  reduce  the number of  workers who would qualify for labor protection  benefits when  the  line was eventually aban doned. During the decade of the 1970's, the  mileage of our Nation's largest railroads de clined by 37,000 miles.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 brought  about dramatic changes in the railroad indus try through deregulation. Under Staggers, rail roads were given a new opportunity to ration alize their systems through  line sales. These  line sales have become a popular alternative  to abandonment.  The Staggers Rail Act allowed the Interstate  Commerce Commission  [ICC]  to exempt  line  sales from labor protection requirements if the  purchaser was a nonrailroad entity. The  ICC  further expanded  this authority by voting  to  exempt all sales  to nonrailroad companies,  and to consider these transactions under ex pedited procedures.  Regional railroads are generally not encum bered by the same work rule restrictions used  by major  rail carriers. This enables  regional  railroads to turn profits on what would other wise be very marginal lines for major carriers.  The  ICC's blanket exemption  from  labor  protection standards has enhanced the finan cial  feasibility of sales of  light density  lines  and has led to tremendous growth in regional  railroads. Since 1980, 179 new regional  rail roads,  including 1 O  in my own State, have  been created. These  railroads now operate  more than 17,000 miles of line.  Although employment in the railroad indus try continues to fall, a majority of the Nation's  regional  railroads employ more people today  than they did on their first day of operation. In  addition, a majority of the employees of these  railroads work under union contracts. Never theless,  the authority of  the  ICC  to exempt  line sales from  labor protection requirements  has been questioned.  The authority of  the  ICC  to exempt  line  sales from  labor protection requirements has  been  the subject of  judicial  review. Unfortu nately,  conflicting  Federal  court  decisions  have now clouded, more  than clarified,  the  issue. It appears that final judicial resolution of  this issue will not be forthcoming for at least 2  years, until a case reaches the U.S. Supreme  Court.  In  the meantime,  it  is highly unlikely  that any sales will occur while this uncertainty  exists. In  fact, it is  likely that some railroads  may return to policies of abandonment. And it  ",1988
216,,100,-0.578,266,5,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the wake of  Jesse Jackson's political campaign  for  the  Presidency,  I am pleased  to share with my  colleagues  two enlightening articles  that ex emplify  the problem of  race  in  this country.  The first article entitled ""If Jackson Loses So What?"" appeared  in  the Cleveland Plain  Dealer on March 24, 1988. The article deals  with the realities of Jesse's bid for the Demo cratic nomination.  The second article entitled, ""A New Kind of  Racial Put-Down"" appeared  in  the Washing ton Post on March 28, 1988. This article disEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cusses a new phenomenon of hidden  racial  prejudice in this country relative to the Jack son campaign.  Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to share these  articles with my colleagues.  [From the Cleveland <OH> Plain Dealer,  Mar. 24, 19881  IF JACKSON LOSES-SO WHAT?  <By Mike Royko)  It's possible that when the primaries are  over and the Democratic National Conven tion begins.  Jesse  Jackson will have  the  most delegates. Not enough to automatical ly win the nomination, but more than any  of the other bumblers.  If that happens, what do the Democrats  do?  From what  they're now  saying,  they'll  look at the other candidates, decide which  one is the least feeble, then try to convince  the voters that they have found someone of  heroic stature.  Then this person will run and almost cer tainly  lose  to George Bush, who will be  propped up by Ronald Reagan, and all these  tens of millions of dollars in paid TV politi cal propaganda will have been wasted.  Since  they're  almost  certain  to  lose  anyway, why don't the Democrats  show  some imagination and do something differ ent, make a little history, put some pizzazz  into the whole thing.  What they should do is this: If Jesse Jack son has the most delegates going into the  convention,  they  should  nominate  him,  make him  the Democratic candidate  for  president.  That would be  the fairest  thing  to do.  After all, the Democrats have gone to great  pains to get away from the old-time back room dealing,  the delegate swapping and  the  brokering. When George McGovern  came  in with the most delegates, he was  nominated. When Walter Mondale was the  leader, they threw the convention to him.  So why not do the same if Jackson is the  leader?  What's that you say? Jackson will be a  cinch to lose? That's probably true, but so  what? George McGovern was a  cinch  to  lose, but that didn't stop  the Democrats.  Walter Mondale was a cinch  to  lose and  they went right ahead and let him do it.  Not only did they lose, but they left no  legacy  that would benefit the Democratic  Party in future campaigns.  By nominating Jackson,  the Democratic  Party would create a legacy by putting the  national conscience to a true test. We would  be having a referendum on racial discrimi nation, which is  the most destructive and  persistent of all our domestic problems.  Name any of our urban miseries-poverty,  crime, unemployment, education, housing and it boils down to race. Add up the costs,  not only in dollars, but in fear and distrust,  and the bottom line is race.  So why should the country waste time lis tening to some white neo-liberal, pseudo-lib eral, old-time liberal or whatever the rest of  these Democrats are, talking about all these  social problems when we can have the genu ine  article-someone who  has  lived  the  social problems. In fact, some might even  say  that he  is a  living, breathing, social  problem himself.  And what a perfect match-up  it would  be-Jackson vs. Bush. The Southern-born  black man  from  the humblest of back grounds against  the white Eastern aristo crat.  If Jackson got up and talked about what it  was like to ride in the back of the bus, to be  March 31, 1988  told he couldn't eat at a greasy spoon lunch  counter, to have the job doors slammed in  his face,  to sip from a separate drinking  fountain, how would Bush respond-by de scribing the difficulty finding  reliable do mestic help these days?  It's said that despite our glorious Consti tution, our statement of commitment  to  equality, we are really a racist nation. Even  our allies say it. The British scolded us all  during the 1960s civil rights demonstrations.  After all, it's one thing to shoot a few trou blesome Irishmen, but what we did in Selma  was absolutely unsporting.  So this will be our opportunity to demon strate that maybe we aren't as bad as they,  and many of us, think we are. Or maybe we  will find that we are as bad. Either way,  we'd learn something.  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 28, 19881  A NEW KIND OF RACIAL PUT-DOWN  <By Meg Greenfield>  The white people  I know who  remain  trapped in the residual racial prejudice of  our culture-and that, I fear, includes great  numbers of them who would swear other wise-do not use racial epithets or compara ble invective in their speech and probably  do not even think such things in private. On  the contrary, the tip-off that they are con cerned exclusively with the skin color of a  black person and don't begin  to  think of  him as an equal comes not in rudeness, but  in its ostensible opposite. This is the adop tion of a heavy-handed, clearly simulated,  relentlessly smiling and ultimately friend ship-suffocating tone of ""respect"" -or what  is meant to pass for respect. It is unyielding  and impenetrable, and the black person can  get no other response, no matter how hard  he tries. All this adds up to the new voice  and body  language of racial put-down. If  you want to see the phenomenon in action,  turn on your television set almost any day  of the week and notice how many of his  white critics, competitors. interlocutors and  even admirers approach Jesse Jackson this  way.  Maybe it was inevitable, and is merely a  way station en route from a bad place to a  much better one that we will reach in time.  But right now this well-mannered and im penetrable indifference isolating the black  from all others strikes me as simply a new  form of segregation. Certainly it is a defin ing feature of this campaign where Jackson  is  concerned. Fellow Democrats, who do  each other  the courtesy of combat,  just  smile condescendingly at Jackson, unwilling  to argue with him in public. They and the  million or so political kibitzers and analysts  on the case have apparently also not real ized until  lately how  racially arrogant  it  looked to keep on asking, as Jackson racked  up one success after another, ""What does he  really want?"" Belatedly the implication of  the question-that he could neither have  nor surely even suppose he could have the  presidency-became plain  to  them. They  were then at pains to say that they didn't  mean  Jackson couldn't be nominated or  that they did mean he couldn't be nominat ed, but that was only because he couldn't  win, which in turn was either not because  he was black but because he was controver sial or because other people wouldn't vote  for a black. Or something. Meanwhile, Jack son of course  flourished, not because of  their trepidation but because he is a hell of  a campaigner.  The Democrat's preoccupation with and  anxiety about Jackson's race and the pitiful  ",1988

Jean Adelsman,  Judith Borek, Shirley Borks, Dee Hardison,  Beulah Helgerson,  and Grace  LaPoint  all  share the qualities of generosity of spirit and  the kindness of concern for others.  Jean Adelsman faces enormous responsibil ity as managing editor of  the South Bay's  community newspaper, the Daily Breeze, while  still finding time to contribute to her communi ty. She has been selected  to serve on  the  Pulitzer Prize nominating committee and has  implemented a weekly feature article highlight ing activities of nonprofit organizations.  Ms. Adelsman holds the position of secre tary for the board of directors of the volunteer  center and has been a human  race board  member for 2 years. She frequently speaks to  groups of high school and college students as  a role model and inspriation.  Judith Borek serves as both an administra tor and counselor of children and their families  in her role as director of programs at Switzer  Center. Her deep  compassion  and  under standing  of  disabled  youngsters  extends  beyond Switzer Center, as she is responsible  for  the establishment of a summer  job pro gram open to all special education students in  three South Bay cities. Since  the establish ment of First S.T.E.P. in 1985, more than 60  high  schoolers  have  received  employment  training and placement  in summer  job pro grams, many of whom have been retained for  year-round, part-time employment.  Ms. Borek  is a member of  the Council of  Exceptional Children, a member of the Council  for  Children  with  Behavioral  Disorders,  member of  the Council  for Children with  Learning Disorders, a member of Pi Lambda  Theta, an honorary educational organization,  and past officer of CAPSES [California Asso ciation of Private Special Education Services].  Shirley Borks is an educator, teaching third  grade at Seventh Street School in San Pedro  where she  is a  training and demonstration  teacher.  Her  community  service  extends  throughout the bay area from the South Coast  Botanic Garden Foundation, where she is cur rently on the board of trustees to the League  of Women Voters, where she serves as water  and natural resources chair.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Ms. Borks is currently on the board of trust ees of the Community Association of the Pe ninsula [CAP] where she oversees the Multi cultural Committee and acts as historian. Her  love of the outdoors and  the environment is  reflected in her involvement with the Audubon  Society,  Sierra Club,  and Cabrillo Marine  Museum.  Dee Hardison's civic activities are outlined  by her participation in the Torrance City Coun cil, Torrance Planning Commission and  the  Torrance Park and Recreation Commission.  Dee's contributions  to  the community go  far  beyond her official  titles. When she sees a  need, she throws her considerable talents and  energies into accomplishing the task at hand.  Ms.  Hardison  has worked  tirelessly  for  better schools both as a volunteer and teach er, she has received the PTA Honorary Serv ice Award and Continuing Service Award. The  School Board Association honored her with  the Golden Bell Award and as a  leader  in  preservation of parks and open spaces she  received  commendation  from  the National  Recreation and Park Association.  Beulah Helgerson was selected volunteer of  the year for giving more than 4,000 hours of  service  to  the Retire Senior Volunteer Pro gram  [RSVP].  Her  community  service  is  boundless by the vital energy she shares and  the enthusiasm she exhibits when undertaking  each project. She excells in her ability to ar range  for and disseminate  information which  is of help to South Bay senior citizens and the  needy.  Ms. Helgerson hosts the Seniors in Action  Program which airs weekly in  the South Bay  area on the local cable network. She assists  with set-up and distribution of cheese and  other surplus items to the needy of the area  and has brought  the  ""Silver Saver"" Senior  Discount Program to many.  Grace LaPoint has dedicated much of her  volunteer  time  to  the South Bay Hospital,  where she served on the auxiliary board of di rectors. Her kindness and consideration of  others has been apparent in her untold hospi tal volunteer projects and work with the Salva tion  Army,  Head  Start  Program,  Abused  Women, and Children Program, and the South  Bay Hospital House Calls Program, making  daily contact with  those alone, disabled, and  aged.

Their spirit, energy and generosi ty is to be applauded and commended.  6255  UNIQUE HINDU TEMPLE SOCIE TY OF LEHIGH VALLEY HOLDS  FESTIVAL  HON. DON RITTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 31, 1988  ",1988
218,,100,0.268,279,5,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, the Lehigh Valley  has been blessed during  its entire history by  the existence of strong, proud, ethnic groups  in its population. One of the most recent and  must active ethnic additions to our population  are the Indian community.  Although the first settler from India came to  the Lehigh Valley  in 1960,  in 1977, a  large  group of immigrants from  India settled in my  district in Pennsylvania and formed the Hindu  Temple Society of Lehigh Valley. The purpose  of the society was to create a religious-cultur al center where old and young could meet  and participate in  religious and cultural  func tions. This was especially important for young  children so  that  they could  learn of, while  older members retained, the rich, 7,000-year old Hindu culture while adapting to their new  land. Now there are about 400  Indian-Ameri can  families, mostly professional and many  highly  successful,  in medicine,  engineering  and science, education, and business.  As a scientist and now a Congressman,  I  have enjoyed numerous working relationships  and  friendships with  this creative and high achieving group of people. As  their Repre sentative  in  the Congress  of  the United  States, I am proud of new and healthy dimen sions our Indian families have brought to the  Lehigh Valley.  The Hindu Temple Society  raised  the necessary funds within  their com munity and have built a unique Temple  in  Bethlehem, PA. Mr. Speaker,  this is the  first  temple in the world where all the four religions  of  Indian origin-Hinduism, Buddhism, Jain ism,  and Sikhism-are worshipped  on  the  same pulpit.  The Vedas,  the old Hindu scriptures date  back to more than 5,000 years B.C. We also  know,  in education, great Indian minds gave  birth to the decimal system, digit system, and  the concept of zero which became the foun dation of mathematics and the ensuing scien tific endeaver of mankind.  India also gave  birth  to a great man-Mahatma Ghandi-a  wonderful soul who showed the world a new  dimenstion of nonviolence. India as a beautiful  spring day, has brought  forth much beauty  and wisdom for the world to use. Not only in  my district, but around the Nation, we can all  point with pride to the  Indian-Americans who  are fellow citizens and good neighbors.  Indian-Americans have enriched my life and  the  lives of my constituents. And  I believe  their contribution to our society is only begin ning. Mr. Speaker, on  the occasion of  the  April 9 Holi Festival of Colors at the Temple,  which heralds the start of spring, I ask my col leagues to join with me  in conveying our ap preciation for the contributions from the grow ing Indian-American community.

219,,100,-0.126,292,5,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I am today in troducing the ""Winding Stair Mountain Nation al Recreation and Wilderness Area Act,"" a  comprehensive plan of wilderness, botanical,  recreation and scenic and wildlife areas com ponent designations to benefit future genera tions of Oklahomans and the United States.  For the  last 2 years, we have spent hun dreds of hours developing  this plan which  I  believe  is  the  right combination of designa tions and needed management changes and  is acceptable to those interested in the man agement of the Ouachita National Forest  in  Oklahoma. The plan I offer to the Congress is  one of very delicate balance and was crafted  after local hearings, formal and informal meet ings, field visits to the forest and one-on-one  conversations with  interested parties.  I have  remained objective and allowed the same lati tude and openness to each group.  Without question, this bill has been probably  the most difficult piece of legislation on which  I have worked during  the 12 years  I have  been in the Congress. However, with passage  of this bill it will be one of the most personally  satisfying things that I will have accomplished  in the Congress. What began as a look at only  RARE II  lands for wilderness designation was  expanded greatly to include a comprehensive  effort that will allow many people from across  this great country from this and future genera tions enjoy the Oklahoma portion of the Oua chita National Forest.  First, let me say I have never been one to  think  that we  should  set-aside  land  for a  single purpose that would not allow flexibility  and the utilization by a broad base of constitu encies. Each of the groups for or against wil derness have expressed to me the ""right"" po sition  to  take  in  this matter.  I could not be  honest with myself if, after looking at our com plete natural resources,  I could not say  that  some of the area  is deserving of being set aside untouched for future generations. When  I say untouched, I mean from the time of en actment of this legislation. All of the Ouachita  National Forest lands in Oklahoma were cut over by timber companies at the turn of the  century.  It  is only now  that the  forest once  again flourishes with diversity. We do not have  virgin  timber areas, but we are proud of the  resources we have.  Some of those opposed to wilderness admit  that  it needs  to be done but ""not now.""  If  something is not done now, then it will take at  least another 50  years  before  the  timber  would grow back provided it was cut. Some times you know down deep the right thing to  do and it is with courage you must pursue in  the face of adversity. That is my choice.  My staff and I have been working for sever al years with interested parties to find a sensi ble balance between the needs to preserve in  a pure state some of the undeveloped lands  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  while  also  accommodating  the  economic  needs of the area, State, and Nation.  This bill  is one  that  is well balanced and  provides  for  the  interests of  loggers-small  and  large-environmental  groups,  wildlife  groups-deer and  turkey-soil conservation  groups,  including  the  resource conservation  and development councils, tourism and recre ation  interests,  local civic organizations,  local  and State elected officials, and  local school  system officials.  Of the four areas on the Oklahoma portion  of the Ouachita evaluated under the RARE  II  study,  and  later  reevaluated,  Black  Fork  Mountain was recommended for wilderness at  a  level of 4,072 acres and Upper Kiamichi  was recommended for wilderness at a level of  8,852 acres. The bill I propose includes 4,523  acres for Black Fork Mountain Wilderness and  9,371 acres of Upper Kiamichi River Wilder ness. Had the Upper Kiamichi River tract not  been designated wilderness, it would have re ceived some  form of protection almost as  strong as wilderness because of  the scenic  sensitivity in the area which adjoins the Tali mena Drive.  The comprehensive plan should  result  in  little or no loss of revenues from Federal re ceipt sharing because of wilderness area  in volved  is  such  a  small  part of  the  total  1,591,849  acres  in  the Ouachita National  Forest  in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Changes  in management should have no  impact as  long as reductions  in  timber receipts do not  occur  in  other parts  of  the Ouachita.  In  McCurtain and LeFlore Counties alone, there  are a total of only 249,205 acres of Federal  forest  lands and  this bill only deals with a  small portion of that total.  Moreover, tourism and recreation enhance ment  to  the area will bring  revenue  to  the  local area to boost local earnings.  LeFlore County is becoming a major attrac tion for business and industry in the northern  part of the county while the southern part of  the county offers the most unique tourism and  recreation in Oklahoma. The enhancement of  tourism and  recreation opportunities will at tract more business and industry who look for  these kind of opportunities before locating in  an area. Areas that are not crucial to a viable  tourism  industry are available for commercial  timber activities. LeFlore County has the kind  of combination that most counties desire in at tracting business and industry.  Inholdings are held  to a minimum  in all  areas  that are proposed  for designation,  in  fact, a preliminary check has  indicated  that  most owners of inholdings are willing sellers.  The general rule is that inholders will have the  same access in wilderness and other desig nated areas as they did prior to the enactment  of this bill.  Let me make clear that this bill only affects  LeFlore County  in Oklahoma and  not any  other county  in Oklahoma or Arkansas  that  has portions of Ouachita National Forest.  Specific principal provisions of the ""Winding  Stair Mountain National Recreation and Wil derness Area Act"" are as follows:  First. The bill creates a 13,894-acre national  wilderness area which includes 4,523 acres as  Black Fork Mountain Wilderness Area and  9,371 acres as Upper Kiamichi River Wilder ness Area. Language  is  included  to protect  March 31, 1988  the area in the event of fire, insect outbreaks,  or disease. Careful consideration was given to  allowing roads for access as close as possible  when wilderness boundaries were drawn. No  buffer zones are to be established around the  designated wilderness areas. The  legislation  also ""frees"" other wilderness areas which had  been studied and designated as possible wil derness areas.  Hunting,  fishing, and  trapping, as well as  camping, will be allowed in wilderness areas,  except to meet special circumstances estab lished by the Secretary of Agriculture, or his  designee. Wildlife management activities per mitted under the Wilderness Act will continue  to improve the supply of game. ""lnholders"" people who own private property within  the  boundaries of the designated areas-generally  will have the same access to and use of their  properties as they do now.  Second. The bill designates 26,445 acres  as the Winding Stair Mountain National Recre ation Area.  ""Unevenaged""  timber manage ment-which means selective cutting-shall  be used within the recreational areas.  Timber harvest and sales shall be designed  so as to not detract from the scenic values of  the area. Management practices  that would  detract  from  the scenic quality and natural  beauty within view from the T alimena Drive or  Helson Valley Road would not be allowed in  the recreation area. This area would be princi pally managed  for the public enjoyment and  second  for wildlife. Further  landscaping at  turnouts,  improved picnic areas, and other  benefits to public use and enjoyment would be  enhanced.  lnholders should not be affected  by this designation.  Third.  The  bill  designates  a  8,026-acre  Robert S. Kerr Memorial Arboretum, Nature  Center and Botanical Area which would en compass the existing acreage at the Arbore tum and adds Rich Mountain-considered for  wilderness-which contains unique plant spe cies and vegetation similar to that contained  at  the arboretum. The bill does not change  the way the arboretum is now managed. No  commercial or Federal  timber harvesting will  be permitted on  this  tract, although mecha nized cutting for trail building shall be allowed.  Improvements and expansion of roads and fa cilities shall be permitted in the vicinity of the  Kerr Nature Center.  Fourth. The bill also designates 400 acres  near Beech Creek as the Beech Creek Botani cal Area. The same criteria for management  would be applied to Beech Creek as applied  to the Kerr tract.  Fifth. To best promote  the entire area for  tourism purposes, all of  these designations  shall be known on maps as the Winding Stair  Mountain National Recreation and Wilderness  Area.  Sixth.  In addition, a special ""esthetics and  wildlife management area""  is  to be estab lished along and  in view of Talimena Drive  and  the Helson Valley Road,  collectively  known as the Indian Nations National Scenic  and Wildlife Area. Management practices that  would detract from the scenic quality and nat ural beauty shall not be allowed in the area as  viewed  from any  location on  the Talimena  Drive and Helson Valley Road areas. This pri mary esthetic zone constitutes  the boundary  ",1988
220,,100,-0.265,370,5,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in sup port of H.R.  1975,  the Federal Cave Re sources Protection Act. I was pleased to intro duce this legislation with the cosponsorship of  my colleagues Mr. CRAIG and Mr. JOHNSON as  well as 29 other Members. I also want to com mend our colleague Mr. RICHARDSON  from  New Mexico for his valuable contributions with  respect to caves located on Indian lands.  This bill enjoys endorsements from the Na tional Speleological Society, National Wildlife  Federation, American Cave Conservation As sociation, Defenders of Wildlife, Bat Conserva tion International, Sierra Club and the National  Audubon Society. Senator DASCHLE has intro duced a companion measure in the Senate, S.  927.  The purpose of H.R. 1975 is to strengthen  the ability of Federal agencies to protect and  manage cave resources when they are situat ed on lands under the jurisdiction of the Sec retaries of Agriculture and Interior or on Indian  lands. There are two key questions which go  to the heart of this legislation: why are caves  worth protecting, and why  is  this  legislation  needed?  I will address each of these ques tions in turn.  Caves are worth protecting due to their di verse resources. Caves are home to a rich va riety of species, and many as-yet-undiscov ered species are  thought  to dwell  there as  well. These abundant and diverse species  provide a gene pool which is valuable for sci entific study and advancement. Caves are  also an  important conduit  for underground  rivers which serve as water supplies for many  rural  communities. Equally  important, caves  are a favored recreation site for visitors enjoy ing both their pristine and unusual beauty and  the adventure of cave exploration.  Caves are  in particular need of protection  because  they are nonrenewable  resources:  once caves are destroyed they are gone for ever. A decorative rock formation which took  hundreds of years to form can be destroyed in  moments. Exacerbating  this situation  is  the  fact that cave ecosystems are delicately bal anced and easily damaged.  The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act  is needed because  there  is a management  gap in present Federal law through which bal anced management of our Federal cave  re sources has slipped. For example, the Nation al Forest Management Act and  the Federal  Land  Policy  and Management Act, which  govern  the management of  the majority of  lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretaries  of Interior and Agriculture, do not specifically  mention caves as a resource to be considered  in the management of public lands.  A  report by  the Congressional Research  Service on cave protection stated  this prob lem succinctly,  ""It appears  that  the existing  land management laws are broad enough to  permit management of cave  resources, but  they do not expressly address  that goal or  compel that result.""  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In the absence of such direction, manage ment of caves on Federal  lands is inconsist ent and  inadequate.  In several New Mexico  caves, for example, colonies of Mexican Free  Tail bats have been decimated by vandals. In  Idaho, toxic waste was abandoned in a cave  and leaked into its soil. Throughout the United  States, graffiti and litter in and removal of sta lactite and stalagmite formations  from caves  on Federal lands have increased. The Federal  Cave Resources Protection Act addresses  these concerns by both empowering and di recting the Secretaries of Agriculture and Inte rior to include cave resources in land manage ment plans.  The act also authorizes the Secretaries of  Agriculture and Interior to withhold information  on the nature and location of a cave on Fed eral land when disclosure of such information  would create a substantial risk of harm  to it.  Although the caving community has more ex tensive  files on  the  location and nature of  caves on Federal lands than do Federal agen cies, it is hesitant to share these files with the  Federal Government out of concern that wide  distribution of the information would result in  vandalism and looting of unprotected caves.  This exemption would encourage the caving  community to come  forward with  its informa tion, thereby enhancing Federal land manage ment. For example, a Forest Service  land  manager has  related  to me  the hazards of  planning Federal timber sales without knowing  the location of caves in the harvest area.  Ig norance of a cave's location poses a danger  to  equipment and  loggers who  could  fall  through hidden cave openings.  There  is a precedent  for  this withholding  provision  in  the Archaeological Resources  Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA). ARPA's with holding provision has worked effectively  to  protect archaeological resources while provid ing exemptions for the disclosure of informa tion, and  I am confident  that H.R. 1975's  nearly  identical provision would work equally  as well.  In addition  to  the  land management and  withholding provisions, H.R. 1975 encourages  coordination of  information between Federal  agencies and the public, requires permits for  the  collection  and  removal  of  natural  re sources from caves, establishes criminal and  civil penalties for activities which are damag ing  to  the cave  resource, and authorizes a  special fund for the benefit of damaged cave  resources.  In preparing H.R. 1975,  the willingness of  volunteers  from  the  caving  community  to  share  their expertise and educate  the public  about cave resources has been impressive. In  administering this measure, I would hope that  Federal agencies would avail  themselves of  the caving community's expertise in the areas  of cave management and safety procedures.  At this time, I would like to make special note  of  the hard work which  caving  volunteers  Janet Thorne, Jer Thornton, Phil Lucas and  David Foster have contributed to the advance ment of this legislation.  Caves are  the  repository of diverse  re sources and are in need of enhanced protec tion. The Federal Cave Resources Protection  Act affirms that it is the policy of the United  States to protect cave resources on Federal  lands and provides the specific authority to do  April 11, 1988  so.

The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 4155  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That the  Armed Forces Recreation Center at Fort  DeRussy, Hawaii, shall be known and desig nated as  the ""Dan Daniel Armed Forces  Recreation Center"".  ",1988
222,House,100,0.232,383,5,Mr. MARTIN of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Mississippi for  introducing this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to sup port naming  this  recreation  center  after Dan Daniel.  All of us who knew Dan remember  him  for  his most  remarkable  at tributes of kindness and compassion  for people. Dan had a special place in  his heart for the welfare of the mil lions of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and  marines who devote themselves so un selfishly to the defense of our Nation.  His support for the well-being of the  military man and woman was repeat edly manifested in his unswerving sup port for resources to support the con tinuing effort to provide for an adequate quality of life for the American  military.  On many occasions we witnessed  Dan Daniel  rising on  the  floor  to  speak out for the welfare of the mili tary community. He also worked hard  behind the scenes at every opportuni ty to guarantee our military the bene fits to which they deserve and are en titled.  The  Armed  Forces  Recreation  Center in Hawaii had a special mean ing for Dan Daniel. He fought hard to  make  it the kind of place  that our  military could enjoy and be proud of.  Today, the Armed Forces Recreation  Center at Fort DeRussy provides de served  rest and relaxation for hun dreds of thousands of military people,  reciprocating  for  their devotion  to  duty.  Dedicating this center to Dan Daniel  would salute his passionate support  for our military personnel and allow  those who visit  this area reason  to  pause and reflect upon the memory of  our dear colleague.  Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, the  gentleman  from Virginia  [Mr. Dan  Daniell was one of the true gentlemen  I have ever had the privilege of serv ing with in any capacity.  ",1988
223,House,100,-0.172,383,5,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  this  bill is certainly a fitting tribute to one  of  the  real gentlemen of  the U.S.  House of Representatives.  Dan Daniel, the gentleman from Vir ginia who recently passed away, was a  member of the Committee on Armed  Services and as chairman of the Sub committee on Readiness spent a great  deal of his  time  to ensure that the  men and women of the Armed Forces  were maintained properly and  that  their recognition and welfare had a  high priority.  He  also  felt  very  strongly  about  equipment and facilities being in good  shape and properly maintained  for  these people.  Naming this Fort DeRussy Recrea tion Center after Dan Daniel  is  a  proper thing because of his interest in  the  soldier and  the sailor and  the  marine and the airman and their wel fare.  0 1230  Dan Daniel was a good friend. He  not only worked with us, he shared his  advice and his thoughts freely. Having  a distinguished career in the Virginia  House of Delegates, former chief of  the American Legion of  the United  States, a World War II Navy veteran,  he brought his expertise and his abili ty to get things done in the U.S. Con gress to this place and made it all the  better, not just for the fighting men  ",1988
224,House,100,-0.631,396,5,Mr. STARK.," Mr. se Speaker, it is with both  pride and sadness that I bring the accomplish ments of Hayward city manager Don Blubaugh  to the attention of my colleagues. While I am  proud to say that Don has been an excellent  city manager for the past 9 years, implement ing innovative and exciting changes within the  government of Hayward, I am sad to say that  he will soon be leaving us to start his new po sition as city manager of Walnut Creek.  Don  is  the  kind  of  constituent  every  Member of Congress dreams of. He not only  Mr. Speaker, several million boys,  girls, men, and women  suffer  from  eating disorders. These disorders are  best treated if detected early. But that  is not always easy, since  the person  with the disorder may be a model stu dent, with good grades and good be havior.  Mr. Speaker, on personal note,  a  member of my family was 15 when she  developed anorexia and later bulimia.  Her disease went undiagnosed for 1  full year. Then she was hospitalized  and underwent a 4-year life-and-death  struggle.  She  won  that  struggle.  Today, 15 years later, she has a hus band and a young child and is leading  a full and active life.  Her suffering would have been far  less had her disorder been diagnosed  earlier. That  is where  this bill can  help. Awareness week aims to increase  preventive efforts and to educate the  public  and  professionals,  such  as  teachers and coaches.  Nonprofit support groups  through out the country have organized activi ties for this week. Their theme: ""It's  What's Inside That Counts."" Through  conferences, speaking in schools, and  on  television  and  in  print,  these  groups will focus on early intervention  and will seek to puncture the myth  that  being  thin  necessarily means  being happy and in control of one's  life.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  look  forward  to  action in the Senate, where BARBARA  MIKULSKI has introduced a companion  bill, Senate Joint Resolution 259.  ",1988

226,Senate,100,-0.266,448,5,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, as  we consider the budget resolution, it is  important to look at the effect of that  budget on our  long  range economic  goals. More  than  any other  single  piece of legislation, the budget is the  reflection  of  the  Federal Govern ment's goals and priorities. In the near  future,  the Senate will  take up  the  conference agreement on the Omnibus  Trade and Competitiveness Act. It is,  therefore, especially appropriate that  we examine the budget resolution in  the context of our efforts to improve  America's economic competitiveness.  In recent months,  the administra tion has all but proclaimed our com petitiveness problem over. Yet,  last  year's historic  trade deficit has not  disappeared. Productivity growth  in  the United States lags behind that of  our economic competitors. The United  States  is  still  the world's  largest  debtor nation. We continue to add to  the $2. 7 trillion Federal debt at a rate  where interest payments on the Feder al debt  in  fiscal year 1989 will by  themselves exceed the total, combined  budgets of the Departments of Agri culture,  Commerce,  Education,  Energy,  Interior, Labor, and Justice,  the Veterans' Administration, the En vironmental Protection Agency,  the  National Science Foundation, and the  National Aeronautics and Space Ad ministration.  The  administration's  rosy  predic tions notwithstanding, we  still have  not dealt with the stagnating standard  of living for working Americans. Real  wages are below where they were 10  years  ago. The median  real  family  income is stagnated. The recently re leased report by the Corporation for  Enterprise  Development  entitled  ""Making the Grade: The 1988 Devel opment Report Card"" sums up the sit uation when it states:  One of the most jarring impacts of the  rapid restructuring of the American econo my during the 1980s has been the decline of  well-paid, low-skill jobs and the rise Of low paying, moderate-skilled jobs. Caught in be tween are people who once could support a  family by their labor and now cannot.  In area after area-trade, technolo gy, human  resources, capital  forma tion,  and  international  economic  policy-our competitiveness problems  remain. This is not to say that we have  not made progress, we have. But, con trary  to  the administration's claims,  we still have a long way to go.  Mr. President,  to begin  to correct  our problems, we must continue  to  make the restoration of our economic  competitiveness, with the purpose of  raising the standard of living, a major  priority of our economic policy. Deficit  reduction  is  important  to  improving  our competitiveness, and  the budget  currently under consideration fulfills  the deficit reduction commitment we  made  last year.  In  this  regard,  this  budget is a major step toward solving  our competitiveness problems. But, we  should keep  in mind  it  is only one  step. As we consider the budget resolu tion and move through the budget and  appropriations process, I urge my col leagues  to continue  to focus on the  larger problem of sustaining our com petitive position in the world economy.

227,Senate,100,-0.322,500,5,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, today I  appeared  before  the  Energy  and  Water Development Subcommittee of  the Senate Appropriations Committee.  I submit for the RECORD  the text of  my statement submitted to that com mittee.  STATEMENT OF SENATOR DAVID PRYOR  Mr. Chairman, it is my high honor and  personal privilege  to appear before  this  committee alongside the representatives of  the Red River Valley Association, the Ar kansas River Basin Interstate Committee,  the Ouachita River Valley Association and  the Lower Mississippi River Valley Flood  Control Association. On  behalf  of  our  friends and constituents from these areas of  Arkansas  and  the  surrounding  states  I  thank you Mr. Chairman for your diligence  in helping guide the Senate through some  very difficult economic times in recent years  while managing to keep our nation's public  works programs moving forward. It is no  small accomplishment, and you and your  staff are to be commended. I know our con stituents from these areas of the lower Mis sissippi River Valley and the Arkansas River  Basin, who are here today, fully recognize  and appreciate your efforts.  HELENA HARBOR AND PORT OF YELLOW BEND  Mr. Chairman, this past year this Com mittee took decisive action on two harbor  construction projects in Arkansas situated  on the Mississippi River that I believe are  absolutely crucial to economic recovery in  the Mississippi River Delta region. I speak  of the Helena Harbor project, which was au thorized in the Water Resources Develop ment Act of 1986, and the Port of Yellow  Bend, which was authorized under Section  107 of the Chief of Engineers' continuing  authority. The Committee acted on these  projects in the face of opposition from the  Administration, and that kind of courage  ought to be recognized.  How the Reagan Administration can con tinue to oppose economic development for a  seriously depressed region of our country on  the one hand, and tout economic recovery  as a tenet of Reagan achievements remains  a mystery to me.  Mr. Chairman, I anticipate continued ef forts by this Administration to avoid the ini tiation  of  construction  of  the Helena  Harbor project, and I want to assure you  that this Senator is going to continue his  unwavering efforts to see it constructed. I  hope and ask that you continue your sup port and ensure  that this Committee di rects,  in language and funding,  the Army  Corps of Engineers to move forward swiftly  with their design plans and specifications  and be prepared to commence construction  in FY 1989.  I believe that the Corps is committed to  constructing the Port of Yellow Bend, Mr.  ",1988
228,,100,0.739,513,5,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, as Americans we  all feel a burning desire to help the oppressed  people of  the world  in  the struggle against  their tyrants. We observe these people's tire less  fight  to secure a better  future  for  their  children and embrace  their struggle as  if  it  were our own. We share in their pain, sorrow,  frustration, and especially their commitment.  However, many  times  these  feelings  lead  some to foolishly embark on a quest to cure  the world of  it's many  ills. The world has  come  to realize  that an American on a cru sade can be as threatening as the Red Army  itself. Such is the case in South Africa today.  It has been almost 2 years since the passing  of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act and  black South Africans are no closer to achiev ing political and economic  freedom.  In  fact,  the  repercussions of  these sanctions have  dealt a hard blow to the black community. It is  time  to reexamine  the value of sanctions to  the cause of the South African blacks. Amer ica cannot continue to be a negative influence  on the black's struggle against apartheid.  The effect of sanctions on  the South Afri can economy are quite disturbing. By initiating  the exodus of over 170 U.S.  businesses,  these  sanctions have greatly hindered  the  blacks  in  their quest  to achieve economic  freedom. While whites  have  eagerly  pur chased  these companies at  firesale prices,  the blacks have suffered. They can no longer  benefit  from United States business spon sored employee welfare programs and are  now subject  to  the wrath of  the new Afri kaaner owners, who have systematically fired  their black workers. We all know that the key  to the establishment of a free, democratic so ciety is a strong middle class, yet we persist in  impeding the black community from achieving  this prerequisite for freedom. The blacks need  our help-the key  to  their  future  lies  in  the  continued presence of United States busi nesses in South Africa.  In addition,  the  sanctions have wreaked  havoc on South Africa's political establish ment. By threatening the security of the Afri kaaner community,  the sanctions have en hanced the political standing of the rightwing.  In the most recent elections, the liberal Pro gressive Federal Party [PFP] was defeated as  the  official  opposition  to  Prime Minister  Botha's administration. Moreover,  the once  moderate Botha has toughened his stance on  the black opposition for fear of losing popular ity within the white electorate.  Is  this  the  ""moral backbone"" so many of  my colleaguP.s demanded when they overrode  the President's veto and passed these sanc tions? When President Reagan vetoed  the  Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, he did not  do so under disdain  for  the South African  blacks. He foresaw the effect these sanctions  would have on the black community. But why  did so many Congressmen  ignore his warn ings? Was it a lack of foresight? Or did they  simply use  the black's struggle  to enhance  their own public image?  I challenge my colleagues  to open  their  minds and put the interests of the South Afri can blacks ahead of  their own.  Instead of  searching for praise from the media, we need  to search  for answers. Answers which will  assist the black community achieve economic  prominence as  the. first step  in securing a  future of freedom for their children.  For a deeper insight into the present situa tion in South Africa, I highly recommend an ar ticle entitled  ""The Scandal of Sanctions""  in  the March 1988 edition of the American Spec tator.   [From the American Spectator. March  1988]  THE SCANDAL OF SANCTIONS  <By Fleur de Villiers)  In the fall of 1986, fueled by moral out rage and high moral purpose, the United  States Congress set out  to punish South  Africa and express solidarity with its black  oppressed masses.  Its  chosen  instrument  was the imposition of sanctions that would  excommunicate  South Africa  from  the  world's economy until the apartheid state  was brought to its senses, if not to its knees.  Those who wielded bell, book, and candle  blithely  ignored  the  fact  that  sanctions  without the threat of direct military inter vention have had a dismal record in the con duct of  international affairs.  Indeed,  the  question of whether or not sanctions would  achieve the abolition of apartheid and the  transfer of power to the black majority was,  one suspects, always secondary. The main  aim was  not  to  liberate South African  blacks, but to free the U.S. Congress from  the frustration of doing nothing.  Moral outrage and an instinct for med dling in areas that few politicians visit and  even fewer understand are American quali ties the rest of the world has come to dread.  There are  few  spectacles on earth more  alarming  than American  legislators  in  search of a quick fix of other people's prob lems. But if this addiction has too frequent ly made United States foreign policy  the  diligent pursuit of folly, seldom has it been  more diligently or more blatantly pursued  than by those who believed that the only  way to bring South Africa into the family of  civilized nations was to remove all traces of  American influence.  Now, eighteen months since the passage  of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act,  the full extent of that folly should be ap parent  to  all-except  those  congressmen  and senators who, having saddled the sanc tions horse, are determined to ride it all the  way to this year's elections. But before one  examines  their  failure  to win  anything,  except possibly the approval of Jesse Jackson, it is important to reflect on just what  they  thought  they would achieve  in  the  heady days of October 1986 when Congress  overrode a White House veto to secure the  first humiliating defeat of a hitherto all conquering President.  It is perhaps not too cynical to suggest  that that was part of the attraction. But  other motives were confused and contradic tory. For  some-the high-minded  rather  than  the  ruthless-excommunication was  the only way  to convince Pretoria of the  error of  its ways; white South Africans  would feel  the pinch and, putting wealth  above racism, would force their government  to change, thus effectively preventing the  expected bloodbath. For others revolution  was  the solution, not  the problem. Sanc tions, they calculated, would so impoverish  black South Africa that, with nothing left  to lose, it would rise up against its fatally  weakened white oppressors and thus usher  in the Utopia where all men were equal in  poverty and which would no longer make  any claim on America's conscience <only on  its purse). Those who felt a  little queasy  about inflicting further penury and depriva tion on South Africa's black citizens were si lenced with the answer that this  is what  South Africa's black leaders themselves de manded.  In any case,  it was suggested, sanctions  would  be  felt more  keenly  by wealthy  whites than by blacks who had little enough  anyway-a proposition that ignores the inte gration of the South African economy and  the simp1e fact that if you take food away  from a fat man he will suffer, but if you  take it away from a thin man he dies.  Above .and beyond all these considerations  was the conviction that a successful transfer  of power to the black majority was inevita ble, if not imminent, and that it was impor tant for America's long-term interest in a re source-rich region to ""get on the right side  of history""; failure to do so would hand the  area over  to Moscow and  its surrogates.  That belief was shared not merely by sanc tioneers  in Congress-Senators Kennedy,  Simon, Lugar, and Cranston and Congress men Wolpe,  Solarz, Gray, Rangel,  and  Leland-but by state and municipal govern ments  across  the United States which,  through boycott and threat of boycott, have  at the latest count sent 170 American com panies in South Africa stampeding for the  exit.  But just how effective has the whole sanc tions package been-disinvestment  includ ed? How have the promises survived more  than a year of practice?  The first answer was not long in coming.  President Botha cashed. in quickly, using  this unexpected American bonus to call and  win an election  in early May, calculating  correctly that external threat would induce  the white electorate to rally round the flag.  In a country in which history has bred a  strong  strand  of  isolationism,  he  could  hardly go wrong. But South Africa is not  unique. Other histories have-or  should  have-instructed us that a people who be lieve  their security  is  threatened will put  that security above material considerations.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

229,,100,0.348,526,5,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  it  gives me great pleasure to set-aside this time  to recognize Father Peter D. Costarakis of St.  Prophet Elias Church of San Bernardino, CA.  Father Costarakis will be honored on May 1,  1988, for serving 25 years as a priest of the  Greek Orthodox Church. I would like to honor  him today by saying a few words about his ac complishments during his distinguished career.  Mr. Costarakis was born  in Dara, Greece,  on June 10, 1937. His father, a priest of the  Greek Orthodox Church in Greece, was invit ed  to serve the Greek Archdiocese of North  and South America. The family arrived in the  United States on December 23, 1946, settling  in Lewiston, ME.  In 1963, Peter Costarakis received his bach elor of arts and bachelor of divinity in theology  from Holy Cross Seminary in Brookline, MA. In  1970 he received an S.T.M. from St. Vladimir  Seminary  in New York. He was ordained on  March 17, 1963, by Metropolitan Germanos at  the St. Sophia Church  in Albany, NY. Father  Peter Costarakis represents the  fifth genera tion of his family to enter the priesthood.  Father Peter has exemplified a dedication to  the ministry which few possess. From 1963 to  1964 he dutifully served  the entire State of  Montana as a missionary priest after which he  moved to Troy, NY, where he served as priest  for 14 years.  During his stay in New York, Father Peter  founded and served as president of the St.  Andrew Orthodox Brotherhood of upstate New  York and was cited by Nelson Rockefeller for  his accomplishments.  In addition  to his al ready demanding church duties, Father Peter  also served on the board of directors of the  New York State Red Cross.  In 1978 he moved  to San Bernardino, CA  where he still resides and continued his phil anthropic ways.  In southern California, Father  Peter has served on a multitude of Church  councils and commissions. He  is a member  and past president of the Southern California  Orthodox Clergy Council. He also occupies  the position of orthodox chairman of the Or thodox-Roman Catholic Dialogue Commission  of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Further,  he presently serves on  the Diocese of San  Francisco Mixed Council, the Diocese of San  Francisco Presbyters Council, and  the San  Bernardino Ministerial Association.  Although  Father  Peter's  service  to  his  church  is  in  itself commendable,  the honors  and  awards  Father  Peter  has  received  throughout his professional  life represent the  feelings of those who have been most familiar  with  the work he has accomplished.  In addi tion  to  the honors previously mentioned,  in  1979 Father Peter was awarded  the  title of  steward of  the church and  later was named  protopresbyter of the Diocese of San Francis co. Father Peter currently holds the position of  liturgical officer of the Greek Diocese of San  Francisco, and in June 1988, will be awarded  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the title of protopresbyter of the Ecumenical  Patriarchate of Constantinople.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in salut ing Father Peter Costarakis. He serves as an  outstanding example to us all  for his dedica tion to the improvement of his church and his  community.  It is with great respect that I pay  tribute to him today.  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  HON. PETER W. RODINO, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 12, 1988  ",1988
230,,100,-0.435,526,5,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago  our Nation lost a leading voice for justice and  freedom. The assassination of Martin Luther  King, Jr. on April 4, 1968 was one of the most  tragic events in American history.  Dr. King was still a young man when he was  killed and he was deprived of the richness of  a long life. We were also deprived of the pres ence and  the wisdom of  this great man.  I  know  that  I still miss his voice of  inspired  leadership as deeply now as during  the  first  months after his death. Throughout the past  20 years as we worked to honor our commit ment to ensuring a fair and just society for all  Americans, Dr. King's firm, resolute, and confi dent voice would have provided  inspiration  and encouragement.  But Martin Luther King, Jr.'s voice does live  on because his dream was stronger than life  and more powerful than death.  It lives on  in  the effort to guarantee a decent quality of life  for every citizen.  It  lives on  in  the vigilance  necessary to preserve equal opportunity for all  Americans.  It  lives on  in  the  international  struggle  for human  rights. Throughout  the  world, wherever  people  are  searching  for  peace or striving  to overcome  injustice-Dr.  King's voice and his dream continues to pro vide inspiration and comfort.  Dr. King's voice also lives on  in the hearts  and minds of all Americans as we continue to  nurture his dream. This was reflected  in  the  outpouring of respect and emotion across the  United States on  the 20th anniversary of his  death.  Mr. Speaker, my own city of Newark, NJ  honored  the memory of Dr. King on April 4,  1988 with a ceremonial groundbreaking  for  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Courthouse.  I am  proud  to  have  sponsored  the  legislation  naming this new courthouse after Dr. King.  It  will serve as a living memorial and reminder to  future generations of  the  true greatness of  Martin Luther King, Jr. With your permission, I  would like to include the following article in my  remarks.  [From the Star Ledger, Apr. 5, 1988]  KING HONORED-OFFICIALS BREAK GROUND  FOR COURTHOUSE  <By Frederick W. Byrd)  Ceremonial groundbreaking  for  the $60  million Martin Luther King courthouse in  Newark was held yesterday afternoon as  speakers, noting it was the 20th anniversary  of King's death, said the building would be  a symbol of his life's ideals.  ""Years from now, little children will look  at this building and ask, 'Who was Martin  April 12, 1988  Luther King?'"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg  <D-N.J.). ""So the story will be told again.""  Construction of the $60 milion, five-story  federal courthouse is to begin this year and  be completed in 1990, acording to spokes men for the General Services Administra tion <GSA>.  It will add 15 new courtrooms to the seven  federal courtrooms now located in Newark.  GSA  spokesmen  estimate  the  350,000square-foot structure will provide about 800  jobs.  . While praising the building, Newark offi cials said there was a ""downside"" to the de velopment in that it is another building in  Newark that will not pay property taxes.  ""It is my hope and the hope of my council  colleagues that the federal government will  provide  an  in-lieu-of-tax  payment ""  said  Council President Henry Martinez.  '  The audience assembled  in  the second floor conference room of the Rodino Feder al Building for the formal ceremonies and  unveiling of a model of the new building.  They held a 30-second silent  tribute  in  honor of King, who was assassinated on  April 4, 1968, while arranging a march to  help sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn.  Then  the officials went outside  to  the  courthouse  site-Walnut  and  Orchard  streets-to turn the ceremonial first shovel fuls of dirt.  Mayor Sharpe James noted King came to  Newark during the last week of his life.  ""I remember he spoke at South Side High  School  <now Malcolm X  Shabazz High  School) which is my alma mater and Mayor  (Edward> Koch's alma mater.  ""He told the youngsters to 'burn the mid night oil ... learn, baby, learn.'""  ""Even in death,"" the mayor said, ""he lives  on, he still shines like a bright star.""  ""This building underlines his  idea  that  justice should never be out of reach for all  Americans,"" he added.  ""If Dr. King were alive today he would be  concerned about justice for all. By dedicat ing this courthouse we can relive the whole  dream and purpose of this great humanitar ian.""  Lautenberg, who along with Rep. Peter  Rodino <D-lOth Dist.) sponsored legislation  naming the structure after King, said, ""He  told us injustice anywhere is a threat to jus tice everywhere. The courthouse will be a  daily reminder of that.""  John Alderson, acting national adminis trator of the GSA, said naming the building  for King is appropriate because ""he gave his  life in pursuit of justice for his fellowman.""  The courthouse will mean ""a net expan sion of the number of judges and facilities  in Newark, making Newark truly a federal  judicial center,"" said William Diamond, the  GSA regional administrator.  Essex County Sheriff Thomas D' Alessio  said  the new courthouse will further  the  ends of justice in Newark. ""This centralizes  the location and is a great honor for the  city,"" he said.  Allen Trousdale, the project director. de scribed  the building  as  a  contemporary  design, ""but an interpretation of the neo classical style of  the existing government  buildings nearby.''  ""We set the roof line of the King building  at  the same  level as  the cornice of  the  present courthouse across Walnut Street""  he said.  '  ""There is a one-story stone base to sup port the main facade. The main body of the  building has a portico and colonnade of pi lasters, capped with a cornice of  the top  floor.""  ",1988

I  simply want  to say I  think,  for  once, we have an issue before us that  is perhaps simpler than it has been  made out to be. That is not often the  case here.  This is not a very complex problem  we seek to resolve, and it is not a very  complex solution  that your commit tees have suggested.  The real issue presented by the legis lation  is whether or not we assume  that  the States  can manage  their  waters and  the shipwrecks  lying  in  them in a proper and responsible fash ion.  If you assume-and this Chamber, at  least as far as I can recall, is full of  folks who give a great many state ments  about States  rights-if  you  assume that States can exercise their  responsibilities  properly,  then  you  should support this bill; if you assume  that States will be fair to their own  people, you should support this bill; if  you assume that a stable, predictable  regulatory system to govern the exca vation of shipwrecks is better than one  that would probably require a Federal  lawsuit every time you want to recover  an underwater  artifact,  you  should  support this bill.  The Chamber  is  full of Members  who think the States are perfectly ca pable of carrying out their general re sponsibilities with respect to the man agement  of  lands  and natural  re sources, police and safety and other  functions. If we do not fear our States,  if we do not have a disrespect for their  elementary  capabilities  elsewhere,  there is no reason on this Earth that  we should not vest in them unequivo cally and clearly and beyond legal dis pute this responsibility.  I urge Members to support this bill.  ",1988

245,,100,-0.332,825,5,Mr. NOWAK.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to  bring  to my  col leagues' attention an essay that Deanna Lee  Dascomb, a student from Cheektowaga, NY,  in  the  33d Congressional District which  I  proudly represent, wrote for the annual voice  of democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest,  sponsored by  the Veterans of Foreign Wars  and its ladies auxiliary.  A senior at Maryvale High School, Ms. Das comb's essay was chosen from thousands of  other entrants to represent New York State in  a national competition. Her essay,  reprinted  here, entitled  ""America's Liberty-Our Herit age"" poignantly describes that essential qual ity that makes America truly a unique nation  and an inspiration to the world.  AMERICA'S LIBERTY-OUR HERITAGE  <By Deanna Lee Dascoinb)  Liberty. This one simple word takes on so  many different meanings. During the Revo lutionary War, people wanted  this more  than anything. Men fought for  it,  risked  their lives for it, and even died for it. Why  was  this so  iinportant  to not  just a  few  people, but an entire nation? To them, liber ty meant a personal freedom from tight re strictions  placed  upon  them  that were  beyond their control. It meant being able to  express  themselves  and  act  freely  upon  their emotions. It meant being an individual  and living life by their own standards and  not someone elses. Life can only be a mere  existence without  the  freedom  that our  country enjoys so much. The sense of liber ty was so enormous, that it spread to other  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  countries throughout the world. Thousands  of immigrants poured into America during  the 1800's and the earlier part of the 20th  century. They brought along with them a  desire  to  lead a better life and become a  better people. Why did they choose Amer ica? What drew  them  to our country,  in stead of some other land? Freedom is the  answer. Our  ancestors  that made  their  homes in America all came here for the end less benefits that freedom brings, and those  benefits have remained the same for today's  generation.  Each person has their own definition of  liberty, but  the major points will never  change. When I think of America, a number  of things come to mind; freedom, opportuni ty and a strong sense of individuality which  sets this country apart from the rest. Here  in our country, freedom serves as the build ing block in the construction of the entire  nation. Without freedom there would be no  intermingling of cultures or a variety of be liefs and values, because everyone would be  living under the same roof. There would be  no chance for opportunities because there  would always be a limit on social mobility.  Without opportunity, there couldn't possi bly be a growth of  individuality because  people would be looked upon as a whole.  This  is what America was  like before we  won our  independence and  this  is what  caused men to fight and die for the freedom  that meant more than life itself.  Walking hand-in-hand with liberty is op portunity. Behind this  lies a wide assort ment of choices which are open to anyone  who has an ambitious soul to choose. Pursu ing goals in America has one great reward,  and that's accomplishment.  There  are many  different  goals  that  people want to reach, and because the world  has so many careers and vocations to offer,  almost every skill has a use. Everyone who  enters this country has a chance to become  the creator of his or her destiny. Being able  to choose one's own lifestyle is a basic free dom everyone should have, but those who  weren't blessed with that, entered the doors  of America.  One of the finer aspects of a free nation is  the elasticity of opportunity.  Jobs don't  have to remain jobs forever, but can grow  into a career. Freedom also involves moving  up the ladder to a higher position if one de sires to do so. Not only does this raise the  standard of living, but it also brings along a  sense of pride and self worth. A perfect ex ample is the unknown cook hidden in the  back of a fast food restaurant. He may start  out working for minimum wage, but as years  go by, he may be the head chef in an elite  restaurant or the meal planner for a chain  of hotels. There will always be a thirst for  self improvement and a desire to live up to  one's  fullest  capability, but without  the  freedom of social mobility, this craving can  never be satisfied. In Ainerica, the only dry  souls are those who wish to stay that way.  Our ancestors were  in search of  this ad vancement, and it meant so much to them  that  they  left  their homes and  traveled  overseas to find it.  The key  to  advancement  is  education.  Moving up is made possible by the many fa cilities set up to increase learning. All over  the nation there are colleges and universi ties specially designed to serve the needs of  motivated students, wishing to make their  mark in the world. Without education, the  doors to many careers will remain locked.  Millions of people have taken advantage of  this  by making  an  investment  in  their  future. This could only happen in a nation  6801  that wants only the best for its people, and  with this sort of quality anyone would find  America a great place to live.  Because of  the  countless opportunities  available  to  us  and  the many different  people of all nationalities and character, our  country has become a land of wide diversity.  I like to think of America as being one giant  coloring book, and each person who is a part  of it is given a different color crayon. We all  shade in our part, and when it's done, the  result is one big beautiful picture of Amer ica. Each color has its own purpose, its own  value and its own significance. Without even  one color, the picture could not be complete.  This  is what American liberty stands for.  This  is what brought shiploads of people  into our harbors, and this is why we should  all value our freedom and honor our pride.  If our nation were to become anything less,  America could only be black and white.  LEADERSHIP  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 13, 1988  Mr. HAMIL TON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington Report for Wednesday,  April  13,  1988  into  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD:  LEADERSHIP  Everywhere in southern Indiana, Hoosiers  talk to me about the need for good leader ship. Candidates for the presidency are also  talking about a leadership gap in Washing ton. Each candidate argues  that he can  supply something missing, and he defines  that absent quality as leadership. Yet for all  our talk about leadership, it seems to me  that we are never really sure what we mean  by leadership and what we are looking for  in our leaders. American voters seem to be  yearning  for  something we  cannot quite  define.  People ask me repeatedly why there does  not seem to be another Jefferson, another  Lincoln,  or  another Franklin Roosevelt  among the current presidential contenders.  The voters seem uneasy that no one seems  to have the formula for governing America  effectively. But it  is hard to define what  makes a great leader. It has been noted that  while  the  accomplished  general Ulysses  Grant made a not-so-great president, Lin coln, a man with a less distinguished record,  became a great president. Thinking back on  John Kennedy's 1960 campaign, I do not re member finding Indiana voters terribly ex cited by the man who would later become a  new American legend.  Although leadership qualities are desired  in our elected officials,  I  am always  im pressed by the ambivalent feeling of voters  toward most political  leaders. Americans  recognize  the necessity of political skills,  but they do not seem to put political leader ship high on their list of personal values. Al though political figures often dominate the  lists of the most admired people, few par ents come  to me and say that they want  their children or grandchildren to be politi cians. Even so,  they recognize that politi cians can have a great influence on their  daily lives-that their actions can help or  hurt people, or can contribute or fail to con tribute to social progress.  There are many  leadership qualities  re vered  by Americans:  experience,  intelli",1988
246,House,100,0.255,838,5,Mr. MOLINARI.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley  is  to be commended for the forceful  initiative his Department is taking in  investigating the management and fi nancial fitness of the Texas Air Corp.  to fly commercial air passengers.  The  fact  that yesterday  the FAA  also  announced a  proposed  fine of  close to $1 million against Eastern Air  Lines for safety violations on top of  the $9.5 million it previously received  clearly demonstrates  the need for a  special investigation of Texas Air.  We have seen a continuing pattern  of problems at both Eastern Air Lines  and Continental Airlines, both owned  by Texas Air. It is disturbing that in  1984 the NATI inspection program re ported Eastern Air Lines' very poor  safety record. Now, 4 years later, East ern's record is still poor.  Ten months  ago  I wrote  to Mr.  Burnley's predecessor and asked for a  white gloves or thorough inspection of  Eastern's fleet. No action was  taken  then, but I am pleased to see the spot light of Federal scrutiny being focused  on Texas Air at this time.  Through his announcement yester day, Secretary Burnley is sending the  right message  to Texas Air manage ment and to the management of all  commercial air carriers. This is abso lutely essential to ensuring air safety,  and the Secretary has made an impor tant move in that direction.

247,House,100,0.186,838,5,Mr. RIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I have in troduced legislation that, in my view,  is essential  to the continued sepera tion of banking and commerce, essen tial to the protection of federally in sured deposits.  This  legislation certainly addresses  an  ongoing  and  questionably  legal  takeover  of  the Koppers Corp.  of  Pittsburgh. But for my colleagues that  are being visited by the army of lobby ists  for  Shearson-Lehman-Hutton American Express and foreign banking  firms, you should understand that this  takeover has implications far beyond  the  immediate  hostile  takeover  of  Koppers.  For the first time, an enormous di versified  financial  services  firm  in tends to use  its resources, which in clude the resources of America's 20th  largest bank, for the purpose of taking  an equity position in a corporate take over of a industrial firm. If Shearson  can carve  itself out this new, prece dent-setting innovative role in the cor porate takeover business, the takeover  of Koppers is only the beginning. No  domestic bank or bank holding compa ny could undertake this role because  American  laws protect  federally  in sured deposits from this risk.  Second, this takeover has a foreign  bank holding company, National West minster Bank,  engaged  in  activities  that the U.S. bank holding companies  cannot undertake.  Mr. Speaker, this takeover involves  risk for federally insured deposits, in volves a foreign bank effort to disman tle a U.S. company with the assistance  of Wall Street and foreign financiers.  The takeover reeks from lack of con cern for Koopers employees, communi ties,  and  long-term  investors. Pitts burgh  today,  and  your  community  may be the target tomorrow.

251,Senate,100,-0.352,916,5,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I will  not take 5 minutes.  I just want to clarify a couple points  that have arisen in the course of the  most recent moments of the debate.  First of all, I really want to make it  clear to my colleagues that this is not  lashing out. This is not an effort to be  tough. It is not an unreasonable spur of-the-moment, moment-of-the-month  respose  to  the headlines of  recent  days.  I was a cosponsor of this amendment  last year,  and  I  thank  the distin guished ranking member of the For eign Relations Committee  for  once  again joining as a cosponsor this year.  We had a  standard by which  to  measure  last year. This  is  the same  debate we had last year. Not too many  words have changed except  that we  have a new report that measures the  language of cooperation.  Mr. President,  I heard  the distin guished Senator from Connecticut say:  ""Why aren't we talking about all these  other countries?"" Well, Mr. President,  we did look at all those other countries. We made the judgment that Co lombia extradited Carlos Lehder, had  its Minister of Justice assassinated, its  Attorney General assassinated, half of  its  supreme court assassinated,  and  was still taking risks in trying to fulfill  the limits of  its ability. We made a  judgment about the other countries.  But the fact  is  that the State De partment report says 50 to 60 percent  of all the marijuana and cocaine that  enters  the  United  States  comes  through  the Bahamas and 30  to 35  percent of all the marijuana and co caine  entering  the United  States  comes through Mexico.  So, Mr. President,  if you  take  the  low end of the estimate, we are dealing  with 80 percent of the drugs that come  into the United States. And if you take  the high end of the estimate, we are  dealing with 95 percent of the drugs  that  come  into  the United States  through  these  two  countries  alone.  That is not lashing out. That is not  unreasonable. And  it is fair that we  make  the  tough  judgment about 95  percent of the drugs coming into the  United States of America.  Mr. President, the State Department  report used words  like: ""much more  needs to be done""; ""no court proceed ings  to date""; ""the government does  not vigorously enforce""; ""the lack of  meaningful enforcement""; ""they have  yet  to  demonstrate  the  necessary  will""; ""the Nigel Bough proceedings  continue.""  This is not just one issue. It is not  just one item of noncooperation. It is a  pattern.  Now,  I  respect the letter from the  President of the United States, but it  was very carefully crafted. The letter  said seizures are up and it said oper ational  cooperation  is  good.  That  means the Coast Guard gets what it  wants.  Let me read to you from a New York  Times February article. This is the tes timony of David Westrate, Assistant  Administrator for Operations at the  DEA. He said:  The Drug Enforcement Administration  has often been willing to overlook allega tions of official corruption to insure contin ued cooperation with  its operations. Mr.  Westrate compared the level of cooperation  in the Bahamas to that of the drug agency  received from General Noriega. He said the  agency  has  ""never made  a  request  in  Panama that hasn't been honored.""  If that does not tell the story about  all this operational claptrap and about  seizures.  Do you know what they do? We had  a wonderful bit of testimony from two  different witnesses,  both  of whom  made a  living  smuggling drugs and  now they are spending, between them,  about 63 years in  jail. Do you know  what they said? That the Government  of Mexico seized some ships, counted  it as a seizure, and escorted them to  the other side of the gulf and let them  go. That is a seizure.  Do you know what happens to the  drugs when  they  seize  them? The  police go out and sell them later. And  we have had testimony of how one of  the defendants even made a deal to  get  away by giving  the police  the  drugs and they let him fly off into the  sunset, Mr. President.  If we cannot make it a tougher judg ment about seizures and operational  cooperation,  if General Noriega has  not taught us a lesson, I am not sure  what is going on.  The law is clear. The law sets stand ards.  The  question  here  today  is  whether the U.S. Senate is going to  uphold its own laws or whether we are  going to make a mockery of this proc ess.  I yield back my time.  ",1988
252,Senate,100,-0.355,968,5,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I  rise  as a cosponsor of the legislation being  introduced today by my distinguished  colleague, Senator HEINZ of Pennsyl vania. The issue, and indeed the legis lation that Senator HEINZ is introduc ing,  is  timely. We have pending  in  Congress major legislation governing  both the role of banks in the securities  business, and corporate takeovers gen erally. Senator HEINZ' proposal is ap propriate for  incorporation  in either  bill.  The legislation addresses a situation  where an investment bank has made  an unprecedented equity interest in a  highly leveraged hostile takeover-in  effect  acted  as  a  corporate  raider,  rather than an offeror of investment  advice. Most importantly, this invest ment bank has done this at the same  time it is in the highly unusual posi tion of owning the 20th largest f eder ally insured bank in the United States.  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say  that  the  banking  industry  in  this  country  traditionally has followed a  philosophy of conservatism and avoid ance of risk. When it has strayed from  this course it has gotten into trouble.  Thus, when the owner of a bank, for  whom the Federal Government is pro viding  insurance,  takes an enormous  equity interest in a highly leveraged  hostile acquisition, I  think it is  time  for us  to pause and  reexamine  the  laws that permit this to occur.  The separation of banking and com merce has been a basic tenent of bank ing law in America for generations. It  is good public policy. The separation  of banking and commerce is a check  against conflicts of interest. It protects  federally  insured deposits  from  risk,  and  it prevents  these deposits  from  subsidizing nonbanking activities.  Mr.  President,  so-called  nonbank  banks are somewhat of an enigma in  this  scheme.  In  last year's banking  bill, we grandfathered over 100 such  banks to be owned by diversified com panies. I supported this legislation and  still do. However, we did not foresee a  situation where  a  federally  insured  nonbank bank would be a very, very  large part of a company's operation, at  the same time the company engaged  in corporate funding.  Thus, Senator HEINZ'S bill has much  merit. Quite simply, it says that when  a bank comprises over 10 percent of a  financial services company's business,  that company cannot make an equity  investment in a nonfinancial services  firm of greater than 5 percent. Indeed,  the proposal parallels just one of the  many restrictions on traditional bank  holding companies-the provision of  the Bank Holding Company Act that  limits equity investments in nonbank ing activities to 5 percent.  Mr. President,  it's often said  that  banks occupy a  special place  in our  economic system. We confer certain  advantages on both banks and their  owners and in return expect them to  fullfill certain obligations.  I  respect fully submit that corporate raiding is  not one of these obligations.  In closing, I want to note that the  Koppers Co.,  that has unfortunately  become a takeover target recently, has  been an outstanding public citizen of  my home State for over 50 years. Its  forest products division services some  400 sawmills statewide, and its Stone  Man Construction operation is an im portant part of  the east Tennessee  economy.e  By Mr. LEVIN:  S. 2289.

253,Senate,100,0.275,981,5,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  wish to call my colleagues' attention  to an excellent article by Tom Clancy  entitled ""America's Favorite Whipping  Boys."" Like me, many of my  col leagues may  have  read  some  of  Clancy's books, such as ""Hunt for Red  October""  and  ""Red Storm Rising.""  They are outstanding.  So is this article.

As he shows, the men  and women who serve in our Armed  Forces have  taken a  few bum  raps  through the years, and they haven't  always  gotten  the  credit  they  de served.

How could I be,  after walking down the gangplank of  the S.S. Majestic on December  23,  1935, finding refuge with my mother  and father  in a  country which has  since allowed me such success?  Defense spending is never popular,  and yet is as necessary as the lock on  the door or  the policeman  the  street.

254,,100,-0.358,994,5,Mr. BRYANT.," Mr. Speaker, Bob Bullock,  Texas' Comptroller of Public Accounts for the  past 13 years, has been a fixture in the public  life of Texas for more than three decades and  is,  in his own  inimitable way, a symbol of  Texas.  He's left his indelible mark along the way as a member of the Texas House of Repre sentatives, as an assistant attorney general,  as a lobbyist, as legal counsel to a Governor,  as secretary of state and chief elections offi cer, and as comptroller.  As comptroller, the State's tax collector, he  breathed  life  into  an  archaic bureaucracy,  making  it  the model  of modern  efficiency  other State agencies and other States emulat ed.  Bob Bullock is a tough task-master. He de mands the utmost of friends and employees.  He's creative and  innovative and expects no  April 14, 1988  less of others than the best they can produce.  He  is  loved and  feared, but mostly admired  and respected.  A recent profile  in Texas Business maga zine, which I share with my colleagues, paints  an excellent portrait of Bob Bullock, the man  and the public servant. Bob Bullock clearly is  a unique individual and a credit to the State of  Texas.  [FROM THE TEXAS BUSINESS MAGAZINE, APRIL  1988]  Calling the Shots  <By Michele Kay)  Bob Bullock sits back  in a comfortable  chair in his office, stretches his legs, and  turns on his special brand of down-to-earth  Texas charm. ""There's an attitude problem  in Texas,""  says  the state comptroller of  public accounts. ""People are skeptical that  we've turned the corner when, in fact, we  are pulling out of the recession. The trouble  is  that when I was warning Texans  that  things were getting worse, they'd accuse me  of playing politics. Now  that  I'm telling  them the economy is finally improving, they  don't believe me.""  Bullock  shrugs  and  smiles.  Texas  is  headed for brighter days, and so is he. He  feels he's long overdue. After  struggling  first  through personal problems, followed  by state budgetary crises and tough political  decisions, things are going his way.  For a start, Bullock has at least shed his  role as the perennial bearer of bad news.  The economy is on the mend, he says, and  good tidings are in the offing. When Bullock  goes bef01 e the Legislature next year with  his biennial revenue forecast, chances are  his numbers will be cheered. He's confident  the picture he paints in 1989 will not inspire  the same budget impasse Texas witnessed in  1987.  At the same time, Bullock is getting satis faction from the new attention being paid  to the state's system of taxation. In recent  sessions, he went blue in the face trying to  convince  the Legislature  that Texas was  badly in need of tax reform. His plea for  long  fell on deaf ears, but  finally  crisis  proved him right. Last year the Legislature  appointed a landmark tax equity committee,  inviting Bullock to participate as an ex-offi cio member. He's refrained from saying, ""I  told you so"" or ""It's about time."" Bullock  also has refused to predict the committee's  eventual recommendations. Whether or not  he agrees with  the final outcome of  the  committee's work is not the issue; the very  fact that the state's tax system is being de bated is a victory for Bullock. ""What we  have  right now  isn't a patchwork.  It's a  quilt,"" he complains.  Bullock now faces a new challenge. After  13 years as state comptroller, he's making a  run for the job of lieutenant governor. Al though elections are more than two years  away, Bullock is already campaigning with  the same  intensity he brings  to bear on  every task. ""I haven't found any opposition  to my candidacy,"" he says firmly.  Equally important, he seems to have dis carded much of the personal baggage that  once upon a time impeded his professional  progress.  Back in the 1960's and 70's, Bullock's life  was marked by a series of chaotic and cata strophic events, allegedly triggered largely  by alcoholism. But Bullock says he hasn't  had a drink since 1981, a claim supported by  the fact that he hasn't made a public spec tacle of himself since then. Gone are the  ",1988
255,,100,0.272,1007,5,Mr. LUJAN.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I want  to  bring to the attention of my colleagues a very  important technological advance that was re cently made by engineers and scientists at  Sandia National Laboratory,  the Department  of Energy national  laboratory  located  in my  hometown of Albuquerque, NM.  For years computer scientists  in  industry  and academia have believed  that no matter  how many processors were tied together in a  computer,  the problem-solving speed of  the  computer could only be increased by a factor  of between 50 and 100. This speedup limita tion  was  called  Amdahl's  law.  However,  Sandia National Laboratory personnel recently  demonstrated that this practical barrier to in creasing the speed of computers doesn't exist  when  they were able  to  link together 1,024  computer processors  to  reduce  the  time  re quired to solve complex problems by over a  factor of 1,000.  In parallel processing, the computer first di vides a problem into smaller pieces that may  be solved by different sections of the comput er. Various steps of the solution can then be  performed at the same time rather than wait ing for completion of a previous step.  The most capable off-the-shelf supercom puter available today is the Cray X-MP I 416,  which has four processors operating in paral lel-in comparison  to Sandia's 1,024 parallel  processors. The Sandia discovery opens the  door  to  the development of new, massively  parallel computers  that will solve problems  that no  computer  in  existence  today  can  tackle. For example,  it will be possible  to  solve problems in nonlinear wave simulation,  circuit analysis, structural mechanics, and fluid  dynamics which arise in  technology areas as  diverse as nuclear  reactor safety, explosive  technology,  electronics  circuit  design  and  packaging, nuclear waste storage containers,  and vertical axis wind  turbines  for electricity  generation. This breakthrough will permit the  optimization of designs in ways previously be lieved not to be possible.  I would especially like to congratulate and  call attention  to  the Sandia staff who made  this  important  breakthrough. Bob Brenner,  John Gustafson, Gary Montry,  and David  Womble were  the primary members of San dia's team  that did  this work. Recognition  is  also due  to Gil Weigand, Pat Eicker, Ed  Barsis, and Venky Narayanamurti. Members of  this  team have already  received  two major  computing awards: The Gordon Bell Award  and  the Karp Challenge Award. Their work  has been  reported  in  the New York Times,  Newsweek, Time, and my colleague from New  Mexico, Senator DOMENIC!, has already enEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tered  into  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the  March 14 front page story from the Washing ton Post.  In  recognizing  Sandia's  achievements,  I  also want to emphasize the importance of the  ties  that Sandia has  to American  industry.  I  believe that these ties are largely responsible  for the success that Sandia continually exhib its as our Nation's leading national engineer ing laboratory. Many are unaware that Sandia  National Laboratory has been operated by  AT&T-now AT&T Technologies,  lnc.-since  1949 when President Truman had the wisdom  to ask AT&T to undertake this vital manage ment task for the Atomic Energy Commission,  the predecessor of  today's Department of  Energy. Few Americans are aware that AT&T  has performed this public service without fee  or profit for nearly 40 years. AT&T has vast  experience in organizing and managing  inno vative electronics  technology  from  research  through development and into production, and  it brought these management skills to the op eration of Sandia.  In  these critical  times when we are con cerned about  the competitiveness of our in dustries, I invite my colleagues to visit Sandia  National Laboratory to learn of their many re search accomplishments and how these ad vances have been converted  into products  that are manufactured by private  industry.  I  believe that it is critical that our national lab oratories be managed by institutions such as  AT&T  that understand and work effectively  with both universities and private industry. It is  becoming clear that innovation done in an iso lated  research environment can experience  long delays before  it is converted  into prod ucts that can  improve our competitiveness.  I  congratulate Sandia and AT&T for these ad vances in computer technology and urge them  and others  to quickly  turn  these discoveries  into commercial products.  HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN  AMERICA  HON. DOUG WALGREN  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 13, 1988  ",1988
256,,100,-0.247,1007,5,Mr. WALGREN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my  Pennsylvania  colleague, Congressman  TOM  RIDGE,  in  introducing a very  timely piece of  legislation designed to protect American com panies,  American  workers,  and  American  cities from  the havoc threatened by a unique  brand of hostile takeover.  The bill we are introducing today addresses  the unique and highly questionable nature of a  hostile takeover attempt recently  initiated by  Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., a subsidiary of  the American Express Co., in concert with two  British entities, Beazer PLC, a construction  materials company, and National Westminster  Bank.  Shearson's target is Koppers Co.,  Inc., an  industrial  company  headquartered  in  Pitts burgh, which employs 1,300 people  in  the  Pittsburgh area. Koppers employs a total of  12,300 people across 40 States.  In early March, after  it had unsuccessfully  solicited Koppers to become a client, Shear6983  son announced  that  it was a partner  in a  $1.27 billion hostile tender offer for Koppers.  The Shearson bid marks the first time that a  major investment banking  firm has  taken an  equity partnership  in a hostile  takeover at tempt.  Shearson  initiated  these events almost 1  year ago by proposing  the  takeover  to  its  client, Beazer PLC, and agreed  to provide a  bridge loan of nearly one-half billion dollars to  finance  it. At  the same  time, Shearson pro posed to invest its own funds in financing for  the shell  company  that would attempt  the  takeover.  If this deal succeeds, Shearson will  own almost 50 percent of Koppers.  Also implicated in this transaction is Nation al Westminster Bank, PLC, one of the largest  commercial banks in England and the parent  company of several FDIC-insured banks in the  United States. NatWest has committed  itself  to providing up  to $300 million  to Beazer to  assist in financing the tender offer.  Shearson's conduct raises disturbing ques tions concerning the proper role of an invest ment banker  in  takeover bids. Whether any  securities firm should be permitted to provide  merger advice while simultaneously making an  equity investment in a takeover contest, illus trates a serious potential conflict of interest.  Equally  disturbing  is  the  fact  that  both  Shearson and NatWest own major FDIC-in sured  banks.  Shearson/ American  Express,  own the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Co.,  the Nation's 20th largest bank with over $15  billion in assets. They have escaped the regu latory safeguards of the Bank Holding Compa ny Act, which would normally not permit their  investment banking activities, by virtue of a  grandfather clause.  In the recent debate over the repeal or par tial repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act that cur rently separates banking and commerce ac tivities, both House and Senate banking com mittees agreed  that equity underwriting by  commercial banks at the present time is too  risky.  I do not believe that Congress intended to  permit one of  the  largest  securities  firms,  owning the Nation's 20th largest FDIC-insured  bank, to become engaged in the risky use of  their own capital to finance hostile takeovers  through equity acquisitions.  The legislation we are introducing today at tempts to address this problem. It would pro hibit a financial services company, like Shear son Lehman, that owns an FDIC-insured bank  from  taking more than a 5 percent equity in terest in a company that is not involved in fi nancial services.  The bill would also prevent  foreign bank  holding companies, like National Westminster,  which owns one or more U.S.  federally-in sured banks,  from engaging  in activities not  permissible for U.S. bank holding companies.  Namely,  no  foreign bank holding company  that owns U.S. banks could use their financial  resources to acquire interest in a non-banking  company in the United States. This prohibition  would be effective as of March 30, 1988. Any  foreign bank holding company  that had al ready acquired such an interest prior to March  30, 1988, would be required under the bill to  divest these shares within 60 days of date of  enactment of this bill.

257,,100,-0.32,1033,5,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, today is Yorn Ha shoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. This  day is designated each year by Congress and  the State of Israel to commemorate the brutal  deaths of more than 6 million Jews who per ished under the cruelties of the Nazi regime.  The systematic program of genocide must  continue to be remembered and studied if we  as a free democratic nation are to prevent its  recurrence.  It  is our obligation  to  remember  the horrors of the Crystal Night,  the Warsaw  Ghetto,  the gas chambers at Auschwitz,  the  children of Terenstadt, the mass shootings at  Sabi Yar, and other massacres suffered by  the Jewish people during  the  1930's and  1940's.  While there were heroes, such as the Gies  family that housed Anne Frank, and the Swed ish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg,  too many of  us simply turned and  looked  the other way.  This day serves as a permanent reminder of  what happened during  the Holocaust and  what we must pass on  to our children  to  ensure  they remember the horrible atrocities  that took place-to remember the past so we  do not repeat it.  Because so many of our children were born  after the Holocaust,  they need  to be made  aware of  the Nazi  ""solution""  that  left post World War II Europe without its Jewish people  and culture. On  this day,  the most important  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  element that we can pass on to our young is  not only  the memory of  the Holocaust's evil  but the memory of the 6 million Jews who per ished. We must  remember  these events  in  order not to repeat them. Holocaust Remem brance Day gives us just the opportunity to do  so.  KILDEE HONORS MRS. ROBERTA  V.  COURTS,  DR.  THOMAS  COURTS, MRS.

258,,100,-0.385,1033,5,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  bring  to  the attention of my colleagues and  the Nation an appreciation dinner that will be  held Saturday, April 23,  in Flint Ml, honoring  Mrs. Roberta V. Courts, Dr. Thomas Courts,  Mrs. Clara Smith,  and Mr. Wilburn Banks.  These  individuals are being honored by  the  Stewart School Community Advisory Council  for their unwavering dedication to S.S. Stewart  Community School.  Mrs. Roberta V. Courts has  taught  in  the  Flint community school system  for 28 years.  Her dedication and creativety has had a last ing  impact on  the quality of education in our  community and in the lives of hundreds of stu dents. Mrs. Courts, who  is retired  from Coo lidge Elemenatry School, has played a vital  role  in  shaping  educational  programs  that  meet  the  real needs of our children  in  the  most  impressionable  stage  of  their  young  lives. As a former kindergarten teacher at S.S.  Stewart Community School, she has set an  extraordinary example for the future leaders of  our country.  Dr. Thomas Courts has played an essential  role in the progress of S.S. Stewart Communi ty School. As  the  founder and pastor of the  Vermont Christian Church, which  is  located  around the corner from S.S. Stewart Commu nity School, Dr. Courts has unselfishly given of  his  time  to provide our schoolchildren with  spiritual  inspiration and good judgment quali ties. He has continually assisted in  the plan ning and organizing of many school activities.  Dr. Courts has  distinguished himself as a  highly successful pastor and as a community  leader.  As the first woman principal of S.S. Stewart  Community School, Mrs. Clara Smith  has  proven herself a most distinguished leader in  education as well as an asset to the Seventh  Congressional District. Her selfless dedication  to improving the lives of thousands of children  and adults who passed  through her office  door is extraordinary. Since retiring from S.S.  Stewart Community School, Mrs. Smith has  spent many hours continuing her public serv ice by volunteering at agencies and  institu tions  in our community. Mrs. Smith has suc ceeded  in making Genesee County a better  place in which to live.  Mr. Wilburn Banks has spent a lifetime de voting himself  to maintaining  the beauty of  S.S. Stewart School. He began his career at  7009  S.S. Stewart Community School in 1955 as a  custodian. Mr. Banks, however, has reached  far beyond his custodial duties. He brought joy  into many children's  lives by playing Santa  Claus at Christmas time and gently counseling  children when  they were mischievous. Since  his  retirement, Mr. Banks has been  sorely  missed by not just the children but by the fac ulty as well.  Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Roberta V. Courts, Dr.  Thomas W. Courts, Mrs. Clara Smith, and Mr.  Wilburn Banks have distinguished themselves  as  fine examples of  the highest degree of  good citizenship. They have touched the lives  of many individuals, and they inspire those of  us who know them to ask more of ourselves. I  am congratulating them on their accomplished  careers.  A TRIBUTE TO COACH PAULIE  MILLER  HON. ROMANO L. MAZZOLI  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 14, 1988  ",1988
259,,100,-0.186,1033,5,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to Coach Paulie Miller, who recent ly retired after 18 years of service as Jeffer son County Circuit Court Clerk. Paulie, who  was elected for three terms,  is a past presi dent of the Kentucky Circuit Court Clerk's As sociation.  Many  Louisvilleians,  however,  respect  Paulie mostly  for his enormously successful  career as a  football coach at Flaget High  School and at the University of Louisville.  At Flaget, Paulie coached six future college  All-Americans  including ""Golden Boy,"" Notre  Dame's Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hor nung, and Kentucky All-American, Miami Hurri cane Coach and current University of Louis ville head  football coach, Howard Schnellen berger. Among his many honors during his 18  years at Flaget, Paulie won  four State  titles  and became  the only coach  in Kentucky  to  win Coach of the Year three times.  Upon his retirement from coaching in 1970,  Paulie's immense popularity made him a suc cessful public figure throughout the Common wealth.  Paulie,  a  strong  supporter of  the  Democratic Party in Kentucky, was extremely  influential  in shaping  the political careers of  former Kentucky Governors  Jullian Carroll,  Martha Layne Collins, and U.S. Senator Wen dell Ford as well as my own career.  But it was upon the little people with whom  Paulie had his greatest  impact. As a coach,  Paulie reveled  in  taking young people under  his wing and instilling in them the same work  ethic and burning desire for success which he  has displayed throughout his entire life. As cir cuit clerk, Paulie continued this philosophy by  paying extra attention  to  those citizens who  were less fortunate than himself.  Paulie's  legacy  in  the Commonwealth of  Kentucky will  continue  for many  years  to  come.  In addition to the many people I've al ready mentioned, Paulie's fine son Tony, was  recently elected as his replacement as Jeffer son County Circuit Court Clerk.  So, Mr. Speaker,  I join all  the citizens of  Louisville, Jefferson County, and  throughout  ",1988

262,Senate,100,0.068,1059,5,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  think it might be worth saying a word  or two about the provisions in the bill.  I believe there is merit to the provi sion which is currently in the bill and,  at the same time, I acknowledge the  merit in the arguments made by the  distinguished  Senator  from  New  Hampshire, but I do think there ought  to be a word of explanation as to why  the bill is crafted in its current form  to excerpt attorneys at law in a litiga tion context. This provision is included  because where you have a position of  prestige which might yield undue in fluence in governmental circles after a  person leaves government, that situa tion is not likely to occur in a context  of litigation where there is an adver sary proceeding.  If you have a  lawsuit, customarily,  many  times  it  is settled  in advance.  Most controversies are settled before  litigation ensues.  So if you take it to a point where a  complaint is filed, an answer is filed,  and you go to court, it is in an adver sarial  relationship and  there  is not  likely to be inappropriate influence on  the governmental official.  If you have a former ranking govern mental official or a former Senator or  former Member of the House of Rep resentatives and they have not been  able to work it out, then certainly any  suggestion of influence has been ne gated when it comes to a point where  there is litigation.  Similarly,  if  there  is  a  potential  criminal prosecution,  the practice  is  frequently  followed where a counsel  for a prospective defendant, perhaps  during a grand  jury proceeding, will  negotiate with governmental officials  to see if a defense can be offered in ad vance. It may be that in such a situa tion,  a  former  Senator,  a  former  ",1988

I  think we can avoid  that,  and I have introduced legislation that  would place a damper on  the  fires  burning in the gulf. By creating a U.N.  naval task force to patrol the area, we  could reduce the Iranian incentive to  carry  out  attacks  against  foreign  navies currently in the gulf, and the  foreign navy I worry most about is our  own.

This new facility, the William C. Hopkins Stu dent Services Building, was dedicated to the  memory of my long-time friend and adviser Bill Hopkins-who devoted much of his life to  the  founding and  improvement of State Fair  College.  Bill Hopkins was one of the most outstand ing individuals I have ever known, and estab lishing a building in his name is a more than  fitting  tribute  to a man who served  for 20  years  as  chairman  of  the  board  for  the  school's trustees. Further, Bill's horizons ex tended well beyond the college campus to a  concern for the community as a whole. As a  member of several  local civic organizations,  he was recognized by all who knew him as a  man who  selflessly devoted  his  time and  energy to making the world a better place. Bill  was  also  a  successful  businessman  and  served for 12 years as a special agent for the  FBI.  Although Bill Hopkins passed away in 1986,  his dedication and generosity obviously have  April 18, 1988  left their mark on his Missouri community. The  student services building  that was dedicated  in his name at State Fair Community College  will serve as a reminder to current and future  students of Bill Hopkins' legacy of service to  the Sedalia area.

We sometimes wonder whether or  not in the midst of our labors and our  watchings, You are still with us in this  project of building this Nation. And  we ask  the question: Lord,  is  there  something we  are  doing  that we  should not be doing? Or is there some thing that we are not being that we  should be? And we tremble at the pos sibility  that You would  take Your  Holy Spirit from us.  And  so,  very,  very  humbly  this  morning we come to You and ask that  You would  be  the  invisible  divine  builder  in our midst. We pray  that  You would assist us in all of our labors  and in all of our work and not only for  the household of  this Nation do we  pray, but also for our own homes and  families.  We pray for those children of ours,  and grandchildren, and wives and re lated  family  and members  of  our  neighborhoods. We pray  there,  too,  that You would be in our midst and  assist us.  We do not presume upon Your pres ence, Lord. We love You and we need  You and we come to You as one who,  for the sake of only a few righteous  men, would save an entire city which  was woefully evil.

266,House,100,-0.321,1332,5,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of H.R.  2641,  the National Trails  System Act amendments and urge my col leagues  to suspend  the  rules and pass  this  legislation.  Since  enactment  of  the National  Trails  System Act,  the Federal Government has  been encouraging  the conversion of aban doned  railroad  tracks  into  trails  for hiking,  biking, jogging, and horseback riding. My own  State of Oklahoma has  taken advantage of  these programs  to develop  trails. The River  Parks Trail in Tulsa is an excellent example of  a  rails-to-trails conversion. The Tulsa River  parks system has become an  important part  of that city's recreation and tourism industry.  The Oklahoma State Department of Tour ism is working now to get access to an aban doned line for the creation of a trail between  the cities of Henryetta and Durant. The Tulsa  River  Parks Authority  also  is working  to  expand  the  trail system by converting addi tional nearby track  into trails. Oklahoma has  nearly 2,000 miles of abandoned railroad track  which could be converted  into a system of  trails.  Under existing law, taking advantage of the  rails-to-trails program  is not easy. State and  local governments face a mess of bureaucrat ic redtape at the  Interstate Commerce Com mission  to  get  access  to  the  abandoned  tracks. H.R. 2641 streamlines the process and  should lead to increased conversion of aban doned railroad tracks into recreational trails.  Oklahoma outdoor recreational activities al ready attract thousands of visitors each year.  Tourism is the State's third largest industry. A  statewide system of trails could complement  the existing outdoor resources and enhance  Oklahoma's tourism potential. H.R. 2641 will  make  it easier  for State and  local govern ments  to convert abandoned  railroad  tracks  into trails, increasing the State's attractiveness  as a vacation spot for out of State visitors and  expanding the recreational and fitness oppor tunities for residents within the State.  I am pleased to support this legislation and  I urge the House to vote ""yes"" on H.R. 2641.  ",1988

Mr. Speaker, while being prepared  and strong in the preservation of our  own rights, we must never fail to ex plore  thoroughly with  the other su perpower  those  avenues which  can  lead to a  reduction  in  tensions. The  challenge is to make the world a safe  place within the national security in terests of both countries. That is vital.  One thing is for sure: There is over whelming  bipartisan  support  for  House Resolution 422,  legislation  in  support of the INF Treaty, in the Con gress and among the American people.  Support for this resolution, is support  for  something other  than an unre stricted, unregulated arms race. There  must  be  something better  for  the  future of mankind and it falls on the  leadership of both countries  to  take  the steps necessary to see if we cannot  arrive at that point.  Mr. Speaker,  credit  should go  to  President Reagan and this administra tion for negotiating the INF Treaty  and for continuing discussions on all  other matters of equal  importance strategic  arms  reductions,  chemical  warfare, nuclear testing, and ultimate ly and hopefully conventional arms re ductions.  As has been made clear by the lead ership in the executive branch and in  the Congress and restated by the gen tleman  from Michigan  [Mr. BROOM FIELD] and myself when we met with  General  Secretary  Gorbachev  in  Moscow, agreements in these areas are  welcome. Even though it might be dif ficult to conclude such agreements, it  is essential that we do so, and it is es sential that we get the approval of the  American people and the Congress of  the United States to do so.  Such action would lead to a  reduc tion  in  tensions between  the super powers and depends not only on these  agreements but on a whole host of  other issues which are interrelated but  do not necessarily have to be formally  linked but are linked as a matter of  fact. I shall only mention two. One is  regional disputes. There is no way that  any permanent reduction in tension or  way of life can be agreed to between  the superpowers  if  the Soviets have  the  idea that they can extend their  system with impunity whether by mili tary means  directly  or  indirectly,  whether  economically or politically,  directly or indirectly, anywhere in the  world. The Soviets cannot expect to do  this without meeting  a  challenge.  Right now that challenge is being pre sented  to  the Soviet Union by  the  United States and the West and other  peoples in the world.  Mr. Speaker, the saddle is on us be cause we are a superpower with the ca pability to fundamentally make that  challenge and we have done it and we  will continue to do it. There is no hope  for the future of mankind unless the  reduction in tensions between the su perpowers makes it possible for us to  live  together, and one of the things  that has to be considered in this strug gle is the fact that the Soviet Union  cannot go with impunity everywhere  in  the world and  try  to  impose  its  system without facing a challenge.  D 1330  Mr. Speaker, I think that the Ameri can people have made it abundantly  clear-not only  in the Persian Gulf,  but everywhere-that people have the  right to make their own decisions.  The other point, Mr. Speaker, is on  the question of human  rights. We  have made  it abundantly clear,  that  while it may be Soviet domestic policy,  the fact is that under generally accept ed principles of humanity and interna tionally-recognized  human  rights  standards. Soviet mistreatment of its  own people-whether they are Soviet  Jews, or Pentecostals, or  those who  simply want  to  express an  adverse  opinion, or commemorate the millen nium of Christianity in Kiev-will be  considered  by  reasonable  people  in  other parts of the world to be brutaliz ing of their own people and that will  be an obstacle to the reduction of ten sions between superpowers.  We have seen an amelioration on the  part of  the Soviet Union under the  leadership of Gorbachev. We should  welcome this. We may have reserva tions, we may be concerned, but on all  of these issues there has been some  change.  We in the United States, the West  and in the free world need to continue  to  be  strong  enough  and willing  enough to take up that challenge to do  everything we can in order to make  the world not only a safer place  in  which  to  live, but a more pleasant  place in which to live.  So, Mr. Speaker, ratification of the  INF Treaty, which House Resolution  422 supports is a historical step, not  only in the history of this country, but  ",1988
269,House,100,0.382,1371,5,Mr. BLILEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong opposition to the rule before us  today.  I oppose  this rule because  it  represents  just one more attempt to  sidestep  the  issue  of  dial-a-porn  through clever procedural gimmicks.  It's precisely this type of gimmickry  that has put us in the situation we're  in today.  Five years ago, I began the crusade  against dial-a-porn when I sought to  have this type of service banned from  our  Nation's  telephone  system  through an amendment  to  the FCC  authorization bill. Unfortunately, the  amendment was altered in a manner  that, for the first time, legalized com mercial obscenity over the phone lines.  A vote for this rule is-in essence-a  vote to maintain the only place in the  entire United States Code where com mercial obscenity is given legal protec tion.  That is precisely the thrust of the  language that is included in the con ference report-language that was in cluded in the conference report with out the conferees on that issue ever  having met in open public session as  required by rule 28 clause 6.  Let's look for a moment at the pro posed conference language. Will it be  effective? No; the FCC, as the expert  agency in the field of telecommunica tions, has provided us with an analysis  of the conference language, They say  it won't work. What effect will it have  on live, obscene sex services that are  billed through personal credit cards?  Absolutely none. What effect will  it  have on dial-a-porn services where the  phone company provides billing infor mation to the dial-a-porn vendors, but  doesn't do the billing itself? Absolute ly none. What about rural areas where  digital  switching  technology  is  not  available and phone companies do not  have  the  ability  to block customer  phones? No effect. What about pay  phones? No effect. What new burdens  or  obligations  does  the  conference  report language place on: dial-a-porn  vendors? None. It doesn't impose one  ",1988

271,House,100,-0.4,1501,5,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support  of the School Improvement Act of 1988. I am  especially pleased that drug abuse education  has been extended in this legislation.  Our children are our future and they are en dangered by drugs and  the criminal activity  that surrounds  it. Although  the national  inci dence of drug abuse is decreasing, its use by  children  is  increasing dramatically. Drug use,  in part, accounts for the marked  increase  in  violent activity by children in recent years. Acto Mr. Payne of New York's Family  cording  Court:  We've had almost a 50-percent incease in  drug crime. Crack is the main reason. We  are seeing kids as young as 10 or 11. They  can make $800 a week. They only stay in  school because that's where their constitu ency is.  Children are used as lookouts and couriers  for gangs running drugs. Police in Washington,  DC, have discovered  that child couriers are  used  to escort drugs on planes  from New  York City to Washington, DC.  Children  in  the  inner city are  in greater  danger of being drawn into increasingly violent  gangs, gangs  that are better equipped with  the weapons that their drug money affords.  According to an investigator in the Manhat tan homicide unit,  the new gangs seem  to  have ""less respect for human life"" than previ ous and older drug dealers.  They kill to intimidate.  They shoot their victims in public, crowded  places, often in broad daylight: walking up to  them and  shooting  them  several  times at  point-blank range.  A New York Times article tells of two sus pected gang members who were shot and  wounded as  they alighted  from a Mercedes  limousine. An 18-year-old woman  in  the car  was shot and paralyzed; her 6-month-old fetus  was killed.  By supporting measures against drugs, we  in Congress reaffirm our commitment to eradi cating  substance  abuse  in  our  Nation's  schools, college campuses, and communities.  The School  Improvement Act will provide for  drug abuse education, counseling,  family and  school based prevention programs, treatment,  referral and  training.  I urge passage of  the  conference report.  ",1988
272,House,100,0.478,1501,5,Mr. DREIER.," of California. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in support of the conference report to ac company H.R. 5,  the comprehensive 5-year  reauthorization of most Federal elementary,  secondary, and adult education programs.  H.R.  5  increases  Federal  authorization  levels  for education programs by about $1.5  billion a year. Among  the programs reauthor ized by H.R. 5 are chapter 1, supplementary  services for educationally disadvantaged chil dren; chapter 2, a flexible block grant program  for State and local educational agencies; math  and science programs; magnet schools;  the  Drug-free Schools and Communities Act;  the  Indian Education Act; and  Impact Aid. H.R. 5  provides additional funding for alternative bilin gual education programs such as ""English as  a second language"" and ""immersion"" and es tablishes a number of new programs,  includ ing Even Start,  to provide educational and  social  services  to very young  children and  their parents; ""Star Schools,"" to support edu cation by satellite technology; and a dropout prevention program for secondary school stu dents.  I am especially pleased that we will have an  opportunity  to vote on a provision  to bring  dial-a-porn  telephone services  to an end.  I  have  received hundreds of  letters  from my  constituents who share my outrage over these  obscene telephone services and want to see  the Federal Government intervene.  In 1983, Congress passed an amendment,  with my support, to the Federal Communications Commission reauthorization bill to outlaw  sexually explicit telephone communications to  minors. The FCC has attempted to satisfy the  requirements of  this amendment  twice,  yet  neither attempt has survived court challenges.  A third attempt was proposed last July, but no  final rules have yet to be issued. The problem  with the 1983 amendment is finding a way to  differentiate between the minor and adult call ers.  Rather than continue the search for a way  to satisfy  the  1983 amendment,  the Bliley  amendment prohibits dial-a-porn services alto gether,  for both minor and adult callers. As  originally brought before the House, H.R. 5 did  not  include  the Bliley  language,  so  I am  pleased that we will now have an opportunity  to vote on the Bliley language and I am hope ful that it will pass.  Again, Mr. Speaker,  I support  the confer ence report accompanying H.R. 5 because it  recognizes the importance of education of our  Nation's children  and  I support  the Bliley  amendment which prohibits obscene dial-a porn telephone services.  ",1988
273,House,100,-0.321,1501,5,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  strong support of the conference agreement  on  the school  improvement amendments. As  a member of  the conference committee,  I  commend  the chairman and my conference  colleagues for their bipartisan efforts. I believe  we have a strong and effective omnibus edu cation package dedicated  to excellence  in  education.  These amendments reauthorize 14 Federal  elementary and secondary programs, extend ing  them  through 1993  to avoid a  ""patch  work"" approach  to our most vital asset:  the  education of our children.  In the future, these  programs will be considered comprehensively  so as  to better coordinate education policy  and resources.  The core of  this  legislation  is chapter 1 ,  compensatory  education  for  disadvantaged  children. Education enhances one's daily life  but more  importantly,  education  can  help  break the cycle of poverty. Chapter 1 is com mitted to just that:  improving the educational  achievements of disadvantaged children to in crease  their opportunities as well as enrich  their lives.  The changes adopted in this bill greatly im prove chapter 1 . First, chapter 1 is expanded  into  preschools  and  secondary  schools.  Second,  funds will be  targeted  for dropout  prevention, a critical problem for minority and  disadvantaged  students.  The  amendments  also target funds to those with greatest need.  As  the representative of a rural State,  I was  pleased agreement was reached on a concen tration grant  formula which shifts a greater  portion of funds to poor, rural areas.  The school improvement amendments also  reauthorize  the Bilingual Education Act. My  district is over 40-percent Hispanic. Thus, the  Spanish  language  is an  integral part of our  culture and heritage. More importantly, Span ish  is often the first language of many of our  children. As a result, I want to emphasize the  importance of developmental programs in the  Bilingual  Education Act. Developmental  or  dual language programs are an effective way  to bridge  the gap  in acquiring English  Ian",1988

290,,100,0.416,1540,5,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, even pithy col umnist George Will has outdone himself with a  superlative piece on the importance of the Na tion's infrastructure, appearing in  the April 25  issue of Newsweek.  [From Newsweek, Apr. 25, 1988]  LISTEN TO THE BRIDGES  <By George F. Will)  New York, New York,  it's a wonderful  town [song-writers are not under oath], the  Bronx is up and the Battery's down. And so,  almost, is the Williamsburg Bridge. That 85year-old suspension span across  the East  River connects Manhattan with America,  which may not be in the national interest,  but nearly a quarter of a million people use  in daily. Used it. Since last Tuesday only pe destrians and bicyclists do. It is not quite  collapsing-yet-but it is unsafe for vehicu lar traffic, and that is a considerable defect  in a bridge.  The discovery  last week of  its corroded  condition was serendipitous. The discovery  occurred while  the three surviving Demo cratic presidential candidates were careering  around the Empire State promising to make  America into a paradise and, in their spare  time, pacify  the Middle East. The mere  crumbling of a bridge  is  too mundane a  matter to arrest the attention of candidates  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  who are bent on the betterment of all man kind. However,  the sounds made by  that  tired  old  bridge <it was  screeching  and  squealing ominously) should be listened to.  It tells us more about our future than the  candidates do. The nation has a huge bill  coming due for the neglect of its infrastruc ture, meaning bridges, roads, airports, wa terways, water and sewer systems-all the  things that make everything else possible.  This neglect, which reflects a weak ethic  of common provision, may be consequence  of our  individualism.  Individually, Ameri cans are exercising more and eating more  sensibly  to maintain  their personal  infra structures while the nation's physical plant  deteriorates. In the years dead ahead that  physical plant is going to force itself upon  our attention. It will be something to think  about while we creep along in increasingly  congested  traffic, or wait for our delayed  flights to take off at overburdened airports.  The National Journal reports that one out  of  four  bridges  is  considered dangerous.  More than 4,100 are closed. Every two days  a bridge collapses. Sixty-five percent of the  Interstate Highway System is in need of re habilitation. The average age of  the 1984  principal  locks  on  the  inland waterway  system is 40 years. The Army Corps of Engi neers says 3,000 dams in populated areas are  hazardous. Air traffic has doubled in the 14  years since the last new commercial airport  <Dallas-Ft. Worth)  opened.  Los Angeles  needs to spend $111 million more every year  just repairing streets or 60 percent of them  will be unusable by the end of the century.  The Environmental Protection Agency says  $108 billion will be needed between now and  then just for construction of new sewage  treatment plants.  OK, some of these numbers may involve  overreaching and attention seizing and an  appetite  for pork. Still,  there are many  needs and not enough money. The cost of  public-works investment is substantial, but  so is the cost of underinvestment. Millions  of worker-years are lost as congestion and  detours sap economic efficiency. The cost of  Los Angeles County congestion is estimated  to be nearly half a million hours a day and  half a billion dollars' worth of working time  <and 72 million gallons of gas) a year. Unfor tunately, blocking the road to a solution is a  mountain-Mount Deficit.  The deficit is the numerical expression of  a cultural tendency, the national tendency  to  live  for  the moment and beyond our  means, consuming more  than we produce  and investing too little, heedless about the  future. A government devoting 14 percent of  its budget to pay interest on its debts-to  rent money-has not enough money for the  physical prerequisites of efficient and com modious  living. Four federal  trust funds highway, transit, aviation and waterways had a combined cash balance of about $24  billion at the end of 1987, all of it from user  fees that can be spent only on infrastruc ture. But our leaders, ever  imaginative at  cooking the books to make the deficit seem  smaller than it is, are hoarding the money.  This is done so that deficit estimates will be  smaller and the Gramm-Rudman knife will  be easier to avoid.  INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS  An earlier, more robust America had more  energetic  leaders  regarding  ""internal  im provements."" On March 9, 1832, a candidate  for the Illinois General Assembly distribut ed an open  letter  to  the people of his  county. The first plank in his platform was:  ""Time and experience have verified        the  public  utility  of  internal  improveApril 19, 1988  ments,""  such  as  roads  and  navigable  streams. Lincoln lost, but he soon won and  authored a flurry of bills such as those per taining to ""a state road from the Wabash to  the yellow banks of the Mississippi River""  and ""a canal upon the valley of the Sanga mon River.""  In 1808  Jefferson's Treasury  secretary,  Albert Gallatin,  issued  his  ""Report  on  Roads and Canals,"" a proposed network of  projects, most of which were built over 60  years. It is unfortunate they were not built  sooner. In 1816 John C. Galhoun, who even tually would sow seeds of secession, intro duced a bill for  internal improvements at  federal expense. He warned that New York  and other Northern states had public and  private  financial  resources  sufficient  for  such improvements, but that the South did  not. Without federal help the South would  be consigned to inferiority, and ""disunion""  might result. President Madison,  taking a  crabbed view of federal power, vetoed the  bill  as  unconstitutional. Denied  federal  help,  the South's dependence on slavery  grew, as did its sense of separateness.  Disunion is not a danger today. Decay is.  That is a pity because public works are the  sort of things government is good at. The  Tennessee Valley Authority and the Inter state Highway System were not just good in  themselves, they were good for the morale  of government, which  periodically needs  some inspiriting successes. Alas, in election  years we have this sort of dispiriting experi ence:  You are driving warily down a street cra tered with potholes deep enough to serve as  silos for the MX missile. Your car radio is  emitting the sounds of candidates promising  to provide ""meaningful jobs"" and ""a sense  of community""  in ""model cities""  in a dis armed world. And  you  are  thinking  (if  thinking is possible as you jolt along, your  radio chattering and radial tires disintegrat ing): Thanks a lot, but could we please start  our  trip  to utopia on a well-paved street  leading to a structurally sound bridge?

Dr.  Holder,  rightfully  called  the  ""father of  the  Tuna Club,"" had heard of a wonderful game  fish, then called ""leaping tuna,"" that surround ed Santa Catalina Island. He used his experi ence with  salmon  to work out  tackle  that  would be of sufficient strength  to cope with  the mighty fish.  It was his desire to give the  quarry a better than even chance of survival,  matching human skills against the instinct and  strength of  the  fish. On June 1, 1898, Dr.  Holder successfully landed a 183-pound tuna  with  rod and  reel,  the  first such catch on  record.  The charter members decided  ""the object  of this club is the protection of game fishes of  the State of California and to discourage hand  line  fishing as unsportsmanlike and against  the public interest.""  Little has changed in the goals of the Tuna  Club  in  the ensuing 90 years. Current Tuna  Club angling and tournament rules state ""the  underlying spirit of angling should be that it is  a sport in which the skill of the angler is pitted  against  instinct and strength of the  fish,""  to  that end,  it  is common  for Tuna Club mem bers to fish for and catch tuna and marlin with  line testing 12, 20, or 30 pounds. These fish  can weigh in exces of 250 pounds. In addition  to  fishing with  light tackle, Tuna Club mem bers  in  the  interest of conservation, consist ently catch and release more game fish annu ally than they take.  Salt water fishing today is recognized as a  multi-million dollar industry. Tackle and fishing  ",1988

298,,100,-0.355,244,11,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, June  1988 has been designated as ""National Recy cling Month."" This resolution is aimed toward  educating the American public about the  im portance of recycling, and I am pleased to be  a cosponsor of this legislation.  Recycling serves countless purposes. For  instance,  recycling  saves energy and  con serves our country's natural resources by re ducing the use of raw materials. For every 1 0  percent of used crushed glass added  to a  glass plant's  furnace, energy costs drop as  much as 5 percent. For every  ton of used  crushed glass  in  the manufacturing process,  up to 1 .2 tons of raw material are saved.  The benefits of paper and glass recycling  are evident, and we have unlimited potential  for  further much-needed conservation. Many  other products such as metal, plastic, and alu minum also can be  recycled. For example,  turning used aluminum cans  into new ones  takes 95 percent  less energy  than  refining  new metal from raw bauxite.  We should recognize and must encourage  the growth of public, political, and economic  support  for  recycling. More  importantly, we  must overcome  the obstacles which  remain,  such as lack of markets for recycled products,  high collection and separation costs,  resist ance to change, and the importance of con venience in waste disposal.  I urge my colleagues to reflect on the bene fits of recycling and encourage your constitu ents to use this excellent method of conserva tion.  It is our responsibility to encourage par ticipation  in educational endeavors  that pro mote waste separation methods, community based recycling programs, and expanded utili zation of recovered materials. All progress we  make in recycling today will help to slow down  the voracious consumption of our rapidly di minishing supply of energy and natural  re sources.  HOUSE  JOINT RESOLUTION 317,  SOWETO REMEMBRANCE DAY  RESOLUTION  HON. CHARLES A. HAYES  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  ",1988
299,,100,-0.656,244,11,Mr. HAYES of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, to para phrase an  article by Arlene Getz entitled,  ""Apartheid's Troubled Children,"" which ap peared  in  the December 1987 World Press  Review:  South African parents are agonizing over  the problems of raising their children in a  deeply  divided  and  increasingly  violent  racist society. During the past decade, chil dren have been catapulted into  the front  line of  the South African struggle. Black  children have been particularly hard hit by  the chronic violence  racking  their  town ships. Thousands have been detained withEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  out trial; others have been tear-gassed and  shot. According to the Rev. Frank Chikane,  general  secretary  of  the South  'African  Council of Churches, ""They find themselves  either confronting the system or running  away from tear-gas and bullets. For these  children, violence has become a  lifestyle,  leaving still undetermined emotional scars.""  For these children, many of whom are fortu nately too young to have been part of one of  the worst displays of state-sponsored  terror ism of modern times, today is not just another  day of existence under a racist state support ed  system of  repression. Today,  they are  marching with  their parents, if they are lucky  enough to still have them around,  in remem berance of their  fallen brothers and sisters.  On this day in 1976, more than 1,000 children  were brutally murdered by  the South African  police in the township of Soweto. What horri ble crime did  they commit in order to suffer  such devastation? They simply wanted to be  educated  in  their native  language  in  their  native  land-the  land where  their  families  have lived for generation upon generation.  Today marks  the 12th commemoration of  the Soweto massacre and it is in that regard  that I wish to make note of what took place in  that township 12 years ago, and what contin ues to take place even as I speak. On that oc casion, in addition to the more than 1,000 chil dren who were brutally murdered, an addition al  5,000 were wounded  by South African  police. These children were committing no  crime, at  least not by our standards. They  were simply protesting the fact that they were  not allowed to be educated in their native lan guage in their native land.  As we have watched  the South African  Government's response  to  its growing crisis,  we have also seen increased trageting of chil dren. American citizens have been appalled;  first, by the overwhelming violence, and more  recently,  by  the extension of  the  state of  emergency which has hidden most of the bru tality, but has still allowed us to view the num bers-30,000 more detainees since 1985, of  which over 8,000 of them have been children.  In an effort to show solidarity with the chil dren of South Africa and  to show solidarity  with courageous people of all races in South  Africa and throughout the world and are fight ing to end the evil of apartheid,  I introduced  House Joint Resolution 317, a resolution de claring June 16 as  ""Soweto Remembrance  Day."" This resolution, which is nonpartisan in  nature, call on American citizens to participate  in  local activities designed  to commemorate  the martyrs of Soweto and  to work  toward  ending support for the system of apartheid.  To date, 95 of our colleagues have added  their names as cosponsor of House Joint Res olution 317. Unfortunately, House rules dictate  that 218 Members cosponsor such resolutions  before they can be considered on the House  floor. While we are short on cosponsors, it in  no way detracts from the importance of com memorating the tragic event that took place in  Soweto.  I am pleased  to  report  that while House  Joint Resolution 317 will not be considered, at  this time, thousands of American citizens are  spending  this day  in  demonstration,  vigils,  educational events, and  lobbying. The  focus  of these activities is  twofold;  first, as  I have  mentioned, is to show solidarity with people of  June 16, 1988  all races  in South Africa and  throughout the  world who are fighting to end the evil of apart heid, and second, to garner support for Rep resentative RON DELLUMS bill, H.R. 1580, the  Anti-Apartheid Act Amendments.  The  apartheid  system and  its  continued  denial of basic human rights and freedoms to  the 26 million black majority population of  South Africa offends the sensibilities of free dom loving people everywhere. It is repugnant  to the ideals which our Nation's founders em braced  in our Declaration of  Independence,  Constitution, and Bill of Rights. A nation that  embraces such treatment of its citizens should  be condemned by the world community.  While we have seen  fit  to  impose  limited  sanctions on South Africa,  the sad reality of  those restrictions  is  that they have  failed  to  stir any  significant progress  toward ending  apartheid. I believe it is imperative that strong er actions are undertaken by our Government  to continue demonstrating  to  the world  that  the  intransigence of the South African Gov ernment will not be tolerated by what is con sidered the world's No. 1 democratic govern ment. Enactment of H.R. 1580 will not end  apartheid next year or the year after, but it will  show the South African Government that we  have the will and the resolve to do all within  our power to isolate it from the world commu nity until their apartheid system is dismantled.  RABBI STEPHEN ROBBINS'  SERMON ON AIDS  HON. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  ",1988
300,,100,-0.44,244,11,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker, at the High  Holy Day Services at Temple Emanuel in Bev erly Hills, CA, Rabbi Stephen Robbins deliv ered a most unusual sermon. His  topic was  the AIDS epidemic. The sermon is a frank and  moving discussion of the need to educate our selves and our children about what he calls a  ""simple and hard  reality.*  * * We cannot,""  he correctly states, ""avoid dealing with AIDS.""  Rabbi Robbins described the need not only  to educate ourselves but also  to provide a  support system to people with AIDS,  instead  of becoming  ""enemies who would  isolate  them."" We must ""avoid increased conflict and  prejudice,"" he told his congregation. He talked  about the workshops and programs his temple  would offer because ""We must be active-not  just personally but also politically. You and  I  must not permit this disease to become a po litical  football."" He ended by challenging his  congregation  to  ""dedicate ourselves  to  the  Jewish value of Pikuach Nefesh, the saving of  lives.""  I would very much like to share this moving  discussion with my  colleagues,  and  I am  asking permission that it be reprinted here in  full.

301,,100,-0.379,257,11,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, Sunday, June 19,  is Father's Day. Like our commemoration of  motherhood a month ago, it is a celebration of  the  family unit, and  the  special  role of a  parent. Dad, daddy, and pop are at different  turns,  the soft  touch,  the disciplinarian,  the  coach and the cook.  There is no greater gift than the love of a  child freely given. But in 1988, fatherhood car ries more responsibility than ever before.  Regardless of where  the discussion  takes  place, in the living room or in a congressional  committee hearing, there is a serious debate  on  family values and  family policy  that con cerns us all. More often than not, that debate  centers on  the children,  the most vulnerable  and dependent people in our society.  It is appropriate that on  this Father's Day,  children and  fathers be  the special  focus of  our attention in the Congress. Ossie and Har riet Nelson are a  fading  sterotype of  the  American  family, and  the meaning of father hood is evolving.  For example, a recent survey on American  voter  attitudes on  child  care  services  re vealed:  More than 70 percent of men believed that  affordable good quality child care is difficult to  find; nearly 60 percent of men believed  that  there are not enough child care services avail able; 67 percent of men believed  that most  parents work in order to make ends meet, and  that Government should help make it possible  to afford quality care for children.  Families are striving to provide a decent en vironment for their children. The Act for Better  Child Care  [ABC], H.R. 3660, sponsored by  Representative  DALE  KILDEE  of Michigan,  would help families confront one of the obsta cles that make that goal difficult to achieve. I  am a cosponsor of the ABC bill, and I give it  my strongest endorsement.  ABC  is a comprehensive measure that will  help make quality accessible child care avail able  to  those  in need. ABC helps disadvan taged  families pay  for good quality services  that are in critically short supply, as well.  19-059 0-89-9 (Pt. 11)  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The 1980's marked the advent of stagnant  family incomes, soaring housing costs, and an  even more mobile society  that dilutes  the  family  support  system.  Families,  especially  children, are under tremendous pressure.  Fathers are not immune to these pressures,  and too many have abdicated our most impor tant responsibility. As the Congress continues  to examine the  issue of day care and other  children's  issues, we may not forget the  fa thers who have forgotten their children.  Too often, some  fathers have chosen  to  ignore the most basic family obligations. Too  many  leave  the  job of child  rearing  to a  spouse, to a grandparent, to the schools, or  far worse, to the juvenile justice system.  In recent years, we have opened our eyes  to acknowledge both the  failure of some fa thers to support their children and our failure  to hold  them accountable. More  than ever,  economic and social realities make raising a  family more than women's work.  In raising our sons and in formulating public  policy, we have an obligation  to  teach and  foster personal responsibility.  But for the great majority of parents, includ ing  fathers, who search vainly  for affordable  quality child care,  the Act  for Better Child  Care is a good beginning.  Providing for our children, for our future,  is  the most important task we face as a society.  Passage of progressive and timely legislation  like  the ABC bill will  take us another step  along that path.  In closing, I want to urge my colleagues to  be responsive to America's families, to be re sponsive to America's fathers, and to support  the Act for Better Child Care.  A  TRIBUTE TO THE EASTERN  HIGH  SCHOOL  BASKETBALL  TEAM  HON. BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker, this spring, the  Eastern High School basketball team complet ed  the  finest season  in  the history of  the  school. Their accomplishments, including a 23  to 1 record and league and sectional champi onships, were a triumph for all of us in Beaver  and southern Ohio.  Head Coach Greg Slone, his assistant Neil  Leist, and manager Jamie Bond, deserve our  congratulations for a job well done. And  the  players-Darren King, Darrell Howard, Eddie  Nance, Bryan Hale, Dustten Alley, Rex Leist,  Blaise Reader, Eric Meredith, Ben Howard,  Jeremy  Linkous,  Peter  Keller  and  Justin  McBee-demonstrated that a true team effort  combines hard work and commitment as well  as skill. They are an example to the Nation of  what can be achieved when  individuals bind  together in dedication  to a singular purpose.  They epitomize what athletic competition is all  about-striving with the support of family and  community to be  the best they possibly can  be. They have made us all very proud.  The players' parents, the teachers and ad ministrators, and all of us had our emotions  rise and  fall with  the efforts of  these  fine  15033  young men on the basketball court. Their vic tory became our victory.  This was a team effort not only in terms of  the players on the court, but the school and  community as well. I want to particularly com mend  the Eastern High School cheerleaders  who kept our spirits up. Let me take this op portunity also to congratulate the great job of  the Boosters Club and  the enthusiasm of a  community for its team.  ""SPIRIT OF AMERICA""  PROGRAM  HON. PHILIP M.

303,Senate,100,0.31,400,11,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of S. 1323, the ""Tender Offer  Disclosure and Fairness Act of 1987."" I  am pleased that the Banking Commit tee's months of hearings on the effects  of hostile takeovers on the economy of  our Nation have resulted in a piece of  legislation  that  makes  significant  progress  toward making  the  tender  offer process more fair and evenly bal anced. I do not agree with every provi sion of this bill. On balance, however,  it is a modest and balanced piece of  legislation that deserves  the support  of the Senate.  I  believe  that  any  tender  offer  reform should build on the fundamen tal principles of  the Williams Act:  Government neutrality in contests for  corporate control, rules to ensure full  and timely disclosure, adequate  time  for management and shareholders to  make informed decisions, and effective  SEC enforcement of these principles.  These laws are designed to preserve in vestors' faith  in  the fairness of  the  marketplace and ensure that there is a  level playing field in contests for cor porate control.  After carefully listening to hours of  testimony before the committee, I be lieve that the evidence  is ambiguous  about the long-term effect that hostile  takeovers have on the health of the  American economy and the perform ance of corporate management. We  can find a  study  that confirms any  point of view on these issues.  Whatever your own personal preju dice  is, you can find  that somebody  has done that study which conclusive ly proves your point of view.  Hostile takeovers may be necessary  as a check on the behavior of corpo rate managers who do not own  the  assets that they are managing for the  shareholders. On the other hand, we  have seen manipulative  takeover at tempts by raiders who clearly have no  intention of  running  the companies  that they've put into play. The only  beneficiaries of these deals are invest ment bankers and lawyers.  This suggests to me that we have to  maintain the careful balance set up by  the Williams Act. We should make  those changes that we can all agree  on, such as closing the 13(d) window. I  hope that we will limit our efforts to a  simple  package  of Williams  Act  amendments and leave areas such as  corporate governance to the States. As  a  former Governor, I am very reluc tant  to  impose  the Federal Govern ment's wisdom on areas which have  traditionally been the province of the  States.  The  Supreme  Court  has  spoken on this issue in upholding the  Indiana statute, and I believe that we  should  let  these  laws be subject  to  time and  judicial scrutiny before we  hastily preempt them. I hope that the  States will  think about the national  implications of their decisions and the  economic  results  forthcoming,  and  that they will take these into consider ations as  they enact or amend anti takeover laws, and I believe that we on  the Banking Committee should contin ue to monitor their effects.  I also hope that we do not load this  bill down with controversial amend ments which interfere in our market  economy such as  restrictions on the  amount  of  debt  corporations  can  incur.  I am one who believes that an ill considered taxation measure that was  introduced last fall in the House Ways  and Means Committee had a great  deal to do with triggering the down turn of the October 16, 19, and 20 on  the stock exchange.  We will start down a very dangerous  path if we begin to impose legislative  limits on how much money consenting  adults can borrow.  Tender offer reform strikes me as an  area where the ""Law of Unintended  Consequences"" reigns supreme. If we  enact amendments that tilt the bal ance of the legislation one way or the  other, we could be very disturbed by  the results further down the road. Let  us fix the Williams Act and leave it at  that. We can always return to these  issues if events demonstrate that we  need to tinker with the process fur ther.  I  encourage my colleagues  to  vote against amendments which favor  corporate raiders or incumbent management and to support the bill as re ported out by the Banking Committee.  I  thank  the Chair and yield  the  floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",1988

Since  its  establishment  40  years ago,  Israel has developed a political,  economic, and  intellectual system  that has  become a model for the world.  I salute them  for their efforts and their consistency.  Beginning a nation ""from scratch"" is not an  easy  task. This  is especially  true when  the  nation  in question  is surrounded by hostile  states. However,  the people of  Israel have  worked together to create the only democracy  in  the Middle East.  Israel has  incorporated  hundreds of thousands of Jews from around  the world, including countless individuals flee ing less tolerant cultures, into an open society.  The United States and Israel share common  goals of peace  in  the Middle East.  Israel's  strong  pro-Western  orientation  gives  the  United States one of its few true friends in the  world. There is cooperation between the two  countries in a host of defense and intelligence  areas, as well as joint air and naval exercises.  As a Member of the U.S. Congress,  I take  special  pride  in  Israel's  celebration.  The  United States and Israel have shared a friend ship dating back to the first day of Israel's ex istence. The United States aided the fledgling  State of Israel in its formation, and immediate ly extended diplomatic  relations  to  the new  state upon  its proclamation of independence  on May  14,  1948. Our  two  nations  have  always been fast friends and firm allies, work ing  together  to secure our common values.  Our relationship has been based on a shared  democratic perspective, one which we can  send to the rest of the world.  Mr. Speaker,  I hope that all Americans will  join me  in  saluting  the 40th birthday of a  friend of America. Let us all wish Israel happy  birthday.  RACE IS NOW A CLASS ISSUE  HON. CHARLES B.

307,,100,-0.514,517,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  throughout the  previous decades our Nation has experienced  the pain and  suffering associated with  the  fight  for racial equality, and civil  rights. Over  the last 20 years, some initial racial problems  have been  resolved, and some blacks have  achieved more political, social, and economi cal autonomy. But, as John V. Lindsay has  written  in a recent editorial  in  the Christian  Science Monitor,  the problem of  race  still  exists; its structure has just changed.  Mr. Speaker, and fellow Members, I believe  it is time that we step back and reevaluate the  crisis  facing  the poor and disadvantaged of  our country. For too long this group of people  have been neglected in our legislative efforts,  and many recent studies are conveying grim  pictures of the progress that has been made  15293  by the Federal Government in combating the  problems of the poor in the last 8 years. This  deteriorating situation  is a direct result of a  widening socioeconomic gap, which not so in cidentally leaves behind blacks and other non white minorities.  I would like to share with you Mr. Lindsay's  article, and as  I read  it,  I hope that you will  keep  in mind  the continuing needs of our  country's disadvantaged.

Yet, Americans who hope their  country will practice what its constitution  preaches still invoke the report presented to  President Lyndon Johnson 20 years ago by  the Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,  the so-called Kerner Commission.  This  800-page  document  accused  the  United States of having become ""two soci eties, one black, one white, separate and un equal."" Following the ""long hot summer"" of  racial discord and urban riots in 1967, this  accusation rang true. Our report was unani mous. Whether  liberal,  conservative,  or  moderate,  every  commission member  ac knowledged  incontrovertible evidence of a  racially polarized body politic.  Two decades later that polarization has  taken a new form. The US now confronts a  new  crisis  in  race  relations which  the  Kerner Commission could hardly have an ticipated and which better  leadership  in  recent years might have prevented.  America's nonwhite middle class has ex panded significantly; that is partly because  of the Kerner report and to citizens and po litical leaders who took the findings serious ly. Also, a growing number of blacks and  Hispanics  occupy  leadership  positions  in  city halls and statehouses across the coun try, as well as in Congress.  While  such  changes  are  hallmarks of  greater decency and maturity in our nation al life, many of the poorest of minority citi zens have been left far behind in a  losing  struggle for survival. Backsliding at the fed eral level on commitments to equal opportu nity  in  employment,  job  training,  low income housing, and medical care have had  devastating results.  Rising crime rates, more homelessness, as cending  teen-age birthrates,  lower school  dropout ages, and heavier traffic in illegal  drugs describe  the effect on behavior and  the tragic circumstances of a growing por tion of the population that is disconnected  from society as we have known  it. What  were once regarded as  issues of race have  become,  increasingly,  issues of ""class,""  a  word never heard in our country before.  In the 20 years since the Kerner report,  legislative protections against racial discrim ination have diminished, but not erased, the  problems of poverty suffered by this ""un derclass."" A new commission examining the  difficulties that the Kerner panel investi gated would find two societies: divided these  days more along  lines of economic condi tions and personal conduct  than of  race.  Worse, racial polarization has become fur ther exacerbated by the widening gulf be tween social classes.  This problem, caused by a climate set at  the highest levels of government, can only  be solved by  leadership  that reflects  the  U.S. Constitution's highest principles.  ",1988
308,Senate,100,-0.382,608,11,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  today  I am  reintroducing  important  legislation aimed at reducing the trag edy of drunk driving. This bill is iden tical to S. 2367, introduced on May 11.  With introduction of this new bill, I  look forward to prompt action by the  committees with an interest in seeing  this  important  legislation move  for ward.  This bill would enhance our fight  against drunk driving by encouraging  the adoption of tougher, more effec tive laws. I am pleased to be joined by  Senators DANFORTH,  BENTSEN,  PELL,  GORE, WEICKER,  CHAFEE, MIKULSKI,  LUGAR,  MURKOWSKI,  HEINZ,  and  GRAHAM. Along with groups like Moth ers Against Drunk Driving,  together  we're working toward a simple goal-to  save lives.  With  the passage of  the National  Uniform Minimum Drinking Age Act  in 1984, the Congress took an impor tant step forward in the battle against  drunk driving. As the Senate sponsor  of that bill, I'm proud to see the re sults of  that action. Today,  all 50  States have adopted a minimum drink ing age of 21, eliminating ""blood bor ders."" A 1985-86 study by the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administra tion  found  that over an 18-month  period, almost 850 young  lives were  saved,  largely due  to  the  increased  minimum drinking age. With ""21"" now  fully in effect, we expect to spare 1,000  families the grief of a lost child each  year.  But the battle against drunk driving  is far from over. A drunk driving fatal ity occurs every 22 minutes  in  this  country. Drunk driving has to be re duced among drivers of all ages.  An essential component of our con tinuing efforts must be enhanced en forcement of Federal, State, and local  laws. Our bill would help States meet  that goal.  The bill would  authorize Federal  seed money to States to help establish  self-sustaining drunk driving preven tion programs. In order to be eligible  for this program, States would have to  put  into place a  self-supporting en forcement program, under which fines  and surcharges collected from individ uals convicted of drunk driving are re turned  to communities  for  enforce ment.  States would also have to adopt laws  that provide for the prompt suspen sion or revocation of the license of a  driver found to be driving under the  influence of alcohol. A recent study re leased by the Insurance Institute for  Highway Safety [IIHSJ showed that  such laws reduce drunk driving fatali ties by 9 percent.  In addition  to  being  eligible  for  grants under these two basic require ments, States could also receive sup plemental funds for adoption of either  or both of the following procedures:  First, a means of making drivers  censes of those under the legal drink ing age  readily distinguishable from  those of drivers of legal drinking age;  and second, the mandatory blood alco hol testing of drivers involved in fatal  or serious accidents.  Finally,  the bill would direct  the  Secretary of Transportation to com mission a study by the National Acade my of Sciences on  the appropriate  blood alcohol concentration at which a  driver should be deemed to be under  the influence of alcohol.  li Mr. President,  the  importance of  this legislation is apparent to anyone  who has suffered the loss of a loved  one. Recently, I listened to the tragic  story of Bob Gore. Mr. Gore was vaca tioning in Hawaii with his 24-year-old  son and daughter, when his children  were killed by a drunk driver. This was  not the first time that driver had been  guilty of driving drunk. But he was  still able to drink and drive. That is an  outrage that must be corrected. That's  what this bill would do.  That drunk driver has now been con victed of manslaughter in the death of  the Gores. But in the 15 months be tween their deaths and the conviction,  he was allowed  to go on driving. In  fact, Mr. Gore told us that the last  thing the convicted killer of his chil dren did before leaving the courtroom  was to turn over his drivers license. If  that had been done after his earlier  transgressions, perhaps  that  tragedy  might never have happened.  Nothing can be done  to bring lost  loved ones back. But we can take steps  to keep  tragedies  like  the one  that  killed  the Gores from happening  to  other families. I want to commend Mr.  Gore  for  his  commitment  to  this  effort. He's turning his personal grief  into a positive force,  trying to spare  others. For  that, he deserves  to be  commended.  I'm pleased  to be  joined  in  this  effort by Mothers Against Drunk Driv ing, the Insurance Institute for High way Safety, and the National Safety  Council. This coalition has been suc cessful before, providing crucial force  behind the minimum drinking age bill.  I  look forward  to continued success  with this legislation, and urge my col leagues  to  join  in cosponsoring  the  bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a copy of the bill be included  in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2549  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  That this Act may be cited as the ""Drunk  Driving Prevention Act of 1988"".  SEc. 2.  (a) Chapter 4 of title 23, United  States Code, is amended by adding at the  end the following new section:  ""§409. Drunk driving enforcement programs  ""(a) Subject to the provisions of this sec tion,  the Secretary shall make basic and  supplemental grants to those States which  adopt and implement drunk driving enforce ment programs which include measures, de scribed in this section, to improve the effec tiveness of the enforcement of laws to pre vent drunk driving. Such grants may only  be used by recipient States to  implement  and enforce such measures.  ""(b) No grant may be made to a State  under this section in any fiscal year unless  such State enters into such agreements with  the Secretary as the Secretary may require  ",1988
309,House,100,0.332,647,11,Mr. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the best opportunities we'll have this  year to cut wastefull spending in the  military may fall by the wayside due  to the Democratic leadership's refusal  to honor its promise for a floor vote.  The base closing measure, to set up a  nonpartisan  commission  to  recom mend military bases for closure, was  not offered as an amendment to the  DOD authorization bill because  the  Democratic  leadership  wanted  a  chance to consider the bill at greater  length. That earlier promise now looks  more and more like it was designed to  derail this popular idea.  For  this measure  to be successful  this year,  it must be handled in the  conference on the DOD authorization.  The Democratic  leadership has said  that to handle  it  in conference  the  House must first debate it and vote on  it on  the House  floor.  I  urge  the  Democratic leadership to stop playing  politics with this issue and bring this  bill to the House floor before the end  of the DOD conference.  Mr. Speaker, this issue is much too  important to stall around on. Let the  House have a chance to vote on this  measure before  the DOD conference  ends.

310,House,100,-0.514,660,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Chairman, as  the Chair man of the House Select Committee on Nar cotics Abuse and Control, I rise in support of  the provisions in H.R. 4781,  the Department  of Defense appropriations bill, 1989, which  relate to drug interdiction.  H.R. 4781 appropriates $410 million for the  Navy  to support Coast Guard activities  for  coastal defense and drug interdiction. Of this  total, the bill provides $350 million for procure ment of equipment including  three E2-C air craft, six helicopters, 1 0 patrol boats, secure  command and control equipment, and air sur veillance equipment. The remaining $60 mil lion  is  to be  transferred by  the Navy to  the  Coast Guard  for maintenance of  this equip ment. This money will enable the Coast Guard  to carry on  its critical drug  interdiction and  coastal defense activities.  Mr. Chairman, in fiscal year 1988, the Coast  Guard was forced to absorb a $103 million cut  in its operating budget, and drug patrols were  cut back 55 percent. Such patrols are respon sible for 90 percent of the Coast Guard's drug  seizures.  The Coast Guard Commandant,  Adm. Paul Yost, testified recently that he has  personnel sitting  in port, because there was  not sufficient money to send them out to sea.  This is a clear waste of valuable, trained man power, and can only have a negative impact  on the morale of the individuals involved and  serious detrimental consequences for the mis sions,  including drug  interdiction,  they would  otherwise perform.  If winning  the war against drugs  is  the  number one domestic concern of American  voters, as public opinion polls say it is,  then  Federal spending patterns should reflect this  concern.  I support the $41 0 million provided  for the Coast Guard in the 1989 Department  of Defense Appropriations Bill. Although  this  amount is not adequate to significantly curtail  the continuous onslaught of drugs which is di rected against America,  it  should at  least  enable  the Coast Guard  to restore  the drug  enforcement activities curtailed by  the 1988  cuts. The House is currently working on omni bus drug  legislation which will be brought to  the floor later this summer. I am hopeful that  at that time we will be able to provide signifi cant enhancements to the Coast Guard's drug  enforcement capabilities.  I am concerned about the continuing pat tern of funding a portion of the Coast Guard's  budget out of the DOD appropriations bill. The  Transportation Appropriations bill the House is  scheduled to take up later this week assumes  the appropriation of the funds included in the  DOD bill. If for some reason the Coast Guard  funding in the DOD bill does not become law,  the amounts included for the Coast Guard in  the DOT bill are totally insufficient to provide  for Coast Guard operations.  In my mind,  this  jerry-built approach  to  Coast Guard funding is no way to fight a war  on drugs. We need to assign a higher budget ary priority to our antidrug efforts and find a  way to ensure  that the Coast Guard will  re ceive directly the funds it needs to do the job  of drug interdiction Congress has assigned to  it.

311,House,100,0.585,660,11,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Chairman,  once again, we  face  the  incomprehensible  myopia of those who want to cut the future off  at the knees.  If Jimmy Carter had proposed SDI,  liberals  would be four-square behind it. SDI is a revo lutionary  concept.  It  is Ronald  Reagan's  legacy.  SDI: ""A shield, not a sword,"" Edward Teller.  Arms control and strategic defense are not  competing objectives. They are  rather,  two  sides of the same coin.  It is a humane, sane alternative to insane,  profane, inane mad.  Not moving forward with SDI would be like  asking  the Orioles  to  take  the  field without  baseball gloves. They'd never win. It would be  like asking the Capitals to play hockey without  a goalie.  We can do it. The technology is there in de veloping. Making great progress. The Soviets  obviously believe it can work. First,  they are  developing  it  themselves; and second,  they  are trying desperately to prevent us from de veloping it.  Offshoot  technology  from SDI  is already  paying dividends and will continue to do so specifically in medicine and technology.

312,,100,0.492,699,11,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, as our distin guished colleagues in the Senate move closer  to passing  legislation  (S. 533), elevating  the  VA to a cabinet level department-the bill has  7 4 cosponsors in the Senate-it is time to re flect on  the negative press  reaction  to  this  popular initiative. In this regard I am placing in  the RECORD a recent editorial by Richard Har wood entitled the VA Question.  Tm: v A QUESTION  It  <By Richard Harwood)  On the 12th day of November, 1987, 69  years after the armistice ending World War  I, The Post, in a manner of speaking, start ed a modest little war of its own. The guns  of its editorial page were unlimbered and  fired off at targets all over town: the presi dent, the Veterans Administration, Congress  and the various veterans' lobbies. The pur pose of this assault, carried out at dawn  when most people were still sloshing their  oatmeal, was to blow holes in a scheme to  grant the Veterans Administration Cabinet  status.  is now  a mere  ""independent""  agency, owned and operated <somewhat like  the Agriculture or Defense departments> by  80 million constituents <veterans and their  dependents> and such patrons as the Ameri can Legion and G. W. ""Sonny"" Montgomery  <D-Miss.>. chairman of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee.  Six days passed with no counterfire from  the politicians. Then, on Nov. 18, the House  responded with a barrage  that shattered  teacups all over the editorial department. It  approved the Cabinet proposal by a vote of  399  to 17. Pow! Take  that, you egghead  scribblers!  The six-day war was over. Before  the  summer is out, the Senate will have passed  the bill, the president will have signed it,  and the next chief of the agency will be ad dressed as ""Mr. <or Ms.) Secretary.""  It is not clear whether the Post editorial ists, perhaps suffering from a white-collar  form of Post Trauma Stress Disorder, recog nized what had happened on Nov. 18, be cause they launched on Nov. 25 a soporific  harassing  operation  against  the  bill.  began with an editorial bearing a half-heart ed headline hinting at broken spirits and a  lack of enthusiasm for the fight: ""Such a  Bad Idea.""  Four months later, the editorial campaign  was  terminated (""quietly,"" as we say) but  not The Post's involvement  in  the  issue.  The news department, initially on the side lines, had by that time joined the fray. It  produced a series of low-key articles devoted  largely  to allegations made by critics of  both the legislation and the VA and to occa sional predictions that the bill was in trou ble.  One of the more amusing stories related  ""fears"" in the Senate that Cabinet status  would ""politicize""  this agency, which hisIt  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  torically has been approximately as nonpo litical as the Democratic and Republican na tional committees. It will spend, under the  direct and constant supervision of the big  veterans' lobbies, $27 billion this year. As a  token of its liberality, it handed out $156  million in overpayments a couple of years  ago, a fact reported with some pride to its  approving partners in Congress.  A counterattack on the news department  was launched on April 10 by the Disabled  American Veterans, a strong proponent of  Cabinet status for the VA. The Blind Veter ans of America, led by John Fales, contrib uted supporting fires. One charge was that  the news and editorial departments were en gaged in a conscious and unethical alliance  to torpedo the legislation. Given the rival ries and frequent intellectual conflicts be tween the two departments, such an alliance  would represent the second great act of de tente in 1988. As Meg Greenfield, the edito rial page editor, remarked to Mikhail Gor bachev during an  interview  last month,  ""Our empire [the Post company] is competi tive within itself ... like all empires.""  The only direct evidence of teamwork on  the VA issue is vaporous, consisting of the  appropriation in one news story of language  obviously borrowed and paraphrased from  an editorial: ""There is no dispute that the  government has a lasting obligation to vet erans wounded in combat and to their fami lies and survivors."" Reporters don't usually  talk or write that way.  Still, there was a clear coincidence of view point in the paper's editorial stance and its  news coverage. It is explained by the princi pal reporter involved, Bill McAllister, as a  simple case of the V A's critics making the  most noise. That is one of those all-purpose,  self-protective  statements  journalists  use  when accused of bias. Taken at face value, it  converts mindlessness into a virtue. Was the  news coverage tilted against the VA plan?  Yes.  Now that the war is over, there is another  question I ask with great trepidation: Who's  running this town anyWay, the press or the  politicians?  15475  tachments and diseases of the retina. He now  practices in Warren, OH, is on the staff of St.  Joseph Riverside Hospital and Trumbull Me morial Hospital, and formerly served as chief  of ophthalmology at both hospitals.  Dr. Shapiro  lives  in Girard, OH, with his  lovely wife Anita Tamarkin,  and  his  three  doting children-Andrea, Sam, and Tom. He is  a past president of the Warren Lions Club, is  a former district trustee for the Ohio Lions Eye  Research Foundation, and  is a member of  both the Cleveland Eye Bank's Medical Policy  Committee and St. Joseph Riverside Hospi tal's Board of Directors. He  is president of  Rodef Sholom Temple, chairman of the Com bined  Jewish Appeal,  and  serves on  the  Youngstown Area Jewish Federation Execu tive Board.  Dr. Shapiro is a man of firsts when it comes  to surgical achievements in Warren. He per formed  the  first  intraocular lens  implant,  the  first phacoemulsification, the first silicone fold able  intraocular lens,  the  first corneal  trans plant, the first radial keratotomy, and the first  televised surgery. He also accomplished  the  amazing  feat of the  first combined cataract,  intraocular  lens  implant, and corneal  trans plant surgery.  Dr. Shapiro is truly a wizard when it comes  to medical surgery, and  through his miracles  he has  improved  the eyesight of countless  people in Mahoning and Trumbull Counties.  I  am proud  to call Dr. Shapiro my friend, and  hope that his successful services to humanity  continue  for a  long  time. Thus,  it  is with  thanks and special pleasure  that  I join with  people of  the 17th Congressional District  in  saluting  the astounding work and extremely  admirable character of Dr. Richard Shapiro.

314,,100,0.246,712,11,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, my friend, JOHN  DUNCAN, announced May 27 that he will not  seek a 13th term in the House because of ill  health. Shortly after this unhappy announce ment, his son, Knox County Criminal Court  Judge ""Jimmy"" Duncan, Jr., filed his candida cy papers for the Republican Party nomination  for the U.S. Congress to succeed his father as  Tennessee's Second Congressional District  Representative in Congress. As an old friend  of JOHN, his lovely wife, Lois, and their won derful family, I wish to express a few thoughts  on these unexpected events.  The first is that JOHN DUNCAN  is my close,  personal friend, and he is a fighter. He contin ues to  fight  to  regain his health so he can  return to Washington to be with us for the re mainder of his term, and I hope his colleagues  here in the House will remember him in their  thoughts and prayers.  It has been my privilege  to know  JOHN  DUNCAN  for many, many years, and we have  served  together here  in  the House  for 24  years representing adjoining districts  in east  Tennessee. His  record  of accomplishment  and service  to his constituents  is  legendary  throughout the Second Congressional District.  No constituent's problem was ever too small  or unimportant  for him  to  take up and  turn  around  for  the benefit of  the person who  asked him  for help. Most of his colleagues  here associate him with his diligent and effec tive work over a great many years as a  member of  the House Committee on Ways  and Means, where he has served as ranking  Republican Member since 1985. Over  the  years, I have gone to JOHN for advice and as sistance and he has never  failed  to come  through with sound advice and effective as sistance. This is so because of his sound and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  steady  judgment, abundant common sense,  and practicality as well as his great heart and  willingness to help.  So, with his retirement announcement after  24 years of outstanding service in the House,  he has left big shoes to fill. For my money, or  you might say, my 2 cents' worth, there is only  one  person  big  enough  to  fill  those  big  shoes-his sori, John ""Jimmy"" Duncan, Jr.  I have absolutely the highest regard and af fection  for  Jimmy Duncan, whom  I have  known since he was a boy. His father is justifi ably proud of him and the trail he has blazed  in  life. After a solid academic and practical  training in law, Jimmy Duncan has served as a  Knox County Criminal Court  Judge  since  1981. He has built a fine reputation  for firm ness, fairness, and compassion on the bench  in  administering  justice  to  those  brought  before his court. He  is a strong Republican  Party man who knows the Second Congres sional District and its people as few do, and  he  is an energetic and effective worker who  will represent them well in the Congress.  JOHN DuNCAN's shoes are truly big ones to  fill, but I am convinced Jimmy Duncan is the  man who can do so. Because of this,  I am  proud to support him with great enthusiasm in  his campaign  for election  to  the 1 01 st Con gress.  At  the same  time,  I salute Tennessee's  Second  District Congressman, my  friend,  JOHN DUNCAN, and wish him well  in his fight  against cancer.  I know our colleagues in the  House join me in saying to JOHN that we are  thinking of you and you are in our prayers. We  miss you, and we hope to see you back on  the House floor soon. We need your leader ship.  And  to Jimmy Duncan, my best wishes as  you begin to take up the challenges of cam paigning  for a seat  in  the Congress where  your  father serves with great distinction and  the respect and affection of those who know  him.  IN PROTEST OF THE EXTRADI TION OF JOSEPH PATRICK DO HERTY  HON.GEORGEJ.HOCHBRUECKNER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 21, 1988  ",1988
315,,100,-0.348,712,11,Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to protest  the decision of Attorney General  Edwin Meese  to extradite political prisoner  Joseph Patrick Doherty  to  the United King dom. Mr. Doherty, who was convicted in 1981  of killing a British Army captain in Belfast, es caped from a Northern Ireland prison and fled  to the United States. The British Government  immediately  initiated extradition proceedings  following his June 18, 1983, arrest  in  the  United States.  In 1984, the United States District Court for  the Southern District of New York after a full  hearing denied the British request to extradite  Mr. Doherty  to Northern  Ireland. The court  found that his offenses were political not civil.  In 1986, after  judicial  review,  an order  to  deport Mr. Doherty to the Republic of Ireland  was issued. This decision by the Board of lmJune 21, 1988  migration Appeals was to end 4 years of litiga tion during which Mr. Doherty remained incar cerated  in  the United States without being  charged of a crime in this country.  Archbishop Cardinal John O'Connor of the  Archdiocese  of New  York,  Bishop  John  McGann of the Diocese of Rockville Centre,  as well as several  Irish-American organiza tions have protested  this situation. Members  of  the ad hoc congressional Committee  for  Irish Affairs, of which I am a member, sent a  telegram to Attorney General Meese on July  14, 1987, urging him to uphold the decisions  of both  Immigration Judge Howard  I. Cohen  and  the Board of Immigration Appeals which  called  for  the deportation of Mr. Doherty  to  the Republic of Ireland.  On June 14, 1988, shortly before the fifth  anniversary of Mr. Doherty's incarceration  in  the United States, Attorney General Meese  overruled  the decisions of  these courts and  ordered the extradition of Mr. Doherty to the  United Kingdom. On June 16, I joined with a  bipartisan group of 14 members of the Com mittee for Irish Affairs in  issuing a statement  strongly criticizing Attorney General Meese's  decision. We declared, 'The Attorney Gener al's decision did not address issues of law instead it was purely a political decision aimed  at not jeopardizing relations with Great Britain  over the problems  in Nortthern Ireland."" We  concluded  that Attorney General Meese ""ig nored the rulings of Federal judges which es tablished  that his crimes were political and  which would bar extradition."" Joe Doherty has  become,  thanks  to Mr. Meese, a  ""political  sacrificial lamb with no regard to any rights he  might have under the law.""  Mr. Speaker, I strongly protest the decision  of Attorney General Meese  to extradite Mr.  Doherty to Great Britain and I urge him to re consider this decision. The extradition of Mr.  Doherty absolutely disregards  the  rulings of  two U.S. courts and it forces our legal system  to become entangled in diplomatic concerns.  According to the U.S. Constitution, the execu tive and judicial branches of our Government  are designed to operate separately and fairly.  By protesting the Attorney General's decision,  this separation can be upheld, and fair treat ment can  be ensured  for every  individual  under the law of the United States.  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLA TION  TO  PROVIDE  EQUITY  FOR RAILROAD RETIREES  HON. PAT WILLIAMS  OF MONTANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 21, 1988  ",1988
316,,100,-0.315,712,11,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing  two separate bills which will help  provide equity for railroad retirees and other  retirees so they are on a par with Social Secu rity beneficiaries.  The first bill-the Railroad Retirement Medi care Equity Act of 1988, will amend title XVIII  of the Social Security Act to provide the same  limitation on increases in deductions for Medi care part B premiums from railroad retirement  annuities as currently applies to Social Securi ty. What  this means  is  that any  increase  in  ",1988
317,House,100,-0.004,816,11,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Tennessee  [Mr.  QuiLLEN] for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the rule on H.R. 4800, the HUD-Inde pendent Agencies Appropriations Act  and I strongly support the effort of  the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr.  SYNAR] and the gentleman from Penn sylvania  [Mr. CLINGER]  to offer an  amendment  to  eliminate  indemnity  payments  for  the manufacturers of  banned and suspended pesticides.  I also join with the gentleman from  Tennessee  [Mr. QuiLLEN]  in  lauding  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  [Mr. BoLAND] who is serving out his  final days in the 100th Congress and  in his service in the Congress. He is an  outstanding Member and he certainly  deserves to be honored for his contri butions to the House of Representa tives and I am proud to call him a  friend. The fact that I oppose this rule  does not carry with it any indication  at all of my support for his efforts on  this particular appropriations bill.  I  think this is an important bill and I  know that he and the gentleman from  New York [Mr. GREEN] have done an  excellent  job. But, Mr. Speaker, the  Subcommittee  on  Environment,  Energy, and Natural Resources of the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations, on which I serve as the ranking  minority member, has held hearings.  The Subcommittee on Environment,  Energy,  and Natural Resources  is  chaired by the gentleman from Okla homa [Mr. SYNAR] who is one of the  cosponsors of  this amendment with  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. CLINGER] who is the ranking Re publican on that subcommittee. Their  hearings were held in 1983 and last  fall  that subcommittee held further  hearings and recommended to the full  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations, which the committee adopted,  the report entitled ""Soaring Subsidies  for Banned Pesticides Stymie Safety  Reviews.""  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Synar-Clinger  amendment would implement two crit ical  recommendations made by  the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations in that report which was ap proved last year. It is clear to me that  year after year of oversight hearings  and  investigations  are meaningless  unless actions are taken to eliminate  the  problems  identified  over  the  course of those hearings.  The  Synar-Clinger  amendment  would do just that while at the same  time saving taxpayers potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Only by  defeating this rule on this bill can the  House have an opportunity to vote on  the Synar-Clinger amendment which  will eliminate a  taxpayer subsidy en joyed  by  pesticide manufacturers,  something that has been granted to no  other segment of American business.  Mr. Speaker, taxpayers do not foot  the bill when Detroit finds  it neces sary to initiate a recall of unsafe auto mobiles. The Government does not  pay drug manufacturers millions of  dollars  to pull dangerous or  tainted  drugs  off  store  shelves.  There  is  simply no  reason  to  pay  pesticide  firms to not only remove unsafe pesti cides from the market but to then also  pay these firms vast sums of money to  store and dispose of those materials.  By defeating the rule, the House will  be afforded an opportunity to vote on  an amendment that has a broad base  of support, as broad as almost any I  have ever seen. The repeal of indemni fication payments is supported by the  administration, every major environ mental  organization,  the National  Taxpayers Union, and national news papers. It is being offered in a biparti san fashion by two Members of Con gress with primary oversight responsi bility for the pesticide program.  Mr. Speaker,  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania has just provided me a  copy of a letter dated June 22, 1988,  from the Administrator of the Envi ronmental Protection Agency, Lee M.  Thomas, in which he says:  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, .  Washington, DC, June 22, 1988.  Hon. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, Jr.,  Environment,  Energy,  and Natural Re sources Subcommittee,  Committee  on  Government Operations, Washington,  DC.  DEAR MR. CLINGER: This is in response to  your request for the Agency's position on in demnification,  storage and disposal with  regard  to suspended and cancelled pesti cides. Our position has been and continues  to be that indemnification must be abol ished. As for storage and disposal, we think  the  registrants should be  responsible  for  performing these functions under EPA reg ulation and oversight. We also  think the  Agency should be able to issue enforceable  regulations governing recall of pesticides.  Sincerely,  LEE M. THOMAS,  Administrator.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote in opposition to this rule and to  voice  their  support  for  the Synar Clinger amendment to eliminate this  unfair and unjustified special interest  subsidy.  Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman from New York yield?  ",1988
318,House,100,-0.306,842,11,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support  for H.R. 4800, which appropriates  $59.7 billion for fiscal year 1989 for the De partment of Housing and Urban Development  and  16  related agencies.  Included  in  this  measure is funding for many programs of spe cial importance to my home State of West Vir ginia and I would like to take this opportunity  to highlight a few of these.  The legislation before us today appropriates  $9.9 billion for housing programs in fiscal year  1989, including $7.4 billion for housing assist ance and $1.6 billion for public housing oper ating subsidies. The funding  levels in the bill  are approximately at  the  fiscal  year 1988  levels. I am very pleased that once again the  Appropriations Committee has wisely rejected  the Reagan administration's attempt  to pro vide almost all low-income housing assistance  in  the  form of 5-year housing voucher con tracts.  Instead,  H.R.  4800  continues  the  present mix consisting of  the voucher pro gram, section 8 rental subsidies, rehabilitation  of rental housing and reconstruction or devel opment of public housing.  Under the section 202 program, the bill pro vides $1.5 billion for 9,500 rental units for the  elderly or handicapped. Additionally, $5 million  is appropriated for congregate services at el derly and handicapped housing projects, fund ing  that the administration did not include in  its proposal. To help address  the growing  homeless problem in this country, H.R. 4800  provides $65 million for grants to renovate or  convert buildings for use as emergency home less shelters and to pay for certain operating  and social services at such shelters.  In addi tion, $85 million  is provided  for housing and  support services for the homeless mentally ill  and homeless families.  Another program which has been of  im mense assistance  to West Virginia  is  the  Community Development Block Grant Pro gram for which $3 billion is contained in H.R.  4800. Unfortunately, the bill does not appropri ate any  funds  for  the Urban Development  Action Grant Program for fiscal year 1989, al though it does provide for the continuation of  the  program with  recaptured  funds.  I will  strongly support an amendment being offered  later today that would provide $150 million for  the UDAG Program.  H.R. 4800 funds the Environmental Protec tion Agency at $5.2 billion for 1989. Of great  importance to West Virginia  is the $2 billion  contained in the bill for construction grants to  municipal, State, and  interstate agencies  to  assist with the planning, design, and construc tion of waste water treatment facilities. Many  of our communities in West Virginia are strug gling  to comply with  the secondary sewage  treatment standards mandated by  the Clean  Water Act. The funding provided for the sewer  grants program is critical for these and other  communities  throughout  the  country which  simply do not have the resources to meet the  sewage treatment requirements.  Mr. Chairman,  I am also happy to support  this bill because  it appropriates a  total of  $28.2 billion in fiscal year 1989 for the Veter ans' Administration, which  is  $250 million  more  than  the  administration  request and  $443 million more  than  the fiscal year 1988  funding  level.  I am especially pleased since  $15.7 million of  the  funding  for major con struction projects will be used for clinical  im provements at the Beckley Area VA Medical  Center in my hometown of Beckley, WV. The  Beckley VAMC  is a 17 4-bed acute medical  and surgical center, with a 42-bed nursing  home care unit. There are 57,000 veterans  from 11 counties in West Virginia and 1 in Vir ginia with potential access  to  the Beckley  VAMC. Money for clinical additions and alter ations provided for by the bill would create es sential extra space  to accommodate an  in creasing staff serving an ever-growing number  of patients.  I salute my colleagues on  the  HUD-Indepedent  Agencies  Appropriations  Subcommittee  for  recognizing  the needs of  veterans in southern West Virginia and south western Virginia. Our Nation's veterans have  given so generously of themselves in protect ing the rights of free Americans that it is only  fair to reward them with adequate health care  facilities. I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port H.R. 4800.  ",1988

320,House,100,-0.446,855,11,Mr. MFUME.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of the amendment.  ",1988
321,House,100,-0.173,855,11,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Chairman, we are  faced today with another exercise in  hard choices. We are asked to choose  between our Nation's basic commit ment to research and development, be tween our commitment to providing a  decent place for people to live, care for  homeless veterans, commitment to re building our cities and also reducing  the pollution  to our Nation's rivers  and streams.  0 1450  I guess if we had our druthers, we  would rather do them all. We do not  have that luxury today, in light of our  budget deficits.  My decision to vote for this amend ment is made easier because of the fol lowing facts: Even if this amendment  is adopted, the space component of re search  and  development  within  NASA's budget will receive a $500 mil lion increase, not a cut but a $500 mil lion  increase. My  support  for  this  amendment is made easier because of  the  fact  that we have already cut  housing during the last 7 years by over  one-half. If we had cut everything else  in our Federal budget by as much as  we  have cut housing, we not only  would have a  balanced budget, we  would have a surplus of some $200 bil lion.  My support for this amendment also  is made easier by the fact that in 1994,  and beyond, we will provide no more  new Federal money  for cleanup of  sewage discharges  into our Nation's  rivers and streams.  In urging my colleagues to support  this amendment, let me conclude by  saying, ""enough is enough.""  An increase of nearly 15 percent in  NASA's  fiscal  year  1989  budget  is  enough. Seven years of deep cuts in  housing programs is enough. We can  do something about it by voting  in  favor of this amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  Delaware  [Mr.  CARPER] has expired.  ",1988
322,House,100,-0.194,855,11,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. Chair man, this past year the Nobel Prize in  Economics was  awarded  to Robert  Solow of the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology. In his thesis he said  that it is high technology and its re search and development that basically  is  the creation of wealth and  that  leads a nation to productivity. That is  simply our future. The Nobel Prize  Committee recognized that, and that  is part of the price that we have today.  Now, certainly the Soviets have rec ognized  that,  for  they are  in  their  third generation of a  space station.  This is merely the space station where  a great deal of materials processing  and medical research is  taking place  and future kinds of pharmaceuticals  are now being experimented with in  this extraordinary environment called  zero gravity.  When we sent JoHN GLENN into the  heavens, we  even  thought  that  the  human eyeball might change shape,  but what we found was that we could  harness this environment to do incred ible things, including the experiment  that will go on Discovery, at the end  of this summer, an experiment called  protein crystals.

343,,100,0.379,959,11,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, apart  from  the  problem of the drought, there are a number of  problems  facing midwestern dairy  farmers.  Our colleague  from Wisconsin, TOBY ROTH,  recently aired some of his views in a column  published by the ""Wisconsin State Farmer."" I  believe that solving the dairy industry's prob lems will require a lot of discussion and a lot  of fresh thinking. At this point, I would like to  insert Mr. ROTH's column into the RECORD for  the benefit of my colleagues.  MILK MARKETING ORDERS: TIME FOR A  CHANGE  <Representative TOBY RoTH)  The Federal Milk Marketing Order system  is outdated and needs to be overhauled.  The system has contributed to excess pro duction and clearly discriminates against  farmers in traditional dairy producing states  like Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota re ceive  the lowest prices  in the nation for  their milk while farmers in states like Geor gia and Texas get the highest prices. In fact,  the gap in prices paid between regions was  further widened in 1985 with the mandated  increase in the Class I differentials.  The normal economic factors of supply  and demand play a minimal role  in  this  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  price determination. The price per cwt.  is  virtually the same throughout the 44 na tionwide milk marketing orders. The price  difference is determined by an antiquated  formula based on the cost of transporting  fluid milk from Eau Claire. Thus, marketing  orders for regions located farthest from Eau  Claire tend to claim the highest prices.  For example, a farmer in Shawano may  receive  $10.33  per cwt.  for  his milk. A  farmer in Brehman, GA, would get $13.41.  At  this  rate,  a Wisconsin  dairy  farmer  almost could book a super saver flight on a  national airline, fly his milk to Georgia and  still make more than if he sold it in his  home state.  In March, the General Accounting Office,  an independent federal investigative agency,  released its findings on the status of the  milk marketing order  system. The GAO  report concluded that the system no longer  serves its original purpose of encouraging a  local supply of milk. Today, milk  is pro duced in every region of the country. Ad vances in technology have made it easier to  store and transport milk in traditionally de ficient areas.  An excellent example of how the price dif ferential is at the root of our dairy surplus  problem  lays  in  the  story of Masstock  Farms in Montezuma, GA. Masstock  is a  foreign-owned dairy that targeted Georgia  to eventually build five dairies with over  6,000 cows. The reason: Price. The price dif ferentials have caused production increases  of 25-25% in the South and Southwest.  Milk marketing orders were established in  1933  to safeguard dairy farmers and con sumers from great swings in milk supplies  and prices. An admirable goal in 1933 since  milk was an extremely perishable, bulky  commodity  and  refrigeration  and  other  preservation technologies were primitive.  In 1988, however, 44 national milk market ing orders provide for cumbersome bureauc racy and the outdated transportation allow ances cost the U.S. taxpayer an estimated  $800 million a year in waste and  income  transfer. And  technological advances that  improve the shelf life of milk have virtually  eliminated the need for vast transportation  differentials based on Eau Claire.  With production estimates up 2% from a  year ago, the dairy industry is on a collision  course  toward another 50¢  price cut.  In  order to preserve the health industry, we  must have fundamental changes  in dairy  policy, starting with milk marketing orders.   Later this month, I will propose to the  House Agriculture Dairy, Livestock  and  Poultry Subcommittee replacing the current  44 milk marketing orders with a  regional  marketing system that more accurately re flects transportation costs based on four re gional midpoints.  I believe that there should be no more  than four milk marketing orders based in  corresponding regions. The nat:lonal price  paid for milk should be determined as it is  now. The transportation differential should  accurately reflect the 1988 costs of moving  milk to and from the specific region's natu ral collection point.  I also strongly support efforts to pressure  the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service  into holding oversight hearings on the net  effect of the 1985 mandated increase in the  Class I differentials. It is high time that the  facts were on the table with respect to the  changing distribution of milk production  throughout the regions of the country.  While  it  is unlikely  that Congress will  fully  tackle  this  issue before  the session  closes  in October,  I am hopeful that the  15735  groundwork will be firmly laid for changes  in 1989.  A  fundamental  restructuring of  the 44  milk marketing areas would reduce govern ment bureaucracy, save taxpayers money by  limiting the amount paid for transportation,  and would not discriminate against farmers  in the traditional milk producing areas of  the Midwest. More important, restucturing  the orders may result in such a saving that  farmers could receive more for their prod uct while consumers pay less.  It is time that we in Congress set aside our  regional differences and do what is right for  the nation for a change. It is time for all  farmers across  the nation  to be  treated  equally and fairly. A streamlined regional  milk marketing system is long overdue.  COUNCILMAN GILBERT WILLIAM  LINDSAY  HON. MERVYN M.

I would like to bring to your attention, and to  the attention of all my colleagues, Dr. Lind say's significant  contributions,  and  am  re questing that the attached be inserted into the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  COUNCILMAN GILBERT WILLIAM LINDSAY  Gilbert William Lindsay,  the first black  man to become a member of the Los Ange les City Council, has a background in gov ernment that extends over 50 years. Born  on a cotton plantation in Jasper County,  Mississippi on November 29, 1900, he left  the farm in his early teens and moved to  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he complet ed his secondary education.  Mr. Lindsay left Pittsburgh and went to  Arizona to serve in the United States Army  in both the lOth Cavalry and the 25th In fantry. Always seeking to progress by fur thering his education, he enrolled in a pro gram at the University of Arizona's School  of Business Administration while  in  the  Army.  Following military  service, he went  to  California where he was hired by the De partment of Water and Power for the City  of Los Angeles. Using every available hour  to pursue courses and take promotional ex aminations,  he  continually  moved  up  through the civil service ranks.  Mr. Lindsay became quite active in politics  and community affairs despite his busy  schedule. In 1952, he served as Associate  Manager in the campaign to elect Kenneth  Hahn, Supervisor of Los Angeles County;  and after the election, he was appointed the  first black Deputy Supervisor, a capacity in  which he served for 10 years.  In January of 1963, Mr. Lindsay was ap pointed to fill a vacancy on the Los Angeles  City Council for the 9th District, becoming  the first black Councilman in the City's his tory. In the general election in May, he was  overwhelmingly elected, defeating 11 oppo nents. He has been re-elected for seven con secutive terms and has served for over 24  ",1988

President Ronald Reagan,  in a very pleas ant Oval Office meeting, extended his warm est admiration to the group and expressed his  congratulations to the team and Coach Evelyn  Blalock.  Team members presented  the President  with numerous gifts: A Rangers warm-up suit,  baseball cap with the school emblem, college  yearbook and school history, and a gym bag  filled with similar gifts for Mrs. Reagan.  The Kilgore  Lady Rangers  captured  the  NJCAA championship with a 33-1  season  record. In the NJCAA national tournment, Kil gore College defeated Lees College, Jackson,  KY, 105-102: Moberly Area College, Moberly,  MO, 79-73; Northeastern Oklahoma A&M Col lege, Miami, OK, 72-69; and John A. Logan  College, Carterville,  IL,  in  the championship  game 78-71.  During  the season, Kilgore Lady Rangers  scored  3,071  points-an average  of 90.3  points per game-while allowing  their oppo nents only 2,381-an average of 70.0 points  per game.  Kilgore College went to the national tourna ment for the first time in 1986, finishing sev enth. The  team  returned  in 1987,  finishing  sixth, and in 1988 became the NJCAA nation al champions.  The Lady Rangers are coached by Evelyn  Blalock, who started the women's basketball  program at Kilgore  in 1979. Managers and  members of the championship team who were  received by President Reagan included Yolan da Brown, Vicki Dunbar, Rosalind Hodge, Pam  Hudson, Charlotte Jones, Barbara Latham,  Joey McReynolds, Wendy  Martin,  DeDe  Palmer,  Kim  Scott,  Hope Walker,  Terail  Walker, Charon Wells, and Pam Wells.  Also attending the reception were: Kilgore  Mayor Bob Barbee; Jim Campbell, Kilgore Col lege's dean of student services and assistant  vice  president;  Latane Speer,  cheerleader  sponsor and teacher at Kilgore College; and  James A. (Archie) Whitfield, director of public  relations at Kilgore College.  Mr.  Speaker,  as we  adjourn Congress  today, it is my hope that we do so in honor of  the NJCAA champions for 1987 -88-the Kil gore College Lady Rangers of Kilgore, TX.  Mary Ellen and  I were proud  to present  these  champions  to  the President of  the  United States-and we will be pulling  for a  repeat performance in 1989.  HON.

349,,100,-0.49,1128,11,Mr. CLAY.," Mr.  Speaker,  this weekend,  American  families celebrated  the  importance  of fathers. Over the past several decades, the  role of fathers has changed dramatically. No  longer are fathers the sole or solely breadwin ners with  few other  family  responsibilities.  Today's  fathers are  taking an active  role  in  caring for and raising their children.  The increased family responsibilities under taken by men have placed new demands on  them. With over 95 percent of  fathers and  almost 60 percent of mothers at work,  the  need  for one parent to attend  the needs of  newborn or seriously ill children has  intensi fied. Many companies have  recognized  the  changed needs of workers and provide tem porary job leave for family needs. Unfortunate ly, the majority of companies have yet to for mally protect their workers. Only 40 percent of  companies  provide  job  protected  parental  leaves. Many of these companies provide less  generous  leave to men,  in clear violation of  title VII of  the Civil Rights Act's prohibition  against sex discrimination.  Our society has finally begun to realize that  women should not alone bear the responsibil ity for caring  for  family members. More and  more men are taking active roles in child rear ing. It is time the United States join the rest of  the civilized world and enact a national family  policy that allows working men and women to  care for their families.  DECLARING  ""VIETNAM  VETER ANS WEEK"" IN BOLINGBROOK,  IL  HON. JACK DAVIS  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 23, 1988  ",1988
350,,100,0.393,1128,11,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, there are  many, many good reasons  for Americans to  feel proud on the Fourth of July.  I would like  to share one particular event happening in Bo lingbrook,  IL,  that  is going  to make 1988 a  very special, and very proud Fourth of July for  a group of Americans  that have  certainly  earned the right to hold their heads up high.  Mayor Roger Claar  of Bolingbrook  has  issued a proclamation declaring the week of  June 28, 1988, through July 4, 1988, as Viet nam Veterans Week  in his community. This  proclamation, though, is only a portion of the  mountain of compassion and support that the  community of Bolingbrook is offering to Viet nam veterans.  The Vietnam veterans convoy to the wall is  a group of several hundred Vietnam veterans  that are volunteering  their own  time and ef forts in a journey from one end of this great  country of ours to the other. They will start out  from Portland, OR, and travel across America  in their own vehicles to arrive at the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial Wall  in Washington, DC,  for the Fourth of July. They want to recognize  America's  celebration  of  independence  by  paying tribute to their comrades-and in many  cases-their friends, who answered the call of  their country and left their homes and families  to defend the ideals on which this country was  founded on that first Fourth of July, 212 years  ago.  When the Vietnam veterans convoy to the  wall arrives  in Bolingbrook,  I L,  they will be  greeted by a community that has gone out of  its way to welcome the travelers and show its  support. From  the police  to  the  fire depart ment,  from  local businesses and restaurants  to families and their homes,  the entire com munity of Bolingbrook is welcoming the Viet nam veterans with open and supportive arms.  I know that the efforts of Bolingbrook will be  warmly appreciated by the veterans traveling  to Washington. I hope, however, that the rest  of America will take a moment and turn their  heads toward Bolingbrook, IL. I hope that they  will open their eyes and see a community that  is extremely proud to be American-a commu nity that has the time to take a moment and  say thank you to those who clearly deserve all  of our thanks.  I would like to insert the proclamation of the  village of Bolingbrook into the CONGRESSION AL RECORD to stand as an example to the rest  of the country of the compassion and grati tude of a fine American community.  VILLAGE OF BOLINGBROOK-PROCLAMATION  VIETNAM VETERANS WEEK JUNE 28-JULY 4,  1988  Whereas,  the Viet Nam Convoy  to  the  Wall is making their 2nd annual trek from  Portland, Oregon  to Washington, D.C.  where they will participate in our Nation's  Fourth of July celebration and while en route Bolingbrook will have the opportunity  to host this convoy on June 28th and 29th;  and  Whereas,  the  Village  of Bolingbrook  wishes to encourage the rest of our nation  to follow our lead in welcoming home Viet  Nam Veterans and provide them with a time  and place to participate in the healing and  sharing experience  required  to bring our  veterans home; and  Whereas, members of the Armed Forces  of the United States who served in South east Asia during the Viet Nam Conflict per formed such service under the most trying  conditions because of the lack of domestic  support for the conflict and the nature of  the conflict itself; and  Whereas,  the courage and sacrifice of  America's  soldiers,  sailors, marines,  and  airmen during the Viet Nam era was by all  measures equal to that of their counterparts  in other wars; and  Whereas, we have never fully expressed  our thanks to those who have given a sub stantial portion of their lives at their coun try's request and in the name of the people  of the United States, and who served honor ably during this period; and  Whereas,  the  Village  of Bolingbrook  would like to dedicate this week to giving  back some peace and joy to the 6 million  men and women who fought for years  to  insure us those same rights and privileges.

355,Senate,100,0.084,1284,11,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  join  the  distinguished  Chairman of the Finance Committee  in introducing the Medicare Graduate  Nurse Training Act of 1988.  This bill is designed to addresss one  of the most serious issues our health  care system faces: a shortage of quali fied nurses. We spend a great deal of  our health dollars on research, better  technology and ensuring a high qual ity of care. Unfortunately, we seem to  forget that all of our health services  are only as good as the people who  provide them. Our services depend on  skilled, caring, and motivated people.  Nurses are perhaps the most impor tant of these people.  As a group, nurses have a depth of  experience that is unsurpassed by any  other group of health care profession als. They touch every aspect of the  field. They are the hands-on providers  of care.  However, they are undervalued as a  group by both society in general and  the health care industry specifically.  Nurses have limited opportunities for  financial and professional growth.  I  believe these are two of the most sig nificant  reasons  for  the  alarming  nurse shortage we face today.  The bill we are  introducing would  address both of these issues by offer ing expanded opportunities to nurses  in advanced clinical  training and al lowing Medicare to help pay for that  training.  Currently,  the Medicare Program  pays hospitals for their direct costs of  educating nurses as well as physicians.  These costs can include stipends, sala ries  of  supervisors,  and  classroom  space. However, under current  law,  Medicare will not pay for educational  programs operated by medical or nurs ing schools. Unfortunately,  this rule  has had the effect of limiting Medi care payment for nurse  training be cause most  nursing  education  pro grams are operated by nursing schools,  often  in universities. On  the other  hand,  graduate physician  education  generally  takes place  in hospitals residency programs.  The result is a disturbing difference  between Medicare support for gradu ate physician education which equaled  $1 billion in 1986 and its support for  graduate  nursing  education which  amounted to only $300 million in the  same year.  There are approximately 80 academ ic health centers across the country  currently providing clinical training of  graduate nurses. However, their role is  hindered because of this inequity. In  addition, hospitals are reluctant to de velop these programs because they are  not paid for the costs of providing a  clinical setting for nurse trainees.  Our legislation will change the Medi care Program by allowing graduate  nurse  training programs to be reim bursed for  the same costs currently  covered  in a  resident physician pro gram.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office estimates that the bill will cost  an additional $5 million in 1989 and  $56 million from 1989 through 1993.  The program will sunset at the end of  4 years in order for Congress to evalu ate its effectiveness. If the program is  as successful as we believe it will be,  Congress will make the program per manent.  Mr. President, promoting the profes sional growth of nurses will encourage  them to remain active in their profes sion and will equip them to practice in  an increasingly complex health care  system. Passage of this legislation will  also let the nurses of America know  that we recognize the vital role they  play in our system and that we intend  to do whatever we can to increase our  support for their work.  I urge my colleagues to join us in  sponsoring this criticallegislation.e  By Mr. SYMMS (for Mr. HELMs,  for himself, Mr. SANFORD, and  Mr. SYMMS):  S. 257 4.

356,,100,0.585,1297,11,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I  have  introduced an amendment which ex presses  the  sense  of Congress  that  the  United States must maintain  its commitment  to a 600-ship Navy. We are at a perilous  crossroads in our Nation's history as we move  from reliance on nuclear weapons for our na tional  security  to  conventional  deterrence.  Now more than ever, there is a need for the  United States and its allies to have modern,  credible, and well-equipped navies capable of  force projection worldwide.  A strong, well-balanced Navy is fundamen tal  to our interests. First, we must recognize  the realities  that geography  imposes on our  maritime strategy. Three fourths of the globe  is covered by water. To maintain our freedom  and that of our allies, we must be capable of  meeting aggression wherever  it occurs. The  waters of the world cannot become an uncon tested medium  from which our adversaries  can launch hostile attacks.  Second, until recently, we had the relative  luxury of planning on moving carrier battle groups from the Pacific to support Atlantic op erations if the need arose. We can no longer  afford  that  luxury. The  increasing presence  and activity of the Soviet Navy in the Western  Pacific has required us to revise our maritime  strategy.

The Evans ton Hospital, which  is  in my district,  treated  four of  the shooting victims and  I am very  pleased to  insert in  the RECORD a very fine  letter  that Mr. George Fisher,  the  father of  one of the children, sent to Evanston Hospital.  Mr. BERNARD LA.cHNER,  President, Evanston Hospital Corp., Evans ton, nz.  DEAR MR. LA.CHNER: This letter is to com mend your hospital for the excellent work  which enabled my daughter, Lindsay Fisher,  to  live after being shot at  the Hubbard  Woods School on May 20.  Upon  learning of  the shooting at  the  school, the Evanston Hospital notified their  crisis team of the pending arrival of the in jured. Dr. John C. Alexander was relieved  during the course of another operation to  attend to these children. Early assessment  of Lindsay's condition resulted in the selec tion of Dr. Alexander as the cardiovascular  specialist and of Dr. Stephen Sener as the  abdomen specialist.  The extent of Lindsay's bullet wound cre ated massive bleeding from multiple areas.  The blood veins in an eight year old are  very small and for Lindsay, were providing  inadequate blood transfusions. An unusual  procedure of transfusing the much needed  blood directly to Lindsay's heart, while a  major artery was being repaired, saved my  daughter's life. Lindsay proceeded to under go two more operations within 18 hours of  the first operation. These were to perform  additional closing of the wound to stop in ternal bleeding.  Dr. Joseph R. Hageman capably directed  the post-operative care. During the first five  days the Intensive Care Unit watched over  my child day and night. It was not uncom mon to see a desk pulled up to Lindsay's  door where nurses could do daily paperwork  and still maintain their vigil. The nurses on  the Pediatric floor eased her pain and made  Lindsay's hospital recovery quicker.  As a bystander thrust into a tragic situa tion, my emotional stress was severe. How ever, the medical staff's support of Lindsay  and the knowledge of their dedication to my  daughter gave me peace of mind. On many  occasions I had very emotional discussions  with doctors who provided us with colnfort  during difficult times.  It is  impossible  to overlook any of the  staff at Evanston Hospital: they all contrib uted  to Lindsay's recovery, especially  the  three doctors mentioned. Lindsay  is alive  today because of the grace of God, the pray ers of  thousands of  supporters and  the  expert staff at the Evanston Hospital. Their  actions to help my daughter will forever be  my example of excellence.  Sincerely,  GEORGE C. FISHER.  UNITED STATES AID TO  GUATEMALA  HON.

364,,100,-0.599,1518,11,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  policymakers  in  the United States have  for  years been trying to determine the proper role  our Government should play  in  promoting  peace and democracy throughout the world.  Should we give foreign aid? If so, what type of  aid and how can it be most effectively chan neled? Clearly,  there  is no simple  formula;  every  troubled nation has unique domestic  and  foreign characteristics  that define how  they can best be guided down  the  road  to  popular democracy.  A case in point is Guatemala, which recent ly asked our Government for renewed military  aid. This deserves careful consideration: The  Guatemalan military  is guilty of a variety of  human rights abuses, having all but silenced  voices of opposition throughout their country.  The military, on the other hand, maintains that  the United States assistance  is needed  to  strengthen the weak civilian government that  it defends. The United States must  now  devise a plan that will direct aid to the most  democratic purposes.  I would like to share with my colleagues a  provocative article on  this  topic written by  Caleb Rossiter and Bonnie T enneriello,  two  Washington experts on Latin America, that ap peared  in  the Christian Science Monitor on  June 9, 1988.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, June  9, 1988]  CAN U.S. MILITARY AID REALLY HELP A  CIVILIAN PRESIDENT?  <By Caleb Rossiter and Bonnie Tenneriello)  Guatemala's minister of defense, Gen.  Hector Gramajo, came to Capitol Hill re cently to lobby for renewed military aid. His  paradoxical argument was that such aid will  bolster  the country's fragile new civilian  government. The implicit message was that  Army hard-liners must be given the aid as  an  incentive  to continue  letting civilians  hold office. The same argument brought  the Army $7 million last year. Yet that aid  failed to placate undemocratic elements in  the military who recently launched an un successful uprising.  In looking at this year's request, Congress  must decide whether the aid really benefits  the civilian side of Guatemala's delicate po litical balance. This decision will have im portant  implications  for United  States  policy  toward Latin America as a whole.  Guatemala is a prime example of a regional  trend that is confounding policymakers: the  emergence of countries in which the mili tary has turned over office, but little real  power, to elected civilians.  Members eager  to support Guatemala's  transition to democracy listened carefully to  General Gramajo's request. Even  liberals  are considering supporting it, despite ongo ing abuses of human rights by the Army.  Not long ago, such a reception for the gen eral would have been unthinkable. Guate mala was perhaps the most brutal of Latin  America's military dictatorships.  Faced with a rural revolt in the mid-1970s,  the Guatemalan Army responded to Mao  Tse-tung's dictum  that  guerrillas move  through the civilian population like fish in  the sea by essentially draining the sea. The  Army killed tens of thousands of Guatema lans, erasing 440  Indian villages from the  map. Gramajo  held  important military  posts during the period. US arms aid was  banned.  What, then, has changed, Certainly not  the Army's respect for human rights. The  Army's rural massacres of the early 1980s  no longer occur, largely because the guerril la threat has been reduced to an ""annoy ance"" of fewer than 700  rebel troops, ac cording to Gramajo. Yet Amnesty Interna tional and others report numerous recent  ",1988
365,House,100,-0.304,183,17,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the Mccollum amend ment.  Right now, we all know that the gun  trade  is  absolutely booming  in  this  country. According to testimony that  we  have  received  in  the  Judiciary  Committee,  drug  gangs  are  buying  weapons in one State and transporting  them to other States, and using them  in drug-related crimes.  For example, FBI agents in Texas  have told us that that State supplied  much of the gun power for a massive  heroin ring in New York; agents have  found Virginia-bought  guns  in  the  hands of Washington, DC, drug deal ers, where gun sales have been banned  since 1977; in my own State of Ohio,  we have uncovered an organized crime  conspiracy involving crack distribution  and gun running.  Congress can confront this drug-gun  control head on, or it can avoid the  issue. A vote for the McCollum amend ment is going to unquestionably take  away  a  police weapon  for catching  criminals before they commit crimes  with handguns.  The waiting period amendment that  is already in the bill, in the antidrug  bill, represents a reasonable, effective  and straightforward plan of attack. It  would simply require that any person  who wants  to purchase a  handgun  over the counter wait 7 days so that  local authorities have the opportunity  to check that applicant's background.  The wait would also provide a cooling off period for those who are consumed  by some violent passion or a drug-in duced  rage. Waiting periods  impor tantly have a proven track record at  the State and municipal level. Califor nia screened out more than 1,500 ineli gible gun applicants in 1986, and New  Jersey stops an average of more than  500 felons each year from purchasing  guns under  its  review  system. But  State waiting periods alone are not  going to be enough. Unless we have a  national waiting period,  determined  drug pushers will still be able to buy  handguns as easily as they can cross  State lines.  The McCollum amendment addition ally failed to address at all the grow ing drug-gun connection. It would only  apply to felons, so it would not help  gun  dealers  identify other persons  barred from gun ownership by Federal  law,  including  drug  addicts,  illegal  aliens, and those adjudicated mentally  incompetent. It would require finger printing which would make the cost  absolutely  prohibitive,  estimated  in  the morning's Washington Post, and  responsibly,  I  think,  somewhere be tween $250 and $500 million. It would  not be binding and would have to in troduce whatever recommendation the  Attorney General comes forward with.  The  biggest  problem  with  the  Mccollum amendment, we do not need  more studies on this issue, which  is  what  the Mccollum  amendment  is  trying  to  substitute. According  to  members of the law enforcement com munity,  the  implementation of  the  McCollum amendment is not only just  years  away,  but  light  years  away,  which is why I believe it lost on a vote  of 22 to 12 in the Committee on the  Judiciary.  The widespread support for the lan guage  in  the  bill  underscores  its  modest nature. The provision has been  championed by every major police or ganization in the country. The Presi dent has endorsed a waiting period.  The Attorney General has gone fur ther, supporting the concept of a wait ing period and a background check at  the national level. Even the NRA has  supported this, the National Rifle As sociation,  has  supported  a waiting  period. This is the NRA's own docu ment of a few years ago where they  say ""A waiting period could help in re ducing crimes of passion and in pre venting people with criminal records  or dangerous mental illnesses from ac quiring guns."" That is the position of  the NRA and was the position of the  NRA until a few years ago.  Mr. Chairman, the provision is based  on a single premise that we cannot win  the war on crime and drugs unless we  begin to disarm drug  traffickers. By  keeping the waiting period in the anti drug  legislation we will act  to end  senseless drug violence. We will also  help to save lives.  I would urge def eat of the McColl um  amendment.  ",1988

368,House,100,-0.023,196,17,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Chairman, 6 years  ago  this winter a woman  from my  home  town, Pittsfield, MA, walked  into a  local gunshop and bought a  handgun.  She left the shop, bundled up her 9year-old son and her 5-year-old daugh ter in the car, drove to the Pittsfield  Cemetery, and shot both her children  and herself. The police  found  their  frozen bodies a few days later.  Melinda Daniels never should have  been able to leave that shop with a  handgun. A few weeks before she had  been in the psychiatric ward at the  Berkshire Medical Center. Her hus-  band and friends knew she was suici dal.  If the Brady amendment had been  in effect then, she never would have  walked out of  the gunshop with a  handgun.  Mr. Chairman,  the  7-day waiting  period does not deny a  citizen  the  right to own a handgun.  It is a modest restraint against the  injudicious sale of a handgun to some one, maybe a drug-dealing criminal or  an emotionally disturbed person, who  is either not fit to handle a handgun,  or is going to use it for criminal acts.  No one who uses handguns responsi bly wants  to see  those people with  handguns. I certainly don't. My sports men friends don't. One friend of mine  just wrote to me and said, ""Sil, I've  been a member of the NRA for almost  40 years, but NRA or no NRA, we need  a nationwide waiting period for hand gun purchases. The frontier days have  been over for a long time.""  Seven days is not a long time to wait,  but it may be  time enough  to keep  someone from impulsively buying and  using a handgun. Seven days might  have saved the lives of Melinda Dan iels and her children. Seven days can  help to avoid a future tragedy.  I'm going to vote to keep the Brady  amendment part of the drug bill, and I  ask my friends to support it as well.  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman,  may I  inquire as to the time remain ing?

370,,100,0.227,235,17,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to  share with my colleagues some convincing  facts about the administration's deep commit ment to the war on drugs. The White House  recently  released a detailed  report entitled  ""The Reagan Record on  the Crusade  for a  Drug-Free America"" which presents an array  of  impressive  facts concerning  the accom plishments of  the administration during  the  past 7 years in  its battle against illegal sub stances, both domestically and internationally.  While more must be done if America is to  emerge victorious in  the war on drugs,  I be lieve  that  the administration has done  far  more than past administrations in committing  significant resources to antidrug programs as  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  well as calling the attention of the American  people  to  the drug menace  in our society.  While critics of  the administration have de bunked our President's drug programs,  the  basic statistics reveal  that  the White House  has fought a valiant war on drugs in America.  While  the  rhetorical guns of  the Democrats  are blazing, our Chief Executive is interested  in a sound drug policy, not drug politics. We  owe President Reagan our sincere thanks for  his brave efforts in this important crusade.  He has truly ""run up the battle flag"" in this  war which America cannot afford to lose.  I have extracted some of the highlights and  the more important segments of this report for  my colleagues in the Congress.  THE REAGAN RECORD ON THE NATIONAL  CRUSADE FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA  SUMMARY STATEMENT  Illegal drug use  is beginning to decline;  no-nonsense  judges are enforcing stricter  penalties  for  drug  dealers;  and  record  amounts of  illegal drugs are being seized.  Most importantly, the American people are  changing the way they think about illegal  drugs and drug use. Today, public opposi tion  to  illegal drugs  is growing stronger.  America is increasingly less tolerant of ille gal drugs and drug users. These are the keys  to a drug-free America.  HIGHLIGHTS  Drug Use Declines.-As knowledge about  drugs has increased, popular attitudes about  illegal drug use are beginning to change and  drug use has started to decline during the  1980s. For example, current use of cocaine  among high school seniors dropped by one third in 1987 to the lowest level since 1978.  Daily use of marijuana among  these stu dents dropped from one in nine high school  seniors in 1979 to one in 30 in 1987.  Enforcement Increases.-The number of  Federal drug investigators more than dou bled and the number of Federal drug pros ecutors  increased  four-fold between 1980  and 1988. By FY 1987, arrests by the Drug  Enforcement Agency of  the most serious  drug offenders had  increased 175 percent  over 1983.  Sentences Get Tougher.-The  average  sentence for those convicted of drug law vio lations increased from 51 months in 1979 to  73 months in 1987.  The Budget Triples.-Total outlays  for  Federal drug programs have  tripled since  President Reagan took office. In FY 1988,  the total Federal anti-drug budget was $3.3  billion, up from $1.1 billion in FY 1981. The  President's FY 1989 budget called for a 15  percent increase in Federal outlays to sup port the overall drug effort.  More Drugs Interdicted and Seized.-As a  result  of  Federal  enforcement  efforts,  140,000 pounds of cocaine were seized in FY  1987. Some 2.2 million pounds of marijuana  and 1,400 pounds of heroin were also taken  into Federal custody.  The Military Enlists.-This Administra tion was the first to declare illegal drugs a  threat to national security and the first to  implement a change in the law allowing the  Department of Defense <DOD>  to support  other Federal drug-law enforcement efforts.  By  1987, DOD  forces  spent more  than  16,000 hours in the air and provided 2,512  ship days searching for drug smugglers.  Federal  Coordination  Enhanced.-This  Administration has greatly enhanced  the  coordination among Federal, state, and local  campaigns against illicit drugs; has stepped  up  the use of our  intelligence  agencies  24115  the first  to use  the  Investigation  <FBI>  against drugs; and  is  Federal Bureau  of  against drug dealers.  More Funds for Drug Abuse Prevention. Federal outlays for drug abuse prevention  increased four-fold between FY 1981 and  FY 1988, from $117 million to $454 million.  The President has requested $574 million  for drug abuse prevention in FY 1989, an  additional 15 percent increase.  Prevention Education.-To help parents,  teachers and others in the community, the  Federal Government  collects  information  on drug and alcohol use and promotes pro grams  that effectively combat  illicit drug  use. One example: The Education Depart ment has distributed 1.9 million copies of a  handbook  offering  a  12-point  plan  to  achieve schools free of illegal drugs.  Treatment.-In FY 1988, the Federal Gov ernment provided the states $283 million in  grants for drug abuse treatment and spent  $370 million overall in this important area.  The Federal Government  is also working  closely with state and local governments to  develop effective treatment approaches to  reduce the demand for illicit drugs as well  as  the  transmission of AIDS by IV drug  users.  Drug-Free Military.-The Armed Forces  have been testing for drugs since 1971. Re ported drug use in the military has declined  67 percent since 1980.  THE RECORD  The President's Leadership in Stopping  fllegal Drugs  For seven years, the Reagan Administra tion has pursued a comprehensive anti-drug  strategy  that  is more  extensive,  better  funded,  and more effectively coordinated  than any Federal anti-drug or anti-crime  initiative in our nation's history.  The Administration's strategy emphasizes  international  cooperation,  interdiction,  criminal  investigations and other enforce ment programs,  treatment and prevention  efforts and  research. Today, virtually all  Americans acknowledge that such a compre hensive strategy is the best approach.  In 1986, the President selected these addi tional goals as the steps toward a drug-free  America:  1. Drug-free workplaces for all Americans.  2. Drug-free schools, from elementary to  university.  3. Expanded treatment for drug users.  4.  Improved international cooperation to  cut off the production and transportation of  illegal drugs.  5. Strengthened drug  law enforcement,  using all of our available resources to stop  drug traffickers.  6. Increased public awareness and preven tion.  The Reagan Administration has vigorous ly  pursued  these  goals, marking many  ""firsts"" in the history of the national cru sade against drug use. For example,  the  Reagan Administration was the first in his tory to:  Acknowledge and declare  threat to national security;  Implement a change in Federal law that  allows  the DOD  to support Federal drug  laws;  Send troops and equipment abroad to de stroy drug production facilities in another  country;  Mandate U.S. intelligence agencies to sup port the anti-drug battle;  Call upon the FBI to investigate drug law  violations;  illegal drugs a  ",1988

For over 75 years,  the Parish of Our Lady  Queen of Martyrs has been a significant part  of the Forest Hills community. As an instutition  with  thousands  of  faithful members,  the  church has contributed  immeasurably  to  the  development of its community over the years  and has given stability, permanence and a  sense of tradition to this entire vicinity.  This church is more than just an edifice of  stone and granite.  It represents the genera tions of devoted people who have played an  invaluable role in the life of the neighborhood.  To celebrate  the anniversary of  this  fine  church many activities, including concerts and  special masses, have taken place. The parish  is also planning a dinner dance to be held on  October 28.  This outstanding parish has contributed  to  improving the Forest Hills community through  many educational and social programs such  as: Adult Education, Caregivers, Community  Police  Program,  high  school  equivalency  classes, Leisure Programs for the elderly, and  Nar-anon Drug Programs and other support  groups. The Parish also participates in Catho lic charities organization, and has a  thriving  choir.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Many people deserve credit for the magnifi cant work  that  takes place at  the Parish of  Our Lady Queen of Martyrs. I commend some  of the important people who play vital roles in  keeping  the parish at  the  forefront of  the  Forest Hills area. These include pastor emeri tus Rev.  Joseph P. Denning; Rev. Msgr.  Thomas J. Gradilone; associate pastors Rev.  Eugene Milmoe  and  Rev.  James Massa.  Other  important  leaders  include: Resident  Rev. Barnabus Wang,  resident Rev.  Louis  Resch, and resident Msgr. Michael J. Dempsy;  and  the deacons, Rev. John Z. Rogan and  Rev.  Thomas R. McCarthy. The  excellent  choir is led by a fine organist, Richard Pretzer.  I am sure my colleagues  join me  in con gratulating the members of Our Lady Queen  of Martyrs Parish on  this historic occasion,  thanking them for their essential contributions  to  the community, and wishing  them all  the  best in the future.

372,Senate,100,0.261,352,17,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor the 30th anniversary  of the De Paul Hospital in Milwaukee.  Since 1958, De Paul has provided qual ity care for countless men and women  suffering from alcoholism and other  afflictions.  The De Paul Hospital-under  the  leadership of Mr. A. Bela Marotti-has  been a source of pride to the Milwau kee  community. Wisconsinites  take  care of each other, and De Paul  is  leading the way by example.  I ask that a brief history of the De  Paul  facility  be  included  in  the  RECORD.  The information follows:  DE PAUL REHABILITATION HOSPITAL  Founded by A. Bela Maroti in 1958, De  Paul Health Corporation originated as a  halfway house for homeless men. Within a  year the home was legally incorporated as  St. Vincent de Paul Men's Home, Inc.  By 1961, De Paul expanded to meet the  medical, psychological, spiritual, social and  vocational needs of the men at the ""home"",  many of whom were alcoholics.  In August 1963, De Paul received approval  from the Wisconsin State Board of Health  for operation of a hospital unit to provide  the specialized medical care needed by the  acute alcoholic. The following year De Paul  was approved for membership by the Ameri can Hospital Association as a specialty hos pital.  Since then, De Paul has continued to grow  and expand to meet the needs of all people  living  in Milwaukee and  throughout  the  State of Wisconsin.

373,House,100,-0.348,378,17,Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER.," Madam  Speaker, I am pleased that Congress  has  designated  today  as  ""National  POW /MIA Recognition Day."" This  day will serve to honor those who were  captured in war and  increase public  awareness of the many American serv icemen still unaccounted for overseas.  We must  remember  the  sacrifices  made by these American heroes not  only on this day of national recogni tion, but every day. Let us give thanks  to those who fought bravely to defend  the freedoms that we so often take for  granted.  Today I would like to salute John C.  Rosano, a World War II veteran and  POW from Long Island, NY, to whom  I awarded the POW medal on July 30,  1988. I am proud to present this Amer ican hero in Congress. Throughout his  service in Europe during World War  II, Mr. Rosano exhibited true bravery  in the face of constant danger and was  willing  to  sacrifice his  life  to help  others.  Mr. Rosano  enlisted  in  the U.S.  Army in April 1943. After basic train ing, he volunteered for the 82d Air borne and completed jump training at  Fort Benning, GA. Soon after, he was  sent overseas, where he participated in  the Sicily campaign and the D-Day in vasion of Normandy. When  jumping  behind enemy lines, as Mr. Rosano did  in Normandy, he was completely on  his own. There were many days and  nights of the traumatic experience of  hand-to-hand combat,  in which Mr.  Rosano had to look ~to the eyes of  the men he was forced to kill.  Mr. Rosano was captured in France  by German soldiers on August 9, 1944.  They marched him toward Germany,  picking up about 1,000 other POW's  along the way. He watched his friends  being shot before a German  firing  squad.  Subsequently,  his  life was  spared due to a timely allied bombing  raid. He was locked in a boxcar with 60  men for 30 days, where there was no  ventilation, no room to lay down, and  rats which ate the remains of those  who died of starvation.  In October 1944, Mr. Rosano and his  fellow POW's began a ""death march""  to Germany. Those who survived the  march were forced to work 16 hours a  day building barracks and air  raid  shelters. Stationed 1 mile from a rail road troop station, Mr. Rosano's camp  was bombed for at least 6 hours every  night. That winter, they were forced  to sleep on a cold cement floor with no  winter clothing, and were fed only a  slice of bread and a small portion of  potato soup daily. In 9 months, Mr.  Rosano lost 70 pounds. One night, the  POW's were  so  hungry  that Mr.  Rosano, knowing he would be severely  punished if caught, crawled under a  barbed wire fence to take Red Cross  packages  to his men. While  this al lowed his  fell ow PO W's to eat, Mr.  Rosano was caught and placed for 2  weeks in a hole 5 feet long, 3 feet wide,  and 4 feet high.  On January 15, 1945, there was an  air raid by allied bombers on Mr. Ro sano's POW camp. The air raid shelter  was  shared  by  both  POW's  and  German civilians. During the raid, a  German mother dropped her two chil dren while running to the shelter. Ex hibiting great courage and compas sion, Mr. Rosano ran back  into  the  bombing and rescued the two children.  Just as he  returned  to  the shelter,  however, it received a direct hit. Mr.  Rosano and four other PO W's were  buried alive for 5 days. During this in cident, Mr. Rosano sustained physical  injury  that has  plagued him  ever  since.  In May 1945, the POW's were liber ated by the 10th Army Division. Mr.  Rosano was sent to Lake Placid, NY,  and then Fort Lee, VA, to recuperate.  Doctors recognized that he had sus tained serious and debilitating injury,  but were unable to diagnose it. It was  only in 1972 that he was diagnosed as  having an organic brain  syndrome.  While Mr. Rosano frequently received  medical treatment at the VA North port Hospital on Long Island, his wife  Lucy and his children Linda, Lori, and  John have all helped to care for him  over the years.  Mr. Rosano  received  the following  honors for his distinguished military  service: The European-African-Middle  Eastern Campaign Medal,  the Good  Conduct Medal, the World War II Vic tory Medal,  the Combat  Infantry  Badge, the Sharp Shooting Medal, the  Bronze Star, with six smaller bronze  stars for his six jumps behind enemy  lines,  and  the Conspicuous Service  Cross. Recently, I had the honor of  presenting Mr. Rosano with the POW  Medal.  Madam Speaker, let us devote this  day to honoring John Rosano and all  the POW's and MIA's who have sacri ficed so much in the defense of our  great Nation.  0 1100  POW-MIA RECOGNITION DAY  <Mr. YOUNG of Florida asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)

I will remember him with  warmth and hope to see him again in the near  future.  Since 1983 when Dr. Chien came to Wash ington as Taiwan's chief representative to the  United States and I began my service in Con gress, Dr. Chien worked hard  to make sure  that his Government's views were heard in the  Halls of Congress and  the views of my col leagues and I were heard in Taipei. During his  tenure here,  the already close  ties between  the citizens of our  two  respective countries  were strengthened by Taiwan's  tremendous  economic growth and progress on political lib eralization and human rights.  I have been to the Republic of China twice.  Although the second time I arrived in Taiwan  was less than a year after my first visit, I was  surprised  to see  the visible changes  in  the  landscape of Taipei and its suburbs. The eco nomic growth and prosperity of Taiwan has  brought previously unimagined opportunities  for its citizens. At the same time, growth has  brought greater responsibility for all  levels of  Government in Taiwan. The National Govern ment and local governments are being called  upon to provide better urban planning, control  the sources of pollution, extend  consumer  protection, and provide other services.  Another responsibility of Government made  even more important by growing prosperity is  expanding the right of the citizens of the Re public of China to fully participate in political  institutions that fully reflect  the new political  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  era that Taiwan has entered. Like other Asian  countries, basic political institutions may need  to be revised.  Independent judicial authorities  should be solidified. Political assembly without  violence should be encouraged. Finally, politi cal stability is best ensured through the selec tion of elected national representatives rather  than appointed representatives.  Based on my experience of working with  able and  thoughtful  individuals such as Dr.  Chien, I believe the Republic of China is up to  the task ahead. In his new position, Dr. Chien  will be helping to lead the continuing political  and economic development of Taiwan.  It has  been a privilege  to work with him here  in  Washington. I wish him and his family the best  of good health, happiness and success as  they meet new challenges.  LARRY  W.

It is  the  rare occasion when one meeting, when  one person has an overwhelming effect on a  member. It happened to me Mr. Speaker this  week when  I met a constituent of mine who  has been named the Department of Interior's  most outstanding handicapped Federal em ployee for 1988. Thirty years ago, Larry Marsh  was struck by a drunk driver. He lost both of  his  legs. He has overcome his disability by  succeeding  in a world set up  for  the able  bodied. Mr. Marsh teaches at an elementary  school in Bloomfield, NM. He is an outstand ing educator and a tremendous inspiration for  those of us fortunate enough to meet him.  I  would  like to  insert into the RECORD a letter  written by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel ex plaining Mr. Marsh's background and accom plishments.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,  OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY,  Washington, DC.  INTERIOR'S OUTSTANDING HANDICAPPED FED ERAL  EMPLOYEE  FOR  1988-LARRY W.  MARSH, BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS  Larry Marsh, a teacher with the Bureau  of Indian Affairs since 1966, is the Depart ment's selection as its Outstanding Handi capped Federal Employee of the Year. In  1958, shortly after graduating from high  school, Mr. Marsh was involved in an acci dent which subsequently resulted in a high  thigh double amputation. Determined  to  overcome his handicap, he learned to walk  on artificial legs with the aid of a cane and  to drive a car with hand controls. Through out the years, Mr. Marsh has voluntarily  provided support and assistance to numer ous accident victims who have lost limbs. He  has spent many hours encouraging  these  people and served as proof that their future  was not as bleak as it might appear. Mr.  Marsh has never allowed his handicap to  interfere with his commitment to teaching  and is considered one of the most talented  24349  and outstanding educators in the Bureau.  He has the rare gift of installing in students  the desire and motivation to learn.

I be lieve this agreement will benefit New  England and the Nation in expanding  our trading relationship with our larg est trading partner, Canada. Connecti cut has approximately $2 billion of  trade with Canada which will be en hanced by the elimination of tariffs  between our two countries. Removing  the large number of trade barriers and  discriminatory  practices  that  have  been erected can only enhance  the  flow of trade and allow our nations to  grow.  The scope of the Free-Trade Agree ment  is  impressive.  Canada  will  expand its Government procurement  markets to United States businesses.  American financial services and invest ments  in Canada will be given  far  greater opportunities under the agree ment. Future trade disputes will be re solved by a new Binational Commis sion which will hopefully reduce the  frictions  we  have  experienced  in  recent years.

383,House,100,0.27,768,17,Mr. TAUKE.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support  H.R. 5155, the Protection and Advoca cy for the Mentally Ill Individuals Act  of 1988. This legislation will reauthor ize, with several needed improvements,  the existing protection and advocacy  program for the mentally ill. This pro gram was  initiated  in  under  Public Law 99-319 to ensure that the  rights of the mentally ill are protected  while they are inpatients or residents  in treatment facilities. This program  distributes funds through the already  established protection and advocacy  systems set up under the Developmen tal Disabilities Act.  Under  Public Law  these  agencies were given the authority to  investigate incidents of abuse and ne glect to the mentally ill when they are  residents of  treatment facilities and  for 90 days after discharge. These sys tems are responsible for pursuing the  appropriate legal, administrative, and  other remedies for  these individuals.  H.R. 5155 strengthens the current pro gram with some new provisions. One  of  these provides protection  to  the  mentally ill while being transported to  a treatment facility and when tempo rarily detained in a municipal deten tion facility. Another requires that the  governing boards shall have  the re sponsibility for developing the annual  priorities together with the advisory  council.  This  improved  legislation  should  better serve our mentally ill citizens.  This bill represents a modest effort to  try  to assist  the States  in helping  those individuals in society least able  to help  themselves.  I  know  in my  home State of Iowa, the program has  proven to be very effective and benefi cial.  Iowa's  Protection  and  Advocacy  System opened a total of 16 investiga tions in fiscal year 1987, the first full  year of the program. Already this year  Iowa's program has opened 22 cases,  and my State protection and advocacy  officers  indicate  that the 1988  total  may be double that of 1987. This is but  one indication of the need for this pro gram.  I also wish to stress the importance  of the provisions allowing protection  and advocacy services to follow the in dividual when he or she is deinstitu tionalized. These provisions help  to  ensure that the individual receives ap propriate  community-based  services.  As we are very much aware in our ef forts to address the serious problem of  homelessness, many of our Nation's  homeless are mentally ill  individuals  who  have  been  deinstitutionalized  without assurances that they will  in  fact receive the community-based serv ices they need.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  ",1988

We have to do everything we possibly  can to assure the American public that  we  are concerned over  their safety,  and we are doing all we can to make  flying even safer.  What this resolution says is that we  do not want  to see a  repeat of the  Aloha Airlines tragedy, and we believe  it is possible to prevent it. We think  the time to study the structural integ rity of aircraft  is before  they come  apart in flight-not after.

386,House,100,-0.387,807,17,Mr. UDALL.," It would provide for the es tablishment of a new unit of the Na tional Park System to be located on  lands within the Zuni Reservation in  western New Mexico.  The Zuni Reservation is an area of  great  historic  and  cultural  signifi cance, with a wealth of archeological  and other resources that rivals many  other parts of the Nation. It is also the  homeland of the Zuni people, whose  occupation of this area can be traced  back at least to 1540, and whose ances tors were  in  the area even earlier.  Thus, the Zuni area offers a remarka ble concentration of past and present  cultural values.  As reported by the Interior Commit tee, H.R. 4182 would lay the foundation for a mutually beneficial coopera tive relationship between the National  Park Service and the Zuni people that  would further the sound management  of  the values and resources of  this  area and assist the efforts of the Zuni  people to protect their heritage while  sharing better understanding  of  it  with other people everywhere.  The bill was worked out  through  consultations  among  the  committee  staff, the Park Service, and the Zuni  Tribe, and  it  includes a number of  common elements in the version of the  legislation that has been favorably re ported by the Senate's Select Commit tee on Indian Affairs.  Under the bill, the Zuni Tribe would  have 1 year after enactment to offer  to the Secretary of the Interior a lease  of Zuni trust lands for the purposes of  establishment of the park. The Secre tary would have to accept the lease if  it met the requirements of the bill that is, that it was for a term of at  least 99 years, would not require pay ment of rent, included lands the Direc tor of  the Park Service determined  necessary and adequate for the pur poses of the park, and was not incon sistent with the bill. Upon acceptance  the Secretary would publish a notice  in the Federal Register which would  trigger the other provisions of the bill  and which would constitute the formal  establishment of the park.  Under the bill, once the park was es tablished, additional Zuni lands could  be added to it if the tribe offered to  lease  those  additional  lands  under  similar terms and the Secretary agreed  to accept such a lease-in other words,  once the park is established, additions  to it could be made but only by the  mutual consent of the tribe and the  Secretary.  The bill also includes a number of  other provisions relating to the man agement of the park after its estab lishment, which have been carefully  shaped to address the particular cir cumstances of this area and the new  relationship which we anticipate be tween the Zuni Tribe and the National  Park Service.  Finally,  the bill would amend the  legislation passed last year which pro vided  for designation of a vehicular  tour route linking a number of Nation al Park System units in New Mexico  and Arizona. The  substitute would  rename  that  link  as  the  ""Masau  Route""  rather  than  the  ""Masau  Trail."" This would be consistent with  the nomenclature the Interior Com mittee has  subsequently  used with  other, similar designations. It would  also lessen the chance of any confu sion between such designations and  the designation of units of the Nation al Trails System, which for the most  part includes unroaded trails.

393,,100,-0.402,846,17,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as  our Taiwanese  friends celebrate  their 77th  birthday on October 10 of this year, we in the  U.S. Congress wish  to assure  them  that we  applaud their political reforms and appreciate  their efforts to try to reduce their trade surplus  with us. We hope to work out our differences  with  them satisfactorily, and  I am confident  that our long history of friendship and coop eration will allow us to accomplish that goal.  As a recent publication pointed out, Taiwan  has achieved the greatest economic success  of all  the newly industrialized countries. The  economy has won  remarkable  real growth  rates, hitting 11 percent last year. Equally im portant is the fact that this economic success  is being shared throughout its society. Observ ers expect Taiwan  to soon make  the  leap  from a newly industrialized country to a fully  developed economy.  Equally encouraging  is the  liberalization of  the nation's political system that has provided  for a broader participation in the political proc ess. The dedication to constitutional democra cy is clear, and  I believe it is important that  Taiwan's allies in this country understand and  applaud this progress.  Although  there has been criticism of Tai wan's economic policies,  it  is  important  for  Americans to note that Taiwan  is rapidly be coming an  important economy.  In  this  first  quarter of 1987, United States imports soared  136 percent, and Taiwan is now the fifth larg est market  for United States  farm products,  and the largest on a per capita basis.  Helping this import boom, of course, is the  more equitable distribution of  income-not  through government  intervention, but by  the  flourishing  free enterprise  system-and  the  decision by the government to allow the New  Taiwan dollar to float on  the world currency  market.  Mr. Speaker, I think I can speak on behalf  of all my colleagues when I say that I would  like our Taiwanese friends and allies to know  ",1988

397,,100,-0.245,1171,17,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to pay tribute to a great lady who  resides in the Eighth Congressional District oi  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Tennessee, but whose influence is felt all over  our great State.  Mrs. Carrie Pentecost is the 93-year-old ma triarch of one of Tennessee's most interesting  political families.  I would  like to have the at tached article, which appeared recently in the  Dresden Enterprise,  included  in  so that others can share the many interesting  tales Mrs. Pentecost relates about her child hood and  into her adult years. Needless  to  say, she has experienced many  things and  seen many changes  in her world during  the  last 93 years and  I think my colleagues will  enjoy the article as much as I did.  the RECORD  MRS. CARRIE: MATRIARCH OF TENNESSEE  POLITICAL CLAN  <By Jim Dumas)  Carrie Pentecost  is a non-assuming and  charming  93-year-old  lady whom  some  people believe to be the matriarch of one of  Tennessee's most interesting political fami lies.  But as a non-yielding Democrat, her role  in shaping the political structure of modem  local and state politics has been timely and  behind the scenes. While her father was a  former high sheriff of Weakley County, and  late husband Rev. Cayce Pentecost a  re spected County Clerk and judge in Weakley  County, her only  son Cayce moved  the  family political niche a step further by win ning first the office of state representative  and then several state-wide runs for public  service commissioner.  Even Gov. Ned Ray McWherter would  become a viable part of Mrs. Carrie's world  as ruler of the state House of Representa tives. But she will be the first to say that  cousin Ned's election as governor of  the  state would have been thought next to im possible when the governor was growing up  in Palmersville and Dresden.  Albert Gore Sr., related to the Pentecosts  through marriage to Pauline LaFon, carried  the dynasty outside of Tennessee borders by  winning first a seat in Congress-then U.S.  Senate-and once considering the vice presi dency of the United States.  Then for several months last year and this  year, Mrs. Carr~'s political kin flirted seri ously with the thought of the White House  as Albert Gore  Jr. <now U.S.  Senator)  became a major candidate for  the Demo cratic nomination for president. He failed,  but carried Super Tuesday and his close  hand campaigning left its mark for future  years.  Confidence has certainly not been lacking  in the life of the Pentecost family, at least  of all, not in Mrs. Carrie. ""I think back to a  long time ago when I was a young student  in  school  and wore  a  cape one day.  I  thought I was so pretty and the center of  attention-capes were so stylish then.""  She is  the daughter of Simpson LaFon,  and enjoyed her first years on a farm near  Palmersville. The good years and closeness  of family are among the lasting qualities,  and even during the uncertain times of the  Great Depression,  the LaFon family was  better off than most of their city brethren  because  there was food  to provide steady  diets. Also  standing out-but  on  lesser  tone-was long hours in the tobacco fields,  and to this day Mrs. Carrie frowns when re membering that her job was to worm and  sucker the plants.  ""Palmersville was a busy, bustling place in  those days and we never had to go  into  Dresden because the town had two or three  dry goods, a drug store, post office, bank  and grocery store . . . Still when we wanted  25051  to buy good clothes and shoes, we took the  horse and buggy or team and wagon over to  Cottage Grove. Rainey Brothers Store had  anything you needed in fashions.""  Mrs. Carrie walked at  least 2 miles  to  school at Palmersville and recalls that her  first teachers included Monte and Chesley  Golston. Even when she passed a  special  test to gain a teaching certificate after com pleting  high  school,  one  thing  hadn't  changed. She  still walked  two miles  to  school. She  taught  in old Webb School  when the principal was Theron Kemp, earn ing $30 a month.  ""There were some good one room or two  room schools in the county then, recalled  Mrs. Pentecost. Palmersville even had a col lege in those days called Mina Normal Col lege, and many of the students boarded at  homes in the community.""  She and Cayce Pentecost Sr. were married  in 1915. ""I'll never forget it, and we took the  vows from Brother J.J. Kirkland, a Primi tive Baptist preacher, while seated  in a  buggy the whole time.""  ""Our honeymoon was  in going back  to  Cayce's home where we had a party and lots  of friends came over.""  In 1927, the couple moved to Dresden and  the Pentecost-LaFon political union grew  more steadfast as Mr. Pentecost was elected  County Court Clerk. Mrs. Carrie worked as  deputy clerk during the years that her hus band served as clerk. Judge Pentecost went  on to be a public servant for 24 years. Other  members of the family-in addition to the  junior Pentecost and Simpson LaFon-who  were  elected  to  political office  included  Whit LaFon, ex-sheriff and currently circuit  judge in Madison County.  ""It was good  little political  fun, but  I  never had any urge to run for any office  myself-we just let our men folks-the ones  most interested, take care of all that. Its  still going on, and we are so proud of Al  Gore Jr. too.''  Mrs. Carrie was born in 1895 while Presi dent  Grover  Cleveland  was  half-way  through his second  term, nevertheless,  it  was two people named Roosevelt-one a Re publican-who would make the first impres sion on her. ""Teddy Roosevelt is the first  president I can really remember. But FDR  <F.D. Roosevelt) was I think the greatest of  them all."" Ironically,  the Stephensons on  Mrs. Carrie's mothers side were Republi cans. ""My mother was a Democrat, and I  still don't know whether she was pressured  into becoming one after she met my father,  or just switched on her own.""  ""While there are some things I wouldn't  want  to go  through again. Walking  two  miles to school is one of them. I wouldn't  take anything for the life we had then.""  ""We were as poor as Jobe's turkey, and I  took many a nap under those large tobacco  plants while working through another day.''  But  for an occasional square dance at  Cane Creek, work was the leading recrea tion for the young folks in the mid 1900's  and 1920's. One person who Mrs. Carrie  looked forward to seeing each morning was  the rural mail carrier, Luther Brann.

398,,100,0.371,1184,17,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  rise  today  to extend my congratulations  to  Mrs. Yvonne Greenleaf, of Bakersfield, who  has been named ""Nurse of the Year"" by the  Kern County Registered Nurses' Society.  This is fine and fitting tribute for Mrs. Green leaf from her colleagues inasmuch as she was  selected from a large field of candidates and  nominated by  local organizations and private  citizens. With  Mrs.  Greenleaf's  extensive  background  in nursing, her  long  record of  achievements, and most of all, her kindness  and compassion  in  tending  to suffering pa tients on her rounds,  I know that this honor  will be a source of pride for her, and an inspi ration to her colleagues.  The ""Nurse of the Year"" award is a testa ment to the dedicated work of nurses in Kern  County and throughout the State of California  and  I am proud  to  recognize Mrs. Yvonne  Greenleaf today.  SUMMIT HOTEL-120TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON. MATTHEW J. RINALDO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 1988  ",1988
399,,100,0.023,1184,17,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Speaker, on October 14,  Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey will be  awarded the Summit Hotel's Community Serv ice Award for his leadership in promoting pride  in New Jersey and the economic revitilization  of our State. One of the things that Governor  Kean's administration has enthusiastically sup ported is historic site preservation and restora tion.  The Summit Hotel  is part of  that colonial  history of New Jersey, and which Governor  Kean will celebrate. Famous as a gracious  country  resort  area,  New  Yorkers  once  flocked to Summit for its beautiful rural charm  and atmosphere. At  the heart of this setting  was the Blackburn House, an elegant country  resort. Horses and buggies carried hotel pa trons and  their servants from nearby Lacka wanna Railroad Station  to  the Blackburn  House. It helped Summit to achieve a reputa tion early in this century as a Newport of New  Jersey.  In 1929, as a result of the growing number  of visitors  to Summit,  the present Summit  Hotel was erected on the site of the original  Blackburn House. Expert European craftsmen  were employed to fashion the intricate exterior  Tudor mansion  brickwork  and  the  interior  vaulted beamed ceilings and elaborate and  exquisite Tudor details. It is now listed in the  New Jersey Historic Preservation Sites Inven tory and Union County  Inventory of Historic  Sites.  The  new  Summit Suburban Hotel was  opened  just months before  the 1929 stock  market crash. Many wealthy  residents who  lost their homes and estates moved  in with  their servants and called the hotel their home.  The Summit Suburban Hotel continued as  the home of a celebrated life style, frequented  by prominent public officials and celebrities,  drawn by the hotel's park-like setting and con venient proximity to cultural and  recreational  attractions,  historic downtown Summit  and  easy access to Manhattan.  The Summit Suburban  thrived unchanged  until  1984 when  it was  acquired  by new  owners and  renamed  the Summit Hotel.  In  1986, a comprehensive renovation took place.  Over $10 million was  spent  to  thoroughly  modernize and upgrade  the hotel  to world  class status and capture the look and feel of  timeless European elegance.  Today,  the Summit Hotel  stands  as  a  symbol of the distinguished and colorful histo ry of Summit as well as the home of gracious  hospitality,  fine continental cuisine and Euro pean ambience.  SUPPORT OF H.R. 2461, FOR THE  RELIEF  OF  MILENA  AND  BOZENA MESIN  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 1988  ",1988
400,,100,0.372,1197,17,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker,  going  to make my  argument  briefly on procedural grounds.  This is the 23d time in this Congress  we have been hit with a self-executing  rule. That is nearly 16 percent of all  rules, which has got to be an alltime  record.  Self-executing  rules  are  a  sham.  They represent a continuing abuse of  procedures which, if allowed to contin ue, means that we will have fewer and  fewer opportunities  to consider and  amend legislation on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, most polls out there  are showing that respect for the Con gress as an institution has been drop ping rapidly  in the past 2 years.  Is  there any wonder?  What would the framers of our Con stitution say about the way this House  is being run?  Here we are celebrating the bicen tennial of our Constitution,  the em bodiment of democratic principles, and  we have a Congress running more in  the direction of the old English mon archy. The first seven specific com plaints made against George III in the  Declaration of Independence concern  his disregard or abuse or neglect of  legislative procedure. Boy, he would  feel right at home in this House.  Mr. Speaker, the textile bill which  this rule seeks  to ram through  is a  considerably  different  version  from  that which  originally  passed  the  House. When the House and Senate  bills differ, the normal procedure is to  send them to conference and iron out  those differences, and that is the only  proper way  to go on a controversial  bill such as this.  Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, this  is  just another step. The Congress,  coming  to  an  early  conclusion,  a  number of things pending over in the  other body; what is going to happen  on minimum wage? What is going to  happen on parental  leave? Are we  going  to have  the  same  treatment  when we have an opportunity in this  body to work our will as we did on the  drug bill and made a real substantial  contribution to helping shape that leg islation?  Mr. Speaker, that is what our role  ought to be in this House. Those of  my colleagues, even those who on sub stantive grounds supported textile legislation  in  the past, ought  to vote  against  it for no other reason,  than  what is being done to us with respect  to the rules. This applies particularly  to those on my side of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote against this self-executing rule.  ",1988
401,,100,-0.215,1197,17,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from North  Carolina CMr. HEFNER],  for  the pur poses of debate only.  ",1988
402,,100,-0.264,1197,17,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  once again in support of a bill which  has been fought long and hard in this  body. This Congress and the adminis tration has acknowledged that a level  playing field is absolutely necessary if  we  are  to  compete  successfully  in  international markets by enacting the  general trade bill. It is now time  to  make sure that the same level field is  afforded to the textile industry. H.R.  1154 must be passed and signed by the  President.  There are those that say this is a  protectionist measure. Nothing could  be further from  the truth. This bill  does not roll back imports of textile  and apparel: It does establish global  quotas and provides for annual growth  rates.  This is what this administration had  said it would consider as a method for  dealing with the flood of imports into  this country.  In a  letter  to  former  Congressman Carroll Campbell in Jan uary of 1980, then candidate Reagan  stated that import growth might be  tied  to domestic market growth and  that global quotas might also be used.  Since 1980, the trend in imports has  grown many times faster than the do mestic market. And I say to our friend  who  talks  about  declining  imports  from July of 1987 that new domestic  orders for textiles has declined by 9  percent in real terms. The decline in  imports is clearly market related and  not to any quota restrictions.  With  the growth  rate allowed by  this bill 1989  imports would be  in creased  by  700-million-square-yard  equivalents over this year's pace of im ports. This  is compared with a U.S.  market that grows  less than 400,000  square yard equivalents a year.  One further point, Mr. Speaker. We  ought to pass and the President ought  to sign this textile trade bill on nation al security grounds alone. The textile  industry ranks second only to the steel  industry in importance to our national  security. A strong viable textile indus try is exceedingly important to the in dustrial base of our country and to our  national security.  ",1988
403,,100,0.091,1197,17,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of this rule which is  vital  trade  relief  legislation  for our  textile, apparel, and footwear  indus tries.  For years, foreign footwear and tex tile products have been the Hurricane  Gilbert of  imports,  laying waste  to  hundreds of companies and destroying  thousands of jobs. Unfortunately, this  import storm has yet to be downgrad ed. The textile, apparel, and footwear  industries have been  the consistent  victims  of  uncontrolled  and unfair  import surges.  This legislation, by allowing 1-per cent annual growth  for  textile  im ports, and maintaining footwear  im ports at the 1987 volume level, is virtu ally their last hope for survival.  This initiative signifies a new, clear eyed approach  to  trade, and a new  awakening to the realities of the inter national economy. The U.S. Govern ment can and should take substantive  actions  to counter  the  targeted  im ports from countries running their in dustries full-tilt and paying submini mum wages to cut into the American  market.  Just look at what the cold neglect of  the Federal Government has meant to  the footwear industry.  In  1981, when orderly marketing  agreements expired,  footwear  import  levels  hit  50  percent  of  the U.S.  market. By 1985, when the administra tion denied relief after a formal sec tion 201 injury determination, imports  had climbed  to over 75 percent. By  1987, imports went over 81 percent.  Our  trade  laws should be able  to  confront problems like this, but that  apparently is the case only in theory.  In reality,  this  import surge cost us  over 7,000  jobs  in Maine alone, and  forced 19 plants to close their doors.  Textile and apparel imports contin ue to soar as well, and are gleefully  dropped by the ton on the everentic ing American market through lack of  enforcement and big loopholes in the  Multi-Fiber Arrangement.  In recent years, while the Govern ment has sat idle, the job loss toll has  mounted. Only recently in Maine, over  100 employees at the Carlton mill in  Winthrop were  laid off. The Emple  Knitting Mill in Brewer closed down  this spring and 150 more workers lost  their jobs. Dozens of other examples  a.bound.  Mr. Speaker, this bill cannot change  the past but it will help this Nation  face  the  future. We  simply cannot  afford to wait, though. A recent Office  of  Technology  Assessment  report  reaches a chilling conclusion: In the  absence of a response to these surges  in imports, the United States stands to  lose all of its apparel market and two thirds of its textile market by the year  2000. That's no way to celebrate the  dawn of a new millennium.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I strongly  support enactment of this legislation.  Let us start today to respond to trade  conditions as they actually affect in  practice our companies in the United  ",1988
404,House,100,0.332,1210,17,Mr. FAWELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  opposition  to  the self-executing  rule on  the  Senate amendments to H.R. 1154, the Textile  and Apparel Trade Act.  I urge my colleagues  to reject this protectionist trade legislation.  Once again,  the textile and apparel  indus tries are before Congress clamoring  for pro tection. These industries are already the most  heavily protected in the country by an elabo rate network of quotas and tariffs. The Multi Fiber Arrangement  [MFA], originally enacted  as a temporary system, extends quota protec tion  to some 1,500 textile and apparel prod ucts. The MFA renewed in 1986 now covers  80 percent of all low-priced textile and apparel  products.  In addition to the MFA, 42 bilateral agree ments have been negotiated by the Adminis tration, including agreements with Hong Kong,  Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to limit their  import growth to one percent annually.  The  textile and apparel  industries  receive  further protection from steep tariffs. Tariffs on  textile and apparel imports average an incred ibly high 18.6 percent, which  is much higher  than the average 3.6 percent tariff on all other  imports.  How much more do the textile and apparel  industries want? In my view, too much. In fact,  the protection currently extended to these in dustries is costing American consumers up to  $27 billion annually according to the Institute  for  International Economics. The quota bill  adds an additional $10.4 billion  to  that price  tag. Of course, increased consumer costs will  hit low-income families the hardest.  There are other losers under this quota bill.  In order to ""save"" 46,000 jobs in  the textile  and  apparel  industries,  the  retail  industry  would  lose an  estimated 52,000  jobs  that  depend  on  imports.  It would  cost  over  $220,000 to ""save"" each textile and apparel  job.  Although proponents of this quota bill would  have us believe that the textile and apparel in dustries are on  their  last  legs and  that  this  protection will  restore  them  to  greatness,  don't believe  it. These  industries are doing  quite well already.  Capacity utilization in  the textile  industry is  92 percent compared to an 83 percent aver age for other manufacturing industries. Textile  and apparel exports were up by 14.4 and 25.1  percent in 1987, respectively.  In the first five  months of this year, textile imports fell by 8.2  percent and apparel exports dropped by 10.5  percent. Textile producers  registered  record  profits of $1.9 billion last year. The textile in dustry created 21,000 new jobs last year-a 3  percent increase.  While there is little argument that these in dustries have experienced job losses in earlier  years, that employment drop is not due solely  to  import penetration. A study conducted by  Clemson  University  economics  professor  Richard McKenzie concludes that 83 percent  of the job loss between 1973-84 in the textile  industry was  the  result  of productivity  in creases.  Enactment of  this quota  legislation would  turn our trade  laws on  their head. Our trade  laws are designed  to  remedy unfair  trade  practices and prevent serious injury to domes tic industries as a result of imports. The textile  and apparel  industries do not meet either of  these standards. It would be insidious to pass  a quota bill that empties the pockets of con sumers and costs jobs in  the retail sector in  order to further protect industries that are eco nomically robust.  ",1988

406,,100,-0.355,1327,17,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, we are  today  taking  the  final steps  toward  sending S. 328, the Prompt Payment  Act Amendments of 1987, to the Presi dent to be signed into law. Given the  broad,  bipartisan  support  for  this  bill-support which can best be de scribed as overwhelming-I am confi dent that the President will sign this  much needed legislation into law.  My colleagues will recall that I  in troduced S. 328 in January 1987 with  some 55 cosponsors. The list of cospon sors on the bill eventually grew to 88.  When taken up in the Senate in Octo ber of last year, S 328 was unanimous ly approved by a rollcall vote of 86 to  0. The bill enjoyed similar unanimous  support  in  the House. The vote on  final passage in the House last month  was a resounding 394 to 0.  Mr. President, the impressive votes  in both the Senate and House under score our commitment  to  the basic  principle behind the Prompt Payment  Act-getting the Federal Government  to pay its bills on time. For too long,  foot-dragging on bill payment by Gov ernment agencies sent a very danger ous message to the business communi ty,  that  the  Federal Government  simply was not a responsible business  partner.  This shortcoming led to passage o.f  the original Prompt Payment Act in  1982. And we did see some  improve ments in Government bill paying prac tices with passage of that measure.  However, the Prompt Payment Act  has never quite lived up to its poten tial. Clever Government bureaucrats  managed to find loopholes and ambi guities in the act to delay payment to  business contractors.  The General Accounting. Office stud ied the Government's compliance with  the Prompt Payment Act  in a 1986  report entitled, ""Prompt Payment Act:  Agencies Have Not Fully Achieved  Available Benefits."" The GAO found  that nearly 25 percent of Government  payments were  still  late. Moreover,  GAO found that required interest pen alties were seldom paid. Agency per sonnel routinely abused the so-called  grace periods contained  in  the act,  thereby delaying payment to vendors.  The list of abuses goes on and on,  Mr.  President. These  shortcomings  were underscored at the 1986 White  House Conference on Small Business.  Delegates to that conference ranked  closing the loopholes  in the Prompt  Payment Act as one of their top prior ities. A  recommendation  supporting  corrective legislation was one of the  final recommendations coming out of  that conference.  The hearing record which we estab lished on S. 328 both in the Senate  Government Affairs Committee and in  the House Government Operations  Committee  brought  out  testimony  that again  illustrated  the abuses of  the act and urged swift, remedial legis lation.  I would  add, Mr. President,  that  testimony before both commit tees brought forth modifications to S.  328 which I believe greatly enhanced  the bill.  As such, S. 328 goes very far in ad dressing the different short-comings in  the Prompt Payment Act. The bill  eliminates  the various grace periods  currently in the Prompt Payment Act.  These grace periods were originally in tended to provide transitional relief to  Government agency  in adjusting  to  the Prompt Payment Act. Unfortu nately,  Government  bureaucrats  abused these grace periods and used  them  to stretch out  the period for  timely  payment  on  contracts. The  elimination of these grace periods will  help expedite such payments.  The bill also addresses the problem  of nonpayment of interest penalties.  My colleagues will recall that under  the Prompt Payment Act, if a Govern ment agency is late in paying its bill it  must also pay an interest penalty. Yet,  as I have noted very few of such inter est penalty payments are being made.  Indeed,  the GAO report found  that  only 1 in 6 of such payments due is ac tually made.  To correct this problem, S. 328 enti tles a contractor to an additional inter est penalty payment prescribed by the  Office of Management and Budget in  such cases. I believe this will provide  both the additional incentive and the  necessary oversight  for Government  agencies to comply with the interest  penalty provision already in the law.  My colleagues will recall that one of  the major provisions  in S. 328 deals  with applying  the provisions of  the  Prompt Payment Act  to subcontrac tors. This is an issue which we wres tled with for some time in the Senate.  We modified our  language on  this  matter several  times  in an effort to  provide  responsible  relief  to subcon tractors. Our colleagues in the House  have further modified our provisions  on this point and have come up with  language which I believe addresses the  problems of subcontractors while bal ancing  the  needs  and  concerns  of  prime contractors.  Mr. President, these are just are few  of the highlights of S. 328 .. I would ask  unanimous consent that a section-by section analysis of the bill be included  in the RECORD  immediately following  my remarks.  ",1988
407,Senate,100,-0.231,1379,17,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I wish  to publicly commend my distinguished  colle&.gue, Mr. SASSER, for his help in  getting this bill to the Senate floor and to my colleagues for recognizing  the urgency and the magnitude of the  problem we have in our thrift indus try.  A comprehensive study of the indus try's problems and potentials  is  the  only logical approach to solving those  problems and maximizing those poten tials.  It will provide midand  long term direction for nursing the indus try back to health. This study will not  provide a short term, quick fix remedy  but will provide assistance for the next  several years as we work on this prob lem.  Through hearings  in  the Banking  Committee, we have examined the sav ings and loan crisis. But we owe the in dustry and the American taxpayer the  benefit of a thorough study conducted  by some of the finest and most experi enced analysts. It is vital that we keep  our  remaining  savings  and  loan's  healthy. Our efforts to do so justify  the continued confidence of the Amer ican people in their savings and loans.  The first week of August, the Bank ing Committee held 2 days of hearings  to examine this problem. Former Fed eral Home Loan Bank Chairman Pratt  estimated the savings and loan crisis  to be between $40 and $75 billion.  Others in the savings and loan in dustry have estimated that we lose $1  billion each month we delay. At that  rate, if we let this problem slide until  next year, we forfeit $6 billion.  Time is literally money in the resolu tion of the thrift industry's problems.  And we can't afford a nickel and dime  approach to a multibillion dollar pre dicament. We need the coherent over view a National Commission will pro vide. And because our global financial  industries are changing so rapidly, the  ongoing review and planning such a  Commission would allow will help to  avert similar disasters in the future.  One way to demonstrate our sincere  concern that the savings and loan in dustry  is  fiscally sound would be to  support this legislation. That is a debt  we owe to the American people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a  letter of support for the  Commission  for Mr. Richard Pratt,  former Chairman of the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board and an editorial  which I have written on the thrift in dustry be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MERRILL LYNCH,  September 21, 1988.  Hon. BOB GRAHAM,  U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR GRAHAM:  I am writing in  support of S. 2653, legislation that you and  Senator SASSER have introduced to establish  a National Commission on the Thrift Indus try. The creation of this blue ribbon com mission  to study and make  recommenda tions on  the vital  issues confronting  the  FSLIC and the thrift industry would be an  important first step for Congress and the  regulators in resolving these issues. A com prehensive plan authored by  industry ex perts and delivered to Congress in the cru cial early months of 1989 would, I believe,  act as a catalyst for the adoption of effec tive solutions, both legislative and regula tory.  While I have great confidence in the abili ty of Chairman Wall and the members of  the Bank Board to address the problems of  the industry, the existing resources of the  Board and the FSLIC are clearly inadequate  to resolve the industry's large and still grow ing problems. We must expeditiously identi fy and evaluate the legitimate alternatives  for funding the obligations of the FSLIC. In  addition, it is time to re-assess the industry's  regulatory structure and deposit insurance  system  to  ensure  long  term  safety and  soundness and  to  restore depositor confi dence.  There are a number of short-term recom mendations that Congress can make to address the problems of the industry and I  have addressed these in a letter that was re quested by Chairman Proxmire during the  August 3 hearing at which I  testified. A  copy of my letter is enclosed. These short term measures, however, are not a substi tute  for a  comprehensive plan  that sets  forth long-term solutions to the problem.  I commend you and Senator Sasser for in troducing this important legislation. If I or  any of my colleagues at Merrill Lynch can  be of assistance to you in any way, please do  not hesitate to call on me.  Very truly yours,  RICHARDT. PRATT  AMERICA'S SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY  <By Bob Graham, U.S. Senator)  WASHINGTON.-The biggest economic issue  facing the next President-behind the fed eral deficit  and  trade  imbalance-is  the  crisis ravaging America's thrift industry.  Too many  savings-and-loan  associations  are losing money, the federal insurance pro gram that backs deposits  is nearly broke  and Washington doesn't want to face reali ty.  Handling the thrift crisis will be an early  indicator of the fortitude of the Dukakis or  Bush presidency, and could help set  the  tone for the first half of the term.  But Congress shouldn't wait until the new  President is sworn in next January, hoping  this issue gets on the executive agenda.  Congress must act now. The wick is lit on  an economic bomb, and procrastination will  make the explosion louder, more costly.  One-third of  the  thrift  industry-some  1,000 savings-and-loan associations-is insol vent or sliding toward insolvency. Govern ment insurance on deposits has been over whelmed by losses.  The Savings &  Loan crisis has spilled  from Wall Street to Main Street.  It took a long time to get in this mess: so lutions will take years, but here's what we  can do in the next 60 days:  Speed up the rate of closing insolvent in stitutions. At the current rate of closings,  too many insolvent thrifts will continue to  operate into the next decade.  The argument has been made that regula tors need more personnel to speed the rate  of closings.  If so, additional auditors and  other experts should be retained.  Begin to break the cycle of using high-cost  money for high-risk ventures, a high-flyer  formula that often compounds losses. This  predicament  is  like Argentina borrowing  more to pay interest on existing debt.  Institutions  should be  required  to put  more of their own money into high-risk ven tures.  institutions  are  insolvent, we  should restrict their growth and, at the very  least, they should stay out of high-risk in vestments.  Meanwhile, we should begin moving from  the current flat-rate insurance premium to  a risk-based premium.  If state-chartered institutions get federal  insurance, their limits and activities should  fall within the range of limits and activities  on federally chartered thrifts. A handful of  states <Texas and California among them)  have  allowed  state-chartered  savings-and loans  to venture  into  riskier  investments.  This has exacerbated the problems of the  Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corpora tion <FSLIC).  Focus FSLIC's attention on sliding institu tions instead of concentrating only on the  insolvent ones. The government should look  If  ",1988
