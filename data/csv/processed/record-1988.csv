0,7,1,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, in  the next several weeks, Congress will  be considering  fundamental changes  in financial law. We will be revisiting  the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.  Fortunately, the fourth estate has  covered this issue in some detail and  our Nation's editorial writers have de voted considerable time to the subject.  Today,  I submit for  the RECORD  a  number of editorials from Texas news papers. The Dallas Morning News, for  example, dedicated a three-part series  to the argument that reform is neces sary, and  that  this  reform  requires  that the monopoly enjoyed by security  firms-an unintended effect of Glass Steagall-must be busted.  I ask unanimous consent that the  editorials be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the edito rials were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 7,  1987]  THE NATION'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM Is A MESS  Ask any American to name top problems  facing the nation, and it's a good bet the  words ""financial system"" will not be ut teredunless perhaps the respondent  is a  banker.  Yet, if reform of the financial system is  not quickly undertaken, the nation could be  flirting with a near-term collapse of that  system and, in the slightly longer term, loss  of world leadership in financial services.  Consider:  One in 10 U.S. banks-1,484 to be precise is considered by the Federal Deposit Insur ance Corp. to be in ""trouble.""  One in five savings and loans is considered  to be in ""deep trouble"" by the Federal Sav ings and Loan Insurance Corp.  No U.S. bank remains among the world's  10 largest, and only three remain among the  top 20. The world's seven largest banks are  Japanese. A single Japanese securities firm,  Nomura,  is  responsible for  financing one third of  the entire national debt of  the  United States.  Some of  this nation's largest banks are  threating to return their bank charters and  either become state banks outside the Fed eral Reserve system or to stop being banks  and become financial  institutions without  the right to either gather deposits or make  commercial loans.  Unregulated subsidiaries of non-financial  firms such as Sears and General Motors  raised their share of the U.S. credit from 9  to 19 percent in the last 10 years.  Although a topic even less sexy and more  complex than tax reform, reform of the na tion's financial system must become a  top  agenda item for the new Congress. Congress  should: a> define the activities that may be  undertaken by various types of financial in stitutions and the markets they may serve;  b> determine to what degree market forces  will be allowed to shape the future of the fi nancial system; and c> redesign the financial  regulatory system to meet the radically al tered structure of the industry.  From the Great Depression until the mid1970s, the nation's financial ""central differ ent institutions <commercial banks,  invest ment bankers, thrifts and insurance compa nies) existed  to do  specific  jobs without  treading  on  each  others'  territory,  and  where non-financial concerns were prohibit ed from financial services altogether. Banks  were not allowed to pay interest on demand  deposits  <checking  accounts),  and  the  amount of interest that could be paid on  time deposits was fixed by the government  (by Regulation Q>. It wasn't too difficult to  pay a fixed low rate for deposits, loan them  out to creditworthy borrowers, and show a  profit.  But over  the past decade,  this ""central  nervous  system""  has  undergone  severe  shocks. The first shock came when market  interest rates shot far above levels the gov ernment allowed depository institutions to  pay for time accounts. Hundreds of billions  of dollars in savings fled banks and thrifts  for vehicles such as ""money market mutual  funds,"" which were created by securities  firms  and offered near-checking  account  convenience with high  rates of  interest.  Congress responded by ""deregulating"" inter est  rates. Almost overnight, banks were  taken  from  a  protected and predictable  status to the fierce disciplines of the mar ketplace.  This  deregulation  has  forced  banks to compete (pay higher prices> with a  variety  of  non-bank  entities  for  capital  while  institutions  from Sears  to Merrill  Lynch have continued to encroach on bank ers' turf by offering additional  traditional  banking services.  Another shock arrived with those comput er  technologies that turn money into elec trons and send  them whizzing about  the  globe <and across state boundaries) at the  speed of  light,  thereby greatly  thwarting  government efforts  to control  the money  supply, capital flow or exchange rates.  A final shock occurred when a variety of  bad debts began to crash in on banks and  thrifts. The first round hit the big multina tional  lenders when  falling  commodity  prices undermined the ability of many for eign governments <Mexico, Brazil, Poland>  to repay hundreds of billions in loans. Other  U.S. banks were hit when loans to energy  concerns and farmers went sour.  Thrifts <which primarily use savings from  small investors and channel them into mort gage  investments> got  into  trouble when  they found themselves having to pay high  market rates for deposits while their loan  portfolios were primarily low-interest, long term mortgages. To get more money into  the thrifts, Congress allowed 20 percent of  their deposits to be  invested in non-mort gage  investments  like  commercial  real  estate. Lacking the expertise to make wide ranging loans, many savings and loan insti tutions poured billions into bad deals.  The financial system has done the best it  could to adjust. But it has had to do so with out much guidance from Congress or even  those regulatory agencies currently charged  with managing  the system. This has oc curred because Congress  has deadlocked  over whether  the government should act  forcefully  to maintain  the walls between  types of financial institutions, between com merce and finance, and between states, or  whether to encourage the rapid metamor phosis of the financial  institutions toward  large, nationwide, diverse enterprises guided  more by the demands of the market than  the visions of regulators.  Whatever the merits of available options,  the most unacceptable option  is  inaction.  Government must provide  the framework  for the nation's financial nervous system. If  it fails to do so, it courts disaster as individ ual savers and investors lose confidence in  the system, as Americans turn to foreign al ternatives to meet their money needs and as  experimentation  increasingly  defies  the  ability of  regulators  to assure safety and  soundness.  [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 8,  1987]  THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UNCHAINED  The United States'  financial  system  is  being called on to do an increasing number  of jobs:  Finance large multinational corporations  as well as smallto medium-sized businesses.  Provide venture capital for ideas that still  are gleams  in entrepreneurs' eyes. Keep  thousands of governmental entities funded.  All this and still supply credit to individual  consumers in a wide range of income brack ets.  At the same time, the U.S. financial indus try is as much under siege from Japanese  and European competitors as are other in dustries. And, as with other industries, the  foreign competition operates with far fewer  constraints. Japanese and most European  banks  labor under  far  fewer  restrictions  than do U.S. banks, and some may even  engage in ""merchant"" banking (equity own ership for investment purposes). Many for eign banks are not required to maintain spe cific amounts of reserves.  U.S. financial institutions are caught be cause populist  laws  build walls between  types of institutions, between state markets  and between commerce and finance. At the  same  time,  the  international marketplace  demands  large,  sophisticated  enterprises  able to offer a wide variety of financial serv ices and products at the lowest possible cost.  Historically, many Americans  have been  leery of nationwide financial conglomerates  and  a  concentration of  assets  in  fewer  hands. But we must now accommodate our selves to new realities. If the U.S. financial  industry  fails  to serve  the world market place,  foreign  institutions will-at great  profit. That will mean a continued wither ing of U.S. financial muscle and a growing  ",1988
1,20,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, Senators  have made many memorable speeches  in this Chamber but 71 years ago this  week a President of the United States  delivered an important address, from  the rostrum before us. At 1 p.m. on  January 22, 1917, President Woodrow  Wilson was escorted into the Chamber  by a committee of Senators, and took  a seat to the right of Vice President  Thomas R. Marshall, the presiding of ficer.  At that time the First World War  was raging in Europe, with England,  France, and Russia combatting Ger many and Austria. The United States  had maintained its neutrality-Wilson  had  just won  reelection under  the  slogan: ""He Kept Us Out Of War"" but  German  infringements  upon  United States neutrality rights were  increasingly  pressuring  the Nation  into war. On this day, however, Presi dent Wilson addressed the Senate, ""as  the council associated with me in the  final determination of our internation al obligations,""  to outline his vision  for permanent peace in the future.  Wilson took the bold step of calling  for a  ""peace without victory."" This  was difficult  to propose  in wartime,  but he argued  that ""victory would  mean peace  forced  upon  the  loser  It would be accepted in humilia tion, under duress, at an  intolerable  sacrifice, and would leave a sting, re sentment,  a  bitter memory  upon  which terms of peace would rest, not  permanently, but only as upon quick sand. Only a peace between equals can  last."" The warring powers, of course,  ignored and ridiculed Wilson's propos als, and even the United States forgot  them as soon as this Nation entered  the war  in April 1917. When World  War I ended, not by ""peace without  victory,"" but with the total defeat of  Germany,  the  resulting  peace was  built upon the quicksand that Wilson  had predicted,  leading  to a Second  World War just 20 years later.  .

5,33,1,Mr. STAFFORD.," Mr. President,  I  stand before the Senate to recognize  the outstanding contribution the Na tional Geographic Society has made to  this country. In its charter statement,  the National Geographic Society sets  out for  itself the  task of  increasing  and disseminating geographic knowl edge. The society has taken up  this  mission  in earnest, achieving respect  and admiration for it's outstanding ef forts  to promote geographic literacy  among the citizens of our Nation.  Attaining geographic literacy for all  the citizens of our Nation is a crucial  goal, a goal we are far from reaching.  At hearings held last fall, we learned  that knowledge of geography is woe fully lacking among school-aged chil dren. As  a  consequence, my  good  friend Senator BRADLEY and  I orga nized a successful campaign to declare  November 15-21 as Geography Aware ness Week. During that time activities  promoting  geography  literacy were  carried out across our Nation. Geogra phy Awareness Week is a good begin ning, but it is not nearly enough. In  the past 10 years geography as a sub ject of study has all but disappeared  from American  classrooms.  In  the  mind of this Senator, geographic illit eracy is a stumbling block to achieving  economic competitiveness and a threat  to our environmental well-being.  Recognizing  the need  to  increase  awareness of geography, Gilbert Gros venor, the president of National Geo graphic  is steering the society on a  long-range program of geography edu cation. Educational  efforts  are not  new to that organization. National Ge ographic has earned a  reputation of  being America's premier promoter of  global understanding through educa19-059 0-89-2 (Pt. 1)  ",1988

D 1330  LEGISLATION TO CURE THE  BUDGET PROBLEMS  <Mr. GEKAS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1988
16,46,1,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  going to introduce a bill today which  could go a long way to cure the budget  sickness  that overcomes  this House  every single year. It would call for if  the Congress should fail  to adopt a  budget by its deadline of September 30  that the next day automatically would  be  reenacted  the  previous  year's  budget. No more the continuing reso lutions of 30 days creating another  crisis within that 30 days, no more the  pressure  of  checks  that would  be  forced not to be delivered by the Gov ernment because of a  deadline not  met, no more the spectacle of a Presi dent of the United States forced  to  sign an unacceptable budget because  of the threat of a shutdown of the  Government  operations  throughout  the world, no more the crisis, never  ending,  that besets  the Congress of  the United States.  I  know  that one  thing militates  against passage of this bill, and that is  that it makes sense. But I hope that  we can overcome that illness of ours so  that  this country can be put on a  straight basis for a budget process.

As the Iran-Contra committees con cluded in their report:  The common ingredients of the Iran and  Contra policies were secrecy, deception, and  distain for the law.

18,72,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to  bring to the attention of my colleagues the re tirement as president of the Greater Ventura  Chamber of Commerce of my constituent, Jim  Clark.  Jim has been a resident of Ventura since  1970 and a member of the Chamber of Com merce since 1979. Since  that  time he has  served as chairman of the Governmental Af fairs Committee and was elected a director in  1984,  vice  president  1985,  president-elect  1986 and president of 1987.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Jim's term as president was marked by a  30-percent  increase  in membership, making  the Ventura Chamber the largest in numbers  of business members  along  the California  coast between Los Angeles and San Francis co. Additionally he was responsible for estab lishing the award-winning ""Ventura Business""  as the Chamber's monthly newsletter, keeping  the members abreast of current and future ac tivities of  the organization. Revisions  to  the  city's  smoking  and  sign  ordinances were  achieved, mainly  through his efforts, and he  spearheaded efforts which led to the justifica tion  for a 4-year university  to be  located  in  Western Ventura County and selection of Ven tura as the first choice for a site on which to  build it.  Mr. Clark is a native of Ashland, OH and a  graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. Shortly  after graduation he married Suzy also of Ash land. His Navy career included tours on carri ers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers as  well as schooling at  the Naval Postgraduate  School in Monterey, giving him a postgraduate  degree. Duty in Washington, DC followed and  then he was assigned to duties at the Naval  Weapons Systems Engineering Station at Port  Hueneme, CA. While  there he headed  three  departments  and was  responsible  for  the  design, construction and  testing of a 95-foot  remote-controlled Anti-Ship Missile Defense  Test Boat which survived all  range weapons  threats and continues to this day to serve as  a drone launching vessel for the Pacific Mis sile Test Range. At his  retirement  from  the  Navy in 1976, he had served the third longest  tour of duty ever at Port Hueneme.

FAUNTROY  OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 1988  ",1988
19,72,1,Mr. FAUNTROY.," Mr. Speaker, when the his tory of  the 20th century  is written, deeply  woven in its fabric will be the saga of how, in  the latter part of the 20th century, this Nation  ended  the  tyranny of  taxation without repre sentation for its last colony-the citizens of its  Nation's Capital.  That history will have  to  record  that 39  bright and committed young people from  the  District of Columbia  fashioned a magnificent  stride  toward  their own  freedom when  they  carried out a mission on behalf of all  the  people of the District of Columbia by traveling  to Atlanta, GA, for the third national celebra tion of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., to enlist people of conscience from across  the Nation in support of D.C. statehood.  These  students  included  representatives  from the University of the D.C. and the follow ing District of Columbia public schools-Louis  Charles Rabaut Junior High School, William H.  Taft Junior High School, Frank W. Ballou  Senior High School, Benjamin Banneker High  School, Calvin Coolidge Senior High School,  Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School,  the  Washington Dix Street Academy,  and  the  Washington, DC, School Without Walls,  in cluding participants from Mayor Barry's Youth  Leadership Institute. I thought you, Mr. Speak er, would  like  to know  the names of  these  young people  to whom posterity will owe a  debt of gratitude.  They are: Dennis Abrams, Darlene Allen,  Dwayne Bailey,  Lisa Brooks, Sheila Bunn,  Stanley  Burley,  Ricardo  Canales,  Danna  Carter, Carla Y. Cyrus, Carolyn Denr:iis, Sa breena Geddie, Baxter W.

20,85,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a  pleasure  to pay tribute today to  the Chester  Newell Area Chamber of Commerce. I had the  privilege of addressing this organization and it  became clear to me then that special recogni tion was in order.  Residents of Chester, WV, are clearly  in  good governing hands as  this group of offi cials exemplify the epitome of loyalty, concern  and  understanding. Mayor Roy Cashdollar  though only in office for 18 months, has done  an excellent job, as have the board members.  The Chester Newell Chamber of Commerce  represents their constituents well and it is with  great pride that I pay tribute to them today.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  A TRIBUTE TO COMMISSIONER  EDWARD J. MUHL  HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 1988  Mr. CARDIN, Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to Maryland's insurance commis sioner, Edward J. Muhl, who will be honored  for his years of outstanding public service at a  banquet in Baltimore on January 29.  Ed Muhl was appointed commissioner of in surance on June 1, 1983, after serving 18  months as deputy commissioner and acting in surance commissioner. His appointment came  at a critical  time  for  insurance  regulation  in  Maryland, which,  like  the rest of the Nation,  was facing a liability crisis.  It was my privilege to serve  in  the  legisla ture and observe  the skillful diplomacy of  Commissioner Muhl. Without his negotiating  skills, the outcome of health insurance, work men's compensation, tort reform and medical  malpractice issues might have been resolved  quite differently. Ed  is a quiet and effective  negotiator, committed to the fair resolution of  problems.  As  a  regulator, Commissioner Muhl  bal anced the interests of both the consumer and  industry. During his tenure, consumer informa tion was greatly improved, as were the proce dures for appealing a commission decision.  The State of Maryland has been  fortunate  to have such an outstanding public servant  and  I have been fortunate to have Ed as my  constituent, my consultant of my Health Advi sory Committee, and my friend. Although we  are sorry to lose Ed to North Carolina, he has  left us a very proud legacy.  TRIBUTE TO THE YOUNGSTOWN  MAENNERCHOR  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 1988  ",1988
21,85,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great pride that  I pay tribute to  the Youngs town Maennerchor.  This  institution  is  the  second  oldest  singing  organization  in  the  State of Ohio. This year the society celebrates  its 125th anniversary.  Since  the  first gathering of the  initial nine  German members in January of 1863, Amer ica has seen  five wars. During  the Second  World War  these men were engulfed by a  great wave of prejudice and unyielding abuse.  Under the weight of such widespread German  prejudice,  the Maennerchor members  reaf firmed  their oath of allegiance  to  this great  Nation. They vowed  to ""aid and support all  national and  local programs  for  the ultimate  victory of the United States."" Their loyalty and  commitment to  this Nation has been, and  is  unquestionable.  Members have long sought to preserve their  German heritage and culture. Though mem85  bership has fallen in recent years,  the Maen nerchor is optimistic that their numbers will in crease as the commemorative concert sched ule begins.  The Youngstown Maennerchor  represents  an  integral part of Ohio's German heritage  and  it is with great pleasure  I pay  tribute to  such an outstanding organization. The mem bers are  to be congratulated on  their out standing community contributions and person al character. Thank you, Youngstown Maen nerchor, for your gift of song and heritage to  our great State.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 1988  ",1988
23,85,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great pride that  I stand before you  today to  pay tribute to Ohio's finest,  the Women Law  Enforcement Officers of Ohio. Their untiring  service to the people of Ohio and those of the  17th district,  is  to be commended and  I am  proud to represent such a fine group.  Established in December 1986, the organi zation has committed itself to protect the citi zens of Ohio and of the Mahoning Valley, and  to uphold  the  laws  therein. Beyond  this,  the  organization seeks to promote equal opportu nities  for women employed  in  law enforce ment;  to  support,  educate,  and  promote  women  in  law enforcement; and,  to  improve  the working  relationship  among men  and  women in that profession.  The  tasks of an officer are vast and  the  daily job is always potentially life threatening.  Somehow, ""thank you"" seems so insignificant  in light of the duties these women perform.  It is with great pride and appreciation that I  pay  tribute  to  the members of  the Women  Law  Enforcement Officers  of Ohio. They  indeed represent the finest of Ohio's citizens.  ",1988
24,98,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  it  is  with regret that I rise in opposition to  S. 557 as it is currently drafted. I hope  my colleagues understand that my de cision  to  oppose  this bill was not  reached easily, nor does  it evidence  any lack of commitment on my part to  guaranteeing civil rights for all Ameri cans. Rather, my concerns reflect the  view that we can rectify the problems  flowing from the decision of the Su preme Court in Grove City versus Bell  without  imposing  and  expanding,  without limitation, the Federal Gov ernment's power over churches, syna gogues, private and religious schools,  the private sector, and States and lo calities. Simply labeling a measure a  ""civil rights"" bill does not negate our  responsibility to understand its ramifi cations or draft it carefully.  I hope my colleagues will indulge me  as I provide some background on this  issue, because it is critical that we un derstand the current state of the law,  and the ramifications of this legisla tion. I assume that the rhetoric will be  quite impassioned during the next few  days, but I hope that the fallowing ob servations will be taken for what they  are-legitimate concerns  that we do  not destroy one set of civil rights in  order to guarantee others.  The simple fact is that, unless we ad dress legitimate concerns such as the  coverage of churches and synagogues,  religious  tenets and abortion, S. 557  may never be able  to move through  the other body.  It will certainly be vetoed by  the  President, and that veto will be sus tained, in my opinion. And for yet an other session we will have done noth ing to correct the legitimate concerns  confronting title IX, or those who be lieve in title IX; and I happen to be  one of  them. We could have solved  this problem  in 1984 had we had a  simple overrule of the Grove City case.  This is the political reality that we  are facing  today. Mr. President,  the  four statutes amended by this bill pro hibit discrimination on certain bases,  ""any program  or  activity  receiving  Federal financial assistance."" That is  the present state of the law.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  1964 bans discrimination on the basis  of race, color, or national origin. Title  IX of the Education Amendments Act  of 1972 bans discrimination on  the  basis of sex, but it is limited to educa tion programs or activities  receiving  Federal financial assistance.  Section 504  of  the Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  bans  discrimination  against persons with handicaps; and  the Age Discrimination Act of 1975  bans discrimination on  the basis of  age.  The plain language of these statutes  together with  their  legislative histo ries  demonstrates  that  Congress  always  intended  the scope of  these  statutes to be ""program specific,"" as  the Supreme Court correctly deter mined  in  the Grove City decision.  Indeed, the words ""program or activi ty"" would appear, by common sense,  to mean something less than an entire  institution.  Congress has often been criticized  for its ambiguity or its mistakes in leg islative drafting, but I do not think it  made such a wholesale mistake as to  expect  the entire country  to  think  that the term ""program or activity""  was a synonym for an entire school, a  school system or a State.  Title IX  itself makes  reference  to  ""an educational  institution"" and de fines  the  term ""educational  institu tion"" as broader than a program < 20  U.S.C. section 1681(c)). In all honesty  we have to admit that Congress knew  how  to  cover an entire  institution  whenever one part of it received Fed eral aid, but declined to do so in the  antidiscrimination provision of  these  laws.  Moreover, in section 904 of title IX,  Congress prohibited discrimination on  the basis of blindness or vision impair ment ""in any course of study by a re cipient of Federal financial assistance  for any education program or activity       ."" 10 U.S.C.  section 1684. Here,  Congress clearly banned discrimina tion on the basis of blindness through out the institution by using the word  ""recipient""  in  the  statute  itself-in  stark contrast  to  the more discrete  term ""program or activity"" used in the  antisex  discrimination  provision  of  title IX and in the other three stat utes. Congress clearly knew how  to  provide institutionwide coverage under  these statutes and declined to do so.  Thus, it is important to realize that  references by the proponents of S. 557  to the long standing interpretation of  these  laws  are  inaccurate.  Indeed,  while some lower courts did rule that  these statutes covered an entire insti tution whenever any part' of the insti tution  received  Federal  aid, many  other Federal courts ruled, as the Su preme Court did,  that  the statutes  were program specific. And, the trend  in  the  lower courts  leading  to  the  Grove City decision by the Supreme  Court was certainly in that direction.  In Simpson v. Reynolds Metals Co.,  629 F.2d 1226 <7th Cir. 1980), a case  brought under section 504 of the Re habilitation Act before Grove City was  decided, the Court said:  The statute does not, as plaintiff seems to  contend,  generally  forbid  discrimination  against  the handicapped by  federal assistance. Instead, its terms appar ently require that the discrimination must  have some direct or indirect effect on the  recipients of  handicapped person in the program or ac tivity receiving federal financial assistance.  To be actionable,  the discrimination must  come  manifest itself in a handicapped individual's  exclusion from the program or a diminution  the operation of the program or  in  of the benefits he would otherwise receive  the program. 629 F.2d at 1232 <italic  supplied).  from  The Court went on to note that it  could find nothing in other parts of  the act to show ""an intent by Congress  that section 504 impose a general re quirement upon recipients of Federal  grants  not  to  discriminate  against  handicapped employees who are not  involved in a program or activity re ceiving such assistance."" 629 F.2d at  1233. Thus,  in Simpson,  the  court  ruled that an employee at one of the  defendant's plants could not assert a  section 504 claim by virtue of a f eder ally assisted  job-training program at  the plant because the employee was  not  a  participant  in  that program.  Thus, coverage did not even extend to  the entire plant, let alone the entire  company.  Likewise,  in Bachman v. American  Society of Clinical Pathologists, 577 F.  Supp. 1257 <D.N.J. 1983), 1 year before  Grove City, the court made an identi cal finding under a section 504 action:  It is not enough ... to show that a person  has been discriminated against by a recipi federal  funds. Plaintiff must also  show that she was subject to discrimination  ent of  under  the program or activity for which  gram-specific  those funds were received.  . .. Section 504  of  the Rehabilitation Act  imposes a pro requirement  limiting claims  brought pursuant to this section to those  programs or activities which are federally  funded. 577 F. supp. 1262-1263 <emphasis  supplied).  Here, a nonprofit medical associa tion received approximately $50,000 jn  Federal aid to conduct three seminars  on alcohol abuse and to publish the  proceedings of the seminar. The court  ruled that such Federal aid does not  subject  to coverage  the association's  board  of  registry, which  develops  standards and procedures  for entry  and promotion in medical laboratories  and certifies and registers those who  meet  competency  requirements,  in cluding  the use of an examination.  Had  the court  ruled otherwise,  the  standards  for  certifying clinical pa thologists would have been subjected  to an equality of result rather than  equality of opportunity analysis by  Federal agencies and courts.  In Brown v. Sibley, 650 F.2d 760 (5th  Cir. 1981 ), a case involving a business  operated by  the state,  the Court of  Appeals for the fifth circuit held:  [Oln the basis of the language of section  504 and its legislative history, and on the  strength of analogies to Title VI and Title  IX, we hold that it is not sufficient, for pur poses of bringing a discrimination claim  under section 504, simply to show that some  aspect of the relevant overall entity or en terprise receives or has received some form  of  input from  the federal  fisc. A private  plaintiff in a section 504 case must show  that the program or activity with which he  or she was involved, or from which he or  she was excluded, itself received or was di rectly benefited by federal financial assist",1988
25,111,1,Mr. SYMMS.," There may be many  differing views in this body as to the  validity or merits of the FCC cross ownership rules, and I believe there is  room for a difference of opinion. How ever, I think few members of this body  would support the concept that those  rules should be selectively manipulat ed by Congress to stifle targeted cate gories of speech, amounting to blatant  legislative censorship. After all,  the  first amendment says that ""Congress  shall make no law       abridging the  freedom of speech of the press.""  But in the waning hours of the last  session, unbeknownst to most of us, we  did pass a law ""abridging the freedom  of the press."" There is simply no other  way  to describe what  the anti-Mur doch amendment did.  Some may argue that the Murdoch  measure was simply designed  to en force  rigorously  the cross-ownership  rules. But this argument fools no one.  When the Supreme Court upheld the  cross-ownership rules in a 1978 deci sion, it emphasized the importance of  FCC discretion in applying the rule.  The Justices stressed that ""waivers are  potentially available"" where enforcing  the rule could lead to closing down a  newspaper.  But  the  anti-Murdoch  measure  deliberately  removes  that  critical  discretion  for  the manifest  purpose of censoring the views of two  newspapers. Waivers were barred pre cisely because  the Murdoch papers  needed such a waiver.  A more blatant example of targeted,  content-related censorship would be  difficult to imagine.  Mr. President, the Grove City legis lation is the first piece of legislation  that has come before the Senate this  session. This makes it the only avail able vehicle  for as much as several  weeks to cure the damage done by last  year's amendment.  I  therefore urge  adoption of my amendment.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and  nays on the amendment.  ",1988

35,124,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  today the Senate begins consideration  of S. 557, the proposed ""Civil Rights  Restoration Act of 1987,""  the latest  version of  legislation  to address  the  Supreme Court decision in the case of  Grove City versus Bell,  decided  in  1984. For more than 3 years now, we  have heard  the clamor  from House  and Senate Members and  the civil  rights community demanding reversal  of this decision.  ""Restore  the  law  to  its pre-Grove  City state,"" has been the cry. Howev er, if anything has become clear in the  last 3 years, it is that there is wide dis agreement on what the state of the  law was in this area before that deci sion.  The sponsors of S. 557 state that  they want to restore the broad, insti tution-wide coverage of  title IX and  the other statutes addressed in their  bill. However, there is strong evidence  that coverage prior to Grove City was  not institution wide, but program-spe cific, as the language of the statutes  appears  to mandate. The fact  is, we  are probably involved in this exercise  today because Congress did not meet  its responsibility to pass clear and un ambiguous legislation in the first  in stance. I hope we will not repeat that  mistake.  Mr. President, the controversy sur rounding Grove City-related  legisla tion has been improperly focused from  the start. The question is not whether  Federal financial assistance should be  allowed to fund discriminatory activi ties. Indeed, I believe that Americans  support the continued prohibition of  such use of Federal  funds.  I  have  heard no one argue otherwise.  However, the sponsors of S. 557 have  chosen to distort this debate by posing  the question in simplistic terms under  which one is either for their bill or for  federally subsidized discrimination. It  is a tactic which has served them well  on this and other legislation which, re gardless of merit, has been touted as  critical to the future of civil liberty in  our Nation.  The true controversy underlying this  legislation is based upon complex, yet  subtle questions which arise in the im plementation of  the accepted policy  goal that Federal dollars should not  subsidize  discrimination.  is  here  that a number of significant disagree ments exist: What breadth of coverage  should be invoked as the result of re ceipt of Federal funds by a particular  It  ",1988
36,163,1,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President,  I  am  proud to rise as a cosponsor of this leg islation which will facilitate the ability  of adult adoptees and their birth par ents to locate each other through the  creation of national adoption registry.  The  concept  of  contact  between  adult adoptees and their birth parents  is an emotional one. There are those  who argue that such contact consti tutes a violation of the privacy rights  of both birth parents and adoptees as  well as being a threat to the parental  rights of the adopting family. There  are also  those who argue  that  the  right of adult adoptees  to get some  level of information about their birth  parents  is  absolute. This  legislation  goes to neither extreme. It is a sensi tive response to the needs and desires  of all parties. It balances  the right  that all of us have to privacy with the  understandable desire that all human  beings have to know more about who  they are and where they come from.  The distinguishing characteristic of  this legislation is simple: It establishes  a national registry in which, upon re quest, the names of birth parents and  adult adoptees are placed. The exist ence of such a registry allows for the  possibility of matching adult adoptees  and birth parents and allowing them  to contact each other if they desire to  do so. While the legislation establishes  a national  registry, names of adult  adoptees and birth parents are placed  in the registry only if the parties re quest that they become a part of the  system. As  a  result, matches made  through  the  registry  require  the  mutual and voluntary consent of both  the adult adoptees and the birth par ents.  This bill does not-does not-create  open records. This bill does not-does  not-create a situation  in which un willing contact is possible. All this bill  does is facilitate the possibility of con tact if, and only if, both adult adoptee  and birth parent make an active effort  to allow  that contact  to  take place.  Each  party must  voluntarily  place  their names in the registry and, as a  result, a match can only be made if  both parties desire it.  Mr. President,  this legislation does  nothing more than respond to reality.  There are similar voluntary registries  in some States and the experience we  have had with them proves that the  system does protect the rights of all  parties. Unfortunately,  such  State based  systems  are  restricted,  by  nature, to the geographic boundaries  of the State; since we are a mobile so ciety, that limitation reduces the utili ty of State-based system. In addition,  Mr. President, the plain truth is that  without a national registry, both adult  adoptees and birth parents are en gaged  in private  searches  for  each  other-searches which do not recog nize  the privacy rights of the other  party. It is my hope that the failure of  one party to indicate a willingness for  contact by placing their name on the  registry will discourage such freelance  searches and, as a result, help protect  all parties from contact which  they  may not desire.  Let me conclude these remarks, Mr.  President, by paying a special tribute  to Senator LEVIN and his staff. I know  that they have been working on this  legislation for close to 10 years now. I  am absolutely convinced that the op position to this legislation is based on  a failure to understand the extraordi nary  protections which  have  been  built into it. And I am also absolutely  convinced that when this legislation is  adopted-as I hope  it will be-adult  adoptees and birth parents and every one who cares about this issue, will ap plaud the Senator for Michigan and  his staff for  their persistence,  their  dedication, and  the creative and re sponsible way in which they have ad dressed this issue.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am  pleased to  join my distinguished col league from Michigan, Senator LEVIN,  as an original cosponsor of legislation  to  facilitate  the  reunions of  those  adult adoptees, birth parents, and sep arated siblings who are seeking to find  one another. Our bill would accom plish  this by establishing a national  adoption reunion registry.  The need for this legislation is great.  There are presently millions of long separated adoptees and birth parents  who wish to be reunited. Studies have  shown that four out of five birth par ents desire a reunion with their adopt ed  children. Experience with State  registries indicates that a similar per centage of  adult  adoptees wish  to  make contact with their biological par ents. In addition, there are scores of  adult  siblings who,  separated  from  their brothers or sisters in early child hood, now seek to be reunited.  Unfortunately, identifying and locat ing a separated birth parent, child, or  sibling can be a costly, time consum ing, and frustrating endeavor. Our leg islation would greatly streamline this  process by enabling interested parties  to  voluntarily  find  one  another  through a centralized reunion registry.  At the same time, our proposal would  respect the privacy of those who wish  to remain anonymous. I believe that  this approach represents a careful and  sensible way to address the needs and  interests of all parties involved. I en courage my colleagues to join me in  support of this humane legislation.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1988
37,163,1,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, many  Americans  desperately  search  for  years and sometimes for decades at  great economic expense to find their  biological  parents,  siblings,  or chil dren. The problems associated in the  search for lost relatives are unfortu nate and often times unnecessary. For tunately, however, the pains associat ed with the search for a  lost family  member are replaced by the joys of  being reunited.  Several States, including Louisiana,  have made admirable attempts to fa cilitate the reunion of those who have  been separated from  their  relatives.  Many of  these  reunions occur as a  result  of  a  State-by-State  registry.  Every State does not have a registry,  thus, gaps exist that have prevented  the establishment of a comprehensive  national registry.  Today I am pleased to be part of an  effort that will attempt to facilitate  the reunion of perhaps thousands of  Americans who  have  lost  track of  family members. This effort includes  the establishment of a 3 year demon stration project through which biolog ical parents and adult adoptees, and  ",1988

54,189,1,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, some of  my colleagues favor Contra aid. Some  of my colleagues favor the peace proc ess, but I do not know a single Member  of Congress who favors waste of tax payers' dollars,  and  the  record  of  Contra aid in this administration is a  record of waste and profiteering.  Last year, as a  result of a Federal  audit, we determined that half of the  humanitarian aid we had sent nomi nally to the Contra forces in Nicara gua ended up in one grocery store in  Honduras,  a  street  corner  grocery  store  in Tegucigalpa, owned by  the  generals in the Honduran army. We  were  not  quite  sure we  got  our  money's worth  in  this humanitarian  assistance.  Last year Secretary of State Shultz  testified  before  the House Budget  Committee and assured me personally  that he could account for the $27 mil lion  in Contra aid which American  taxpayers sent down  before.  there  the year  D 1445  lacl~ of  I exchanged several letters. I do not  have the stack of them to rap on the  podium here as the President did with  the CR the other night. But I wish my  colleagues could see them because as  they would read them they would find  out the Secretary of State could not  provide that information. As the GAO  reported, our State Department has  shown an utter disregard for spending  controls  and  accountability  when it comes to Contra aid.  is  becoming  increasingly  clear  that our Contra aid is being monitored  by Johnny Carson's infamous book keeper ""Loose-Leaf Maurice.""  Now the President wants us to throw  another $36 million in Contra aid into  the dense jungle of waste and profit eering. We cannot afford to waste an other penny of the taxpayers' dollars  to perpetuate Contra folly in Nicara gua. It is time to give peace a chance  and stop squandering tax dollars on  the Contra effort.  It  LEGISLATION TO AMEND  LOW  LEVEL  RADIOACTIVE WASTE  POLICY ACT  <Mr. COLEMAN of Texas asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1988
55,189,1,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Speak er, I appreciate the opportunity to ad dress the House in support for legisla tion  I  am  today  introducing which  would amend the 1980 Low Level Ra dioactive Waste Policy Act.  This bill would add a section to cur rent law which delegated to the States  responsibility for disposal of low-level  radioactive waste within their respec tive  jurisdictions. A majority of  the  States have formed regional compacts  which then assume control over the  site selection process for  location of  waste disposal facilities as well as all  other tasks associated with the oper ation of the disposal facilities. The for mation  of  these  regional  compacts  must be approved by  the Congress  through legislation.  The State of Texas has elected not  to join a regional compact and has cre ated the Texas Low-Level Radioactive  Waste Disposal Authority to provide a  plan for the disposal of  its low-level  waste.  The effort of the authority in Texas  to select a suitable location for the dis posal facility have raised strong con cerns among west Texans,  the area  most likely to play host to such a facil ity,  in  that political and budgetary  considerations  appear  to  have  had  more  influence  in  the site selection  process than scientific or engineering  factors.  At the present  time,  two  locations  have been selected, both in Hudspeth  County and both  in my district. A  neighboring county, El Paso, has filed  suit  against  the  authority  alleging  that both sites do not meet the siting  criteria spelled out in State law. An in junction has been placed on the au thority preventing any further work  on these two sites while the Texas Su preme Court decides the merits of the  suit. Only last week the Texas court  ruled against the county thus clearing  the way for the final designation of a  site and, in turn, spawning a new cycle  of litigation in the State court system.  My legislation would essentially du plicate language which is contained in  a 1983 agreement between the United  States and Mexico on cooperation for  the protection and  improvement of  the environment in the border area.  The agreement, which was signed by  the Presidents of both countries, pro vides generally for mutual cooperation  in preventing or reducing sources of  pollution in their respective territory  which affect the border area of the  other. The border area is defined as  the area situated 100 kilometers-or 60  miles-on  either  side  of  the Rio  Grande.  The 1983 agreement, and my bill,  recognize the need for both countries  to act  responsibly  in respecting our  shared border area environment. Cer tainly, the location or a low-level dis posal facility within the defined area in this case an international waterway  that  is  fed by  several  surface and  ground  water  sources,  the  Rio  Grande-violates  the  intent  of  the  agreement and poses a risk to the nat ural resource H.R. 791  seeks to pro tect.  Congress has only recently begun to  recognize the need to agressively safe guard against ground water contami nation. With this legislation, Congress  would be demonstrating an apprecia tion for the role we all must play in ac knowledging  the  interdependence  which so characterizes our border area  environment.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am aware of  the  general  unwillingness  of  some  within this House to revisit an issue the  disposal  of  low-level  nuclear  waste-which many  feel has already  been disposed  of. The  situation  in  Texas  underscores,  at  least  in my  mind, that Congress cannot afford to  duck its ultimate responsibility for the  threat posed  to our population by  problems associated with the disposal  of such waste when this problem is the  direct result of policies pursued at the  Federal level.  I am hopeful that testimony devel oped during committee consideration  of  this  bill would  articulate more  clearly  the need for a more careful  monitoring of the actions of the States  in addressing this problem. Just as im",1988
56,202,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, action on  the INF Treaty, as the country is well  aware, has commenced in the Senate,  and it is certain to dominate our work,  the news, and  the attention of our  allies, friends, and our chief adversary  well into the spring. It will command  the substantial energy and resources  of the full Senate on this floor for a  number of weeks. Such an agreement  is well deserving of our attention, for  it is  the first major arms reduction  agreement in nearly a decade.  From preliminary  indications  and  study, I am favorable inclined toward  this accord, although  its complexity  and import merit careful examination.  We must consider carefully what this  treaty represents and what lessons it  will mean for the future. This treaty,  whatever its merits and whatever its  flaws, represents an attempt to turn  back the tactics of intimidation exer cised by the very same power which  has cosigned this document with the  United States. It is a victory for the  West because we stood together under  pressure by an antagonist over a long  period of time.  But now we must answer this ques tion: Where goes the alliance? Is the  threat which  brought  us  together  somewhat dissipated with the advent  of a dynamic, and stylistic new, PR conscious Soviet leader? Mr. President,  the  success or  failure  of  the  INF  Treaty  is  in  its most  important re spects  future  oriented.  How  will  NATO behave? How will the Warsaw  Pact countries behave? What will the  West need to maintain and, if possible,  increase our credible deterrence of any  Soviet bloc temptation to test us? I of fered an amendment to the fiscal year  1988 DOD authorization bill this past  September 26, 1987, asking the Secre tary of Defense to analyze this ques tion  in depth  and  to  provide  the  Senate with his analysis at the same  time as any INF Treaty was submitted  to  the Senate. My purpose was not  only to review this situation anew, but  to make the point of the integrated  nature of  the INF Treaty with  the  future of NATO. I am pleased that the  Secretary was able to produce a sound  study along  these  lines, and I  shall  share the unclassified version of that  report with my colleagues today.  The study addresses the full range  of key questions confronting NATO,  including the future of the strategy of  flexible response, and the moderniza tion of both nuclear and nonnuclear  forces in Europe. It clearly recognizes  that we must do better, that we must  be more efficient, more creative, that  we must work more closely in tandem  with our allies, and, most importantly,  that we must sustain the political will  to  take whatever steps necessary  to  ensure the security of our allies and  our own national security. The Kremlin will certainly seek to engender an  air of euphoria about East-West rela tions  in order  to undermine the re solve of NATO citizens to make diffi cult choices in spending for defense.  The Soviets have already been quick  to portray NATO modernization meas ures  as  circumvention  of  the  INF  Treaty  and  counterproductive  to  future arms agreements, while, at the  same time continuing to improve their  own-meaning  the  Soviets  and  Warsaw Pact countries-offensive ca pabilities. The  report  addresses  in  detail the tasks ahead of us, and out lines a ""framework for a NATO de fense  program  directed  toward  strengthening flexible response in all  of its dimensions.""  Mr. President, I commend the Secre tary for this study. I intend to follow  it up in detail and to discuss its impli cations with our European allied lead ers over  the February recess. Going  with me on that journey will be the  distinguished chairmen of each of the  three committees which will be han dling the brunt of the work in examin ing this treaty and its implications. I  have reference to Mr. PELL, chairman  of the Foreign Relations Committee;  Mr. NUNN,  chairman of  the Armed  Services Committee; and Mr. BOREN,  chairman of the Intelligence Commit tee, as well as Mr. WARNER, the distin guished ranking member of the Armed  Services Committee and a member of  the  Intelligence Committee.  These  Senators will accompany me, we will  be examining three broad areas of in quiry; among others: First, to evaluate  the candid assessments of European  leaders as to the advantages and disad vantages of the INF accord; second, to  discuss  their assessment-the assess ment of European leaders-of Soviet  strategy and  tactics vis-a-vis NATO  during the current period and for the  immediate future; and, third, to assess  the  implications for NATO weapons  modernization,  planning  and  arms  control strategy in a post-INF treaty  environment, assuming  the  treaty  is  approved  for  ratification.  In other  words, where do we go from there?  We will be meeting with European  political leaders, both those in power  and those in the opposition, as well as  military officials, opinion makers, and  experts out of government. I intend to  share a comprehensive assessment of  my findings upon my return and hope  that it will contribute to our under standing of the virtues, and possibly  the dangers, of  the  treaty  that we  have just begun to consider. The De fense Department report ""Support of  NATO Strategy  in  the 1990's,"" will  help  to  focus  the attention of  the  Senate on the ramifications of treaty  enactment for  the Western alliance.  Does enactment of  the  treaty bode  well for the future of NATO? That, in  the  final  analysis,  is  an  important  point  in enacting  the  treaty,  in approving  the  ratification  thereof-to  make  the Western  alliance more  secure for the coming decades.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that this unclassified report be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the report  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  SUPPORT OF NATO STRATEGY IN THE 1990's  <A Report to the United States Congress in  Compliance With Public Law 100-180)  THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,  Washington, DC, January 25, 1988.  To the Congress of the United States:  This Report  is  in  response  to  require ments in the National Defense Authoriza tion Act for Fiscal Years 1988-1989, of De cember 4, 1987, that I discuss the ability of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  <NATO>  to maintain its strategy of deter rence through the 1990s.  Our confidence  in maintaining the Alli ance's  flexible  response  strategy  is  ex plained in President Reagan's January 1988  National Security Strategy Report. Before  entering into our agreement with the Sovi ets we made sure that from the standpoint  of  the military  implications of  the  INF  Treaty, NATO's resulting  force  structure  would be fully capable of supporting deter rence-provided that we vigorously pursue  the necessary modernization, and make ef fective  use  of  the  gains  in  capability  achieved over the last few years.  Consistent with the President's guidance,  this report outlines a framework for achiev ing what  the National Security Strategy  states must be accomplished  to maintain  the credibility and viability of NATO forces  and strategy. The U.S. is prepared to work  in close consultation with our allies to carry  out a NATO Defense Program to achieve  these objectives.  I am confident that the Congress will sup port both what we propose, and the INF  Treaty.  FRANK C. CARLUCCI.  OVERVIEW  Purpose  The following  report concerns U.S. and  allied planning for the future security pos ture of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza tion.  It responds to the Congressional request  <spelled out in the Appendix> that the Sec retary of Defense discuss how Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces <INF) missile reduc tions  fit with NATO objectives and how  they  relate  to  the Alliance's flexible  re sponse strategy. In so doing, the report re flects consultation with NATO's Supreme  Allied Commander, Europe <SACEUR> and  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  includes  seven  supporting  sections  matched to specific questions from the Con gress. This Overview discusses these impor tant matters involving flexible response, de fense requirements, arms control and devel oping programs. All involve issues which are  integral to the support of NATO and Ameri ca's overall strategy-aimed at bolstering de terrence, strengthening our alliances, and  decreasing Soviet military advantages.  It  The INF Agreement  The INF Treaty provides for the U.S. and  the Soviet Union  to  eliminate  all  their  ground-launched  missile  systems  with  ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers,  worldwide.

58,215,1,Mr. EVANS.," Thank you, Mr. Presi dent,  AVIATION HISTORY  ",1988
59,215,1,Mr.  EVANS.," Mr.  President,  on  Monday of this week, aviation leaders  gathered in Seattle for two important  events. First, to celebrate the rollout  of the two newest models of Boeing  airliners, the 747-400 and the 737-400;  Second  to  recognize  the remarkable  career of ""T"" Wilson on his retirement  as  chairmen  of  the  board  of  the  Boeing Co.  In all fields of human endeavor, the  most enduring legacy is achievement  and  the most honored  tradition  is  trust. It is this legacy and this tradi tion that T.A. Wilson leaves to those  who will follow him at the helm of the  Boeing Co. as he moves  into a new  career of busy retirement.  ""T"", as he is known to his friends,  was born in Missouri, the home, iron ically, of one of Boeing's biggest com petitors. During his briliant career, he  truly  lived  the motto of that great  State as he  showed everyone what  first class management  talent could  accomplish.  The Boeing Co.,  throughout ""T's""  career, has been the world's preemi nent producer and seller of commer cial  aircraft.  Today,  their market  share for free world sales continues to  exceed 50 percent despite major com petitive challenges both at home and  abroad. Sales  backlogs  continue  at  record breaking levels.  Recently the company was awarded  a major contract  to build America's  Space Station. Thus Boeing continues  as a world leader in space, national se curity and civilian, air transport.  At a time when we are enthralled by  a crisis of competitiveness, ""T's"" ef forts at Boeing are a shining example  of American industry at its best. Be cause he insisted on research, he en sured that Boeing would stay on the  leading edge of  technology. Because  he insisted on quality, he ensured that  Boeing stayed in the forefront of sales.  We can compete as Americans. Just  ask ""T.""  In a career filled with awards, acco lades, and successes, three accomplish ments stand out. ""T"" should perhaps  be proudest of his contributions to the  security of our country through his  work on two of the mainstays of our  strategic arsenal, the B-52 bomber and  the Minuteman ICBM. These two pro grams are still heralded by military  procurement  experts  as models  of  public-private partnership.  For his second major achievement, I  turn the clock back to the aerospace  recession of 1969, a particularly pain ful time in the State of Washington. I  know,  I was Governor at  the  time.  Through decisive and innovative man agement  action,  ""T""  preserved  Boeing's manufacturing base and laid  the groundwork  for  the  immensely  successful years which followed.  For his  third major achievement,  ""T"" and Boeing received the prestigi ous Collier Trophy. In the mid-1970's,  as foreign government supported ef forts to crack the commercial aviation  market  intensified  throughout  the  world, Boeing, under ""T's"" leadership,  boldly undertook to develop privately  a new family of long-range, fuel effi cient aircraft: the 757 and 767. The re sounding commercial success of these  aircraft is a  testament to the coura geous vision of T.A. Wilson.  Although ""T"" will be stepping out of  the pilot's seat at Boeing, he will still  be in a position to advise the new man agement from his chair at the board of  director's table. He will still be in the  front row as Boeing moves toward the  21st century as not only a commercial  aviation giant, but as a major defense  contractor and space technology inno vator.

70,228,1,Mr. HATCH.," If it would be all right  with the distinguished floor manager,  the distinguished Senator from South  Carolina will take the last 8 minutes  before the vote.  ",1988
71,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY., I would be glad to  yield whatever time that I have to the  Senator from South Carolina.  ,1988
72,228,1,Mr. HATCH., Just so he knows so he  can have a schedule if he can take the  last 8 or 10 minutes before the vote.  ,1988
73,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," I would like to give  him 8 of  the last 12 minutes so we  have 4 minutes,  if necessary,  to  re spond.  ",1988
74,228,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection,  it  is so ordered. Who  yields time?  ",1988
75,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY., I yield such time as  the Senator from Ohio may need.  ,1988
76,228,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Ohio.  ,1988
77,228,1,Mr. METZENBAUM., Will the Sena tor  from Massachusetts  be  good  enough to yield to a couple of ques tions because  I  think there  is some  misunderstanding concerning the ap plicability of the law as it presently is  drafted. I think it might perhaps help  if he and I had a colloquy.  ,1988
78,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY., I welcome the op portunity to yield to the Senator.  ,1988
79,228,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  I  thank  the  Senator.  I  have  several questions  I  would like to ask about the impact of  S. 557 on religious organizations. Let  me assume that a religious organiza tion, a church or diocese or synagogue,  receives Federal assistance for a limit ed purpose. The Federal assistance is  to  provide  assistance  to  homeless  people,  to aid  refugees or for some  other discrete purpose. Under S. 557  will  the  receipt of  such  assistance  result in coverage of the religious or ganization  in  its entirety so  that  it  would be under an obligation not to  discriminate in any of its operations?  ",1988
80,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Not under the cir cumstances that the Senator has de scribed. Coverage_ of a religious organi zation is described in sections <3><a> of  the four parts of S. 557-dealing with  title VI, title IX, section 504 and the  Age Discrimination Act. Section <3><a>  provides  for complete coverage of a  corporation, partnership or ""other pri vate organization"" only under two cir cumstances-neither of which applies  to the situation described by the Sena tor. The first is where assistance is ex tended to the private organization ""as  a whole."" That would apply where the  Federal financial assistance is to bail  out a Chrysler or Lockheed Corp., but  not where aid is for a particular desig nated purpose. So, as the committee  report says (p. 17):  A grant  to  a  religious organization  to  enable it to extend assistance  to refugees  would not be assistance to the religious or ganization as a whole  if that is only one  among a number of activities of the organi zation.  The  second circumstance  that  re sults  in organizationwide coverage  is  where the organization is ""principally  engaged in the business of providing  education, health care, housing, social  services or parks and recreation."" The  principal occupation of a church, or a  diocese or a synagogue or another reli gious organization is by definition ""re ligious.""  So  such  an  organization  would not be covered  in its entirety  even if it conducts one or more pro grams in education or health care or  social services.  Accordingly, a religious organization  which receives limited purpose assist ance will be covered only as  to  the  ""geographically separate"" facility-to  which the assistance is extended.  As  the Senator  knows,  prior  to  Grove City we did not draw a distinc tion between  the  religious organiza tion and the nonreligious organization.  We do draw a distinction between cor porations that provide social services  whose primary purpose is social serv ices. That  is given one requirement,  and  those whose principal  interests  are others, such as religious or maybe  a private corporation. So what we are  basically saying is if you go into a par ticular parish or a particular syna gogue which  is  receiving money  in  that particular parish which is a small  area in any event, they are providing  refugee help and assistance, but they  are also providing food assistance, and  if they are getting Federal money on  refugees they cannot discriminate in  that  particular  parish  against  the  handicapped. That is the limited area.  So we draw a distinction with regard  to those institutions that are primarily  providing public  services,  and  then  within those that are primarily orien tated in a different way, a private cor poration or a religious group, we say  only  those particular separated geo graphical areas that are receiving the  assistance would be covered. But we  have not drawn a distinction on that  prior to Grove City and we never had  a problem with it. We never had any  kind of issue raised even in the course  of the hearings. There was some ques tion with  regard  to  the definition,  whether it was sufficiently clear that  we were really doing what I  just de scribed as what we are doing.  I have a  letter here from the U.S.  Catholic Conference that says:  I have been asked by your staff to provide  you with a  letter concerning one of  the  three  amendments  to  S. 557,  the Civil  Rights Restoration Act which  the United  States Catholic Conference recommended in  its testimony before your Committee. That  amendment  deals with  the  coverage  of  church institutions. The Committee Report  CS Rep 100-64) accompanying the bill which  was approved by the Senate Committee on  Labor and Human Resources and  is now  pending business before  the U.S. Senate  contains language that addresses the major  concerns on  institutional coverage which  the USCC raised in its testimony. Because  of the Committee action, the USCC is no  longer seeking such an amendment to the  bill.  So  I  think  recognizing again  that  what this bill is really talking about is  the extension of coverage. We are not  trying to change what existed prior to  the holding in Grove City understand ing the historical pattern that existed  prior to Grove City, understanding the  clarifications  that have been made  there which have been accepted not  only by the Catholic conference but a  number of other religious groups.  I  would hope that we would not further  define  this in a way which would,  I  think, undermine the central thrust of  the purpose of the legislation.  ",1988
81,228,1,Mr. HATCH.," On this point, would  the Senator yield?  ",1988
82,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY., I would rather wait.  I am not going to yield.  ,1988
83,228,1,Mr. HATCH., It is on this point.  ,1988
84,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY.,  I will yield at a  time.  ,1988
85,228,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.,  I have been  waiting patiently to clarify.  ,1988
86,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY., Then I will come  back.  ,1988
87,228,1,Mr. HATCH., Let us clarify on this  point.  ,1988
88,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY.,  Madam President.  ,1988
89,228,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator declines to yield. The Senator  from Ohio has the floor.  ,1988
90,228,1,Mr. HATCH., Parliamentary inquiry.  ,1988
91,228,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator will state his inquiry.  ,1988
92,228,1,Mr. HATCH.," The Senator has mis stated even his own bill. It seems to  me, is it not-",1988
93,228,1,Mr.  KENNEDY.,  Madam President.  ,1988
94,228,1,Mr. HATCH., Does this Senator not  have the right-,1988
95,228,1,Mr. KENNEDY., Regular order.  ,1988
96,228,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Ohio has the floor.  ,1988
97,228,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  I  thank  the  Senator for that clear and cogent ex planation. My second question has to  do with the application of title VI of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the law  that bars discrimination in the use of  Federal  funds  on grounds  of  race,  Regular  order,  I  do  not  yield,  ",1988
98,241,1,Mr. DANFOHTH.," And  then  the  legal memorandum winds up as fol lows:  It is our conclusion that this amendment  would accomplish its intended result.  That is, the amendment I have just  sent to the desk.  It would declare, in the language of the  statute itself and not simply in the legisla tive history, that nothing in title IX could  be held to require any institution to fund or  perform abortions. The provision would, of  course, displace any contrary  regulations.  The amendment is neutral on abortion in  the sense that it would not forbid a hospital  or other covered institution from funding or  providing abortions if it should so choose.  ",1988
99,254,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  majority leader is recognized.  ,1988
100,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I would  be glad to yield to the distinguished  Senator  from North Carolina  if he  wishes me to.  ",1988
101,254,1,Mr. HELMS.," I thank the Senator. I  want to either see the amendment or  know how long it is. I will either have  it read or I want to read it, if I could  get a copy of it.  ",1988
102,254,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, will the  distinguished majority leader yield to  me?  ",1988
103,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, if the dis tinguished Senator wishes  to  see  a  copy of the motion to recommit with  instructions and the instruction I will  be very happy to not proceed until he  has had that opportunity. I ask unani mous consent that my rights to the  floor be protected meanwhile.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  GRAHAM). Without objection, it is so  ordered.  ",1988
104,254,1,Mr. HATCH., Will the distinguished  majority leader yield for a comment?  ,1988
105,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, I yield for a com ment with my rights to the floor pro tected.  ",1988
106,254,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  rights  to  the  floor of  the majority  leader will be protected.  ,1988
107,254,1,Mr. HATCH.," I have been chatting  with the majority floor managers and  they are trying to reach an accommo dation that we can resolve this matter  without going to a motion to recommit, which was done, without going  through that, plus a whole lot of other  things that we will have to go through  if we cannot accommodate each other.  I  think we are pretty close and we  might be able to resolve this. We need  just a few minutes to discuss this with  the distinguished majority floor man ager  and  the majority  leader,  of  course, and our acting minority leader.  So I would suggest that if you will give  us a few minutes we can maybe resolve  this. If we cannot, it is going to be a  long time.  ",1988
108,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I have no  desire  to hold the floor.  I  intend to  offer an amendment  to  the  instruc tions and I intend to fill up the tree,  not because I want to but because I  am trying to help the manager of the  bill on this side. And I can do that.  But, at  the  same  time,  I want  to  accord Senators an opportunity to dis cuss  this matter  in  the meantime.  Maybe  it will be helpful. How  long  would the Senator suggest? Ten min utes?  ",1988
109,254,1,Mr. HATCH., Yes.  ,1988
110,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that my rights to  the floor be retained, that no Senator  be  recognized  for  the making of a  motion or the offering of an amend ment or for any purpose other than to  speak and then that there be a limita tion on the time of not to exceed 10  minutes, at which time I be recognized  again.  ",1988
111,254,1,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection? Without objection, it  is so ordered.  RECESS FOR 10 MINUTES  ",1988
112,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent  that  the Senate  stand in recess for 10 minutes.  There  being  no  objection,  the  Senate, at 6:03 p.m., recessed until 6:14  p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassem bled when called to order by the Pre siding Officer <Mr. GRAHAM).  ",1988
113,254,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  majority leader.  ,1988
114,254,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I under stand  an  additional  5 minutes  is  needed.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum and I ask unanimous con sent  that  at  such  time  that  the  quorum is called off, that I be recog nized.  ",1988
115,254,1,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  there any objection? It is so ordered.  The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant  legislative clerk pro ceeded to call the roll.  ,1988

119,280,1,Mr.  LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  at  the  save  Tibet rally on the steps of the U.S. Capitol a  few weeks ago, Rabbi Herbert Morris of  the  Congregation Beth  Israel-Judea in San Fran cisco delivered a brief talk that sums up the  reason for rally and for congressional concern  over conditions  in Tibet.  Indeed,  it  is a re sounding  statement of why  all Americans  should care about what  is happening many  thousands of miles away on the ""roof of the  world.""  I would  like to place his outstanding  remarks in the RECORD  for the benefit of my  colleagues:  ""And God created man in His image, in  the  image of God He created him.""  I've  never met Tibetans; Never tasted their food;  do not know what  language  they speak;  Never walked through their villages; Never  studied  their culture;  the names of  their  cities do not come easily to my lips and their  national anthem I've never heard played.  But I do know this:  ""When God created that very first human  being, He scooped up soil from all four cor ners of this world. He took that earth-with  all of its colors, the red and brown and black  and yellow and white-and said: 'You're en titled to live and none to make you afraid.  And you don't have to be all the same color,  speak the same language, eat the same food,  worship the same God or think the same  thoughts.'""  No, I've never met a Tibetan-but he's my  brother. He's entitled to  live. That is his  right. I know that. The same God that cre ated me, created him. I know that! And I  know one more thing from the experience  and  the history and  the  teaching of my  people; to be indifferent to the fate of my  Tibetan brother will condemn him and to be  indifferent to his anguish condemns me; To  be neutral condemns him and to be neutral  to his suffering condemns me. To be silent condemns  the Tibetan  to a  cultural and  spiritual death-to be silent, to be silent condemns me.  JANET CHAMPNEY POSS  HONORED  HON. BRUCE A. MORRISON  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
120,280,1,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speak er, on January 24, 1988, a ""Supper of Recog nition and Thanks"" was held in honor of Janet  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Champney Poss by her friends and colleagues  from the town of Guilford, CT.  A graduate of Wheelock College, Jan con tinued her studies at Boston University and  Columbia University, where she also held a  number of administrative positions. She  later  married Eliasz Poss, a senior engineer at Si korski Aircraft.  Jan  is a leader of the Democratic Party in  Guilford. In that role, we have worked together  on many causes  large and small. Her help  was a key part of my success in my first cam paign  for Congress in 1982 and each of my  subsequent runs for reelection. She is a com mitted activist in  the struggle  for peace and  justice here at home and around the world.  Jan  is also well known  in Guilford  for her  volunteer work. She has been  involved  in a  wide range of volunteer activities for the past  23 years, and  is Guilford's ""Best Volunteer.""  She chaired the Little Folks Fair, the Shoreline  Unitarian-Universalist Society, and  the East  Shore Adult Day Care Center. In addition, Jan  has served as the chairman of  the Guilford  Human Services Council and the Youth Serv ices Bureau. And the list goes on.  Jan was a founding member of the Guilford  League of Women Voters. She was also a  founder of  the Guilford  ""A Better Chance""  Program, which sponsors  inner-city children  and provides  them with  the opportunity  to  attend several years of school  in Guilford,  away from the crime and poverty often associ ated with inner-city schools. Finally, Jan was a  founder and part-time manager of the ""Hole in-the-Wall"" second-hand clothing store. This  store was originally started  to  finance  the  Interfaith Housing Board, of which she is now  the executive director, but presently helps  fund the ""A Better Chance"" Program.  Mr. Speaker, the people of Guilford and its  surrounding communities owe a debt of grati tude  to Jan Poss. Her commitment and un flagging energy in her efforts to  improve the  lives of  the people around her are  truly  re markable. But most important,  I am proud to  call her a  true and dear  friend, and  I take  great pride  in sharing her accomplishments  with my colleagues today.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. DAVID E.  FARKAS  HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
121,280,1,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay  tribute  to Dr. David E. Farkas, my good  friend  and  a  leader  in my  community.  I  became acquainted with David and developed  a lasting  friendship with him some 30 years  ago at Camp Ramah where his endless gen erosity and strong leadership abilities were al ready apparent.  David will be honored on January 31, 1988,  by the Los Angeles Hebrew High School at a  gala dinner/dance at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  The Los Angeles Hebrew High School pro vides a meaningful secondary Jewish educa tion to thousands of students in nine branches  throughout the Los Angeles area. A graduate  of Hebrew High, David has worked  tirelessly  January 27, 1988  for this fine institution in many leadership posi tions  for  the past  16 years. He  currently  serves on the board of directors as president elect and scholarship chair.  David has given generously of his time and  resources to Jewish educational institutions to  provide Jewish youths with  the best possible  educational opportunities. Among his past ac tivities are service as  the vice president of  Camp Ramah, a member of the Young Lead ership Cabinet of UJA, a board member of  Heschel Day School, and a board member of  Adat Ariel. David  continues  to aid  Jewish  youths as a founder of the Hebrew University  School of Dentistry, a member of the Patrons  Committee at the University of Judaism, and a  member of  the Society of Founders at  the  American Friends of Hebrew University. He is  also a member of the Prime Ministers Club of  State of Israel Bonds.  David's contributions  to  this community at  large are also noteworthy. He graduated from  the University of Judaism,  the Association of  Arts  in Hebrew Literature,  the Hayim Green berg Teachers  Institute  in Jerusalem,  Israel,  the University of Southern California and the  School of Dentistry at the University of South ern California. For the past 20 years he has  been a practicing dentist in Sun Valley, CA.  He has also  served as a member of  the  School Screening Committee, Dental Health  Program, and  the Sun Valley Chamber of  Commerce.  It is my distinct honor and pleasure to pay  tribute  to  this outstanding  individual.  I wel come  this opportunity  to congratulate David  and join the Los Angeles Hebrew High School  in saluting him for his continued efforts to help  our young Jewish people achieve their goals.  MONUMENTS COMMISSION AND  KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL PASS  MUSTER  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
122,280,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, for almost 6 mil lion men and women who sacrificed a part of  their lives fighting for the cause of freedom in  the Korean war,  the journey home has been  an incomplete one. While many individuals re turned  from  the  fray  to  rejoin our Nation  in  peace as they had  joined our Nation in war,  over 60,000  individuals  remained behind  in  Korea, dead or missing.  For  those 60,000 who served  their nation  admirably,  the  journey home ended halfway.  Those 60,000 went to Korea but did not return  from Korea.  There is an opportunity to remember those  who served and sacrificed as well as  those  who served and returned.  In the 99th Congress, I was pleased to have  authored  legislation establishing  the Korean  War Memorial. As a symbol, the memorial will  honor the ultimate sacrifice, that is, self-sacri fice so that others may live.  In  the 1 OOth Congress,  I am pleased  to  have  introduced  additional  legislation  that  would bring closer to home here on the Mall  ",1988
123,293,1,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, as one member  who since 1981 has been sponsoring legisla tion to impose swift and certain penalties on  those convicted of hate crimes.  I wish  to  again urge that final congressional action be  completed on legislation passed by this House  which would be an  important  first step  for ward, H.R. 3258 which I was proud to cospon sor.  In addition the report released yesterday by  the Anti-Defamation  League of B'nai B'rith  makes this an even more compelling cause.  Their report makes the disturbing conclusion  that anti-Semitic incidents in the United States  increased 12 percent in 1987 reversing a 5year downward trend according to this morn ing's New York Times.  The total number of incidents for 1987 was  1,018 a staggering rate of more  than  two a  day  for  the whole year. These  incidents of  anti-Semitic incidents include two types: van dalism against Jewish institutions and property  and harassment threats and assaults against  Jews and Jewish property. Typically acts of  vandalism  outnumber  the  harassment  and  threat type of incidents and 1987 was no ex ception. There were 694 acts of vandalism  and 324 harassments, threats and assaults.  Tragically, New York State again  led  the  States with 207 incidents. New York also led  with acts of harassment, threats and assaults.  It  is  important  to note  that an  increased  number of State  legislatures, 29  in all have  adopted stricter  laws aimed at curbing  reli gious or ethnic vandalism. Yet there remains  to this date no Federal legislation to deal with  the problem of religious and ethnic violence.  H.R. 2538 proposes a graduated series of  penalties for those who commit these heinous  acts against religious persons and or property.  This would  include  life  imprisonment for any  such incident that results in death.  There are far too many acts of violence and  vandalism occurring against people of all reli gions. Just two nights ago, Cardinal O'Connor  of the Archdiocese of New York had his per sonal residence broken into by a knife wield ing individual who threatened one of the cardi nal's housekeepers. It was the second forced  entry into the residence in the past year. We  read about too many religious buildings being  defaced. We even hear too much about dese cration of cemeteries.  It is time  to act and we must do so.  It is  tragic that these acts occur but they do. We  cannot ignore them because our inaction will  only encourage more such acts in the future.  293  At this time  I wish to insert an article from  the New York Times highlighting  the B'nai  B'rith report.  [From the New York Times, Jan. 27, 19881  REPORT SHOWS 12-PERCENT RISE IN ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS  Anti-Semitic  incidents  in  the  United  States increased 12 percent in 1987, revers ing a  five-year downward  trend, the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith reported  yesterday.  At the league's New York headquarters,  its national director, Abraham H. Foxman,  called the results ""disturbing."" He said that,  paradoxically, the increase had come in a  period of vigorous  local  law enforcement  and statutory efforts against crimes of bias  as well as a  recent Federal crackdown on  hate groups.  The 1,018 reported incidents in 1987 and  the percentage of increase from 1986, how ever, were less than those of 1981, the last  year the annual audit found a significant in crease in anti-Semitism in this country.  In 1981,  there were 1,324 reported  inci dents. That was the third year in a row that  the number of  incidents was more  than  double the previous year's.  694 VANDALISM INCIDENTS  The league divided the incidents into two  types: vandalism against Jewish institutions  and property, and harassment, threats and  assaults against Jews and Jewish property.  Historically,  incidents of vandalism have  largely outnumbered harassments,  threats  and assaults and that was the case last year.  The number of incidents of vandalism last  year was 694, ranging from swastika daub ings to arson and pipe bombings. This was  an increase of 17 percent over the 594 inci dents reported in 1986. The sharp increase,  the audit said, largely reflected a 121 per cent increase in such incidents in California.  The audit found some of the more serious  vandalism was carried out by members of a  neo-Nazi hate group who call  themselves  the Skinheads. The group's activity  last  year, particularly  in California,  the audit  said, brought the number of anti-Semitic in cidents  attributable  to  organized  hate  groups to 20. In recent years, no more than  one or two vandalism incidents have been  attributed to such groups.  The number of harassments, threats and  assaults was 324 last year, a 4 percent in crease over the 312 such incidents reported  in 1986 These included 16 assaults last year,  compared with 11 the year before. Most of  the harassments and threats came  in the  form of hate mail and telephone calls.  NEW YORK'S BREAKDOWN  New York,  the state with  the highest  Jewish population, led the nation with 207  vandalism incidents, up from 186 in 1986. Of  the 91  incidents reported last year in New  York City, Brooklyn had the most, with 37,  followed by Manhattan, with 27.  Outside the city, Nassau County had the  most  in  the  state,  followed  by Suffolk  County, with 41. The remaining 55 counties  in the state had a combined total of 15 inci dents.  California had the second highest number  of vandalism incidents, 137, up from 62  in  1986.  Florida was  third, with 64,  followed by  New Jersey, with 43. The 1987  totals for  both states, however, were down from 1986.  Connecticut was ranked 20th, with 6 inci dents, one more than the year before.  ",1988
124,306,1,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to a Brooklyn native son, who has  recently been appointed  to one of the most  important positions in the Catholic Church. A  few weeks  ago,  the Holy Father  named  Bishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua to be archbish op of Philadelphia.  It is with great pride that I point out to my  colleagues  that Archbishop Bevilacqua was  born and educated in Brooklyn. He began his  religious  instruction at Brooklyn's Cathedral  College and  later attended  the Seminary of  the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, NY.  The Archbishop's towering and diverse intel lectual strengths are evidenced by  the  fact  that he has also earned a dqctorate in Canon  Law at the Gregorian University in Rome, an  advanced degree  in political science at Co lumbia University, and a doctorate in civil law  at St. John's University.  Mr. Speaker, throughout my career in public  service, in the New York Assembly and in the  Congress,  I have had  the immense pleasure  of working directly with Archbishop Bevilacqua  on a number of critical issues. The Archbishop  served Brooklyn's Catholic community with  distinction,  first as director of  the diocese's  migration and  refugee  office and  then as  Brooklyn's auxiliary bishop. He  is one of the  Nation's authorities on  refugee and human  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  rights matters and has always provided me  with expert counsel on these important issues.  Several years ago, Archbishop Bevilacqua  left the Brooklyn diocese to assume the role  of bishop of Pittsburgh. Aithough he moved  away from our city, the Archbishop will never  cease to be a beloved member of the Brook lyn family.

THE  POSTAL  SERVICE  VANTAGED  BUSINESS  CUREMENT ACT OF 1988  DISAD PROHON. MICKEY LELAND  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
125,306,1,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  last year  the  Postal Service  released  its  comprehensive  statement on postal operations.  In the midst  of pronouncements about the Postal Service  complying with this act or that regulation, was  the startling revelation  that in 1986, only 5.9  percent of all contract dollars went to minority  businesses. This is a dramatic decrease from  1985 when 1 O percent of all Postal Service  contracts went to minority businesses and the  lowest percentage since 1981. In terms of dol lars and cents, this is a drop from $237 million  spent with minority businesses in 1985, down  to $186 million in 1986. This is appalling.  In stead of building on a record that was improv ing  incrementally,  the Postal Service  has  taken a huge step backward.  The Postal Service's disappointing  lack of  involvement with disadvantaged business con cerns, those small businesses that are owned  and controlled by minorities or women, is forc ing me to introduce legislation today mandat ing that every year, at least 1 O percent of all  contract dollars be spent with such disadvan taged business concerns.  We should not have to legislatively mandate  that the Postal Service give more than token  consideration  to minority and women owned  businesses. The Postal Service, however, has  resisted previous efforts to encourage, even  cajole them into being more receptive to mi nority contractors. As part of the Federal Gov ernment, the Postal Service should be a posi tive role model for the Nation. Unfortunately,  when it comes to providing equal opportunities  for all,  regardless of race or sex,  the Postal  Service exhibits, to put it mildly, a lack of com mitment.  I cite as an example  the  fact  that  nearly half, 49.7 percent, of all EEO cases  filed with the EEOC by Federal employees are  filed by Postal Service employees. And be lieve me, my colleagues, I am seeking legisla tive means of changing  this sad state of af fairs also.  The  legislation  that  I  introduce  today will  bring  the Postal Service  in  line with existing  Federal policy. Section 8(a) of the Small Busi ness Act authorizes Federal programs that en courage and assist small minority businesses  in contracting with  the Federal Government.  January 27, 1988  Recent  court  cases,  including a  landmark  case before  the Supreme Court, considered  the provisions of section 8(a) and the proce. dures and constitutionality of this statute were  upheld .  The legislation that I introduce today will not  result in additional costs to the taxpayers nor  postage rate payers. This measure stipulates  that in every fiscal year, the Postal Service is  required to set goals for contracting with dis advantaged business concerns. These goals  cannot be  lower  than 1 O percent, nor can  actual contract dollars spent with disadvan taged business concerns drop below 1 O per cent without sanctions being imposed on the  Postal Service. For women owned and con trolled businesses, the goals and actual dollar  amount must be at least 5 percent each fiscal  year.  I want to make clear that this bill does  not represent a limit on  the extent to which  the Postal Service may contract with disad vantaged business concerns. Quite  the con trary. We have set a minimum standard with  which  the  Postal  Service must  at  least  comply. To accomplish this, the Postal Serv ice must reevaluate  its policies, and change  them where necessary, so that they are more  conducive to minority businesses and encour age minority participation. I suggest the Postal  Service start by removing some of the many  procedural roadblocks to contracting with the  Postal Service and  launch serious efforts to  solicit minority business participation.  Finally, this bill  is comprehensive, covering  all aspects of contracting with disadvantaged  business  concerns,  including  solicitation of  bids and proposals, the responsibility of prime  and subcontractors, the use of inventions, pat ents and licenses, research and development,  payment to the covered businesses, penalties  for misrepresentation of minority or small busi ness status and a required annual  report to  Congress on compliance with the statute. To  see that the legislation is carried out to its full est, the bill also contains a provision that cre ates an Office of Small and Disadvantaged  Business Utilization.  It is time the Postal Service joined the rest  of  the Federal Government  in working  to  assist and encourage the growth of small, mi nority and women owned and controlled busi nesses. It is good public policy and helps the  businesses  involved,  the economy and  the  Postal Service. I encourage my colleagues to  support this measure.  A NATIONAL NETWORK OF  FREE COMMUNITY PHONES  HON. RON WYDEN  OF OREGON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
126,306,1,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago  the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co.  kicked-off  a  unique  program  to  help  the  needy. It's called the Community Connection,  and consists of free telephones for local serv ice at 14 centers around Oregon. Located at  senior  citizen  centers,  community  centers,  public assistance offices, and  the  like,  these  free phones have already been hailed as a  ringing success.  ",1988
127,319,1,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  since  early November, many of the Nation's news papers have collectively devoted a consider able  amount  of  editorial  attention-mostly  negative and completely unjustified-to  the  effort to upgrade the Veterans' Administration  to a Cabinet-level department.  Curiously, many of these editorials share an  entirely  too coincidental similarity  in words,  phrasing, and clicMs,  that suggests a con certed  effort  to  prevent  this  long-overdue  action.  I have  to wonder why when such a  move is in the best national interest, involves  insignificant costs, does not expand govern ment, and affords the Nation's defenders the  deference they have earned. Why would edi torial boards oppose it?  Perhaps Butch Joeckel, executive director  of  the Washington headquarters of  the Dis abled American Veterans, has hit upon one  reason for this media opposition. I would like  to share with my colleagues his thoughts on  the matter:  A DIVISIVE PEN  In the month after the House Committee  reported the bill on November 10 giving the  VA Cabinet rank, the Post published more  than a dozen articles, letters and columns  on the proposal. Three of the Post's four  editorials  against  the measure  appeared  before the Senate Committee's December 9  hearing  on  it.  Predictably,  the  paper's  report of that hearing headlined criticism of  the proposal despite  its virtually unques tioned likelihood of passage.  The unique intensity of the Post's cover age alone, not counting an indirect swipe at  the idea in an editorial about the Dallas  Cowboys,  invites attention. But the more  widespread editorial commentary provoked  by the legislation is more important to con sider.  We have found expressions of opinion in  about twenty newspapers <of some 1700 dai lies nationwide) during  the same month,  from cities that include New York, Wash ington, Philadelphia, Detroit and Atlanta.  All but one <from Waco, Texas> have op posed Cabinet status for the VA.  In addition to this rather remarkable uni formity of view,  the same  reasoning and  even phraseology recur with surprising fre quency. More than half of the editorials, for  example, condemn support for the proposal  by reference to ""special interest"" lobbying  for a larger share of the budget, and more  than half use the word ""clout"" to identify  the villain.  We would not be shocked to discover that  certain editorial  rooms have spoken with  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  each other about the matter. Nor are we  surprised to observe behavior that seems at  least to be conscious parallelism if not con certed action. Our concern  instead begins  with the hypocrisy suggested in the hostile  commentary.  The double standard is best illustrated by  the Post's second editorial <Nov. 25, 1987),  asserting that supporters of the bill claim  ""with a wink""  that it won't increase the  budget, when ""of course"" the Post knows  that isn't true. So much for the integrity of  the President, 399 House members and vet erans' organizations to which belong some  seven million Americans.  The Post then expects its own arguments  to be accepted at face value when, after  paying lip service to the ""special obligation""  owed veterans (as do three-fourths of the  editorials we have read), it goes on to wave  the  flag of deficit  reduction and declare  that at some point, that obligation expires.  Why should the Post's pious handwringing  over  the deficit be  accepted as  its  real  agenda any more than the Post accepts as  genuine the rationale of the bill's support ers?  A clue to what this double standard may  conceal is contained in the Post's first edito rial <Nov. 12, 1987), which says the budget  problem will ""only get worse"" as World War  II veterans become eligible for benefits by  reason of age <current average: 65). The ref erence has more than demographic signifi cance, because it begs comparison with the  unmentioned, new generation of veterans  from the Vietnam War <average age: 40).  The significance of the generational issue  is threefold. First, the different experience  of the two wars produced different attitudes  that have been a crucial element of the divi siveness that has adversely affected veter ans' affairs for the last decade. Second, no  one can doubt the professional skepticism  bred in the media by the government's in formation policy during the Vietnam War.  Third, the Vietnam generation  is now as suming leadership in America's institutions,  including the media.  Our theory is that for powerful historical  reasons, certain like-thinking press leaders  may be perpetuating the divisions of the  Vietnam War by unconsciously working out  their generational conflicts in the forum of  veterans' affairs. At least, continuation of  those divisions can be the effect of the mon olithic reaction of newspapers so far moved  to comment on a Department of Veterans  Affairs.  The country has lived enough with the  image of Vietnam veterans popularized by  those who profit financially from extreme  stereotypes, pitted against  the  twin Goli aths of an ungrateful society and an insensi tive generation of earlier veterans by those  who profit  ideologically  from seeming  to  occupy the moral high ground.  President Reagan supports Cabinet status  for the VA partly out of a desire to honor  Vietnam veterans and Congressman Mont gomery believes the move will help heal the  wounds of the Vietnam era. Both are World  War II veterans. Every veterans' organiza tion  representative who  testified  at  the  Senate hearing on the bill, all of whom sup ported it, was a Vietnam veteran.  It is time to reflect the reality that Viet nam veterans are welcomed, not  to  say  treasured, part of the national mainstream  and that, in the critical area of veterans' af fairs, the older generation and the younger  are mutually reaching across the vanishing  divisions to face a united future.  We hope  that 1988-twenty years from  the Tet Offensive-will see  the establish319  ment of a Cabinet department in recogni tion of this truth, and as an occasion for  turning pens as well as swords into plow shares.

A FAREWELL TO NANCY PIGMAN  HON. ROBERT GARCIA  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 27, 1988  ",1988
128,319,1,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman of  the Subcommittee on  International Finance,  Trade, and Monetary Policy, I would like to ac knowledge the career of Ms. Nancy S. Pigman  in public service which spans 34 years-14  years  in Congress and 20 as Congressional  Relations Officer  for  the U.S. Export-Import  Bank.  Ms. Pigman joined the Eximbank in August  1967. She headed  the Bank's congressional  relations staff and was Eximbank's legislative  liaison with the U.S. Congress. Her job includ ed monitoring all  legislation directly affecting  or of interest to the Bank, responding to myr iads of requests for information from Members  of Congress and congressional committees,  and preparing appearances of Bank officers  before Congress.  Before  her  career with  Eximbank, Ms.  Pigman was an  intern  in  the office of U.S.  Congressman Jacob K. Javits of New York  and appropriations and legislative assistant to  U.S. Senator Leverett Saltonstall of Massa chusetts.  Thursday, January 28, 1988, will be Ms. Pig man's last day at the Eximbank but a begin ning of a new phase in life-retirement. Con gress will be  losing a valued  friend and  re source. Ms. Pigman was of top caliber among  the  congressional  relations officers of  the  Federal agencies. Having worked both  for  Congress and  the Bank, Ms. Pigman knew  well how to keep harmonious the relationship  between Congress and  the Eximbank. Many  of us who have dealt with her have truly bene fited from her thorough understanding of Ex imbank's  programs  and  the  congressional  process.  I congratulate  her  for her dedication  to  public service and would like to thank her for  a job well done.  I along with the subcommit tee members and staff will miss her dearly  and wish her Godspeed.  FREE WORLD LOSES GREAT  ALLY  HON. RICHARD K.

130,332,1,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President,  I  thank my colleague from Utah, Sena tor HATCH, for yielding time.  I rise not only as a cosponsor of the  amendment before us, but as one who  supports the general principles of the  Civil Rights Restoration Act. In light  of  the Supreme Court's decision  in  Grove City, there is a clear need to  strengthen and expand coverage of  the four civil rights statutes banning  various forms of discrimination in pro grams and activities that receive Fed eral funds.  With this said, however, I am also  troubled by several aspects of this bill,  including  its  impact on first amend ment rights as they relate to religious  liberty. Our country was founded on  principles of diversity and pluralism,  particularly with regard to the free ex ercise of religious beliefs as guaran teed by the Constitution. As currently  drafted, this bill does not adequately  protect these rights.  Let me explain. Title IX of the Edu cation Amendments of 1972, which I  voted for, prohibits gender discrimina tion in educational programs or activi ties  receiving  Federal  funds. That  title, however, contained an exemption  for educational institutions which are  ""controlled by  a  religious organization."" Under this exemption, an educa tional institution may seek an exemp tion from  the provisions of title IX  where application of that title ""would  not be consistent with  the religious  tenets of such organization."" Many  private religious colleges and universi ties teach fundamental religious prin ciples on such topics as marriage, chas tity, and abortion. Some religious edu cational  institutions, while believing  that educational and other opportuni ties  for men and women should be  fully  and completely  available,  also  teach  that  particular  distinctions  based on gender are both natural and  religiously significant. While this may  not be the viewpoint of any Senator,  surely we  all  support  the  right of  those institutions to follow the tenets  of their religion.  In 1972, the vast majority of these  religious  schools were directly  con trolled  by  church  denominations,  catholic dioceses and other religious  organizations. The current exemption  was adequate to protect each school's  first amendment right to the free ex ercise of their religious beliefs. I em phasize that was in 1972.  However, the form of association be tween these religious entities and their  private colleges and universities has  evolved over the past 16 years. And I  doubt if there are many Senators here  that are  fully  acquainted with  this  evolution. Today, many of these edu cational institutions, while still hold ing to their religious beliefs and doc trine, are controlled by lay boards and  have  additional  sources of  funding  beyond the religious organization.  Mr. President,  it  is pretty obvious  with the economics of private colleges  today,  that  they must  look beyond  those  denominational  constituencies  for sources of funding. They could not  exist if they did not.  The  ""religious  tenets""  exemption  from application of title IX, as pres ently worded, does not reflect this cur rent form of relationship in these in stitutions. Accordingly,  the ""control""  test for application of the exemption  no longer affords adequate protection  for religious values under title IX. The  current exemption must be amended  to reflect the changed nature of reli giously oriented institutions.  The amendment before us restores  full protection of religious values by  providing an exemption from title IX  based on  religious  tenets not only  when the institution is controlled by a  religious organization, but also when  an  educational  institution  ""closely  identifies with the tenets of"" that reli gious organization.  Keep in mind that we do not seek to  ""loosen"" this exemption. I am an ada mant supporter of the full application  of all civil rights laws. After 37 years  in public life,  I  think that record is  pretty well established. But I do not  share the fear that this amendment  in  will somehow create a loophole result ing  in widespread discrimination  education. This  amendment  simply  seeks to restore fully the constitution al protection of the free exercise of re ligious beliefs in religious educational  institutions,  therefore satisfying  the  intent of Congress when  it adopted  the ""religious  tenets"" exemption  to  title IX in 1972. The amendment will  protect  important nondiscriminatory  principles embodied  in  title  IX and  other civil rights statutes.  Let me remind my colleagues what  this amendment will not do. It is very  limited in scope and does not allow a  college to unilaterally claim a blanket  exemption from all  title IX require ments. There must be a policy or poli cies embodying a particular religious  tenet and a particular title IX regula tion  regarding gender discrimination  in conflict before the exemption will  apply. We still hold the control over  this, Mr. President, under  this act.  Title IX coverage will properly apply  to all other aspects of the institution's  activities.  Further, under the regulations pro mulgated by the Department of Edu cation, a college must still apply for  the exemption. The Department of  Education reviews each exemption re quest submitted, and grants or denies  the request based on the facts present ed. The Department of Education re tains  jurisdiction  to  investigate any  complaints or concerns raised regard ing the school's connection with the  particular religious organization, or if  there is concern about the legitimacy  of  the religious  tenet articulated by  the school.  Nor does the amendment permit an  educational  institution  to claim pro tection for differentiation on the basis  of race, handicap, or age. These civil  rights statutes are fully applicable.  Finally, the exemption is only avail able to schools which are ""controlled""  by a religious organization or ""closely  identified with the tenets of a particu lar religious organization."" The  lan guage places reasonable limits on the  class of eligible religious organizations.  Let me repeat, Mr. President, that  this amendment does not abrogate the  intent of title IX; but rather, reflects  the  actual  structure  of  religious  higher  education. The  amendment  strikes  a  constitutional balance be tween the need to promote the princi ples of equal rights, while allowing for  the legitimate exercise of religious lib erty.  Let  us  remember  that  the  first  amendment guarantees religious liber ty as well as free speech and other  rights.  This amendment has the support of  many organizations, including the U.S.  Catholic Conference, the National As sociation of Independent Colleges and  Universities, the Christian College Co",1988

The  issue before us  is simple, and  that is whether the U.S. Senate wants  to leave up to the Federal courts and  the regulatory agencies the possibility  of  requiring hospitals,  colleges, and  universities to fund or perform abor tions when abortions are contrary to  the moral sentiments or religious sen timents of  those organizations. It is  very simple.  The  characterization  by  Senator  METZENBAUM  is absolutely erroneous.  There is no element of discrimination.  This does not have anything  to do  with Roe versus Wade. The question is  not whether a woman has the right to  an abortion, but the right to pick a  hospital to give her an abortion or to  have it paid for by a hospital or insti tution or has a physician that is con trary to the basic principle of abor tion.

140,358,1,Mr. PACKWOOD.," I thank the Sena tor.  Mr. President,  it has been said  in  this debate that this is not about Roe  versus Wade or not about the right of  a woman to have an abortion, that it is  solely  involved with  the question of  whether or not we are going to compel  Baylor University or Notre Dame to  provide or  to  do  abortions  against  their will.  Respectfully, Mr. President,  I  say  that is not the issue. The issue is mul tif old. One is that there is a certain  antiwoman animus in the attitude of  the proponents of  this amendment.  Two, there is no question but that any  school  that has  any  religious  con science can get out from under these  regulations altogether.  I  do not know where  the  figures  came  from  that  the Senator  from  Texas had, but I will quote a  letter  from the Office of Civil Rights, May  19, 1987. This is from the Reagan ad ministration Office of Civil Rights:  The Office  of Civil Rights has never  denied a request for religious exemption. No  requests for religious exemption are pend ing at this time.  There  have  been  a  number  of  schools  that refused  to comply. For  whatever reason, they did not ask the  Government for a religious exemption.  But do you mean, has any school  ever been turned down for a religious  exemption? The answer is no.  Let me read just some of the schools  that have obtained  the exemptions:  Brigham Young; St. John's in Minne sota; Cumberland College; Columbia  Union College; Catholic University;  George Fox  in my home State of  Oregon;  Pepperdine  in  California;  Union University, in Tennessee; Seton  Hall.  I  ask unanimous consent  there be  submitted for the RECORD and printed  in the RECORD a list of 142 colleges as  of October 25, 1985, that had request ed exemptions and received them. I do  not have the list beyond that date.  ",1988

142,371,1,Mr. HARKIN.," In the case of a small  provider, more is provided by this bill.  As I said, we have this last resort pro vision  that says  if they have  fewer  than  15  employees,  then  they  can  ref er the person to another provider  where the facilities are accessible. So  we leave plenty of room in there for  the mom and pops who absolutely do  not want to build that ramp, who do  not want to provide the facility to help  a handicapped person to shop in that  store. They can ref er them down the  street to someone else who has such  accessibility. That is not too much to  ask in our society.  In 1964, we passed the Civil Rights  Act  in  this country. We said people  could not discriminate on the basis of  race, religion, sex, or national origin.  In 1973, we passed the National Reha bilitation Act, section 504, which the  Senator is amending, extending those  rights to handicapped people but only  to those who are recipients of Federal  aid.  I will go the Senator one better: We  have to extend the same Civil Rights  Act of 1964 that applied to individuals  of this country on the basis of sex, re ligion,  race,  and national origin  to  handicapped people, too. We are not  doing that here.  We are saying  that under section  504,  those  small  amounts  of  civil  rights we give to handicapped people  in terms of accessibility in our society,  we  are going  to assure  those  civil  rights.  To back off with an amendment like  that we back down on our commit ment to handicapped people to equal  treatment in our society. It is a step  backward that no one in this Senate, I  am sure, wants to take.  EXHIBIT 1  CONSORTIUM  FOR  CITIZENS WITH  'DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,  January 28, 1988.  DEAR SENATOR: The undersigned member  organizations of  the Consortium for Citi zens with Developmental Disabilities strong ly urges you to reject Senator Humphrey's  proposed amendment  to  the Civil Rights  Restoration Act which would exempt small  providers  from  compliance  requirements  currently in place under Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As representa tives of many of America's 36 million citi zens with disabilities, we find it most discon certing that Congress would consider limit ing already existing protections in the proc ess of restoring those which were lost.  Senator Humphrey has wrongly charac terized  the  requirements embodied under  the Section 504  regulations  as  ""burden some"", somehow failing  to  recognize  that  those very regulations do in fact provide for  an extremely flexible small provider excep tion. This exception has anticipated the po tential difficulties which might be faced by  a small provider, and provides for a variety  of options which will allow the recipient to  comply with program accessibility require ments. In fact, since their inception in 1977,  the existing regulations have so well met  the  intent of Congress and  the needs of  small providers, that they have been direct ly incorporated into the Civil Rights Resto ration Act under Section 4.  In enacting the Rehabilitation Act fifteen  years ago, Congress understood the signifi cant barriers faced in our society by persons  with disabilities and sought to assure that  at least those segments of society which had  access to the resources of the federal gov ernment would not engage in the continuing  discrimination  against  and  exclusion  of  America's largest minority. It is unaccept able to permit any recipient of federal funds  to  engage  in  the  discriminatory  actions  which would be permitted under Senator  Humphrey's proposal.  Senator Humphrey's amendment  is not  only unnecessary, it will roll back the clock  on  the  progress  already made.

143,371,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, Senator  HUMPHREY'S  amendment  to  exempt  ""small providers"" from any responsi bility to provide access to persons with  physical handicaps is another response  to apprehensions rather than reality,  and I urge my colleagues to reject it.  When  the  section 504  regulations  were promulgated by HEW  in 1977,  small providers were given alternatives  to  making  expensive  structural  changes in their facilities. The regula tions for all  recipients require ""pro gram accessibility""; structural changes  are frequently not necessary to ensure  that the program or activity is avail able  to  individuals with handicaps.  The regulations  for small providers,  those with fewer than 15 employees,  are even more flexible. To avoid signif icant costs to small, low-budget provid ers,  the  regulations provide another  alternative; if small providers cannot  make their programs accessible, they  may ref er individuals with handicaps  to other providers which are accessi ble.  The bill responds to concerns that  have continued to be raised by those  who are not familiar with the flexibil ity of the existing regulations. S. 557  includes the small provider exception  from the regulations to indicate clear ly  that small providers are not  re quired to make significant structural  alterations to their existing facilities.

On my copy of the com promise, which  again  I would  just  compliment  the Senator  from New  Hampshire and his staff for working  on so diligently to reach a compromise  in this, the language that I have here  basically has a question mark after the  word ""handicaps."" That is in the third  sentence, ""to individuals with handi caps."" That is why I did not under stand the last little clause that was  added and I would have to have some  time to think about that. I am sorry.  ",1988
147,384,1,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Somehow we got  two different copies here. I would be  happy to end my question with  the  question mark after the word ""handi caps.""  ",1988
148,384,1,Mr. HARKIN.," I appreciate that. I  am not certain that I know what ex actly  that does, but,  if  the Senator  would,  I would appreciate  it and  I  would respond, then, to the Senator's  question by saying that: Yes,  indeed,  that is my understanding.  ",1988
149,384,1,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Finally, is it the  Senator's understanding, as we stated  in 1978 with respect  to alcohol and  drug abusers, that the two-step proc ess in section 504 applies in the situa tion under which it was  first deter mined that a person was handicapped  and  then  it  is  determined  that  a  person is otherwise qualified?  ",1988
150,384,1,Mr. HARKIN.," Yes.  I  do  under stand-yes, that is my understanding.  ",1988
151,384,1,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr. President,  this  amendment would undo  the United  States Supreme Court's decision  in  School Board of Nassau County versus  Arline, which held  that  individuals  with contagious diseases  are handi capped within the meaning of section  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  and are therefore protected from dis crimination based on  their medical  condition.  The factual question posed in Arline  was narrow: Are employees suffering  from  contagious diseases  subject  to  automatic termination, without regard  for any actual incapacity or risk of in fection? The Court's answer was corre spondingly clear: Groundless fears do  not alone justify terminating an em ployee with a contagious disease.  The question in Arline surfaced in  the Supreme Court because, in adopt ing the Rehabilitation Act, Congress  had given statutory protection to the  handicapped without enumerating the  specific conditions  to which  the act  would apply. Of course, Congress cus tomarily acts by categories; groups are  as central to the legislative process as  cases are to the courts. Still, it is easier  to articulate a general principal than  to apply it in a threatening situation  or uphold it in a difficult case.  The Rehabilitation Act was needed  and  passed  because  human  beings  often harbor an unreasonable dread of  diseases and disorders. It is precisely  because AIDS  is surrounded by  this  same unreasonable and unwarranted  fear and distaste  that the Supreme  Court's decision was  sensible. The  logic of  the Rehabilitation Act de mands that we make no distinctions  where no reasonable grounds for dif ferentiation exist.  In adopting an amendment contrary  to  the Arline  decision,  we  would  embody the prejudices that we over came and precluded in the Rehabilita tion Act. However, a number of un pleasant realities pertaining to AIDS  give us additional reasons to reject the  proposed amendment.  Some of us, and many Americans,  seem  to  feel  that we  can confront  people with AIDS as adversaries or en emies and forcibly control the spread  of AIDS. I don't believe that would be  morally acceptable, but even if it were,  it is impossible. We will control AIDS  only through cooperation, education,  and respect.  By September 18, 1987, the Center  for Disease  Control  had  reported  51,361 cases of AIDS, and it was clear  then that many cases had not been  properly diagnosed or reported. The  Public Health Service estimates that  more than 270,000 cases of AIDS will  be diagnosed by 1991. According to the  CDC,  there may be as many as 100  people who carry HIV, the virus that  causes AIDS,  for  each person with  AIDS. An estimated 25-50 percent of  those who are HIV positive may devel op AIDS within 5 to 10 years.  I hope that we will not resort to har assing and rejecting people who have  been exposed to AIDS. In any event, it  is clear that we do not have the capac ity to identify and control the millions  of people who may become contagious  with AIDS, half of whom may never  display any symptoms, and most of  whom would not be eager to be diag nosed and subjected to discrimination.  A program of contact tracing, for ex ample, would become impossible under  such circumstances. A  threat of  im prisonment is not likely to be very eff ective against someone who has been  diagnosed with AIDS, even if our pris ons were equipped to hold numbers of  fatally ill individuals.  Only with the trust and cooperation  of those who suffer from AIDS, can  we  continue  to seek effective  treat ment for AIDS, and to discover treat ments that prevent antibody-positive  individuals  from developing  the dis ease.  Even if our compassion fails us in  the  face of AIDS,  I hope  that our  powers of reason will still allow us to  recognize the realities that must dic tate our response to AIDS. It is futile  to call for measures that cannot beef fective and simply reflect our most un worthy reactions to AIDS, drug users,  and homosexuals. Further, we would  generate panic and cruelty  that we  could never extinguish.  Instead, we  must commit ourselves  to a  realistic  and balanced approach to AIDS. We  can begin by rejecting  the proposed  amendment.  ",1988
152,384,1,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr.  President,  the form of agreement is that, at least  on the part of the Senator from Iowa  and the Senator from New Hampshire,  there would be no further debate or  discussion at this point.

RESPONSE OF SENATOR BYRD  AND  SPEAKER WRIGHT  TO  THE  PRESIDENT'S STATE OF  THE UNION  ",1988
164,397,1,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  on last Monday evening, January 25,  1988,  the President  of  the United  States delivered  to  the Congress  a  message on the State of the Union. By  tradition, the party not occupying the  White House is afforded the priviledge  to respond to the President's address.  It was with  great  pride  that  I  watched, as did other West Virginians,  the Democratic view of the State of  the Union. Along with the Speaker of  the House  of Representatives,  JIM  WRIGHT, my distinguished and  able  senior colleague,  the majority leader  of the U.S. Senate, Senator ROBERT C.  BYRD, stated their view of the State of  the Union to America.  Mr.  President,  I  commend  the  leader, and Speaker WRIGHT, for their  fine  remarks  to  the people of  this  country.  I ask unanimous consent that Sena tor BYRD'S and Speaker WRIGHT'S re marks be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  re marks were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER ROBERT c. BYRD DEMOCRATIC VIEW OF THE STATE OF THE  UNION  The state of the union has changed dra matically  since my boyhood  in  the coal  fields of West Virigina. I grew up in the De pression yearsand came to Washington as  Harry Truman was leaving office. I've seen  America in distress. And I've seen us at our  best-innovative, forceful, generous.  I've  learned a  thing or  two about  the  greatness of America and what holds us to gether. I've learned how quickly adversity  strikes-the stock market crash of '29, Pearl  Harbor,  the death of John Kennedy-and  how our country struggled back each time  to renewed vision and strength.  I've also learned that predictions of the  future more often bear the glitter of hope  than the tarnish of reality.  Tonight House Speaker Jim Wright and I  will take a  look at the state of the union  from a different perspective. We will ex plore what government has done-and what  it must do in the future. Our assessment of  America will be  tougher  than  the Presi dent's. But it's anchored to the same faith  in our peopleand the same hopes for the  future.  I'm  a  Democrat whose  politics were  shaped in an era of hard times-from the  small world of coal mines and company  stores.  Back then my foster father earned  two  dollars a day as a miner. Our life was as  spare as it was close-knit. As a small commu nity we hung  together-and endured. We  had our disappointments and our sorrows.  There was no such  thing as unemploy ment compensation, or social security. Our  horizons were limited-and our choices few.  I graduated as valedictorian of my high  school and was lucky to get a job pumping  gas at $50 a month.  But out of that grim time came a Presi dent and a government that lifted the spirit  of America. Never before-or since-has this  nation been galvanized by such force.  We came out of World War II with a new  confidence-and a  new promise. For  the  first time my people-working people-had  some security against deep poverty. We had  better working conditions in the mines. The  elderly didn't have to turn to their children  to take them in.  Looking back, we did the obvious. We rose  to the crises of our time. Yet, for me, the  images remain-and with  them  the  truth  that government is best measured by how  well it responds to the peoples' needs.  Since then I have watched this nation and its government-seek its way through a  changing maze of economic and political cir cumstances-from Medicare  to  the Great  Society. The anguish that was Vietnam. The  arrogance that was Watergate. The promise  that was Camp David.  Then dawned the Reagan years-and the  profound experiment. If the Roosevelt and  Truman presidencies were born of necessity,  the presidency of Ronald Reagan was born  of  ideology-and  a  technicolor  view  of  America and our people.  It opened with the promise to get govern ment off our backs. It offered the mystical  formula of ""supply side"" economics which  claimed  that a huge buildup of military  spending and enormous tax cuts for corpo rations and the rich would lead to a bal anced budget in three years. It was an Ad ministration  that sought to make us feel  good with images of ""morning in America.""  It was a time when the President and his  presidency became separated in our minds.  As a man, Ronald Reagan has withstood  physical pain with grace. He has carried the  nation's grief at times of loss. He has always  been at ease with his beliefs. A man who can  touch the nation's humor-and make us feel  better than we sometimes should.  As  President,  his  greatest  victory  has  come at the negotiating table. The arms re duction  treaty,  though  limited  is a mile stone on the road to a safer world.  But his political victories have not always  been national triumphs.  The dark side of the Reagan years has  only begun to loom. Instead of a balanced  budget, he has presided over a doubling of  the national debt in seven years. Our record  budget and trade deficits-once just abstract  numbers-have now forced the government  to default on its most fundamental prom ises-like education and health. We have  surrendered economic leadership in markets  around the world.  Our nation has been sharply divided on  the question of Central America. The secret  arms-for-hostages deals stand in direct con tradiction to our given word not to deal with  terrorists. The cases of cronyism and abuses  of power  for  personal  gain  continue  to  mount in Washington's courtrooms.  We've come  to  the end of an era. The  ""feel good""  slogans have gone  flat with  time. We've  learned  that bravado  is not  leadershipthat  ideology  is no substitute  for common sense.  The time has finally come for us all to  face the hard truths that once gave us our  self-reliance  and world  leadership. Hard  work-on the job and in the classroom. Pay  as you go-no free lunches, no running away  from the bills due. Helping those in need but not those with greed.  It was right here on the Senate Floor that  Congress worked with Franklin Roosevelt to  help end the Depression-and to win a war.  ",1988
165,410,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  since June 1981, over 28,000 people  have died of AIDS. One-quarter of  these deaths, 7 ,000 people, have result ed from intravenous drug use. Accord ing to the Centers for Disease Control,  between 50 and 60 percent of intrave nous drug users, as many as 335,000,  are infected with the AIDS virus.  The AIDS virus  is spread through  the interaction of bodily fluids. This  occurs when a needle used  to inject  heroin is used by another individual to  do  the  same. That needle has  the  blood of  the  first user, which  the  second user is exposed to when using  the same needle. This is the primary  way in which AIDS is spread among  intravenous drug users.  It is not only the intravenous drug  users themselves that are contracting  AIDS. They are spreading AIDS  to  their sexual partners and children. All  these people will die; 53 percent of all  AID-related deaths in New York City  occur among intravenous drug users.  As many as 350 children have died al ready from the AIDS virus contracted  from their mother, and the number of  children born with the AIDS virus is  growing daily. According  to a  study  conducted by Dr. Lloyd Novick, 1 out  of every 60 newborns  in New York  City are born with the AIDS virus.  Children are dying. Mothers and fa thers are dying. We are witness to this  and seem powerless to stop it.  But we are not powerless.  We have the means to reach these  people, break their habit, and stop the  spread of AIDS.  This is not the first time intravenous  drug use has threatened to wipe out a  good number of people in our society.  In 1969, when I was a Special Assist ant for Urban Affairs  for President  Nixon, the crisis was heroin, a narcotic  derived from the poppy plant. At that  time, poppy plants were grown primar ily in Turkey, processed into heroin in  Marseilles,  and  then  smuggled  into  New York.  In order  to cut off  the supply of  heroin, I persuaded the President to  provide  financial  assistance  to help  Turkish farmers make the transition  from a poppy-based to a more general  agricultural economy. With our help,  the program to eradicate illicit poppy  production succeeded and the French  Connection  collapsed,  creating  a  severe  shortage of heroin  in  every  major drug center in the country.  It worked. Heroin use  in all our  cities went down. Crime went down.  But now poppy production has moved  to Pakistan, Burma,  and Thailand.  Iran and Syria have replaced France  as heroin processing centers. We have  had some cooperation with these coun tries to stop poppy production but not  enough. In the last decade, heroin use  has reemerged, and with the onset of  AIDS, has become even more destruc tive.  Just last year, in an effort to control  the  growing  problem, Congress  en acted a major antidrug abuse law. It  authorized $1.7 billion for prevention  and treatment of illicit drug use and  research into ways of breaking drug  addiction, most  notably with  sub stances known as narcotic antagonists  which block nerve endings so that the  effects of narcotics cannot be felt by  the user. But the Reagan administra tion, less than 4 months after the en actment of this much touted piece of  legislation, proposed a $900 million cut  in antidrug abuse programs. Fortu nately, Congress was able  to restore  some of this money, but not nearly  enough.  The bill I introduce today, the Intra venous Drug Abuse and AIDS Preven tion Act, was introduced by Congress man RANGEL on September 16, 1987. As  chairman of the House Select Commit tee on Narcotics, Congressman RANGEL  has led the long and difficult battle  against drug abuse. I have been privi leged to work with him in the past and  am proud to do so again.  This bill seeks to attack this problem  where it lives. It provides $100 million  for  the  Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services  to make grants for  nonprofit organizations for treatment  services to intravenous drug users; 75  percent of these funds will go to areas  with a high incidence of drug use and  AIDS. The  remaining 25 percent of  funds will go  to areas which have a  low incidence of AIDS but a high inci dence of drug use and therefore have  the potential for widespread AIDS in fection.  In addition, $50 million is authorized  for demonstration projects to reduce  the incidence of AIDS in infants and  to care for infants infected with AIDS.  These funds could be used to provide  prenatal care for women who are in travenous drug users, services to par ents of infected children, foster care  for children with AIDS, counseling,  education  and  testing  services  for  women at risk for AIDS by virtue of  drug use or sexual contact with drug  users, and pregnant women  infected  with the AIDS virus.  Lastly, $50 million  is provided for  grants  for outreach and counseling  programs to prevent intravenous drug  use among minority groups. We have  appropriated $14 million specifically  for outreach AIDS education to mi nority communities. Too little.  The  responsibility  is  clear:  If we  don't inform our citizens of the dan gers of drug use in and of itself and its  direct link to the spread of AIDS, we  fail in our duty as public officials and  as fellow human beings.  I ask unanimous consent that an edi torial  in the January 23, 1988, New  York Times entitled, ""Contain AIDS  by Treating Addicts"" be printed in the  RECORD.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill and ask unanimous consent that  the text be printed in the RECORD  in  full.  There being no objection,  the bill  and  the  letter were ordered  to be  printed in the RECORD, as follows:  s. 2014  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION J. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Intravenous  Substance Abuse and AIDS Prevention Act  of 1988"".  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds that:  < 1) More  than 38,000 cases of acquired  immune deficiency syndrome <AIDS) have  been reported  to  the Centers for Disease  Control, and more than 270,000 such cases  are expected to be reported by 1991.  (2) Intravenous substance abusers are the  second largest group in the United States  that has AIDS. Of the cases of AIDS report ed to the Centers for Disease Control, 17  percent are attributable to intravenous sub stance abuse and such abuse was a  risk  factor in an additional 8 percent.  (3) HIV <the virus causing AIDS) is trans mitted among intravenous substance abus ers through the use and sharing of needles,  syringes, swabs, or other drug-related imple ments that are contaminated with blood in fected with HIV.  < 4) HIV can be transmitted rapidly among  intravenous substance abusers in a given ge ographic area. Once a group of intravenous  substance abusers becomes exposed to HIV,  such abusers become the primary source for  heterosexual  transmission  and  perinatal  transmission of HIV.  ",1988
166,449,1,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  this Saturday,  January 30, 1988, our colleague from Massa chusetts, BARNEY FRANK, will be honored by  the  Japanese American  community  for his  outstanding work on  redress  legislation. This  honor comes as no surprise,  for BARNEY'S  tireless work as chairman of the Subcommit tee on Administrative Law and Governmental  Relations was crucial to the development and  eventual passage of H.R. 442, the Civil Liber ties Act of 1987.  BARNEY'S outstanding efforts on behalf of  this legislation add to a lengthy list of his con tributions  to  the  cause of civil  rights and  human dignity. His  involvement  in  the civil  rights movement, his career in the Massachu setts House  of Representatives,  and  his  record  in Congress distinguish BARNEY as a  foremost advocate  for  justice and  fairness.  BARNEY FRANK has established himself as a  passionate and articulate defender of the prin ciples which have made the United States the  great Nation it is today.  Mr. Speaker, by  forcing Japanese Ameri cans into internment camps, the United States  Government strayed from its pursuit of liberty  and  justice. We are  fortunate, however,  to  have a colleague like BARNEY FRANK to help  this Nation straighten its course.  19-059 0-89-15 (Pt. 1)  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  SAN FRANCISCO GIRLS CHORUS  IS CHOSEN TO PERFORM  IN  HUNGARY  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 1988  ",1988
167,449,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure  to announce today that when the Bela Bartek  International Choir Competition is held in Hun gary in July,  the San Francisco Girls Chorus  will be representing the United States-indeed  it will be the only group from America at this  most important event.  Hungary  is  the world  center  for  choral  music, especially for girls and young women.  Competing there means that the San Francis co Girls Chorus has reached the top level of  girls choirs  in  the United States. Founded  in  1978 by Elizabeth Appling at  the suggestion  of Kurt Herbert Adler and Richard Bradshaw  of  the San Francisco Opera,  the chorus  is  made up of girls from 7 to 16. Rehearsals are  twice weekly, and the chorus members, in ad dition  to choral performances, participate  in  dramatic productions and a summer camp.  Advanced singers are selected  to sing with  the San Francisco Opera. The group has  toured the Pacific Northwest, West Germany,  England, and has performed at  the White  House.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to commend  the San  Francisco Girls Chorus and everyone associ ated with it as they look forward to competing  on a world stage with the world's best choirs.  They are a credit  to San Francisco and  to  America.  DUMPING ON ""OCEAN  DUMPING''  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 1988  ",1988
168,449,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, the waste man agement crisis facing the Nation has only in creased the urgency to resolve the dilemma in  disposal and  treatment methods. With more  wastes  accumulating  and  overflowing  from  landfills, one of  the more pressing environ mental effects of the resultant dumping has  been on the ocean.  The landfill crunch makes several things ap parent. First, since only so much waste can fit  into a limited amount of land, available space  for waste disposal is increasingly going out of  circulation. Better approaches to deal with the  crisis are needed. Yet despite  its mandate,  the Environmental Protection Agency  is not  enforcing the already existing laws regulating  disposal and ocean dumping.  Second, with  the need  to ensure  that  the  Nation's wastes are not released into the eco system to damage any further the fragile envi ronment, not enough has been done to em phasize  the existence of available  technol ogies in coping with the crisis.  In the economics of the garbage crisis, the  demand for disposal space has been exceed ing the supply. With nowhere to go, more and  449  more municipal sludge  is winding up  in our  Nation's water systems. And since much of  those wastes carry  the  threat of pollution,  there  is a corresponding need  to  treat  the  wastes to a greater extent.  In the State of New Jersey, with the closing  of many important landfills because of a lack  of available capacity,  the ocean has become  the quick fix in getting rid of whatever unwant ed material our Nation produces.  However, almost  invariably included  in  the  waste material discharged  into  the Atlantic  and Pacific Oceans and into the Nation's es tuaries and river systems are such hazardous  pollutants as PCB's and substances such as  plastic.  In New Jersey, half of the total sludge pro duced within  the boundaries of  the State  is  eventually discharged offshore into the Atlan tic Ocean.  When  the  totals  across  the Nation are  added up,  the amount of waste spilling  into  the Nation's aquatic ecosystems  tops more  than 15 million tons, including 7 million metric  tons of municipal sewage and 8 million metric  tons of dredged material.  Recently, under the auspices of the Trans portation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials  Subcommittee  chaired  by  Congressman  THOMAS LUKEN, a  field hearing was held  in  Hoboken, NJ. At  this hearing,  industry and  community leaders voiced not only their con cerns about obstacles in the development of  these technologies but also their demonstrat ed  potential  in  reducing  the  toxicity  and  amount of wastes  that are dumped  in  the  ocean.  Concentrating on  alternative  technologies  available currently or in the near future once  testing of those technologies has been com pleted, the hearing focused on two concerns.  First of all,  the  technologies and  the  re sources do exist for municipalities all over the  Nation  to reduce  the amount of wastes  that  ultimately must be disposed of with the con ventional methods and  the  toxicity of  the  wastes which end up in the ocean.  Second,  it also demonstrated  that the de velopers of  these  technologies are  facing a  stone wall in their efforts to make these tech nologies the cornerstone of an  improved and  more efficient disposal process.  Although  the EPA  is charged with  the en forcement of statutes presently on the books,  including  the  1978 Marine Protection, Re search, and Sanctuaries Act and  the Clean  Water Act's regulation of municipal discharges  into the ocean, the EPA has yet to display the  necessary enthusiasm in enforcing these laws.  What is needed now is not only to make the  EPA  live up  to its congressional mandate of  enforcing the  laws but also to turn  the spot light on alternative technologies for waste dis posal and treatment.  I am including below an article by Liv Osby,  a reporter for the Daily Record of Morristown,  NJ, detailing this hearing on the different ap proaches available  to  resolve  this crisis. As  she has done many times in the past while a  reporter covering  the state of affairs in New  Jersey, in this article, Ms. Osby thoroughly ex amines  the pressing needs created by  the  crisis.

197,488,1,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, as we  approach our vote on additional aid to  the Contras, I have tried to provide  for myself a careful, objective analysis  of the dangers and opportunities of  Central America. For a century and  more its people have been the victims  of exploitation, high-handed interfer ence, and our well-intentioned but in adequate  economic  assistance. More  recently and positively, those nations  establishing  democratically  elected  governments have had our encourage ment and support in their successful  efforts. We are, at  this moment  in  Washington, observing, and influenc ing beyond what might be our inten tion or our privilege, a turning point in  the arduous history of this still-prom ising region of the Western World.  THE PEACE PLAN  The situation requires wisdom and  diplomacy. There is a proposed Cen tral American  solution,  the Arias  peace  plan. All  Central American  countries have signed and are support ing it. It deserves our understanding  and support. In all the five nations  there are forces ready to champion a  free society and def end the freedoms  the  people  have  already  achieved.  They need our encouragement.  The shaky danger is that there is an  instability in the governments of per haps three of these nations, making  them vulnerable to a return to mili tary or other forms of dictatorship.  Our  task  is  to help  them stabilize.  This peace plan will do  just that. It  commits the five nations to no armed  aggression,  to national reconciliation  of opposing groups, to human rights,  to open and democratic elections, and  opens the way to broad economic and  social development.  Our hesitancy, our dilemma, is that  in one of the nations, Nicaragua, there  is a government we consider unaccept able. Its leaders are avowedly Marxist,  ",1988
198,527,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  authorize the addition of certain lands  to  the Congaree  Swamp National  Monument and to implement portions  of a  proposed general management  plan prepared in 1987 by the National  Park Service.  In May 1976, it was my privilege to  introduce  legislation authorizing  the  establishment of the Congaree Swamp  National Monument, one of the few  remaining examples of an old-growth,  southern bottomland forest. The Con garee Swamp lies primarily along the  north bank of the Congaree River, ap proximately 20 miles southeast of Co lumbia, SC. It is a uniquely forested  lowland area.  In October  of  that  same  year,  former President Ford signed into law  legislation  to  preserve  and  protect  lands of the Congaree River floodplain  for future generations. That legisla tion also directed the Secretary of the  Interior  to develop and  transmit  to  Congress a general management plan  for the use and development of the  Congaree Swamp National Monument.  A draft version of the general man agement plan was submitted to Con gress in 1987. The legislation I am in troducing today would implement this  plan with modifications.  Title I of this bill would designate  substantially all of the acreage within  the existing Congaree Swamp Monu ment as wilderness area. Moreover the  acreage proposed to be added to the  monument in title II of this bill, but  not yet Federal property, would be de signed potential wilderness area. This  is necessary to protect the area until  Federal acquisition.  Wilderness designation means  just  what it says-this area is wilderness. It  will be preserved in its natural condi tion.  As a general rule, hiking, camping,  canoeing and fishing are permissible in  wilderness areas. However, pursuant to  statute, there is a prohibition on com mercial enterprises, structures and in stallations, permanent and temporary  roads,  motor  vehicles,  motorized  equipment,  motorboats  and  other  forms of mechanical transportation in  such area, all in keeping with the pur pose of the National Wildness Preser vation System.  Title II of the bill would increase the  acreage of the monument to a  level  many familiar with the area believe is  necessary to fully protect the monu ment. This legislation would add up to  7,000 acres, primarily along the north ern, southern, and eastern borders of  the swamp. The acreage to be added  represents what is known as the Citi zens Boundary Proposal, which was  developed by a group of concerned citi zens who have a keen interest in pro tecting the environment.  Finally, title III of the bill provides  for the authorization of $2. 7 million  for construction of park visitor facili ties, and the improvement of certain  roads,  parking  areas,  and  boating  ramps.  Mr.  President,  the  forest which  covers most of the monument repre sents the last major virgin growth of  its type in the Southeast. Almost all  other substantial virgin hardwood for ests have been subjected to logging.  Within  the monument  is  found  a  southern  river-bottom  hardwood  forest, consisting of sweetgum, black gum, swamp white oak, southern red  oak, willow oak, black oak, nutmeg  hickory, water  tupelo, bald cypress,  and  loblolly  pine.  Included  among  these are some 200to 400-year-old  giants consisting of 5 national and 12  South Carolina record trees. Previous  studies by the National Park Service  have  found  no  other  area  in  the  Southeast of  comparable  geological  and biological significance.  Furthermore, over 100 bird species  are known to exist in the monument,  including the Swainson's warbler, red cockaded  woodpecker,  Louisiana  heron,  swallow-tailed  kite,  and  the  Mississippi kite. Other wildlife include  the white-tailed deer, bobwhite quail,  turkeys,  raccoons,  largemouth bass,  bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch,  and many others.  Mr. President, this enduring compo nent of creation has provided hours of  enjoyable outdoor recreational oppor tunities for residents of South Caroli na and the Nation at large. Hiking, ca",1988
199,553,1,Mr. HECHT.," Mr. President,  it  is  with great honor that I rise today to  pay  homage  to  a  fellow Nevadan  whose dedication  to  the practice of  medicine and  the people of Nevada  will not soon be forgotten. Dr. Mary  Fulstone was born in Eureka, NV,  in  August 1892  and moved  to Carson  City, NV, with her  family  in 1896  where  she  graduated  from Carson  High School in 1911. Through the per sistence of Mary's classmates, she was  persuaded to seek a career in medicine.  Mary received her M.D. from the Uni versity of California at Berkeley  in  1918. In 1919, she married Fred Ful stone  and  later moved  to  Smith  Valley, NV, and began her life at the  Fulstone sheep ranch.  Women physicians, Mr. President,  were  indeed rare in the early 1920's  whereby the community of ranchers,  miners, and  Indians were somewhat  taken aback by her presence in this  scarcely populated area. The commu nity soon grew accustomed  to  their  new physician and quickly came  to  love her as one of their own. Dr. Mary  soon  found herself examining more  than 50 patients a day in Smith Valley  and the Yerington area, often making  housecalls by horse and buggy. Dr.  Mary was best known for her profi ciency in delivering babies. She deliv ered approximately 5,000 babies in her  65 years of service in medicine.  During  these deliveries, Dr. Mary  was well known  for having  fathers  present during births, long before this  practice was considered the norm. She  would often ask the ranchers to aid  her in the deliveries, thus furthering  the role of the father during the birth  process.  Mr. President, Dr. Mary, a mother of  five, also held a teaching degree which  was a tremendous tool in dealing with  people on a personal level. She served  24 years on the Smith Valley School  Board and 12 years on  the Nevada  Board of Education.  Through her great sense of charity,  she was often known to pay for the  medical expenses of the less fortunate  as well as performing medical services  free  of  charge  for  those without  means.  Her awards have  included Nevada  Mother  of  the Year  in  1961  and  Nevada Doctor of the Year in 1963. As  a member of the Soroptimist Interna tional, she received the organization's  Women's Achievement Award in 1975.  The Lyon Health Center in Yerington  dedicated a new wing of their facility  in 1963 to her, where she herself spent  time after back surgery in 1975 and  1978. In the late 1970's, she was inter viewed by all the national television  networks  including  news  programs  such as CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and others.  A plaque at  the entrance  to  the  Lyon Health Center sums up the atti tude of Lyon County residents toward  Dr. Mary Fulstone,  Dedicated  to  our Dr. Mary Fulstone,  whose medical skill and helping hand have  protected and guided  us  through many  years: a faithful wife,  loving mother, and  philanthropist to all mankind.  Though this Senate Chamber could  not begin to hold the number of indi viduals brought into this world by Dr.  Mary, I am sure, that were they here,  their applause would be deafening for  this great lady, who for 65 years, un selfishly  dedicated  herself  to  the  people of N evada.e  NATIONAL VOCATIONAL  EDUCATION WEEK  e ",1988
200,553,1,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr.  President,  as  many of my colleagues are aware, next  week is National Vocational Education  Week. I would like to rise today to ex press my continued support for  this  very important program.  This  year's  theme  is  ""Vocational  Education:  the Competitive Edge,""  which I believe is highly appropriate.  Strengthening and maintaining educa tional programs is essential for meet ing important national goals, especial ly the goal of improving our ability to  compete in the world economy. Voca tional education programs can help us  reach that goal by making sure that  each individual can fully develop his  or her God-given talents and capabili ties. Developing highly skilled workers  and retraining the existing work force  to meet new needs is essential if we  are to strengthen our national com petitiveness.  Three fourths of today's jobs require  vocational or  technical  skills. Voca tional education is a fundamental part  of  this Nation's employment-related  education and  training programs.

204,592,1,Mr.  DELLUMS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentlewoman from Mary land  [Mrs. MORELLA]  for being kind  enough to yield to me at this time.  I would first like to thank the gen tleman  from California  [Mr. DYM ALLY]  and  the  gentlewoman  from  Maryland [Mrs. MORELLA] for their ef forts in bringing this legislation to the  floor of the House at this particular  time.  I would  like  to make a  few brief  points in support of the resolution.  Mr. Speaker, the Volunteer Income  Tax Assistance Program known  as  VITA helps all who seek assistance,  primarily  the  elderly,  poor,  handi capped, and non-English-speaking per sons.  Mr. Speaker,  in 1986, 37,000 VITA  volunteers assisted more than 800,000  taxpayers  in  completing  and  filing  their returns.  The tax law changes caused by the  Tax Reform Act which we just recent ly passed will  increase the need for  qualified tax assistance. Adoption of  House Joint Resolution 292 will  in crease community awareness of  this  important voluntary resource.  Mr. Speaker, it is the opinion of this  gentleman  from California  that  the  passage of House and Senate resolu tions will also recognize the dedicated  service of literally thousands of indi viduals  and numerous organizations  that make this program work. Nation al VITA Week encourages, I believe,  current volunteers  to continue  their  community service and makes poten tial  future volunteers aware of  the  program's existence.  Again, I would like to thank the dis tinguished gentleman from California  [Mr. DYMALLY] and the distinguished  gentlewoman  from Maryland  [Mrs.  MORELLA]  for bringing this resolution  to the floor in the hope that it will  pass the House by unanimous consent.  ",1988
205,592,1,Mrs. MORELLA.," Further reserving  the  right  to object, Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to say that I have firsthand  knowledge; I have seen the wonderful  work in my congressional district that  was done through the VITA Program,  volunteers helping our seniors with  their grueling income tax returns.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva tion of objection.  ",1988
206,592,1,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.,"  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?  There was no objection.  The Clerk read the joint resolution,  as follows:  H.J. RES. 292  Whereas the Volunteer Income Tax As sistance Program, also known as VITA, gives  hundreds of thousands of low income, elder ly, handicapped, and non-English speaking  persons free assistance  in preparing their  income tax returns;  Whereas VITA volunteers are provided  training and technical assistance by the In ternal Revenue Service;  Whereas VITA  volunteers  represent  a  number of local and national organizations,  including the American Bar Association, the  American Institute of Certified Public Ac countants,  the National Association  of  Black Accountants, the Retired Senior Vol unteer Program, and the United Way, and  include government officials ranging from  mayors and councilpersons to county com missioners and Governors;  Whereas the VITA Program has grown to  over  thirty-seven  thousand  volunteers  across our great Nation,  spreading  from  coast  to coast  throughout at  least forty.  eight States and the District of Columbia;  Whereas  the VITA Program symbolizes  the American spirit of volunteerism and our  long and proud heritage of neighbors lend ing each other a helping hand: Now, there fore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled, That the week be ginning February 1, 1988,  is designated as  ""National VITA Week"", and the President is  authorized and requested to issue a procla mation calling on the people of the United  States to observe such week with appropri ate ceremonies and activities.

Mr. Speaker, further reserving the  right to object, I am pleased to sup port Senate Joint Resolution 172, des ignating February 21,  1988  through  February 27, 1988, as ""National Visit ing Nurse Associations Week.''  The  Visiting  Nurse  Association  [VNAl has provided cost-effective, per sonalized care  to patients at home  since 1885, over 100 years, regardless  of the patient's ability to pay.  The visiting nurse has provided self less service in a quiet, gentle, efficient  manner assisting over 1 million people  each year.  Home health care has been demon strated as a better alternative to hos pital care in many instances because  the individual  is  in the security and  comfort of  their own home. These  nurses care for people of all ages and  ailments, whether it be heart condi tion, cancer, mental conditions, aids,  or gerontology. They assist their pa tient with dedication, providing meals,  reading  to  them or a myriad other  functions so that the person in their  care is made more comfortable.  The original Visiting Nurses Associa tion  started  in Liverpool, England,  founded in 1859 by Florence Nighting gale and William Raithbone. The VNA  has come a long way since then when  their mission was to ensure that in fants and children survived and that  their mothers were well nourished;  they also cleaned houses so that con tagious diseases would not be spread.  The spirit of the original VNA car ries on to the second century and I  commend the Congressman from Colo rado, Mr. HEFLEY, for introducing this  legislation in the House.

265,618,1,Mr. ROTH.," What is the role of the  IG's when a Treasury or IRS employ ee is alleged to have engaged in mis conduct in connection with such em ployee's participation in, or knowledge  of, policy development?  ",1988
266,618,1,Mr. GLENN.," The Treasury and IRS  IG's would  have  full  authority  to  review or investigate any evidence or  allegation of such misconduct. For ex ample,  the IG's would have full au thority  to  investigate allegations of  conflict of interest on the part of a  Treasury policymaker who could per sonally benefit from a policy decision.  The IG Act requires IG's to refer to  the Attorney General any evidence of  criminal wrongdoing.  ",1988
267,618,1,Mr. ROTH.," Of particular concern to  the Treasury Department is the possi bility that the mere disclosure to the  public  of  certain  IG  investigations  could  seriously  destabilize  financial  markets which are sensitive to Treas ury policymaking. For example, if an  IG investigation resulted in any disclo sure that Treasury was continuing to  implement a policy decision to support  the dollar, this could seriously destabi lize those markets affected by Treas ury's intervention decision.  ",1988
268,618,1,Mr. GLENN.," The Treasury and IRS  IG's are under the general supervision  of the Secretary of the Treasury and  the Commissioner and, like all other  statutory IG's, will be appointed by  the President and confirmed by the  Senate without regard to political af filiation and solely on the basis of in tegrity and demonstrated ability.  would be highly inappropriate for the  Treasury or IRS IG to disclose inf or mation about such policy decisions,  the policymaking process, or the infor mation used as a basis for making such  decisions.  In such circumstances,  it  would be appropriate for the Treasury  Secretary or Commissioner, on a case  by case basis, to exercise their statuto ry authority over the IG.  ",1988
269,618,1,Mr. ROTH., S. 908 would amend the  IG Act to include a special provision  for the Treasury Department and IRS.  Does  this provision address  the De partment's and IRS' concerns about  the IG's access  to  information con cerning policymaking?  It  ,1988
270,618,1,Mr. GLENN.," Yes it does. S. 908 pro poses a new section 8C<d><l><D>  as  part of the Inspector General Act of  1978. This provision would place the  Treasury and IRS IG under the specif ic authority, direction, and control of  the Treasury Secretary and Commis sioner,  respectively, with  respect  to  audits or investigations which require  access to information concerning:  Deliberations and decisions on policy mat ters,  including  documented  information  used as a basis for making policy decisions,  the disclosure of which could reasonably be  expected to have a significant influence on  the economy or market behavior.  With  respect  to  this  information,  the Treasury Secretary and Commis sioner are authorized to prohibit an  audit or investigation which the IG  has begun, if they determine it is nec essary to preserve its confidentiality or  prevent its disclosure. If the Treasury  Secretary or IRS Commissioner exer cises any of  these authorities, Con gress will receive notice.  ",1988
271,618,1,Mr. ROTH.," What is meant by the  term ""market behavior""?  ",1988
272,618,1,Mr. GLENN.," The term ""market be havior"" is to be accorded a broad inter pretation. It encompasses the behavior  of institutions such as the stock, bond  or other financial markets due to the  release of  information which might  significantly affect the performance of  those institutions. It also encompasses  the behavior of individuals similar to  that resulting from the disclosure of  insider  information.  For  example,  where  the Treasury Department or  the IRS has the authority to promul gate but has not yet published final  regulations affecting abusive tax shel ters,  an  individual  with  advance  knowledge of the regulations could use  that  information  for personal gain.  Similarly, the disclosure of a planned  review of a particular universe of cur rently transaction reports under the  Bank Secrecy Act could result in indi viduals changing  their behavior.  In  these cases, the IG's access to inf orma tion,  and  authority  to  conduct  an  audit or investigation, are subject to  the authority, direction, and control of  the Secretary of the Treasury or the  Commissioner.  ",1988
273,618,1,Mr. ROTH., Are there examples of  how new section 8c(d) would work?  ,1988
274,618,1,Mr. GLENN.," Yes.  Example: The Treasury IG is per forming an audit of expenditures by  personnel in the Office of the Secre tary. The IG is seeking to determine  whether there is excessive use of taxs,  excessive  reimbursement  for meals,  and so forth. It is doubtful that this  type of inquiry could lead to the dis covery  of  information  that would  reveal economic,  fiscal, or monetary  policymaking. However,  if  there was  such sensitive  information contained  in the expense records, the Secretary  could  assert  control over  the  IG's  access to this information. In this case,  the Secretary would discuss with the  IG the terms of access to this informa tion in order that the IG could carry  out the audit. If necessary, the Secre tary could stop the audit after the IG  has decided  to go  ahead with  the  audit. In that instance, the Secretary  would notify the IG in writing of his  action, and a copy of that notice will  be provided to Congress by the IG.  Example: the IRS IG is conducting  an audit of the use of copy machines.  While  interviewing  staff concerning  the types of documents and number of  copies made, the IG learns of a sum mary of a meeting between the Com missioner and the Treasury Assistant  Secretary for Tax Policy. A couple of  days later, the IG sees the Commis sioner and asks him what was dis cussed in the meeting with the Assist ant Secretary. The Commissioner de termines that the IG is not conducting  any audit or investigation that would  require the IG to have access to this  information. The Commissioner need  not provide access to the information,  and Congress need not be notified.  The Secretary's or Commissioner's  decision to assert control over or pro hibit an audit or investigation shall be  made on a case by case basis. The Sec retary or Commissioner may not de clare in advance through regulations,  guidelines, rules, memoranda, or any  other method that the IG may not  begin an audit or investigation involv ing certain matters or areas. On the  other hand, the IG must be acutely  aware of  the nature of  information  discovered in the course of an audit or  investigation.  If there  is any doubt  about the sensitive nature of inf orma tion, the IG should consult with the  appropriate officials  in  the Depart ment or IRS.  ",1988
275,618,1,Mr. ROTH.," A  concern has been  raised by the law enforcement bureaus  at the Treasury Department regarding  potential disclosure of sensitive inf or mation concerning their investigative  methods and  techniques, which are  learned by the IG in the course of con ducting audits and investigations. For  example,  disclosure  of  investigative  thresholds for review of potential vio lations of bank  secrecy  laws  could  allow  criminals  to  structure  their  transactions in a manner to avoid de tection. What protections exist to pre vent disclosure of such information?  ",1988
276,618,1,Mr. GLENN.," The IG will, of necessi ty. come in contact with investigative  methods and techniques, inasmuch as  these methods and techniques are the  raison d'etre of the law enforcement  bureaus. The IG is not, however, au thorized or required to disclose such  sensitive  investigative methods  and  techniques,  especially where  these  methods and  techniques continue  to  be part of the strategies employed in  ongong  criminal  investigations. The  Treasury and IRS IG's should consult  ",1988

279,631,1,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise to  concur with  the remarks  that have  been made about my colleague and  friend, DANNY INOUYE. I think Senator  METZENBAUM,  Senator  FORD,  and  others have clearly and appropriately  addressed remarks in that regard, and  I agree with them fully.  THE SENATE SUBWAY  ",1988
280,631,1,Mr.  HEFLIN.," Mr.  President,  I  missed  the  last vote, and I do not  blame the cutting off of the time; I  think that we have  to have a  time  limit on votes. If I had been present, I  would have voted for the bill. I do feel  there is an inherent problem which  exists in getting to the floor from the  Hart Building. There are 14 Senators  in  the Dirksen Building  and  it  is  served by one subway car. There are  50 Senators in the Hart Building and  it is served by one subway car. There  are tracks that go to the Dirksen and  to the Hart Buildings. I left my office  with 8 minutes to go. I must have just  missed it because I waited a long time.  In my judgment, the solution to this  problem is to get the subway car that  goes  to the Dirksen Building during  votes to also go to the Hart Building  and pick up Senators. There were un usual circumstances; there were blind  people on the subway car, and it took  some time to get them off, and there  are other problems like this.  But I have now missed two votes this  year, and I do not blame the time. I  think it is up to me to get here in the  15 minutes, but just from an engineer ing, mathematical, mileage, measure ment basis, the car that goes to the  Hart Building can only make two trips  in the 15 minutes, and in this instance  that second trip in coming back, be cause  of  extraneous  circumstances,  caused a delay.  It seems to me that this problem can  be solved by the appropriate authority  working on this to see that the subway  car that goes to the Dirksen Building  also goes to the Hart Building.  I was not alone in missing this vote.  We must have had on this car seven or  eight Senators who arrived late, but I  do think it can be solved and we can  have the 15-minute rollcall. I am not  critical of that. It is just the fact that  if you are in the Hart Building, it is  further and it takes  longer and the  cars do not move that fast.  I think it can be worked out, and I  hope that my remarks can somehow or  another bring it to a head.  ",1988
281,631,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, will the  distinguished Senator yield?  ",1988
282,631,1,Mr. HEFLIN., Yes.  ,1988
283,631,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I am very  sorry that those Senators missed the  vote. There were seven or eight, nine  of them, and they were Senators from  both sides of the aisle. The Chair an nounced the vote 16 minutes after it  began. About 3 minutes or 3 Yz minutes  elapsed then following the announce ment of the vote, I am told-I have  checked at the bar here-and then the  group arrived.  Now, I was told by all the members  of this group  that there were some  blind people on the car, and I can un derstand Senators waiting until an other car came.  ",1988
284,631,1,Mr. HEFLIN., That is  incorrect. It  took additional time for them to get  off. So we were not waiting for an other car.  ,1988
285,631,1,Mr. BYRD.," All right. I had under stood that rather than ask the blind  people off and let Senators come to  the floor on that car,  the Senators  waited on another car. But,  in any  event, I regret that that happened. I  think the thing to do here is, as the  Senator suggested, ask the Architect  of  the Capitol  to see  that  the car  which  serves  the Dirksen Building  serve the Hart Building as well when  there are rollcalls in progress. As I un derstand it, there are 50 or more Sena tors in the Hart Building, and the re maining Senators are scattered in the  Dirksen Building and in the Russell  Building. So there is an extra heavy  load on the car that travels  to  the  Hart Building, which is  the farthest  building from the floor. It seems to me  that that would be a reasonable solu tion to this problem. It is a problem  that has  to be  resolved.  I want  to  assure the Senator that I am going to  inquire of the Architect what the situ ation is and why it cannot be done and  insist that"" it be done. As a matter of  fact,  the Sergeant at Arms  is  right  now contacting the Architect of the  Capitol.  I was asked by a Senator if the Sena tors could still be allowed to vote, and  I stated that cannot be done. And I  would object to that. Even if it were I  who missed the vote, I would object.  And here is the rule so that for the  RECORD Senators  in  the  future will  know that the majority leader cannot,  and in this case would not, prevail in  seeing that Senators have a chance to  vote once that vote is announced by  the Chair. It is rule XII, ""Voting pro cedure.""  When the yeas and nays are ordered, the  names of Senators shall be called alphabeti cally;  and  each Senator  shall, without  debate, declare his assent or dissent to the  question, unless excused by the Senate; and  no Senator shall be permitted to vote after  the decision shall have been announced by  the Presiding Officer, but may for sufficient  reasons, with unanimous consent, change or  withdraw his vote.  And here is the kicker:  No motion to suspend this rule shall be in  order, nor shall the Presiding Officer enter tain any request to suspend it by unanimous  consent.  So  it cannot be done and I  think  these circumstances, which in this in stance were unavoidable, are most un fortunate. I would hope that all the  Senators who missed  the  vote  by  virtue of that situation would state to  the floor staff their names so that we  can put it in the RECORD along with  the  explanation  that  is  now being  made.  (The names of  the Senators who  missed the preceding vote due to the  circumstances  involving  the  subway  herein described have been submitted  for  the  RECORD,  as  follows: Mr.  D'AMATO, Mr. DASCHLE, Mr. HEFLIN,  Mr.  JOHNSTON, Mr. MATSUNAGA, Mr.  MELCHER, Mr. REID, and ",1988

292,644,1,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr.  President,  this  afternoon the Committee on Foreign  Relations met to discuss Senate Joint  Resolution 243 pursuant to the con tinuing resolution to provide addition al authority and assistance for Nicara guan  resistance. Mr. President,  the  committee did hold a meeting. The  distinguished chairman of the commit tee is here with me presently. It is my  understanding that a majority of the  committee members were not present  in the room during the course of that  meeting. Rule IV of the Senate For eign Relations Committee rules insists  that ""A majority of the membership  of  the committee shall constitute a  quorum for reporting any measure or  recommendation  to  the  Senate.""  Stated another way,  the committee  rules say no measure or recommenda tion shall be ordered reported from  the committee unless a majority of the  committee members  are  physically  present.  Mr. President,  rule XXVI of  the  Senate-I cite page 971 of the Senate  procedures-it provides that:  The vote of any committee to report a  measure or matter shall require the concur rence of a majority of the members of the  committee who are present.  On that same page, 971, in the next  paragraph, it says:  The Chair has ruled that a report not au thorized by the concurrence of more than  one-half of a majority of the entire mem bership of the committee, exclusive of prox ies, cannot be received by the Senate upon  objection.  Therefore, Mr. President,  I  ask a  point  of  parliamentary  inquiry.  I  would  like  to ask  the Chair  if  the  Chair  is prepared  to discharge  the  committee inasmuch as the committee  report was filed without a quorum.  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.  ",1988
293,670,1,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, recently  a  customs  fraud  case has  surfaced  which has grave implications for the  safety of American children. Today's  fraud involves the deliberate misclassi fication of flammable children's sleep wear, made  of  cotton but  dubbed  ""playwear,"" which has been purposely  redesigned  to  circumvent U.S. Cus toms regulations and Consumer Prod uct Safety Commission CCPSCl codes.  The magnitude of the danger is diffi cult to quantify due to the fact that  infant  wear  is  categorized  with  women's and girl's clothing when en tered. However, as the details involved  with this fraud clearly indicate, trage dy for American children may soon  emerge  unless we  take  immediate  action on this matter.  The  consumer movement  in  this  country was galvanized  in  the  late  1960's by the growing number of se verely burned children due to flamma ble clothing. A mother's horror of  watching her  child,  clad  in cotton  playwear, suddently burst into flames  after  the child's arm passes over a  burning candle or after contact from a  spark jumping from a fireplace cannot  be  described. Concerned Americans  acted. The result was a CPSC regula tion  established  in  1971 which  re quired chemical treatment for all chil dren's sleepwear. After this nonflam mable  treatment  agent,  Tris, was  found  to be carcinogenic,  the CPSC  determined that only 100 percent poly ester materials would meet the strin gent CPSC standards for nonflamma bility of children's sleepwear.  Children's clothing manufacturers in  the United States have complied with  the 100 percent polyester regulation  since 1971, and the number of chil dren's  deaths  caused  from burning  dropped from an average of 60 per  year in 1970  to an average of 2 per  year in 1982. More recently this pro tective measure for American children  has been  threatened by 100 percent  cotton  ""playwear""  imported  from  GA TT signatories and others hoping  to cash  in on  the projected rise  in  American birth rates.  The CPSC Enforcement Policy on  Children's Sleepwear,  published  in  May 1986, is currently being used by  foreign children's clothing manufac turers as an industrial blueprint to cir cumvent CPSC regulations. Some de signers have successfully imported 100  percent  cotton  children's sleepwear  after originally receiving a restraining  order on their garments simply by al tering their designs to avoid applica tion of CPSC restrictions. Others bla tantly advertise  this playwear with  promotional receiving blankets which  match the clothing. These Japanese  and French exporters are clearly vio lating article XX of the GATT which  states  that signatories must comply  with national measures designed  to  protect human health.  Mr. President, this fraud is a classic  example of misrepresentation to Cus toms officials at U.S. borders made all  the worse by the concomitant viola tion of CPSC regulations and the obvi ous danger to children's lives. This is a  case where foreign manufacturers de liberately  produce what Americans  consider dangerous and have banned,  then export  these products  to  the  United States by fraudulently-for ex ample-misnaming  sleepwear  as  playwear. A private right of action for  customs  fraud,  as  included  in  the  Senate version of the trade bill, would  help us combat these dangerous and  pernicious practices.   A DESPERATE WINTER FOR  ROMANIANS  e ",1988
294,670,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  today, Washington, DC, is experienc ing something of a mid-winter heat  wave. However, the people of Romania  have no such luxury. In fact, due to a  government  decree  that went  into  effect nationwide on November 10, the  use of electricity and gas has been re duced by 30 percent. This means that  most Romanians are  living  in  flats  where  the  temperature  rarely  rises  above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It is im portant  to  remember  that during a  similar shortage last year, there were  widespread reports of many babies and  senior citizens dying due to the cold.  Energy is not the only item in short  supply.  In  mid-December,  West  German Foreign Minister Hans-Die trich Genscher met with Romanian  President Nicolae Ceausescu about the  hardships  being  suffered  by  the  230,000 ethnic Germans living in Ro mania. At the time, he offered to pro vide food aid to Romania to alleviate  some of the most severe food short ages since World War II. According to  a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  report, ""Bread is being rationed at 300  grams a day and few staples are available or affordable."" The difficulties  are being compounded by the impact  of wage cuts.  Instead of accepting  the generous  West German offer of assistance, Cea usescu refused assistance and has even  cut off delivery of packages mailed  from outside the country. According to  an Associated Press wire story dated  December 31, 1987, citing the Essen,  West Germany newspaper,  the New  Ruhr,  ""Two CWest German]  trucks  loaded with food supplies were turned  back at the Romanian border in recent  days. The newspaper said it was the  first time such a private shipment has  been refused entry into the shortage struck Communist Balkan  country.  Romanian Communist party officials  have rejected West German Govern ment offers of emergency shipments  of food and other supplies.""  The ethnic Germans are not  the  only people in Romania being denied  assistance. According to Laszlo Harnos  of  the Hungarian Human Rights  Foundation, many here in the United  States who ship packages to their rela tives in Romania have had them re turned  in recent months. He points  out, that the people of Romania will  be very cold and hungry this winter.  As sad and as terrible as it is to hear  about  the plight of  the Romanian  people, there is something that we in  the United States can do. First, an  amendment has been attached to both  the House and Senate trade bills that  would  suspend  most-favored-nation  trade status to the Romanian Govern ment for 6 months. The purpose of  the suspension is to show the Roma nian regime of Nicolae Ceausescu that  the American people expect Romania  to live up to its human rights obliga tions that have permitted it to receive  MFN status in the past. I encourage  the trade conferees to push forward  on  this amendment  to make certain  that it is included in the final trade  bill package.  In addition, we can all do something  today to indicate our support of the  Romanian people during this particu larly difficult time.  Earlier  this  month,  the  Czech  human  rights organization, Charter  77, called on all Europeans to stand in  solidarity with their brothers in Ro mania. It is a very unusual statement  for Charter 77  to make since it goes  beyond the borders of Czechoslovakia.  However,  its members felt  that the  Romanian people were  suffering  to  such an extreme degree that they mer ited the attention of the world.  Charter 77 has asked  that others  join with the Romanians  in turning  down their thermostats to 10 degrees  Celsius, or 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and  light their homes with no more than  two 40-watt light bulbs. By doing so,  word will get through to the Roma nians  that  they are not alone, but  ",1988
295,683,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, as we enter the  second year of the 200th anniversary celebra tion of  the U.S. Constitution,  that peerless  blueprint for self-governance, it is most appro priate that we also celebrate the great work  done by the people who set the standards of  hard work and dedication for all of us. I mean,  of course, the founding families of the penin sula.  The  11th Congressional District, which  I  have the privilege to represent, has benefited  greatly  from  the  largely unrecognized efforts  of our  first  families, all men and women of  vision, strength, and perseverance.  This description is particularly fitting for the  person we honor here today, Oneida Berlene  Branch, whose personal motto is:  ""You are not really  living until you  others.""  Born  in Louisiana, Mrs. Branch, who was  the youngest of three children, was orphaned  at 3 months of age, but was adopted by a  wonderful family who loved and cared for her.  She became a Christian at age 6. She  is a  graduate of Leland College after having grown  up in the Chicago area.  She  is  the mother of  five  sons-Israel,  Erwin, Whitney, Gerald and Nathaniel. Her first  husband,  Israel Dabney, died when she was  30 years old, and she was remarried 2 years  later  to  the Reverend James Branch. The  Reverend Branch adopted her youngest, Na thaniel. The other  four sons had  reached  adulthood.  The Reverend Branch moved the family-all  except  Israel, who  remained  in Chicago-to  San Francisco, where he became cominister  of St. John's Baptist Church. Many members  of the church were moving  from  the city  to  East Palo Alto during this period. The Rever end Branch was asked  to  form a mission  church  in East Palo Alto to serve these pa683  long  trip each  rishioners and save  them a  Sunday to San Francisco.  In November 1955,  the  family moved  to  East Palo Alto, a community in transition. As  black  families moved  into  the  community,  whites moved out, creating severe economic  dislocations. Despite  financial  hardships,  a  church was started, meetings held in garages  and  living rooms until use of the Carpenters'  Union Hall was gained  for 18 months. After  many  false  starts and  disappointments,  a  home for a new St. John's Baptist Church was  finally settled  in 1958  in a building  formerly  used by St. Paul's Church.  Mrs. Branch continued her community out reach work during this period, setting up the  first  food bank, writing a newsletter that ob tained donations of food and clothing for the  town  that had  severe economic problems.  Students from Stanford University and people  from St. Albert the Great Church were enlisted  for work in the food bank and regular holiday  meals Mrs. Branch cooked and served.  Meantime, Nathaniel-most called him by  this time-was enrolled in elementary school  and later went on to Ravenswood High, where  he first gained attention as an athlete, particu larly  in basketball, and  then went on  to the  University of Nebraska and then to the Harlem  Globetrotters, where  he  gained  still more  fame.  Mrs. Branch's other sons also became suc cessful; one works for the FBI, another in in surance and another in another branch of law  enforcement.  Mrs. Branch, who now has 17 grandchildren  and great-grandchildren, has always kept a  busy schedule of public service. She was the  first black president of Church Women United,  Menlo Park-Palo Alto Council, served on the  Ravenswood School District Board, the Drew  Health Center Board, the Redwood City Plan ning Commission, Mothers  for Equal Educa tion,  Beautification Committee  chairperson,  and on United Flame that had child care cen ters, food banks and summer camp programs.  Mrs. Branch also played a key role in form ing the East Palo Alto community service pro gram in which Frank Crist donated legal serv ices and Louis Rapp provided office space.  Her most famous effort at cleaning up her  town's image was on Willow Road, where the  community service office was  located. Dis mayed at conditions there and unable to per suade anyone  to help clean up  the street,  Mrs. Branch set out one morning armed only  with a Bible and a rake. Within an hour of her  attack on the litter and trash along the street,  others came to her aid.  Individuals came out  with their own tools and the L.C. Smith Con struction Co. sent a truck with a crew to help  clean up. They also eliminated an old tree that  drug dealers and other unsavory characters  had used as shade for their illicit traffic.  Mrs. Branch, we take great pride in recog nizing your continuing work by example and  deed  to create and maintain a wholesome  community all can enjoy and love.  To Oneida Berlene Branch, we bestow this  award as a Founding Family of East Palo Alto.  ",1988
296,696,1,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, the  people of Pittsfield, MA, elected Charles L.  Smith as their mayor. He has served with dis tinction for four consecutive terms through a  period of profound growth and change in his  beloved hometown. During his tenure, Mayor  Smith brought to fruition such major projects  as:  the Vicon  resource  recovery plant,  the  Krofta water-filtration system, Taconic Busi ness Park, Westwood Business Center and  the final development of parcel 3. Completing  any one of these projects would be outstand ing legacy for any mayor, but Charlie did them  all and Pittsfield is a better place because of  him.  But Charlie wasn't just a big projects mayor.  He knows  that a good mayor must run and  maintain a compassionate and efficient admin istration and that he must make time to per sonally deal with  constituent problems. He  must also plow the roads, pick up the garbage  and fill the potholes, services you never hear  about until something goes wrong. But with  Charlie, very little went wrong.  Those that know Charlie best know that he  is a dedicated public servant, family man and  above all else, his own person. As a public  servant, he has served long and well as a city  counselor and city council president. As family  man he and his lovely wife Pat raised 7 beau tiful children of their own as well as an aston ishing 60  foster children. As his own man,  Charlie never created a political machine be cause he wanted to do all the work himself, in  the hands on style  that  is his outstanding  characteristic.  For all his productive life Charlie has cared  and worked for others. He is a man of infinite  patience, dedication, and compassion-he is  a  fine public servant. But Mr. Speaker,  last  year Charlie decided not  to seek  reelection  but rather  to seek new goals  in  the private  sector. I know it was not an easy decision for  Charlie, but if he pursues his new career  in  the same manner in which he has lived his life  he will find only happiness, friendship and sat isfaction. I know I speak for all the people of  Pittsfield when I say congratulations for a job  well done and good luck in your new career.  NATIONAL SALUTE TO  HOSPITALIZED VETERANS  HON. G. V. (SONNY) MONTGOMERY  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 2, 1988  ",1988
297,696,1,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, the/men  and women who served in military uniform will  receive a tribute from grateful American citi zens the week of February 8-14.  Individuals  and  groups  from  communities  across  the  Nation will  visit hospitalized  veterans' and  their families at Veterans' Administration mediFebruary 2, 1988  cal centers to let them know that we appreci ate  them,  that we have not forgotten  them,  and that we care.  An official program of the Veterans' Admin istration Voluntary Service since 1978, Nation al Salute to Hospitalized Veterans is linked to  Valentine's Day.  It presents a perfect time to  show our love for the veterans who sacrificed  so much to safeguard the freedom we enjoy.  National Salute  to Hospitalized Veterans  takes place in the VA's 172 medical centers  where, on any given day,  the VA provides  medical  treatment  to an average of nearly  60,000 inpatients. Approximately 85,000 regu larly scheduled VA volunteers, over half of  whom are members of veterans' organizations  and their auxiliaries, participate in the activities  for National Salute. The volunteers will plan  programs, take visitors on tours, and arrange  for guests to visit with veteran patients. These  volunteers give generously of their time and  hearts year-round  to make hospitalization as  comfortable as possible for the veterans.  The theme for National Salute 1988 is ""We  Salute Those Who Served."" First Lady Nancy  Reagan  is honorary patron of the event this  year; screen star and karate expert Chuck  Norris is chairman.  I urge each citizen to participate in National  Salute to Hospitalized Veterans by visiting a  hospitalized veteran at a VA medical center in  your home community the week of February  8-14. By participating  in National Salute, we  can also show our support for the outstanding  VA volunteers who faithfully serve these veter ans throughout the year. It is also an opportu nity  to witness  the efficiency and quality of  some of the world's finest hospitals and medi cal staffs.  Organizations and  individuals who would  like to participate in the Salute are asked to  contact the nearest VA medical facility for as sistance and information.  GOVERNMENT TERRORISM IN  EL SALVADOR  HON. RONALD V. DELLUMS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 2, 1988  ",1988
298,696,1,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, the continuing  controversy over Contra aid has obscured the  tragic reality that this administration has also  been undermining  the  implementation of the  Arias peace plan in El Salvador.  Last year United States military and eco nomic aid  to  the current Government of El  Salvador exceeded that nation's entire annual  budget. This military aid has resulted in perva sive killing and destruction, and a resurgence  in death-squad and other  terrorist activities,  with the tacit approval of the army and certain  elements in the Government.  What follows below is an English translation  of a sworn deposition given by an eye-witness  to recent Government terrorism in the refugee  camp at Calle Real,  just north of the capital  city of San Salvador. Mr. Francisco Herrera, a  graduate of Holy Names College in Oakland my congressional district-went to El Salvador  as a volunteer church worker  for Catholic  Charities and  the Jesuit Refugees Service.

300,709,1,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to again vote my support for the  nomination of Judge Anthony M. Ken nedy to be an Associate Justice of the  U.S. Supreme Court.  Over the past several months Presi dent Reagan has nominated three in dividuals for a lifetime position on the  Supreme Court.  Judge Kennedy has practiced  law,  taught law, and since 1975 has been a  judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals. While on the bench, Judge  Kennedy has written over 400 opin ions which show him to be a conserva tive  jurist  in  the mold of  Justices  Powell,  Harlan,  and  Frankfurter.  Many of Judge Kennedy's opinions  have dealt with criminal law. Indeed,  Judge Kennedy  has  become  some what of an expert on criminal law. Im portantly, Judge Kennedy has been  tough, but fair, with criminals, and, as  a  judge, has been willing to consider  the rights of victims.  In a recent speech in New Zealand to  the Sixth South Pacific Judicial Con ference, Judge Kennedy spoke of the  need  to be concerned about victim's  rights. Judge Kennedy said that ""the  victim of crime, the only person who  suffered harm in any immediate physi cal sense, has been  left out of  the  criminal justice equation."" I am in full  agreement with his statement in that  speech. I believe that the rights of vic tims should have equal consideration  with the rights of the accused.  During Judge Kennedy's nomination  hearing, he exhibited a  remarkable  understanding of our Nation's Consti tution and our system of government.  His written  decisions  and  speeches  reveal a man who is an able and intel ligent jurist. He is a man who under stands the critical role the Supreme  Court plays in our democracy in pre serving the rights of all, also under stands the need for restraint in the ex ercise of judicial power.  Judge Kennedy's  career  on  the  ninth circuit has been characterized  by this sense of restraint. It is evident  from his desire to ensure that there is  an actual case or controversy before  hearing a case, his care in examining  whether  the parties have  standing,  and his practice of only deciding those  issues necessary  to reach a decision,  that Judge Kennedy is truly one who  believes in the concept of judicial re straint. Furthermore, in his question aire, Judge Kennedy wrote that, ""the  courts must insist upon adherence to a  set of principled restraints that will  confine their judgments to the judicial  sphere. Judges must strive to discover  and to define neutral juridical catego ries  for decision,  categories neither  cast in political terms nor laden with  subjective overtones. Life tenure is in  part a constitutional mandate to the  Federal judiciary to proceed with cau tion, to avoid reaching issues not nec essary to the resolution of the suit at  hand, and  to defer  to  the political  process.""  I  am  in  full  agreement with and  strongly support Judge Kennedy's tra ditional view of judicial restraint.  While some individuals and groups  have opposed Judge Kennedy, I do not  believe  that their opposition  is war ranted  in  light of Judge Kennedy's  overall record. While I do not agree  with all of his opinions, this disagree ment in no way lessens my belief that  Judge Kennedy will make an excellent  Justice. A most fitting description of  Judge Kennedy came  from Mr. Na thaniel S. Colley, Sr., who described  Judge Kennedy as a grown man but  also a growing man.  During the Judiciary hearings on his  nomination, Judge Kennedy was ques tioned about his views on a broad spec trum of constitutional issues. His an swers were cautious, but forthright.  He showed himself to be a judge who  is sensitive  to minorities and to the  less  fortunate.  Importantly,  Judge  Kennedy demonstrated that he had no  rigid constitutional theory or formula  for deciding all cases.  While Judge Kennedy has no rigid  constitutional theory for deciding all  cases, his decisions do show the mark  of a conservative jurist. He is a man  who understands both the good and  the evil for which judicial power has  been utilized throughout our history  and  therein  lies  his philosophy of  moving cautiously in this sphere. His  conservatism, while pronounced, is not  so severe as to prevent him from lis tening to other points of view or from  keeping an open mind while he hears  the arguments in a case.  I believe  that  the Supreme Court  and our Nation will benefit from the  presence of Judge Kennedy. I believe  that he will leave his mark on the Su preme Court and on law in America.  Finally, I should like to take this op portunity to wish Judge Kennedy well  in his new position, for I firmly believe  that he will be confirmed.  ",1988

One week ago in the Judiciary Com mittee,  I announced my reasons for  supporting Judge Kennedy's nomina tion. I will not repeat that rationale  here. Instead, I should like to focus on  a related and important issue, one that  is particularly relevant in the wake of  the Bork, Ginsburg,  and Kennedy  nominations.  That issue is the role the Senate Ju diciary Committee has permitted the  American Bar Association to play in  the Supreme Court nomination proc ess.  As my colleagues know, I am not a  lawyer. Those of my many colleagues  who are lawyers know the ABA as an  association representing about half of  the country's practicing attorneys.  But the Judiciary Committee-with  the executive branch as  its accom plice-has permitted the ABA a  role  that far exceeds its rightful influence.  The ABA's standing committee on  the Federal Judiciary currently con ducts an evaluation process which pur ports to be an objective assessment of  professional competence-but, in prac tice, has become quite vulnerable to  partisan politics.

Mr. President, I will vote to confirm  the  nomination  of  Judge Anthony  Kennedy to be an Associate Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court. I also wish to  cast a vote of support for the confir mation  process  that  the  Judiciary  Committee began and that the Senate  completes today. I am proud to be able  to cast both votes. I believe that we  have fairly established the record by  which this body can judge Judge Ken nedy,  just as we have  firmly estab lished the process by which the Senate  will scrutinize all future nominees for  the Supreme Court.  I think we are at a turning point in  Senate history. All nominees for the  Supreme Court can expect and should  expect rigorous examination of their  views and their record of their philoso phy before they go on the Supreme  Court.  The Senate's duty of advice and con sent  is, without question, a  tremen dous  responsibility. It is a  constitu tional  responsibility which,  by  its  nature, affects all three branches of  our Government. It is a responsibility  that we fulfill only by a rigorous con firmation process.  The process we have now established  in  the Senate  is a  rigorous one.  In  three important ways,  it follows  the  ",1988
308,735,1,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, I rise to  support  the nomination of Anthony  Kennedy to be a Justice on the Su preme Court of the United States.  I do not object to the nomination of  judicial conservatives to the Supreme  Court. I tend to believe that the Presi dent is entitled to nominate those that  share his philosophy, and I have voted  for judicial conservatives in the past.  When I voted against the nomination  of Judge Robert Bork, I opposed him  not because he was a judicial conserva tive, but because I had serious ques tions about his views on fundamental  constitutional issues: The interaction  between  the powers of Government  and individual liberties and the role he  sees for the Court in protecting indi vidual rights guaranteed by our Con stitution. I concluded that his view of  the Constitution leads to a much more  cramped and narrow view in many im portant areas including civil rights and  the right to privacy. These views had  no place on the Highest Court of the  land responsible for the interpretation  of the Constitution.  In contrast, I feel very comfortable  with  Judge Kennedy's fundamental  views on the Constitution and the role  it plays in our society. During his con firmation hearing, he stated:  I do not have an overarching theory, or a  unitary  theory  of  interpretation.  I  am  searching * * * for  the correct balance  in  Constitutional interpretation.  When commenting directly on the  Constitution and the role of the Su preme Court in applying its provisions,  he said:  ",1988
309,761,1,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, today  Senator WALLOP and I are joining to  introduce  legislation  to  reauthorize  and  improve  certain boating  safety  and sport  fishing enhancement pro grams which are funded through the  Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, popu larly  known  as  the Wallop-Breaux  Fund. This fund, established in 1984,  is supported entirely by user fees paid  by the millions of recreational boaters  and sport fishing enthusiasts  in  the  United  States.  The Wallop-Breaux  Fund has been a  significant success  story,  bringing millions  of  badly  needed dollars  to every State in the  Union to improve State boating safety  programs, provide vital  support  for  the U.S. Coast Guard, and enhance  sport fishing and boating opportuni ties.  The  legislation we are  introducing  would extend for 10 years the authori zation for appropriations for boating  safety and Coast Guard support func tions  funded  through  the Wallop Breaux Fund. The boating safety ac count within the fund consists of re ceipts from taxes levied on motorboat  fuels. Like taxes paid into the highway  trust fund by motorists,  these  taxes  are user  fees  paid by  the boating  public. Unlike gasoline taxes paid by  motorists, however, boaters had been  paying these user fees since 1956 but  were not previously receiving the ben efits of these fees. In 1984, Congress  wisely corrected this inequity and as sured  that Federal motorboat  fuel  taxes would be used to enhance boat ing safety and  improve  recreational  programs  that would benefit  those  who were paying the tax burden. In  addition to extending this worthwhile  program, our  legislation would  also  codify an agreement among the boat ing and fishing user groups regarding  the allocation of funding for boating  safety programs.  Mr. President,  the support within  the boating and fishing public for the  Wallop-Breaux  Fund  is  extremely  strong. The millions of people who  enjoy these waterborne forms of recre ation have willingly and actively sup ported the use of these funds in con structive ways that improve the safety  of our waters and enhance the recre ational opportunities  that  so many  enjoy.  I know that many of my col leagues have heard firsthand of the  successes made possible within their  State since the inception of the pro gram, and I hope these colleagues will  join us in cosponsoring this important  legislation and expediting reauthoriza tion of this valuable program.   ",1988
310,761,1,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, today  I  join with my colleague from Louisi ana, Mr. BREAUX in introducing legisla tion to revise and extend the Aquatic  Resources Trust Fund, which is com monly known as  the Wallop-Breaux  Fund. The  trust  fund evolved  from  legislation enacted almost 40 years ago  to aid  in  research and management  programs  for  fisheries. The original  program,  the so-called Dingell-John son Fund,  imposed an excise tax on  iishing tackle and dedicated the reve nues to sport fish restoration projects  managed by State  fish and wildlife  agencies.  The program was funded by fisher men, and the revenues were dedicated  to the specific goal of improving the  fish  populations  in  our  lakes  and  streams. A successful and popular pro gram, the Dingell-Johnson Fund was  subject to demands which exceeded its  revenues. So, efforts were begun about  10 years ago to expand the fund. In  addition to increasing the tax on fish ing tackle, a new excise tax on fishing  boats was also considered. After some  controversy, a proposal was developed  by JOHN BREA ux, as a member of the  House Merchant Marine and Fisheries  Committee, to utilize a portion of the  motorboat fuel  tax for an expanded  sport fish program. As a member of  the  Senate  Finance Committee,  I  sponsored this proposal in the Senate.  The new program, the Aquatic Re sources Trust Fund, or Wallop-Breaux  Fund, was enacted into  law  in 1984.  The new fund included two specific ac counts, the sport fish restoration account and the boating safety account.  The accounts are true user funded ac counts, and  involve no general reve nues. The sport fish  restoration ac count  is  funded by  the  fish  tackle  excise tax, and as I mentioned earlier,  is dedicated to projects undertaken by  State fish and wildlife agencies. The  boating safety account  is  funded by  the motor-fuel excise tax, and is used  for boat safety programs run by the  States and the U.S. Coast Guard.  When Congress enacted the Wallop Breaux Fund  in 1984,  the proposal  contained a specific set-aside from the  fuel tax for the Boat Safety Program.  The first $45 million in fuel tax reve nues was reserved for the Boat Safety  Program. Any collected funds above  that amount would go  to  the Sport  Fish Restoration Program.  Two years ago, after extended dis cussion among the user groups, it was  suggested that the funding allocation  for boat safety programs be increased.  Congress responded favorably  to the  request, and revised  the $45 million  set-aside to $60 million as an amend ment to the Coast Guard authoriza tion bill. Last year, approval was again  given to the funding increase. The leg islation we  are  introducing  today  would make permanent the higher al location. We would thus avoid having  to amend the program every year to  provide an allocation agreed to by ev eryone.  Our bill would also reauthorize the  program for 10 years. Last,  the bill  would revise the list of in-kind contri butions the States can make to meet  their matching funding requirements  under the act.  The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund  is an example of a user funded pro gram which  serendipitously  has  a  public benefit. The changes we are  proposing today will only make a good  program better. I would urge my col league to join in supporting this legis lation.e  By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself,  Mr. DOLE, Mr.  SHELBY, Mr.  BOND,  Mr.  MATSUNAGA,  Mr.  CHAFEE,  Mr.  CHILES,  Mr.  SYMMS,  Mr.  BURDICK,  Mr.  HEINZ, Mr. METZENBAUM, Mr.  GRAMM,  Mr.  GLENN,  Mr.  DURENBERGER, Mr. KERRY, Mr.  GARN,  Mr.  PRYOR,  Mr.  WEICKER, Mr.  SANFORD, Mr.  McCAIN, Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr.  WARNER,  Mr.  CONRAD,  Mr.  LUGAR,  Mr.  STENNIS,  Mr.  QUAYLE, Mr. WIRTH, Mr. STAF FORD, Mr. EXON, Mr. McCLURE,  Mr. SARBANES, Mr. THURMOND,  ",1988

318,787,1,Mr.  JACOBS.," Mr. Chairman,  last  night our friend, Howard Baker chas tised the networks. He said for substi tuting their judgment for  the Presi dent's judgment about which of the  President's speeches was news.  Now I am very fond of Mr. Baker. I  just hope he has not been hanging  around with the leader of Russia, Gor bachev too much, because certainly in  the Soviet Union the politicians decide  whether  their speeches are news or  not. The news people follow suit.  Nonetheless, I must say the Presi dent has convinced me. First of all, the  President says he wants no new Feder al spending. Consequently I must cast  my district's vote  against  this new  Federal spending.  Second, the President describes the  Contras as the freedom fighters. Now  when you consider the fact that the  supreme military commander of  the  Contras  is one Enrique Bermudez, a  top military officer of the Somoza dic tatorship, you might think the Presi dent misses the mark, slightly, by call ing his organization freedom fighters.  But you  just do not understand the  term.  In fact, the Somoza national guard  has been fighting freedom for decades.  Therefore, I do not fault the President  for calling them freedom fighters.  I hear it said that the Washington  Post favors this legislation. I hear it  said that the Miami Herald favors this  legislation. Whoopee. Now  let us see  who  is against  this  legislation. The  American public by more than a 2-to-1  margin. And why? Because they know  that the history of the U.S. interven tion  in other people's countries and  other people's civil wars  is all about  the same, it follows suit also. First the  guns and then the sons.  And always  the pledge, when  the  fuse  is lighted that it will not reach  the dynamite, that young men will not  have to go.  Why do the young men go in every  case? And then we decide later what a  blunder  the Spanish-American War  was, what a blunder Vietnam was; the  very notion that the tip of the Asian  tail could wag the world. What foolish ness. Or as Barbara Tuchman has put  it so eloquently  in  the  title of her  great volume, ""What Folly"".  The answer is rather subtle to the  American public I think. It is because  the officials  in Washington, particu larly  those enshrined  in  the White  House, acquire an egoistic interest in  the position,  the erroneous position  they had taken before.  The French learned their lesson and  Mr. Johnson did not learn their lesson.  Mr. Johnson  learned his  lesson and  Mr. Nixon did not learn Mr. Johnson's  lesson.  The  ego  ""pride goeth before  the  fall,"" not of the President but of 18year-old kids dying an unspeakable  horror in jungles and in marshes.  Will Rogers said it about the very  country we are talking about now. He  said of Nicaragua ""The United States  will send in the Marines to any coun try where we can get 10 people  to  invite us.""  Finally,  the President has made a  concession in his speech last night. He  has proposed that the Congress can  share the complete power the Consti tution gives the Congress in the first  place to decide about military action  in other countries,  to declare war,  which we have  in effect,  if actions  speak louder than words, done in the  case of Nicaragua.  He says that later the Congress can  vote on whether the Sandinistas are  good guys, whether  the Sandinistas  have achieved at least the level of a  democracy where a White House aide  threatens  the  news  people  of  this  country if they will not do what the  politicians say in terms of interpreting  what the news is.  Now how many people in this House  are going to want to cast a vote to say  the Sandinistas are good guys? How  many people in this House think the  Sandinistas are good guys? How many  think they are not Marxists? That is  one of the slickest things a Hollywood  writer ever thought of yet.  Nobody will vote that way, nobody  thinks the Sandinistas are good guys.  Nobody thinks Castro is a good guy.  Nobody  thinks Gorbachev  and  his  outfit are good guys. And there are a  couple of us or more in the House, in cluding my friend Mr. BURTON  from  Indiana and myself who do not think  Communist Chinese are good guys, not  at  least good  enough  to  violate  a  United States statute and receive from  this country nuclear technology with out agreeing at least to what would  happen to the plutonium waste which  can be made  into military weapons.  The President wanted to do that; Mr.  BURTON did not want to do that, I did  not want to do that and I am happy to  say others voted against that.  So the question is, Are we going to  repeat the same folly of the past? The  answer I hope will be ""no.""  ",1988

320,787,1,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of House Resolution 444  to ap prove the President's request for aid  to the Nicaraguan Contras.  I  firmly believe  that if there ever  ~as a time to vote ""yes'', a ""yes"" vote  on the Contra aid,  then the  time  is  now; here today in this place, in this  hallowed Chamber, a symbol of a free  people.  My colleagues, in the 10 hours that  are allocated to debate this measure, I  am sure that every aspect of this issue  will be  thoroughly and exhaustively  debated.  0 1200  However, I do not want us to be so  consumed in the details of this impor tant subject as to miss the overall pic ture. So allow me to off er a broader  perspective.  When discussing United States aid  to the Nicaraguan Contras, we often  hear opponents of this assistance use  this phrase: ""Give peace a chance.""  Well, we here  in Congress need  to  fully understand  that peace  is not  merely the absense of war; true peace  can only be enjoyed in a land where  freedom and liberty abound.  Our Founding Fathers clearly un derstood this and were willing to risk  all that they had in pursuit of freedom  from tyranny. Having just celebrated  the bicentennial of our Constitution  last year, I am amazed at how many  Members here today seem to have for gotten this inescapable fact. What we  should be pursuing in Central America  is freedom, for where there is freedom,  peace will also be present. Therefore, I  say, give freedom a chance and vote to  support aid to the Contras.  Let me say  to my colleagues that  over 210 years ago in a little country  called the United States there was a  cry  from  the halls  in Philadelphia  saying, ""Give me  liberty or give me  death.""

322,813,1,Mr. SHUMWAY.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  We have heard several times in the  debate  today and before today from  those who oppose continued funding  for the Contras in Nicaragua that we  should vote for peace and  therefore  vote to end United States support for  the Contras freedom fighters in that  country.  I  suggest  to you what we  really need to vote for is peace and de mocracy. I think a vote for these twin  goals would fulfill the United States  policy as we have had it for the past  several years.  We should make no mistake about  the fact that the Sandinistas have cre ated  an  expansionistic  Communist  regime in Nicaragua which is a threat  to its neighbors.  I recall a couple of years ago when  we were visited by President Duarte of  El Salvador, hearing him  say very  clearly that as long as there is a Com munist-Marxist  nation  in  Central  America  he  felt  that  there would  never be peace  in  that part of  the  world. It is no secret that Nicaragua  has a massive army which  is well equipped by the Soviet Union. In fact,  last year the Soviets spent for military  aid to the Sandinistas some $450 mil lion. Here today we are debating an  escrowed account of only $3.6 million  in military aid.  We have heard from Major Miranda,  who recently defected, that the Soviet  Union will continue  its buildup and  massive military assistance to the San dinistas.  The policy we pursued thus far has  worked. It has brought the Sandinis tas to the bargaining table. They have  made  concessions. They promise  to  make more reforms to see us stop our  aid to the Contras in that country.  Now is not the time to change that  policy, it is in fact time to continue it,  to keep their feet to the fire, to contin ue to push not just for peace in Cen tral America, but peace and democra cy.  I hope that my colleagues will join  me in not sending the Contras to the  bargaining table empty handed.  I urge the Members to vote ""yes"" for  peace and democracy.  ",1988

326,813,1,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  what  is  this vote on Contra aid all  about? Well I think it is about respect  for the rule of law;  It is about  respect  for  the sover eignity of even small countries;  It is about  respect  for a  regional  peace plan;  It is concern for stopping the killing  in Nicaragua;  It is about respect for the dignity of  people in a country that our Govern ment has  treated shabbily for more  than a century;  It is about us stopping the making of  war in a country that has done noth ing to my country.  Last  January,  I  visited  a  refugee  camp in Nicaragua and spoke with a  campesino who had been displaced  from his home by the Contras. He told  me what President Reagan could do  with his millions of dollars to fight a  war in his country. That poor peasant  said he hoped President Reagan would  spend the Contra aid money on the  poor in the United States. The Nicara gua peasant went on to say very poign antlyWe campesinos are not animals.  Essentially, what  that Nicaraguan  peasant was saying, I want respect for  my human dignity. Let's give  that  peasant and  thousands  like him his  dignity-and stop making war in his  country where too many have already  died.  Reflecting on the 7-year war in Nica ragua:  When American taxpayers ask how  past Contra aid funds have been spent,  the  respected General  Accounting  Office reported that the State Depart ment could not account for over half  the money granted in 1986.  When  I  ask our Nation's military  leaders if the Contras can def eat the  Sandinistas, they respond in the nega tive.  When I ask what the Contras' plans  for governing would be should they  overthrow the Sandinistas, they have  none.  When I ask if the neighboring na tions of Nicaragua are threatened by  Nicaraguan aggression, as claimed by  President Reagan and proponents of  additional Contra aid, Costa Rican,  Honduran, Salvadoran, and Guatema lan leaders voice support for the re gional peace plan which calls  for a  stopping of further Contra aid.  When I ask if our allies support our  actions with regard to Nicaragua, they  do not.  The time has come to end America's  sponsorship of war in Central Amer ica. Vote no on more Contra aid. And  let's get on with addressing some other  problems of this Nation: Housing, day  care, plus the deficit.  D 1430  ",1988

If  the gentleman would check the press,  he would find that just last week the  President of Nicaragua, Mr. Ortega,  told the President of El Salvador, Mr.  Duarte, when Mr. Duarte complained  that Nicaragua was training guerrillas  in his country, that if Mr. Duarte did  not like that, the Nicaraguans would  put missiles in the hands of the guer rillas  in El Salvador.  I,  personally,  called President Duarte and asked him  if it was true, and he said it was.  ",1988

333,826,1,Mr. COLEMAN  of Missouri.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  assume we  are  going  through  this exercise  today because  we are trying to convince a handful of  our colleagues who are supposedly un decided to decide in favor of the way  we speak.  Let me give two reasons why an un decided Member of Congress ought to  vote  for  aid  to  the Contras  this  evening. First, aid to the Contras  is  working. We see that it has brought to  the bargaining table something they  said they would never do, negotiate di rectly with the Contras.  The Sandinistas  have  also made  some modest, albeit modest attempts  to make some changes in their society.  Why are they doing that? Not out of  the goodness of their heart, but be cause  the pressure  that the Contra  forces are putting on them is forcing  them to do that.  The second reason is without aid to  the Contras  there  is  absolutely no  reason for them to continue to negoti ate. There is no reason for the Sandi nistas to try to deliver on the promises  that they for 8 years now have failed  to perform and live up to, since 1979,  to the people of Nicaragua.  I say we must negotiate from a posi tion of strength. And  the only way  that we can negotiate from a position  of strength is to continue to have an  there  for  available  escrow  account  lethal aid.  How can anybody who has heard  Major Miranda, who was a very high  assistant to Ortega, the Defense Min ister, who has defected to this country  and has stated  that he knows  that  these people do not want democracy,  he knows what the Sandinista leader ship stands for and he knows the rea sons that all of this window dressing  and so-called democratization is going  on is for the purpose of cutting off aid  to the Contras, that their audience is  the 435 Members of the House of Rep resentatives.  This is a person who was in a high  command. Why will we not listen to  him? Why will we not heed his warn ings?  We had a bipartisan hearing  the  other day regarding this issue and Mr.  Miranda spelled out all  the reasons  why Members of this House ought to  be voting for aid to the Contras this  afternoon.  We hear a lot about giving peace a  chance. My  colleague  from Florida  just said give peace a  chance. You  know,  the same kind of peace  that  they have today in Cuba; they are not  at war, they are at peace.  I say give democracy a chance. The  only way to give democracy a chance is  to go ahead and support aid  to the  Contras with an escrow account as the  President has offered us to do today.  ",1988
334,826,1,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to point  out something that occurred last night  that I think may surprise you.  Between the hours of 5 and 11 on  KOMO-TV  in Seattle, Seattle  the  sister city of Managua, I might point  out, there was a telepoll on that ABC  affiliate. The question was: ""How do  you want your elected representative  to vote on Contra aid?"" Thirty-four  thousand  one  hundred  twenty-nine  people responded. Fifty-four point two  percent said vote for the aid.  ",1988

336,826,1,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today to join with my colleagues who  oppose the President's request for ad ditional Contra aid.  I have been to the region. I have met  with the leaders of the Central Ameri can countries, the leaders of the oppo sition  groups,  the  leaders  of  the  church and the trade unions. As many  of you have, I have seen firsthand the  conditions under which  the  people  must live in these countries. And you  know that a vote for Contra aid will  only bring more misery, more poverty,  more war  to  the people of Central  America.  The American people have expressed  their  sentiments  for  the  initiative  taken by the peoples of Central Amer ica and their leaders. Under the leadership efforts of Costa Rican Presi dent Oscar Arias, they have set their  own peace agenda. It is not the admin istration's plan. It is not the Soviet  Union's plan. It is a plan written and  signed by  the  leaders of  the region  who are working to set their own desti ny. The Central American Presidents  are taking a major risk for peace, and  we must support them.  That is a point that the administra tion just doesn't seem to understand:  That Central Americans are capable of  taking charge of Central America. In stead, the administration seeks to pro long the war and frustrate the peace  process. The military focus of the ad ministration only makes more difficult  the  task  of  the Central American  Presidents.  Providing  additional  Contra aid now will destroy their ef forts.  President Arias talks about the need  for measures  to promote democracy  and peace through dialog and negotia tion. ""Democracy,"" he says, ""cannot  be achieved by bullets but only by bal lots."" His peace plan reflects this posi tion.  And what does  the administration  off er as an alternative  to  the Arias  peace plan? There is no evidence that  the administration even has a  sus tained and coherent policy for Central  America. Many  slogans  have  been  used-peace, freedom fighters, U.S. se curity  interests-but none  of  these  catchwords appear as an  integrated  element of an overall strategy.  The President's policy response is to  throw more money at the problem. He  is now asking Congress to approve a  $36.2 million Contra aid package, a  package that is touted as being rela tively modest. But let's take a closer  look at the numbers. His request is for  $3.6 million in lethal military aid and  $32.6 million  for so-called nonlethal  assistance. The President tells us that  this amounts to 90 percent nonlethal  and 10 percent  lethal aid. However,  the measure  that we are voting on  today also includes $20 million for an  aircraft replacement fund, and an esti mated $12 million for electronic and  radar equipment for surveillance. Fur thermore, the amount of true humani tarian aid in his package, that is aid  for food, shelter, clothing, and medi cine, only amounts  to $7 .2 million.  This brings the total cost of the pack age  to $68.2 million  f <;>r  a  4-month  period. That  is  an animal  total of  $204.6 million, more th3>µ  the Contras  have ever gotten before.  \  The administration wabts-all -this  money, but they have not presented  any plan for achieving specific objec tives  in Central America. We have  heard about peace, freedom, and de mocracy for Nicaragua. We have heard  feverish statements about threats to  our national security.

Mr. Chairman, let me say to the gen tleman that I think it is ridiculous to  say that we do not negotiate with the  Sandinistas  from  a  position  of  strength. It is a country of 3 million  people, close to the American border.  It has very few troops. Its economy is  in a shambles. It is in absolute disor der and disarray from every viewpoint  we can look at, and to say that the  United States does not negotiate with  this  country  from  a  position  of  strength  is  to misunderstand  every  fact of modern life.  We negotiated with the Soviets and  we did it from a position of strength,  and we negotiate with the Sandinistas  from a position of strength. To say  otherwise is simply not to be in touch  with reality.  ",1988

I would like to point out that Cuba  was a very small country, and that we  certainly were in a position of strength  60 miles from Cuba. However, Cuba  had built the largest military force in  this hemisphere, with Soviet assist ance. And, Cuba continues to conduct  surveillance up  and down  the  east  coast of the United States.  Nicaragua would do  the same. We  were never able  to deal with Cuba.  When the Soviets brought in a brigade  and President Carter had some objec tion, we simply dropped the issue. We  have not been able to deal with the  Cubans at all.  ",1988

Mr. Chairman,  I must respectfully  disagree with my friend and colleague,  the gentleman from Missouri, on this  issue. He spoke about the history and  what has happened  in  the world.  I  would like to review some of the les sons of history.  If we go back to the Bolshevik revo lution, the Communists did not imme diately seize power then. There was a  struggle  for a number of years be tween the Red army and the White  army, the Red army eventually win ning out. If we look at the years since  then, not a  single country that has  gone Communist chose to do so in free  elections. The choice has always been  by force. If we look at the success of  these Communist countries, we cannot  point to one that has been an econom ic success. They are all economic fail ures, and these economic failures are  scattered here and there throughout  the world.  ",1988

351,852,1,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today to express my opposition to ad ditional United States military and  nonlethal aid to the Nicaraguan Con tras. I strongly urge my colleagues to  vote against  the President's aid  re quest.  Money is a fungible resource, a re source which can be expended to free  other forms of financial assistance and  other resources. Assistance to the Con tras can be compared  to a personal  budget. Bills must be paid. If a person  is given money for his rent, he is then  able to use his funds to purchase other  goods.  In  the case of  the Contras,  what will  these additional funds ac complish? They will  free up other  funds and resources for the purchase  of weapons. Furthering aid at  this  time will only serve to extend a bloody  war and place the resolution of this  conflict further away from the eager  grasp of the Nicaraguan people.  During my years as a minister,  I  have worked hard to rebuild my com munity, to take a piece of land and to  raise a building out of rubble, to re store commerce to areas where busi nesses were afraid to locate and to in still faith in people to believe in them selves,  their  community,  and  their  country. Coming from  that environ ment,  it  is  difficult  for me,  as  a  member of Congress, to understand an  administration  that  favors  a  policy  which destroys the communities of a  nation, destabilizes  its economy, and  murders its people.  During the time the United States  has aided the Contras there have been  over 50,000 casualties. This is what we  as a nation have to show for the $276  million  in  assistance  that we  have  given to the Contras. Money is a finite  resource, especially in these times of  budgetary restraint, a resource which  we have squandered on a bloody and  misguided policy. For $276 million, in  my community and across the Nation,  we could have built low-income hous ing, helped families to receive health  care, and helped to educate our chil dren. Having said  this,  I must ask,  which is a better allocation of our re sources?  In which example has our  country been better served? We must  question  the  intensity  and  focus  placed by the administration on a fail ing Central American  policy, when  that same administration's economic  policies are in a shambles.  The issue of funding to the Contras  brings  to mind several  fundamental  issues. Are we  really  a  ""peaceful""  nation, devoted  to self-determination  and the rule of law or are we a nation  that seeks to oust governments that  we disagree with instead of encourag ing democratization. If our goal is to  establish democracy, why do we then  not make the same efforts in Chile,  Paraguay, South Africa, or  in Haiti  that we have made in Central Amer ica.  If our goal is to block a Soviet base  in Central America, why doesn't Presi dent Reagan negotiate directly with  the Soviets, as Gorbachev recently in dicated he is prepared to do, or open a  dialog with the Cubans or the Sandi nistas?  For the past 7 years our country has  been  sponsoring an  insurgent  force  which has  limited popular  support.  What government would willingly ne gotiate away its power or authority to  a small violent minority? I do not be lieve that the Contras are interested  in participating with the Sandinistas  in the political process.  The greatest threat to our democra cy does not come from Communist na tions to the south but from within our  own borders. The greatest danger our  country faces comes not from an eco nomically ravished, war torn Central  American country, but from cities and  towns across this Nation where a gen eration is coming to see drug traffick ing as their only hope for economic  enfranchisement, a country where the  poor go hungry and have no shelter,  people are inadequately educated, and  businesses cannot prosper. These are  the forces that will tear this country  apart, not the Sandinistas in Nicara gua.  This most recent administration aid  request helps to provide a framework  for  the destruction of  the Central  American peace plan. By granting ad ditional military aid to the Contras we  are fueling opportunities and reasons  for the Sandinistas to reject the Cen tral American peace plan with which  they are earnestly trying to comply.  Any aid that helps to keep an army in  the field is ultimately lethal, regard less of administration claims  to  the  contrary. The  use  of  any United  States-supplied goods ultimately  as sists in killing Nicaraguans.  I believe  that  the administration's  goal is to help the Contras to achieve  an unreasonable solution to an inter nal conflict. The Congress will ensure  the continuation of the war and the  slaughter if we approve additional aid  for the Contras today.  Let us today set upon a road toward  stopping the violence and death the  Contra war brings to Nicaragua. Let us  work toward honoring the agreements  made by the Central American peace  accords. Let us respect our allies  in  Central America as equals. Vote ""no""  on the President's aid request.  ",1988

355,865,1,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr.  Chairman,  this evening we  are poised on  the  threshold of a momentous decision for  the Americas. There are few choices  we make in this Chamber where peace  and war hang  in  the balance. This  27th vote that we will cast tonight on  Contra aid is that kind of vote.  The Reagan administration's policy  has evolved from one of covert assist ance to the Contras to overt, multimil lion dollar assistance  for  the single  purpose of overthrowing  the Sandi nista government, one that we diplo matically recognize, by military force.  And now they claim that aid to the  Contras is needed to keep the pressure  on for negotiations. But that policy ig nores the new reality in Central Amer ica, that the Central American govern ments themselves have taken extraor dinary steps  toward regional self-de termination by backing the Arias plan,  the Guatemala peace accords, and sup porting that plan for peace.  The prestige of the Nobel Prize for  Peace is the driving force for peace in  the region, not arms to the Contras;  yet, peace and  the Arias plan will  never have a  chance, never have a  prayer unless we cut off the military  aid and stop the fighting. We need to  create a climate for real negotiations  to take hold, negotiations by those in  the region who are most affected by  their outcome.  We will not achieve peace using the  Contras as our agents; we will become  peacemakers by supporting  the one  clear steady vision, the regional vision  for peace: the Arias plan.  Cutting off military  aid may not  guarantee the success of negotiations,  but continuing the military aid will  assure their failure.  ",1988

357,865,1,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  debate all day today has centered on  the theme of where we have been in  regard to aid  to the Contras. Those  who oppose aid have talked about the  alleged inadequacies of the Contras as  a fighting force  in Nicaragua. Those  who  support  aid have  taken much  solace from the fact the headlines no  longer talk about the battles in El Sal vador, of  the  imminent  fall of  the  democratic government in El Salvador  to an insurgency sponsored from Nica ragua.  Instead,  the  headlines  talk  about battles now on the home turf of  that  aggressive  force  in Nicaragua.  Those who support aid to the Contras  indeed take much solace from the fact  that the fighting in El Salvador has  given way to fighting now where that  aggression emanated from  in Nicara gua. The debate  is not really about  where we have been in regard to aid to  the Contras, the debate is where we  are going from here.  Where are we now and where do we  go? I have heard a strange argument  tonight. The  argument  is  that we  ought  to  let  the Central Americans  settle their own business, let us stay  out of it. If they cannot settle it prop erly,  if  they cannot contain Daniel  Ortega and the Communist Sandinis tas, well then we will send the Marines  in, they will mop it up and clean it up.  It is a strange argument, folks, be cause it ignores the fact that it is Cen tral Americans who are dying in Nica ragua, fighting for freedom there, not  Americans;  it  is Central Americans  who are containing Daniel Ortega's ag gressive tendencies in the region; it is  Central  Americans  dying  in  the  Contra fighting forces to keep Daniel  Ortega and his alleged plan to build a  600,000 man fighting force from over taking  that  region.  It  is Americans  who have to die in place of those Cen tral Americans  if we do not support  them in their efforts.  So  tonight when we ask ourselves  where do we go from here, we ought  eminently to ask ourselves what is this  Nation's best self-interest? I submit to  you we ought to ask ourselves a tough  question: Is it better for us, is it in our  self-interest  indeed  to continue sup port for those Central Americans who  are fighting for their own freedoms,  who are containing that Communist  force in Nicaragua, is it better for us  to continue our support for them and  to ensure that peace indeed can come  to El Salvador and  the democracies  that are peaceful  in the region  like  Honduras  and Costa Rica  have  a  chance to grow and flourish; or is it in stead in our Nation's best self-interest  to abandon those forces  in the field  and to trust Daniel Ortega to do the  right thing in the peace process?  I  suggest  to you  that  if we dare  make that second choice, if we aban don those forces in the field, that one  day the alternative discussed  in this  Chamber, sending the American boys  and girls in, sending our Marines in,  will be the awful fateful choice that  will face this Nation.  I  have  four  young  boys,  two  of  whom are  talking about military ca reers.  I am proud of  them for  it.  I  hope one day that they pursue those  careers. But I would hate  today  to  have on my conscience that we made a  decision to send those boys  to  their  death in defense of liberty when today  19-059 0-89-28 (Pt. 1)  we can count on the Central Ameri cans fighting for their own liberty.  Support aid to the Contras.  ",1988

360,865,1,Ms. PELOSI., I yield to the gentle man from California.  ,1988
361,865,1,Mr. FAZIO.," I thank the gentlewom an for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  aid to the Contras.  Mr. Chairman,  the Sandinistas have made  more progress toward democratization in  the  last 6 months under  the Arias peace plan,  than during 6 years of aid to the Contras.  If our goal  is  to overthrow  the Sandinista  regime  then we should continue to  fund  the  Contras.  If our goal  is  to encourage peace,  reduce repression and promote democracy in  Nicaragua then we should support the Guate malan accords in every way possible,  includ ing putting an end  to aid  that will keep  the  Contras fighting in the countryside.  The Sandinistas have made some important  concessions  in  the  last 6 months.  It's irrele vant why they have made these concessions;  what's important is how can we help sustain  these concessions and encourage the Sandi nistas  to  take  further steps  to protect  the  rights of all the citizens of Nicaragua.  It  is  true  the Sandinistas may  renege on  their commitments to openness and democra cy if Contra aid is stopped. But the Sandinis tas will definitely renege on their commitments  if Contra aid is approved.  The Reagan administration also is  ignoring  several valuable opportunities to address the  legitimate security concerns which the United  States has in the region.  Secretary Gorbachev told President Reagan  during  the  recent summit  that he was pre pared to cut off Soviet military aid to Nicara gua if the United States cut off aid to the Con tras. Ortega also has said that if he receives  security  guarantees  from Washington,  he  would limit his army, withdraw foreign military  advisers, prohibit  foreign bases and prevent  subversion from Nicaraguan soil.  We should seize this opportunity to test Or tega's  sincerity  rather  than  continuing  to  refuse  to even sit down at  the negotiating  table with the Government of Nicaragua.  We should seize this opportunity to support  the bold peace  initiative of President Arias.  We should seize  this opportunity  to  reduce  conflict rather than escalate it, to construct in centives  for meaningful  peace  rather  than  continue to fund Mr. Reagan's military adven tures in Central America.  ",1988
362,865,1,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman,  today  the Members of the House have the  opportunity  to  stop  the President's  policy of violence in Central America.  The question which we must answer,  as individuals and as a nation, is are  we going to support peace or are we  going to support war?  The majority of Americans have al ready  answered  this question-they  oppose the  administration's violent  and destructive policy.  ",1988
363,878,1,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield  2112 minutes to the gentleman from Il linois [Mr. SAVAGE].  ",1988
364,878,1,Mr. SAVAGE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to this ""Rambo"" propos al of President Reagan,  to give an other $36 million to the counterrevolu tionaries of Nicaragua.  I have voted against such ill-advised  aid everytime  it has been proposed  during the past 4 years, for two rea sons:  First of all, I believe that the main  argument for it is specious. The propo nents in this body argue that this $36  million more for the Contras, this vio lent  interference  in  the  internal af fairs of Nicaragua, is justified by the  essentiality of  advancing democracy  and turning back Communist dictator ships in Central America.  Now, every anti-Communist thrust is  not prodemocracy. For  instance,  the  anti-Communist third reich of Adolf  Hilter was an anti-Communist dicta torship, and many of us  risked our  lives  in World War II fighting  that  Fascist regime.  At present, the Fascist/racist regime  in South Africa  is one of the most  anti-Communist in the world-but it is  also one of the most antidemocratic.  So, you see, a foreign policy which  supports whatever is anti-Communist,  often ends up also supporting what is  antidemocratic-and that is part of our  problem in Nicaragua. The U.S. Gov ernment has backed the most brutal  totalitarian rulers there for the past  100 years, financially and militarily.  Moreover, the Contras are related to  the  last barbaric dictatorship  there,  the  anti-Communist Somoza  regime  which, of course, our Government sup ported.  When we find ourselves supporting  antidemocratic movements merely be cause they are anti-Communist, we are  on the wrong side of history. Some  other Central America and Caribbean  current examples are Haiti, Guatema la, Panama, and the Dominican Re public.  In other words, the Reagan adminis tration's policy  regarding Nicaragua  does not promote democracy  in that  region.  Now, the second reason I oppose the  bill before us, to give another $36 mil lion  to  the Contras,  is because our  Government has already given  them  about $200 million of the hard-earned  tax dollars of American citizens. More  than $200 million-that is more than  $10,000 per Contra; $10,000 per Contra  to kill his fellow citizens; men, women,  and children, $10,000 per Contra.  That is more than we pay the aver age senior citizen in the United States,  per year; $10,000 per Contra for kill ing, more than we give for healing our  own indigent citizens.  And hear this. The strongest debaters  for this $10,000 per Contra are among  the strongest debaters to reduce our  Federal deficit. What hypocrisy.  They argue today to give the Con tras more millions, but yesterday they  argued  that  the Government was  going bankrupt. They would  rather  give $10,000 per Contra, rather than  give it to a deserving, would-be Ameri can  college  student,  $10,000  per  Contra, but reduced cost-of-living ad justments  for  American  retirees,  $10,000 per Contra, taken out of Amer ican Medicare  needs,  $10,000  per  Contra, but not $10,000 per unem ployed American, $10,000 per Contra,  but nothing  to  keep  an American  family  on  its hard-earned  farm  or  home, foreclosed by FHA.  I  tell you, Mr. Chairman, charity  begins at home. Take the Contras off  welfare before  reforming welfare at  home. Let us heal our sick before we  kill  their healthy. First,  reduce our  budget deficit, our trade deficit,  the  stock market deficit, and our human  deficit, in the United States of Amer ica.  Never will I vote for aid to the Con tras of Nicaragua, when I need aid for  my own district ih these United States.  I  urge  you  to check your districts  before you vote tonight.  ",1988

367,878,1,Mr. AKAKA., I yield to the gentle man from Texas.  ,1988
368,878,1,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Chair man,  I  rise  in opposition  to House  Joint Resolution 444.  Mr. Chairman, we should concentrate in this  debate on what we agree on. We would all  acknowledge that we could not tolerate a mili tary buildup  in Nicaragua  that  threatens our  security. We could not tolerate efforts to pro mote guerrilla activity with Nicaragua's demo cratic neighbors. But  this request, unlike  the  many which have preceded it from this admin istration, comes at a time when a peace proc ess is underway.  When  it suits the purposes of this adminis tration,  proponents of Contra aid  routinely  invoke  respect  for our democratic allies  in  Central America.  Then, when  those  allies  painstakingly set forth on a path toward a ne gotiated settlement, we  tell  them  that  they  have vastly underestimated  the  threat posed  by  the Sandinistas and  the effectiveness of  the Contras. Those who say  that  ""Commu nists  never  negotiate""  overlook  President  Reagan's recent negotiation of the INF Treaty  and the fact that we can do business with our  adversaries, whether in Moscow, Havana, or  Managua, when it is in our interest and the in terest of democratic nations to do so.  There is a risk in voting to disapprove this  request. The risk is that the Sandinistas may  renege on  the concessions  they made  two  weeks ago in San Jose. They may reimpose  the state of emergency they so recently lifted;  they may unilaterally violate the terms of any  eventual cease  fire. They may resort  to  the  widespread imprisonment of the civilian oppo sition.  But the risk of ignoring the peace process is  greater. We know for certain that the provision  of aid-no matter how  it  is packaged-will  cause the process to fail. What will our policy  be then?  For  the 6 years  that  the Contra war has  been fought, this administration has continual ly declared that our goal is a democratic Nica ragua. But the prospect of real reform by the  Sandinista directorate has invariably led to ef forts  to undermine or subvert any progress  toward  regional discussions of the shape of  elections and  the restoration of civil  liberties.  We should be skeptical about the Sandinis tas' concessions. They have shown every will ingness to bankrupt the population of Nicara gua and to deplete the treasury with the threat  of an invasion of United States troops. But we  have also  given  our neighbors  in Central  America so many  reasons  to be  skeptical  about our own motives. Whatever became of  the Kissinger Commission  recommendations  in the area of economic development? What ever happened to the initial welcoming of ini tiatives  in  the areas of education,  health,  housing, and  literacy  for  the other Central  American  countries? Those  should be  the  focus of our policy,  not  the  single-minded  effort to destroy the Sandinistas militarily.  The policy of aiding  the Contras  intermit tently may have contributed  to the Sandinis tas' decision to make temporary concessions.  Whatever the motivation, they are there. That  is  the  important fact. But  the argument  that  we need  to  ""keep up  the pressure"" makes  little sense. The  ""pressure,""  the  fighting,  is  not an end in  itself. The goal is to fester the  development of a Nicaragua that we and our  Central American allies can  live with. This  vote comes amid a new set of circumstances,  which we cannot afford to ignore.  I urge my  colleagues to oppose this request and to work  to further this opportunity for peace.  ",1988
369,878,1,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to passage of this joint res olution.  Mr. Chairman, House Joint Resolu tion 444, providing $36 million in con tinued assistance  to  the Nicaraguan  resistance, would provide funds to con tinue the war and extinguish the Cen tral American peace process.  Since 1981, the administration policy  of Contra aid has yielded only bitter  fruit, failing to bring about the intend ed peace, or democratic  reforms  in  Nicaragua.  Instead,  the outlook  for  peace and democracy in Nicaragua de teriorated over the course of the civil  war, and the Contra presence in Hon duras and Costa Rica  threatened  to  destabilize the entire region.  ",1988
370,891,1,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I am going  to vote for the President's requested aid pack age for the Contras.  My vote  for aid  today can be understood  only in its proper context. This debate, unfor tunately, has not reflected  that context. We  have reduced a tremendously complex topic United States policy toward Nicaragua-to a  false simplicity. With my vote  this evening,  I  will be  labeled  ""pro-Contra."" My colleagues  who vote against the President's package will  be  labeled ""anti-Contra."" Under the terms of  this debate-across the country and  in  this  Chamber  today-those are  the only options  available to us. We are one or the other; we  are up or down; we are yes or no; we are pro Contra or pro-Arias peace plan. Both sides of  the debate have cooperated to establish this  false dichotomy, with even President Reagan  last night describing today's vote as an ""up or-down"" one.  Yet all of us know, or should know at any  rate,  that those terms are not real. This vote  isn't a referendum on whether we approve of  the Contras, or whether we dislike war, or how  strongly we disapprove of communism. This  vote answers none of  those questions. This  vote  today  is more subtle  than  that.  It  is a  judgment call. All  it says about us is whether  we  think the specific plan sent to us by  the  President will advance our respective goals in  Nicaragua. Each of us, or course,  is  free  to  use  this  vote  to  proclaim  himself  ""pro Contra,""  but  I prefer  to avoid using easy  labels and will discuss briefly why I think this  package today serves our best interests.  Since the  fall of Somoza in 1978 and  the  amost immediate repudiation of United States  overtures to the Sandinista regime, the United  States has had  roughly  four policy options  toward Nicaragua. We could give  the Sandi nistas very wide latitude, permitting them any  domestic and foreign policy activities short of  direct military attacks on the United States or  our allies. The other extreme would be an uncompromising effort to  topple  the Sandinista  regime. The third option allows the Sandinis tas  to retain  internal political control but for bids  them  from engaging  in activities  that  threaten the stability of the Central American  democracies. The  fourth option allows  the  Sandinistas  to  retain  immediate control over  the government apparatus, but requires them  to move down the road to democracy.  I reject  the  first option as a fairly obvious  and substantial threat to the security interests  of the United States as well as our moral and  ideological interests in furthering the cause of  democratic government. While  I wouldn't be  upset to see  the Sandinistas  fall,  I reject a  policy of  forcing  their departure on practical  grounds: I don't think the Sandinistas can be  ousted without direct military  intervention by  the United States, and our interests in Nicara gua are not sufficient to justify direct interven tion. The third option is not really an option in  the long-term sense. Communist dictatorships  are  inherently didactic and  repressive and a  stable peace cannot come  to a  repressive  Nicaragua.  That  leaves  the  fourth  option,  which  I endorse: Allowing  the Sandinistas to  retain immediate control over the government  so long as they do not threaten the improving  structure of democracy  in Central America  and continue to take steps toward democracy.  The package sent  to us by  the President  advances this goal. If you do not support that  goal, you are free to criticize the package: It is  an antagonistic gesture against unlimited San dinista independence on the one hand, and it  is grossly insufficient to pose a serious threat  to  the very existence of  the Sandinistas on  the other hand.  If, however, you support a  containment policy against  the Sandinistas,  you will have a difficult time explaining a vote  against this package.  In considering  this vote,  I start with  two  basic premises: First I believe that an unchal lenged  and  unfettered  Sandinista  regime  would disrupt democracies in Central America  and generally cause mischief  in our hemi sphere. Second, and even more obvious, the  Contras don't like the Sandinistas and would  prefer to expel  them. The goal, then, of con taining the Sandinistas can be achieved only  by carefully negotiating the implicit tension be tween my two premises: If we give nothing to  the Contras they disappear as an effective op position  to  the Sandinistas, who,  I believe,  would  immediately lose  their sudden  interest  in democratization and peace talks. If we give  too much to the Contras, they, in turn, lose in terest in peace talks and decide that perhaps  they should go for broke, as it were.  The terms of the aid package maintain that  tension. The amount is sufficient to keep the  Contras together as an organized opposition,  but it is not enough to give them illusions of a  purely military victory or to give the Sandinis tas immediate fear of a purely military defeat.  The placing of the $3.6 million in lethal aid in  an escrow account  is a deliberately nonpro vocative act. Only with extreme disingenuous ness could the Sandinistas cite $3.6 million in  escrowed military aid as a reason to pull out  of the peace process.  Mr. Chairman, I am on a short list of repre sentatives  labeled  ""swing votes"" on Contra  aid. I don't much care for that appellation, but  for the reasons I discussed earlier,  it's better  than being called pro-Contra or anti-Contra.  I  am not pro-Contra and I am not anti-Contra: I  simply judge each vote on its likely effects in  advancing the peace process. By that stand ard, I must vote yea today.  ",1988
371,891,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Chairman, today we vote  on the future of Central America.  The choice has never been clearer.  We can support the Guatemala peace plan,  or we can support the Contras.  We can support a policy of peace, or a  policy of war.  We can wallow in the failures of the past, or  move ahead with hope for the future.  While Congress is looking to the future, the  administration is dredging up failures from the  past.  ADMINISTRATION DOUBLE-TALK  The administration has not given us much  success in Nicaragua. They have given us a  lot of double-talk.  The President says that the Contras have a  strong support in Nicaragua. And then he says  that they will disappear unless they get Ameri can money.  The President says that Nicaragua is a to talitarian dungeon, whose people  yearn  to  throw  out  the  Sandinistas.  And  then  he  charges that the Sandinistas are going to give  guns to 600,000 people. That's a fifth of their  population.  That's  every Nicaraguan male  from 18 to 35.  So it's a totalitarian dungeon that is going to  arm its inmates.  The Reagan administration says the Sandi nistas are Communists. Then  they say  the  Contras are really Sandinistas.  Remember when President Reagan solemn ly  assured  us  that  the Contras were  not  aiming  to overthrow the Nicaraguan Govern ment-they were really kind of border patrol?  After 6 years of film-flam, Congress is get ting a little skeptical.  CONTRA AID REQUEST  The administration  is claiming credit  for a  democratic  tide  in  Latin America. But  the  Reagan administration is 0 for 2 on democra cy in our hemisphere.  Under Elliot Abrams,  the Reagan adminis tration has dropped the ball on democracy in  Haiti. They dropped the ball on democracy in  Panama. And  they were  in  the process of  losing the game in Nicaragua, until the peace  plan sent them to the sidelines.  And now they're trying  to  tell us  that they  are concerned about democracy in Nicaragua,  and that's what they want funding for the Con tras.  To follow Henry Kissinger's criticism of this  policy, where is the policy?  Is this Contra aid request part of an achiev able policy, or  is  the administration simply  asking for whatever the traffic will bear?  The lessons of the history of Central Amer ica policy are: The administration will ask for  whatever it can get, and  they will say what ever they have to to get it.  And  if we defeat this request, history does  not assure us that the Reagan administration  is a good loser.  When Congress  defeated Contra  aid  in  1985,  the administration declared a national  emergency and imposed an embargo on Nica ragua. When Congress defeated Contra aid in  ",1988
372,904,1,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 5  minutes  to  the distinguished gentle man  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.  BOLAND],  the former chairman of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intel ligence.  ",1988
373,904,1,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition  to  the President's re quest for additional  lethal and non lethal military assistance for the Nica raguan Contras.  We begin this session as we ended  the last-debating Contra aid.  Unlike 6 weeks ago, today, we debate  the issue squarely on its merits, with out the presence of other important  concerns  that  properly  commanded  our attention, during the deliberations  on the continuing resolution.  For me, the Contra aid issue reduces  itself to this question: at this critical  juncture  in  the history of Central  America, does the furtherance of the  peace process  require,  as President  Reagan maintains,  furnishing  the  Contras with more military supplies?  I cannot conclude that it does.  In fact, I believe that the opposite is  true.  If we approve  this request,  in my  judgment the odds, against the even tual success of the Arias peace plan  grow longer, rather than shorter.  There have been some helpful signs  in Central America in the past 6 weeks  since we last debated this issue.  The Central American  presidents  have met to assess the status of their  peace plan.  Not  surprisingly,  the  have  found  that in 6 months, it has not achieved  all of its goals.  But they have also found that, some  discernable progress, has been made.  The Sandinistas  and  the Contras  have met for the first time in direct  negotiations.  Cease-fire proposals have been ex changed.  Clearly, much work remains, and the  road ahead is both long and uncertain.  But I believe,  that more has been  done  to advance  the cause of peace  during  the 6 months of  the Arias  peace plan, than in the 6 years of war,  which preceded it.  The issue now,  is how to best nur ture the fragile process of negotiation,  so recently begun.  President  Reagan  argues  that  Contra military pressure drove  the  Sandinistas  to  the negotiating  table,  and that only a continuation of such  pressure will keep them there.  That, it seems to me, is a view of the  current,  and  likely  future military  stature of the Contras, that, is danger ously at odds, with reality.  Let us be candid about the limita tions of the Contras.  I have seen no evidence which would  support a conclusion, that the Contras  are the vanguard, of a popular revolu tion  likely  to  topple  the Sandinista  government.  While Contra  forces  range widely  across  sparsely  populated  areas  of  Nicaragua, they hold no terrority.  They do not have the ability to pre vent  the Sandinistas from acquiring  Soviet  bloc military  equipment,  in  fact,  they provide  a  continued pre tense for doing so.  Neither can they establish a barrier  around Nicaragua  to  prevent  the  export of Sandinista assistance to left ist guerrilla forces in Central America.  I  should  think,  that more  than 5  years  of  debating Contra  aid,  and  measuring  its  results, we would be  honest enough to acknowledge that, if  the military and paramilitary activi ties of  the Sandinistas pose a  true  threat, to the security of the United  States, and our neighbors in this hemi sphere, than we and our allies directly,  not through the use of surrogates, will  have to do something about it.  The Contras most certainly are, and  can remain, an irritant to the Sandi nistas.  They can exacerbate, an already bad  economic situation in Nicaragua.  They can ensure that more Nicara guans-combatants  and  noncombat ants alike-will die in the weeks ahead.  I would hope, however, that the goal  of our policy would be,  to produce a  result better than that, for the people  of Nicaragua.  The peace plan, crafted by the lead ers of  the nations with  the biggest  stake,  in the settlement of the con flicts in Nicaragua and the rest of Cen tral America, offers a more hopeful al ternative.

If they  shifted from ""no""  to ""yes""  it would  have been 216  to 214. And you, Mr.  Speaker, could not have voted to break  a tie. Five votes.  When my good friend from Califor nia, Mr. BERMAN,  told me this morn ing, they were hoping deliciously that  the margin of defeat would be buried  in Republican votes, and it is. Twelve  Republicans voted against their Presi dent. One of them ate up a half hour  in the Oval Office in the last few days  and  then had  a  former President,  Gerald Ford, spend another 30 min utes on the phone with him wasting  his time, wasting Ford's time. And this  is  this gentleman's first vote against  Contra aid.  Now when  the President had  tai lored a package that sounded for all  the world to me like the Mccurdy plan  named after DAVE MCCURDY, of Okla homa a year ago, and when the Presi dent  finally moves  to  the Mccurdy  plan, McCuRDY moves away from  it.  Here are five Republicans that I think  could win by 70 percent in their dis trict if they change their vote because  their district  loves  them and  they  would not care. Mr. BoEHLERT, who got  Dan Mitchell's seat  in upper New  York State, Mr. AMO HOUGHTON, who  just for  the first  time voted against  the President on Contra  aid, Mrs.  CLAUDINE SCHNEIDER, of Rhode Island,  beloved, wins with  70  percent  and  could  do whatever  she wants; Mr.  TAUKE, a BusH cochairman of Iowa. I  am a cochairman of BusH in Calif or nia so this kind of stings a little bit.  The  fifth one  is  PAUL HENRY who  holds Gerald Ford's seat in Michigan  that Ford held for 25 years.  Now there is hope, and I hope the  Ortega brothers are not laughing in  their designer glasses tonight, because  at least 9 of these 12 Republicans have  told me-I polled them on the floor  before  the vote-they  told me  that  they will switch their vote in an in stant  if Ortega screws around with  this peace process and does not start  releasing these political prisoners. And  I know at least 30 people on the other  side of the aisle, because their careers  are at stake, that would switch in a  minute if Ortega tries to screw up this  peace process.  Now  let me  tell you a  little story  that the great lady, who was once one  of the shining lights-of this delibera tive  body,  the  incomparable Claire  Booth Luce told me a few years ago at  the International Hotel off of Scott  Circle. I said, ""Is it true, Claire, that  you told young President-elect John F.  A PROCLAMATION  Hear Ye, Hear Ye,  to all  true believers  here on Gobbler's Knob and around  the  World. I, James H.

428,943,1,Mr.  BARNARD.," Mr.  Speaker,  today,  on  behalf of Mr. PARRIS and myself, I am pleased  to  introduce  the Thrift Charter Enhancement  Act of 1988. This bill is intended to increase  the attractiveness of thrift institutions, particu larly troubled thrifts, to a wide range of poten tial  investors and  thus enhance the value of  thrift charters.  Its central  thrust would be  to  remove certain onerous features of thrift regu lation that are now reducing the desirability of  thrift ownership and preventing new acquisi tions of failing and healthy thrifts alike. The re sulting private  investment  that could be ex pected from enactment of the bill would inject  much needed capital  into  the  thrift  industry  and significantly help the FSLIC to find buyers  for  troubled  institutions. The  following  are  some of the reasons such a result is especial ly important at this time:  The amount of capital raised by last year's  Competitive Equality Banking Act is  likely  to  be insufficient to meet FSLIC's needs in deal ing with the industry's failures.  The healthy portion of the thrift industry will  not be able to bear any additional insurance  burden without creating a substantial addition al incentive to leave FSLIC.  A bailout of the FSLIC by the U.S. Treasury  would be extraordinarily unpopular,  if not im possible, politically.  A merger of the FSLIC with the FDIC would  be politically unpopularneither the thrift nor  the  banking  industry  supports  such  an  action-and would produce a single fund that  might well be  insufficient  to protect against  potential  losses of  the  two  industries com bined.  The investment of additional private capital  would reduce the costs to FSLIC associated  with  the disposal of failed  thrifts, reduce the  number  of new  failures,  and  sustain  the  growth necessary to increase FSLIC premium  receipts. The Thrift Charter Enhancement Act  of 1988 proposes only modest changes  in  thrift status, but they are designed specifically  to attract new investors and to keep current  investors  interested  in  thrift ownership. The  following are some examples of the bill's pro visions.  Debt  issuance and affiliate  transaction  re strictions would be relaxed for thrifts and thrift  holding companies so  they more closely re semble those governing banks and bank hold ing companies.  New, or ""de novo,"" institutions, which now  have stricter regulatory  requirements applied  HOW NOT TO RUN THE  RAILROADS  HON. NORMAN F. LENT  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 3, 1988  ",1988
429,943,1,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Speaker, as a proponent of  the public stock offering for the sale of Con rail,  I would like to call Members' attention to  an article  in  the February 8, 1988,  issue of  Forbes magazine. Entitled ""How not to run a  railroad,""  the article chronicles  the Conrail  success story and the effective leadership of  its chairman, L. Stanley Crane. It also focuses  on  the need for Congress to take care in  its  deliberations on proposed amendments to the  1989 Staggers Act.  I recommend  this article  to each and every Member.  How NOT To RUN THE RAILROADS  <By James Cook)  Less than a year after Consolidated Rail  Corp. went public  in  the  largest  initial  public stock offering  in U.S. history,  its  feisty boss, L. Stanley Crane, is worried that  Congress  is about to legislate Conrail and  the rest of the railroad industry back into  bankruptcy.  Crane's labor in transforming an amalgam  of bankrupt railroads that had been taken  over by the federal government into a viable  independent property ranks as one of the  great managerial triumphs of the postwar  era. But now a group of shippers, primarily  in the utility and coal industries, complains  that they're the helpless captive of the rail road octopus, and are  trying  to persuade  Congress to re regulate the industry. Crane  reckons  their proposal could cost Conrail  $400 million in revenues and wipe out the  $270 million or so Conrail earned last year.  ""You take away $400 million in revenues,""  he says, ""and there's no way I could take  $400 million of expenses out of the company  unless I abandon a hell of a lot of track out  there.""  Crane, now 72, is understandably proud of  what he has accomplished at Conrail in the  nearly eight years since he retired as head  of Southern Railway, now Norfolk South ern. From his headquarters in Philadelphia,  he not only got the company back on its  feet but he made it one of the most efficient  and aggressively managed railroads  in the  U.S.  today. Conrail's operating  ratio-ex penses as a percentage of  revenue-went  from 106% in 1980 to 87.2% in 1986.  Thus did Conrail move out of the red and  solidly into the black, from a 1980 operating  loss of $188 million  to a 1986 operating  profit of $403 million-$359 million if you  eliminate various temporary employee bene fit and tax concessions. Conrail did so de spite a $224 million drop in revenues, to $3.1  billion. In the process, Conrail's share of the  943  freight market gradually  eastern  railroad  expanded.  Special dispensations  from most of  the  parties  involved were crucial  to Conrail's  turnaround-$3.28  billion  in  government  money, state and federal  tax concessions,  authority  to  cease  passenger operations,  scrap 9,300 miles of track and let go 35,000  freight employees. Most  important of all,  Crane wrung major wage concessions from  the labor unions, all of which ended as Con rail prepared to go public.  With those things going for it, what made  Conrail so imposing a player in the current  transportation game was the Staggers Act  of 1980. Staggers  effectively deregulated  railroad pricing for the first time since the  turn of the century. The act was the govern ment's  long overdue  recognition  that  the  railroads' once-vaunted transportation mo nopoly was no more. Costs and competition  would henceforward determine  the  indus try's price structure. The impact of that act  turned the industry upside down.  For one thing, the Staggers Act permitted  a  railroad to cancel the joint rates it had  with connecting railroads if it couldn't make  money on them. That's a matter of no small  importance, considering that half of a rail road's business may be interchanged with  somebody else's.  In the old days, as Crane explains, if you  carried a shipment half the total distance,  you  got  half  the  revenuesno matter  whether you incurred half the costs. Conrail  and its predecessors had complained for dec ades that, with its high terminal costs, it got  the short end of the stick in dividing the  revenues with other railroads. Staggers en abled Conrail to cancel joint rates right and  left and reprice its service to cover costs. As  former head of Southern, one of the offend ing connections, Crane knew where all the  bodies were buried. ""It wasn't rates  that  mattered, it was the divisions,"" Crane chor tles. ""That's where the money came from.""  Regulations had also forced the railroads  to equalize rates over all available routes be tween  the same points regardless of cost.  Staggers put an end to that as well. Conrail  began setting its rates to reflect the cost of  handling the business. If that meant some  of its rates seemed prohibitively high, why,  better not to carry something at all than to  carry it at a loss.  Equally important, the railroads were for  the first time free  to offer contract rates,  which now cover roughly 40% of Conrail's  total  traffic. Such  rates were  generally  lower than regular rates, and they went to  shippers who could guarantee certain vol umes of  traffic under certain conditions.  This enabled both shippers and  the  rail roads  to planto spend money on things  like equipment and terminals because the  revenues to justify them were assured.  In going after  the now booming stack train business, for  instance, Conrail could  offer shippers like American President Cos.  fixed rates for the service under long-term  contracts. This, in turn, enabled American  President to buy its own equipment for the  double-stack service and Conrail  to spend  the money to increase railroad tunnel clear ance to accommodate the double-stack cars.  Because contract rates are confidential,  the railroads could also offer one rate to one  customer and a different rate to another.  ""Such secrecy has allowed us to offer an in dividual shipper something we could never  offer if we had to make it available every where."" Here's an example of this new free dom in action.  ",1988

At  the  same  time, I have unequivocally called for a  negotiated settlement as a permanent  end to all hostilities in Central Amer ica. These  two positions have gone  hand-in-hand. I believe that the pres sure of the Contras was one of the pri mary  reasons  that President Ortega  signed the Guatemala accord, pledging  to  a  systematic democratization  of  Nicaragua. The peace process, initiat ed by the accord, is an important op portunity for a  lasting peace in Cen tral America. Assistance  to the Con tras has played an important role in  bringing about this diplomatic and po litical process.  We must not  forget  that Daniel  Ortega is a Communist and that the  Sandinistas are a small group of Marx ist-Leninist who have monopolized the  political  decisionmaking  process  in  Nicaragua.  This  Government  has  alienated its democratic counterparts  in the revolution, and if the Sandinis tas are able to consolidate power they  will be a threat to every other country  in the region.  Equally important, we must remem ber that the fundamental goal of our  policy is peace and democracy in Cen tral America. I have strongly support ed the Guatemala accord because it es tablishes the framework for long last ing peace. The peace process provides  an important opportunity which must  be taken very seriously. If this process  fails,  there is no end in sight to the  hostilities in Central America.  By signing  the Guatemala accord,  Nicaragua bound itself to a process of  democratization which includes lifting  the state of emergency; allowing com plete freedom for television, radio, and  the press; permitting complete politi cal  pluralism;  negotiating with  the  Contras for a cease fire; implementing  an  amnesty  program;  and  finally,  holding free and fair democratic elec tions.  This is the basic program of change  I have been calling for as long as this  issue has been before Congress. It is  based on President Arias' firm convic tion  that, ""without democracy  there  can be no peace in Central America.""  Full  compliance would  significantly  democratize Nicaragua  and  provide  the foundation for a lasting peace.  ",1988
440,1034,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  time of the Senator has expired.  The Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr.  President,  the  statement the Senator has just given  has presented  the  finest picture on  Central America, presented by the dis tinguished  chairman of  the  Intelli gence Committee, a man who exempli fies  the bipartisanship  that  should  characterize this entire debate.  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to  my  colleague  from California  [Mr.  WILSON].  ",1988

442,1034,1,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, let me  join in the commendation paid Sena tor Boren, the chairman of the Senate  Intelligence Committee, by my junior  colleague, the Senator from Arizona.  While I am admiring Democrats on  the floor, and I admire many, let me  say that I also join in the observation  made with considerable eloquence ear lier today by the senior Senator from  Texas who,  to paraphrase what he  said, finds it bizarre that in a virtually  parallel situation we have no doubt  about the wisdom of spending many,  many  times more  funds  than  the  paltry sums  that we  supply  to  the  Contras in order to support freedom  fighters in Afghanistan.  The parallels are obvious. In both  situations we have a Communist op pressor  being  resisted  by  freedom  fighters  seeking  to  take back  their  own land and to restore to it the kind  of freedom that should be the birth right of all men everywhere but clear ly is not.  There is, of course, a significant dif ference that the senior Senator _from  Texas spoke upon, and that is that Af ghanistan  is  halfway  around  the  world, whereas here on our doorstep,  literally within walking distance, we  have in Central America a war going  on that has produced a flood of refu gees who are literally able to walk to  the United States.

446,1047,1,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, one is  temped to reply to the rhetoric that  has come around in like time. But the  time has come  to  try  to reduce  the  rhetoric now and to take a look at the  recent history of Nicaragua. There are  some salient facts that need to be re called.  First,  the  revolution  that brought  the Sandinistas to power occurred in  July of 1979. Nicaragua was devastat ed, completely laid to waste. The Nica raguans tried to rebuild their country  over the next year or so. In fact, the  United States gave the Commandantes  ",1988
447,1073,1,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President,  in all  likelihood, the Department of Justice  will shortly make public the Federal  indictment of Gen. Manuel Antonio  Noriega, the de facto head of Panama,  and his coconspirators.  The litany of Noriega's sordid activi ties  is  beyond belief-but  there  is  scant  doubt  about  their  accuracy.  These include international drug traf ficking, arms  trafficking  to Commu nist guerrillas, murder, illegal sales of  computer technology to Cuba, illegal  sales of visas to Cubans, unprecedent ed corruption, and the transfer of sen sitive CIA intelligence to the Commu nists  in Cuba and El Salvador. And  there are other matters.  Mr. President, for a decade I have  tried  to warn  the American people  about Noriega's activities.  In April  1978, I spoke in this Chamber about  the involvement of high-ranking offi cials of the Panama defense forces in  drug trafficking. Noriega, now at the  helm of the defense forces, blatantly  uses those forces to control the gov ernment. Needless to say, the people  of Panama want  this dictator out.  They want their country back.  Noriega has developed  a  complex  network of civilians and military men  to handle his illicit operations. Many  of these persons have been mentioned  in recent press reports. The men who  make up the civilian group are Enri que Pretelt, George Novey III, Carlos  Whitgreen,  Jorge  Krupnik,  Floyd  Carlton-awaiting trial, and Cesar Ro driguez-murdered  in Colombia  last  year.  Mr. President, at least eight key men  form the group of military men who  handle these operations for Noriega.  They  are: Maj. Nivaldo Madrinan,  Maj. Luis Cordova, Maj. Luis del Cid,  Maj. Cleto Hernandez, Maj.  Jaime  Benitez, Maj. Rafael Cedeno, Maj. Hi lario Trujillo, and Capt. Luis Quiel. All  of these worked for Noriega when he  was in charge of military intelligence.  Furthermore,  according  to  former  Noriega associates, there is a group of  Air Force officers who conduct drug  smuggling  operations  for  Noriega.  They are: Col. Alberto PurceL, Col.  Lorenzo Purcell, Maj. Alberto Fun dora, and Col. Marcos Justines.  General Noriega was chief of Pana manian intelligence <G-2)  from 1971  to 1983. Since 1983 he has been the  commander in chief of the Panama de fense forces. In the last 5 years he has  converted Panama  into a  criminal's  paradise.  He has seized control of every impor tant Panamanian  institution-which  allows him to carry out with ease his  drug smuggling and money laundering  activities. The directors of the follow ing  departments  report  directly  to  Noriega: National Bank of Panama,  Immigration, Customs, Civil Aeronau tics, Treasury, Comptroller, Attorney  General, and the President of the Su preme Court.  For several years I have been prob ing the situation in Panama and the  gangster activities of Noriega and his  associates. First, as chairman of the  Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee  and now as ranking minority member  of the Foreign Relations Committee, I  have conducted hearings, taken depo sitions, and held personal  interviews  with scores of Panamanians, and di rected staff to make thorough investi gations. What has been discovered is  that Panama is today a haven for drug  traffickers,  terrorists, and Mafia hit  men.  Mr. President,  it has become clear  that Noriega is not involved solely in  the exportation of drugs to the United  States. He has been  involved in the  supply of arms to the Communist M19 guerrillas of Colombia, which has  enabled the guerrillas to kill the Min ister of Justice, and half of the Su preme Court. Noriega then gave these  terrorists protection in Panama.  Noriega has also been sending weap ons  to  the Marxist-Leninist FMLN  guerrillas of El Salvador. This connec tion first became public in 1980 when  a Panama defense force plane crashed  in El Salvador while delivering weap ons to the Communist guerrillas. Ac cording to credible sources, these arms  transfers to the Salvadoran guerrillas  were continuing as  recently as  late  1987.  Mr. President, not only was Noriega  arranging for arms shipments to the  FMLN guerrillas, he was also known  to be holding meetings with the most  important leaders of these guerrillas.  They  have  sought  safe  haven  in  Panama many times, and their leader,  Guillermo Ungo, now lives there.  It is abundantly clear that Noriega  has been providing protection for drug  traffickers, money launderers, and ter rorists  for many years. These gang sters are free to roam the streets of  Panama without any fear of being ar rested. Some of Noriega's former asso ciates  have  been  convicted  in  the  United States, or otherwise cooperated  with the Senate. They have testified  to us that they were routinely met at  the airport by chauffeur-driven limou sines and bodyguards while on Norie ga's drug business. They have testified  ",1988
448,1099,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce the Presidential Transition  Effectiveness Act of 1988. This bill re flects an effort by the Governmental  Affairs Committee  to  ensure  that  future  transitions,  including  the  coming 1988  transition, are properly  funded and supported.  It has been 12 years since Congress  last adjusted the funding levels in the  1963 Presidential Transition Act. That  act was  passed  to  provide  for  the  smooth transfer of power between ad ministrations,  originally  providing  $450,000 to the incoming Presidential  administration to cover  the costs of  preparing  for  the  assumption  of  office-for example, staff, office space,  and travel. The General Services Ad ministration was made responsible for  making sure all of the expenses were  legitimate.  Prior to 1963,  transitions were pri vate affairs. The President-elect either  had to raise the money for the transi tion by himself or rely on the national  party committees. Congress took note  of the problem in passing the Presi dential Transition Act, expressing its  view  that transitions were public  in  nature, and that the legitimate costs  of a transition ought to be covered in  large part by Government funds. The  funding allotment under the act was  raised to $2,000,000 in 1976, where it  remains today.  Obviously, we will have a Presiden tial transition in 1988. The question  for us is whether the incoming admin istration will have  the  resources  to  prepare itself for office, whether we  can make several changes today that  will help not just the next President elect, but Presidents-elect far into the  future.  Funding is a key concern. Account ing for  the effects of  inflation,  the  $2,000,000 provided to President-elect  Carter in 1976  is worth roughly $1.2  million today. Unlike the Federal elec tion fund, which has grown automati cally from $20 million in 1976 to $44  million  today, Presidential transition  funds are not indexed to rise with in flation. As a  result,  the next Presi dent-elect will almost certainly have to  raise private money to cover some of  the costs of the transition.  Even  if Congress were  to  increase  the public contribution to cover the in flation-adjusted  costs of  transitions,  some private money  is  likely  to be  raised in the absence of any prohibi tion on such. Should such funds be  subject to some regulation? Under cur rent Federal election regulations, for  example, Presidential candidates are  required to submit detailed reports on  all private cash contributions to the  Federal Election Commission.  In contrast, during both the pre-and  post-election period,  there are abso lutely no  restrictions whatsoever on  private money for Presidential transi tions. The question  is whether  the  lack of any disclosure undermines the  public controls which exist under the  Federal Election Campaign Act.  does not appear to make sense to con trol the flow of private cash during  the election campaigns only  to open  the door for undisclosed contributions  either for transition planning during  the pre-election period or for the tran sition itself after the election is over.  The committee examined these and  other issues in hearings last Septem ber and October. As a result of those  hearings, and close consultation with  past transition officials  in both par ties,  I have concluded that Congress  should amend  the 1963 Presidential  It  ",1988
449,1125,1,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President,  I  am  introducing  today, with Senator  GARN, a  joint resolution calling for a  Presidential proclamation of ""National  NHS/NeighborWorks Week""  begin ning June 5, 1988.  This  resolution  seeks  to  increase  public  awareness  of Neighborhood  Housing Services [NHS], and its part ners, the Mutual Housing Associations  and Apartment  Improvement  Pro grams. These NeighborWorks partner ships are the largest network of volun teers-based,  nonprofit  corporations  working to revitalize older neighbor hoods in the United States.  The  resolution  honors  the  thou sands of citizen volunteers who have  contributed their time and energy to  NeighborWorks;  and  recognizes  the  active  cooperation of  thousands of  businessmen and hundreds of  local  in  Neighbor government  officials  Works activities.  NeighborWorks partnerships are ini tiated and funded locally. They have  been organized  in 137 cities and 297  neighborhoods  across  the  country.  Over 3,000 businesses and  local gov ernments contribute some $16 million  yearly to NeighborWorks activities. It  is estimated that over $4 billion has al ready been invested in rehabilitating  and developing NeighborWorks' neigh borhoods.  Rehabilitation  objectives  have been successfully completed  in  more than 60 neighborhoods.  Mr. President, preserving  the Na tion's housing  is a national priority.  Reinvesting in older neighborhoods is  good budget and social policy. Over a  decade ago, I introduced legislation es tablishing a Neighborhood Reinvest ment Corp., to promote neighborhood  renewal  through  local  action. The  local-action  neighborhood  reinvest ment  program  begun  in  1977  has  become, in little more than a decade,  NHS/NeighborWorks in 137 cities and  297 neighborhoods.  That's a success story that needs to  be recognized-and fostered. I urge my  colleagues  to  join me  and Senator  GARN in designating the week of June  5, 1988, as ""National NHS/Neighbor Works Week.""  ",1988
450,1125,1,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  today  Senator PROXMIRE and I are introduc ing a  joint  resolution calling  for  a  Presidential proclamation of National  Neighborhood  Housing  Services  NeighborWorks Week during the week  of June 5-11, 1988.  The purpose of the resolution is to  heighten  public  awareness  and  in crease  private  sector  support  for  Neighborhood  Housing  Services  [NHS] and  its affiliated partnership  organizations,  Apartment  Improve ment Programs and Mutual Housing  Associations,  which  are  rebuilding  America's  lower  income  neighbor hoods through public/private partici pation. The resolution will also honor  those volunteer partners who have  contributed countless hours of work  and financial resources to their local  NHS.  The NeighborWorks network is the  largest  neighborhood-based  network  of public/private partnerships at work  revitalizing  neighborhoods  in  our  country  today. NeighborWorks part nerships are working in 237 neighbor hoods in 137 cities, which along with  60  self-reliant neighborhoods, house  nearly 3 million people. The  track  record of the NeighborWorks network  has been  impressive. Over 14 years,  the NHS partnerships have generated  more than $4 billion in reinvestment  fo!:.;..ittte  rehabilitation  and  develop ment of America's low-income housing  stock.  Each NeighborWorks partnership is  a locally controlled, nonprofit corpora tion managed by a volunteer board of  directors, composed of residents, busi ness representatives, and local govern ment officials. Each partnership is lo cally funded by private sector institu tions and the local government. More  than 3,000 businesses and local govern ments are contributing  to  the oper ations of  their  local NeighborWorks  partnerships at an annual level of $16  million.  In 1978 Senator PROXMIRE  and  I  coauthored the legislation creating the  Neighborhood  Reinvestment  Corp.  which helps local communities develop  Neighborhood Housing Services Pro grams and provides  technical assist ance. It has been very rewarding to see  the expansion and success of  these  programs.  As a former mayor and a member of  the Housing Subcommittee,  I  have  had the opportunity to witness their  work first hand. In Salt Lake City for  instance, one of the critical features of  the Neighborhood Housing Services  revitalization strategy has been com munity  involvement.  In  response  to  youth unemployment and  the prob lems that result when young people  aren't involved  in meaningful activi ties,  the  local NHS established  the  West Side youth project which has de veloped trade and employment skills  in over 100 young people. It has pre sented a positive image of the youth  on the West Side and helped reduce  neighborhood  tensions and negative  stereotypes. The youth have been in volved in short-term, meaningful work  projects and have had direct contact  with local residents through the per formance of jobs and services. I under stand this project is going to be nomi nated for several national awards and  will serve as a pilot in other areas of  the country.  Keeping  NeighborWorks  partner ship organizations strong and enabling  them  to  serve  additional  neighbor hoods requires a steady renewal of this  local government and private sector  support.  ""National  Neighborhood  Housing  Services/N eighborWorks  Week""  will  strengthen  this  local  public/private partnership and I invite  my colleagues to join with us in sup port of this resolution.

463,1229,1,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  pay my respects to Donald L. Rogers  not only for his contributions to bank ing but also for his integrity and trust worthiness. Don Rogers died on Janu ary 18 at which time he was president  of  the Association of Bank Holding  Companies, approaching the 30th an niversary of the association under his  leadership.  Don Rogers grew up in Steubenville,  OH,  attended Miami University  in  Oxford, OH and was graduated from  the College of Law of Ohio State Uni versity  in Columbus. At Ohio State  University he became active  in  the  Young Republican Club and started a  lasting  friendship. After his  admit tance to the bar, Don Rogers  joined  the staff of the Senate Banking and  Currency Committee in 1953 as associ ate counsel, later to become counsel.  His  sponsor was Senator  John W.  Bricker of Ohio,  the second ranking  Republican. However, a great part of  his work was for the Subcommittee on  Banking of which Democratic Senator  A. Willis Robertson, of Virginia was  chairman. The staff of  the Banking  Committee worked together in a pro fessional manner in assisting Senators  from both sides of the aisle. Don typi fied that type of the highest prof es sional duty. He worked on legislation  where he was credited with the recodi fication of the Federal banking laws  which was contained in the proposed  Financial Institutions Act of 1957 as  passed by the Senate though killed in  the House. It was however later en acted in separate bills. Don Rogers did  the Senate staff work on the major  piece of legislation-the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956.  Don became the executive director later president in 1976-of the Associa tion of Bank Holding Companies  in  October 1958, 5 months after its orga nization. It has been written that this  was a case of a job finding a man, not  a man  finding  a  job. Don Rogers  brought to the association his exper tise,  honesty,  and  dedication,  and  made the association his career. Over  the past three decades the association  under his leadership has earned the  respect of Members and staff of the  Congress, the White House, The Fed eral Reserve and the agencies of the  executive branch.  I  shall miss  his  counsel  and his  friendship. To his lovely wife, Helen, I  extend my deepest condolences.  At this point in my remarks, I am in cluding a statement by John R. Petty,  chairman of the Association of Bank  Holding Companies, in the RECORD:  STATEMENT BY JOHN R. PETTY  Don Rogers, more than any other individ ual, has been associated with the success of  the bank holding company movement in the  United States. From his tenure as Counsel  to the Senate Banking Committee <1953-58)  to the present day, Mr. Rogers' encyclopedic  knowledge of the Bank Holding Company  Act and related statutes has been legendary.  Whenever any signifiant question on  the  subject has arisen in Congress or the regula tory agencies over the years, government of ficials, members of Congress,  and other  Washington  insiders have  turned  to Don  Rogers for guidance and enlightenment.  Don's integrity, foresight, and leadership  have been vital components in fashioning the  constructive evolution of the financial serv ices industry, in which bank holding compa nies play a central role. His advocacy of ex panding the base of the industry to allow  for a broader array of products and services  to be offered on a widespread geographic  basis was of genuine benefit to consumers  and small businessmen, and will continue to  benefit the American public as those poli cies are further implemented.  At  the same  time, Don Rogers presided  over the growth of the Associaton of Bank  Holding Companies, nurturing its evolution  from a group of 11 members in 1958, when  bank holding companies were a rarity and  were viewed with suspicion in many quar ters. Today, the association's 125 members  account for almost 75% of the nation's do mestic banking assets, and the bank holding  company has become the dominant form of  banking structure.  As  President  of  the Association, Don  helped  fashion  forward-looking  legislative  and regulatory policies for the Association  and for bank holding companies generally.  Positions  the Association  took  over  the  years with his leadership have proven pro phetic and correct. In 1980, at the Associa tion's Annual Meeting in Williamsburg, Vir ginia, the members voted a historic policy  regarding interstate banking, which includ ed a proviso urging members to enact state  reciprocal banking statutes.

464,1333,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, after 70  years of  totalitarian  rule  the Soviet empire  continues  to crush  the human spirit of hun dreds of millions of people  throughout  the  world. Despite this tragedy, America has de cided  to  reward  this  festering destiny with  treaty after broken  treaty and appeasement  ad nauseum.  Two lessons should be garnered from histo ry. First,  that the Soviets have not extended  their empire 1 inch since the beginning of a  treaty-less  Reagan  administration;  and  second, that peace will never be found in the  dry ink on parchment paper. Peace is a char acteristic of the human spirit.  Mr. Speaker,  the  following  letter  to  editor sets forth clearly this latter lesson:  [From the North County <CA) Blade Tribune, Dec. 11, 1987]  the  A PURE ILLUSION  EDITOR:  All this talk about summit, glasnost (pub licity), and treaties, obscures the fundamen tal and continuing differences between a  collectivist and a free man as they define  themselves,  structure  their  environment  and their institutions.  A free man ""is endowed by his Creator  with      Liberty,"" or the ability to choose.  A collectivist is allowed some privileges by  his government.  A free man experiences freedom, the op portunity to make choices.  A collectivist is told what to do.  A free man's government exists  guard his natural rights.  A collectivist serves his government.  A free man is the base unit of value as an  individual.  A collectivist is valuable only as he is a  useful member of the group.  Unless  and  until  collectivism  defines  human nature in natural, or Jeffersonian,  or biblical  terms <man:  the choicemaker),  such cosmetic and image-oriented activities  as glasnost <USSR) or ""peace treaty"" <Nica ragua and Afghanistan) are pure illusion in tended for control purposes.  Remember, peace is not a cause   an effect.  to safe it's      JAMES FLETCHER BAXTER,  Carlsbad.  ~-~-.. - l;   ......... --    EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  THE  NATIONAL  HISTORICAL  PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS  COMMISSION AMENDMENTS  HON. JACK BROOKS  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 9, 1988  ",1988
465,1333,1,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker,  today, along  with Congressmen  GLEN  ENGLISH,  FRANK  HORTON, and AL McCANDLESS, I am introduc ing  the National Historical Publications and  Records Commission amendments of 1988.  This bill will make minor amendments to the  statutory provisions which establish  the Na tional  Historical  Publications  and  Records  Commission [NHPRC] as an entity of the Na tional Archives and Records Administration. It  also will authorize funding for NHPRC's grants  program for the next 5 years.  With the bicentennial of our Constitution just  past, it is appropriate that we should consider  this  legislation. That celebration reminded all  of us how important our Nation's documentary  heritage  is  to  the understanding of how our  Government works. The NHPRC was created  in  the act  that established  the National Ar chives in 1934, with the mission of leading the  efforts  to preserve and publish our Nation's  historical documents. For the past 24 years,  the NHPRC's Grants Program has supported  projects across the Nation that have kept his torical records from being lost through the rav ages of time and neglect.  The  legislation  I am  introducing  today has  two parts. The first part makes minor changes  in the NHPRC's operational structure, as codi fied in Chapter 25 of Title 44, U.S.C.; it gener ally tracks a legislative recommendation  that  was transmitted to the Congress by the acting  archivist on September 30, 1987.  The second portion of  the  legislation au thorizes appropriations to the NHPRC for the  next 5 years.  It provides for authorizations of  $5 million  annually-the  current  authoriza tion-for fiscal years 1989 and 1990, $8 mil lion annually for fiscal years 1991 and 1992,  and $1 O million annually for fiscal year 1993.  This will allow the Congress to assess and ap propriate funds for NHPRC's important work in  light of prevailing overall budgetary conditions.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to  support this legislation. It will help ensure that  future generations will have a full understand ing of our Nation and its heritage.  UPGRADING THE DIRECTOR OF  THE CENSUS BUREAU TO EX ECUTIVE LEVEL IV  HON. MERVYN M. DYMALLY  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 9, 1988  ",1988
466,1333,1,Mr. DYMALL Y.," Mr. Speaker, I recently intro duced a bill, H.R. 3896 which amends title 5,  United States Code to upgrade the position of  the Census Bureau Director  from executive  level V to executive level IV.  The present executive level position of the  Census Bureau Director, who is appointed by  the President with the advice and consent of  1333  the Senate, is not commensurate with the au thority  and  responsibilities  exercised within  and on behalf of  the Department of Com merce by that official.  It was set in the early  1960's before legislation expanded the activi ties and roles of the Census Bureau.  The work of  the Census Bureau  in  recent  years  includes  the decennial, economic and  agricultural census. The data collected  from  these censuses are used in public and private  planning, including such matters as tax policy  and Social Security. Additionally, many Feder al agencies rely on the Census Bureau for key  statistical surveys, analyses, and training.  The role of the Bureau, however, is not re flected in the level now accorded the position  of its Director. A comparative analysis of func tions and responsibilities at the various levels  of the executive schedule found in the Depart ment of Commerce and  its level  IV positions  shows clearly that the Census Bureau Direc tor's responsibilities are comparable to those  of other Commerce Department level IV posi tions.  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons  I urge that  the position of Director, Bureau of Census,  should be raised from a level V to a level IV  of  the executive schedule  found  in  title 5,  United States Code, section 5315.

469,1359,1,Mr.  SIMPSON.,"  Just  briefly, Mr.  Leader, we are prepared now to go for ward after  this recess.  I again com mend  the majority  leader  for  the  format where we are assured of doing  our work for 3 solid weeks a month  without question, votes on Mondays  and Fridays, and having this opportu nity for official visits and delegation  activity in our own States. That was  very helpful and it gives us all a better  handle on our lives as we deal with the  quality of  life  issues.  I  think  that  worked very well. Senators were able  to do this trip and others of us were  able to go home and have opportuni ties to visit with our constituents in  midweek. We do not get that opportu nity unless we usually have a substan tial recess. And it was very helpful and  very  important. And  I  thank  the  leader for helping and assuring that  we get to that type of format.  So, indeed, we are prepared on this  side of the aisle to go forward, as we  did in these last weeks. We did assist  in a bipartisan effort on the Grove  City activity. That was certainly bipar tisan all throughout on the issues-se rious,  tough issues-of abortion neu trality and we reached a result there  which culminated a 4-year effort and  involved many on both sides of the  aisle.  Justice Kennedy will be sworn  in  this Thursday and we have completed  that travail through three nominees.  And that has involved many of us. The  Supreme Court of the United States  will have a full complement to do its  work which is so critically important. I  think we are all pleased with that.  Now we will proceed with  the  re maining vacancies in the Federal court  system,  and  the committee will  do  that. Senator LEAHY is involved in the  ad hoc committee to help resolve that.  At this time, I want to pay personal  wishes and best wishes for a speedy  and full recovery to our fine chairman  of the Judiciary Committee, a very ca pable and fair man,  JOE BIDEN. We  wish him well as he recovers from very  serious  surgery which  took  place  during the recess period; and to his  lovely wife Jill and to little Ashley and  Joseph and Robert whom I have come  to know. God bless them all and sus tain him in this time of trial.  So, Mr. Leader, we will now be ready  to proceed with you in these weeks to  come on the budget and the INF and  Canadian-United  States  free  trade  agreement, which needs a good deal of  our careful attention, and other items  that will certainly be before us.  At this time I would ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  Senator DOLE'S bicentennial minute  for today.  BICENTENNIAL MINUTE  FEBRUARY 14, 1931: COMPLETING THE RUSSELL  BUILDING   ",1988
470,1359,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, 57 years  ago this week, on February 14, 1931,  the Senate voted to spend $3 million  to complete the office building that we  know  today as  the Richard Russell  Building.  This  first  Senate Office  Building was begun in 1906 and com pleted in 1909. The structure's archi tectural plans mirrored  the Cannon  House Office Building  in most  re spects, except that it was originally C  shaped, with the north end open along  First Street. The 1931 plan called for  closing in the north end and creating a  quadrangular building.  The growing size of the Senate staff  and Senators' need for more space pro vided the rationale for this expansion.  In supporting the funding request, Ap propriations  Committee  Chairman  Wesley Jones pointed out that about  20 Senators had only 2 rooms apiece.  ""I know that the work of Senators is  increasing every year,"" said Senator  Jones. ""I know that a Senator with  four or more clerks-and  there are  none with  fewer-cannot  get  along  very well with only  two  rooms. He  must have some privacy. He must have  some means of meeting  the people  from his State  in a private sort of  way.""  Senator David Walsh of Massachu setts objected that the new wing to  the office building would curtail venti lation and light to inside rooms, and  would cause ""a mad scramble for out side rooms."" He added, ""I come from a  large State; I have a fairly large mail  and a fairly large number of callers. I  occupied two rooms for 3 years. It was  unpleasant and  there was some dis comfort, but what harm  is  there  in  having 15 or 20 new Senators for a  year or  two  being  content with  2  rooms, with the assurance that finally  they will get 3 good rooms."" But in the  end, the need for more space prevailed  over  these complaints and  the new  wing was completed in 1933.e  ",1988
471,1359,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," It was interesting, I  believe,  the comment on the Russell  Senate Office Building, that 57 years  ago the Senate voted to spend $3 mil lion  for  the Russell Senate Office  Building. It was not originally called  that. First it was  the Senate Office  Building and when the Dirksen Build ing was built it was simply abbreviated  to SOB, which has a connotation all  its own in the West. But, nevertheless,  we have spent a  little more than $3  million on every building since I have  been here. And it is an interesting re lation  of  that  in  the  bicentennial  minute.  So  I  do  commend  the majority  leader and  look  forward  to working  with him. And I do indeed mean that.  I thank the majority leader.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore.

472,1359,1,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, this  is  the second in a series of speeches  this  Senator  is  delivering  in  the  Senate on the extraordinarily useful  analysis by Senator LEVIN of the myth  of so-called Soviet dominance of con ventional  forces  in Europe. Senator  LEVIN'S  study  contends  that  the  Warsaw Pact does not have anything  like the overwhelming military domi nance in conventional military forces  in Europe that the Reagan administra tion alleges. LEVIN concedes however,  that the Warsaw Pact has an advan tage in some respects but he contends  that these advantages are counterba lanced by NATO advantages in other  areas. In this speech I will discuss the  Warsaw Pact advantages  in  the de ployment of forces. Senator LEVIN con cludes that in this respect the Warsaw  Pact  is,  indeed, ahead. He also con cludes, however, that the disadvantage  for NATO can be quickly and easily  corrected  by moving more NATO  troops  into  the  forward position  to  which  they are assigned and reposi tioning some of the best trained and  equipped NATO forces  in the north",1988

INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLA TION  TO  ESTABLISH  THE  DELAWARE AND LEHIGH NAVI GATION  CANAL  NATIONAL  HERITAGE CORRIDOR  IN THE  COMMONWEALTH  OF  PENN SYLVANIA  ,1988
475,1411,1,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman  from  Pennsylvaina  [Mr.  RITTER] is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1988
476,1411,1,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, today, it  is my pleasure, along with Congress man KosTMA YER,  to bring an impor tant  historical  and  environmental  treasure to  the attention of my col leagues and the Nation. This treasure  is part of an elaborate national canal  and river-based transportation system  which provided the infrastructure for  supplying our developing Nation with  the coal that fueled its factories and  heated its homes. The proposed Dela ware and Lehigh National Heritage  Corridor is that treasure.  In the Lehigh Valley, the corridor,  rooted in the Lehigh Canal and the  Lehigh River, weaves its way through  the region like a  thread  joining the  fabric of adjacent communities. This  corridor, beyond even its vast histori cal significance, allows us  to finally  bring a  regional focus to the Lehigh  River and its surroundings; the corri dor will  allow us  to coordinate  the  many parties interested in furthering  our No.  1 natural  resource. Several  years ago I brought together a group  of public officials and private citizens  from county executives to shad fisher man;  from history buffs  to business  people; from bankers to boaters. We  sought to develop a focus, an agenda,  and a plan for bringing the Lehigh  River back to  its days of glory. We  sought to help this beautiful natural  resource to once again live up to its po tential, an appropriate 1980's version  of the halycon days when  the river  and the canal were king.  Those  efforts  can  serve  as  the  groundwork  for  future  action. Mr.  Speaker, I am happy to say that the  proposed Delaware and Lehigh Navi gation Canal-National Heritage Corri dor gives  the citizens of the Lehigh  Valley that common ground.  In  an  era  of  rapid  growth  and  changes, the corridor will allow us to  build bridges between the various gov ernmental entities-the counties,  the  municipalities, the boroughs and the  townships  along  the  length  and  breadth of the river. Cooperation on  issues which  involve  the canal and  river offers unique opportunities  to  citizens of the Lehigh Valley to boost  regionalism and proactively build the  kind  of  community we want. The  canal, the Lehigh River, the corridor  can serve as a unifying force bringing  our communities  together, not only  over historic preservation but recrea tion, conservation, sportsmans' activi ties, creative economic and residential  development,  the  environment  and  tourism. This corridor, and the region al approach it entails, have  the dis tinct potential for enhancing the qual ity of life in the Lehigh Valley.  Approximately 375 historic and ar chaeological  sites  exist within  the  total corridor and symbolize, in physi cal form, the naturally formed ecosys tems of the area, creating the back bone of a potential recreational trail/  corridor.  This  corridor would  also  interconnect with other national and  regional  recreation  sites;  the Appa lachian Trail at the Lehigh Gap, the  Lehigh County Saylor Cement Kilns,  Lehigh Gap State Park,  the Hugh  Moore Park and Canal Museum, the  Delaware  and Raritan Canal State  Park at New Hope/Lambertville, the  Delaware Water Gap National Recrea tion Area, the proposed Upper Dela ware National  Scenic Recreational  River, and the planned Morris Canal  County Park in Warren County, NJ.  The Delaware and Lehigh Naviga tion Canal, which opened for regular  commercial navigation in 1834, provid ed an early and essential  link  in a  4,000  mile  national  transportation  route and helped to transform Penn sylvania from an agrarian region  to  the center of an industrialized society.  In 1855, the peak year for the trans portation of goods by canal, 1,276,000  tons of coal moved down the Lehigh  Canal  to Easton, and  the Delaware  Canal, which supported  the Lehigh  Canal, carried 755,000  tons of coal.  Much of that coal went to firing the  furnaces  of  the Nation's emerging  steel industry-what later became the  Bethlehem Steel Corp.  The Lehigh  and Delaware Canal  served as the primary means for trans porting  coal  and other bulk goods  from  the  ""Anthracite Region""  of  Pennsylvania  to  New  York,  New  Jersey, Philadelphia, and other indus trial centers as far away as Europe.  The  route  of  the Delaware  and  Lehigh  Navigation  Canal  parallels  stagecoach routes and the trails of the  Lenni-Lenape Indians, and passes nu merous 18th, 19th, and 20th century  sites of National and State historical  significance.  The Dela ware Canal was declared a  National Historic Landmark in 1978 by  the National Park Service at the re quest of the Commonwealth. The Na tional  Park  Service  declared  the  Lehigh Canal a National Historic Site  and placed it on the Register as a Na tional Historic Trail also in 1978 at the  request of  the Commonwealth. This  bill will designate both canals together  as a National Heritage Corridor.  Mr. Speaker, I, along with Represen tive KosTMAYER, am introducing a bill  tomorrow  to establish  the Delaware  and Lehigh Navigation Canal National  Heritage Corridor.  The purpose of this legislation is to  assist in preserving,  in Pennsylvania,  the unique and significant contribu tions to our national heritage of cer tain historic waterways and structures  surrounding the Delaware and Lehigh  Canals. A cooperative Federal, State  and local approach is proposed.  The bill would establish the Dela ware and Lehigh Navigation Canals  National Heritage Corridor Commis sion. The commission shall assist ap propriate Federal, State, and local au thorities in the development and im plementation  of  an  integrated  re source management plan for the corri dor.  The membership of the commission  shall be composed of 20  individuals.

480,1424,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. AN NUNZIO]  for  taking out  this  special  order in commemoration of Lithuani an Independence Day. As a co-sponsor  of  the  legislation  commemorating  Lithuanian Independence Day, which  has  become  Public  Law  100-247,  having been  approved by President  Reagan on February 11, 1988, I am es pecially pleased  to add my voice  to  those recognizing this 70th anniversa ry of the establishment of Lithuania.  Our observance of Lithuanian Inde pendence Day symbolizes our identifi cation with  the Lithuanian people's  strong desire for democracy and free dom shared by people all over  the  world. For more than a century, the  Lithuanian people suffered under for eign domination, trying vainly to win  their independence. On February 16,  1918, Lithuania was finally able to do  just that.  This  independence was  soon  fol lowed by German occupation during  World War I, but, thereafter, and for  the next 20 years, until 1938, the Lith uanian people were free. That small  nation then came under Soviet domi nation during  the course of World  War II, and in 1940, Lithuania was de clared a constituent Republic of the  U.S.S.R.  Thereafter, during World War  II,  Germany  occupied  this  land  once  more,  for another 4 years until  the  end of the war. Unlike other nations  after the war, Lithuania was unable to  return to  independence, and was, by  1945,  firmly  incorporated  into  the  Soviet Union where it remains to this  day. While Lithuania lost its independ ence, as did many other Eastern Euro pean nations,  the Lithuanian people  lost neither their desire for freedom,  nor their strong culture. It is for these  reasons that we recognize Lithuanian  Independence Day and celebrate it for  those who cannot. With this celebra tion, we  are  reminding  the Soviet  Union  that we  have not  forgotten  their inadmissible policies with respect  to Lithuania and confirm to them our  nonrecognition of Lithuania's incorpo ration into the Soviet Union. We must  continue to work and remember the  millions  of  people who  are denied  their basic human rights behind the  Iron Curtain just as the Lithuanians  are denied their independence.  Mr. Speaker, Lithuanian Independ ence Day is also a day for Americans  of Lithuanian  descent  to  celebrate  their ethnic heritage and point with  pride to their contribution to Ameri can society. We celebrate with them  and at the same time share their con cern over  the plight of  their  loved  ones living in Europe. While the plight  of Lithuania and her people shows us  how  fortunate we,  in  the United  States and other free nations are, it  also serves to renew our obligation to  all people who desire freedom and de mocracy.  Mr. Speaker, I  include the full text  of Public Law 100-247 in the RECORD  at this point:  Whereas this year marks the 70th anni versary of the establishment of the Inde pendent Democratic Republic of Lithuania  by the Lithuanian National Council on Feb ruary 16, 1918;  Whereas the Government of  the Soviet  Union recognized the sovereignty and inde pendence of the Republic of Lithuania in  the peace treaty of July 12, 1920;  Whereas the United States does not recog nize the illegal incorporation of the free and  independent Republic of Lithuania into the  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1940;  ",1988
481,1450,1,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  submit for my colleagues attention the text of  my  recent Washington Report, which was  printed in the January 28, 1988 edition of the  News/Voice. It addresses the issue of special  interests which Congress and the administra tion must courageously deal with if our budget  deficits are to be reduced and controlled:  THE MOST IMPORTANT SPECIAL INTEREST OF  THEM ALL  How many of these abbreviations do you  recognize: ADA, ACU, ANEC, CFA? If you  can't identify them don't feel badly. These  public interest groups and scores of others  are best known in Washington. There they  work to influence Congress on issues of con cern to them, including, of course, the fund ing they favor.  Virtually  every  special  interest  in our  nation now has an organized lobby to pro mote its goals-and I do not use the term  ""special  interest""  in  a  pejorative  sense.  ""Special  interests""  are  the handicapped,  educators, union members, businesses, veter ans,  and many others. Congress has  re sponded well to their concerns, but in doing  so we have lost the bottom line and have  February 16, 1988  failed to add up the burden this places on  our economy and on the American people.  Every lobbying group advances a compel ling argument  that  its cause  is  just, and  therein lies the problem. As our society has  grown in size and complexity, demands for  federal  funding have  far outstripped our  economic resources. In the scramble for a  piece of those resources, individuals have in creasingly sought political power by identi fying themselves as members of a particular  interest group-seniors, veterans, business,  students-rather than Americans in a larger  sense.  Reflecting that political power, Congress  has become a battleground, where victories  for those specific interests often supersede  the larger concerns of the nation. Our fed eral budget process in particular is regularly  ignored and abused; again  this year,  the  Congress produced a massive and shameful  omnibus continuing resolution <CR) to fund  the entire federal government that contains  everyone's  favored  spending. You've no  doubt heard of some of the pet projects in  the latest $603 billion CR, which according  to Newsweek ""was passed in such haste that  the Office of Management and Budget is  still trying to find all  the special interest  baubles hidden in the fine print of its thou sand pages.""  Special interest pressure was never more  evident than during November's overwhelm ing House vote to create a cabinet-level post  for veterans. As the vote rolled up, everyone  around me on the House floor said it was a  terrible  idea  . . .  but  practically  every  member voted for it.  Why? Because the Congress is gripped in  the craven fear of special interests. In par ticular, members are wary of  the ratings  these  groups  regularly  release  reporting  whether a member was ""right"" on selected  votes. These fears of receiving an unfavor able rating or report have undue influence  on the way many members vote.  Although it was difficult, I voted against  the VA cabinet-level proposal. My vote was  not anti-veteran in any way, but rather a  vote against expanding the cabinet with a  new department at a  time when deficits  have reached crisis proportions. I think of  myself as second to none when it comes to  supporting our veterans; I respect the com mitment  they made  to our country and  probably represent more veterans than most  other members of Congress. But faced with  massive deficits, the need to control federal  spending must be the higher priority.  Following that vote, I said that it's time  for courage, time to end business as usual in  Washington and risk offending the lobbyists  in order to come to grips with the crisis that  is upon us. But in our political system, that  means the American people must demand  that change. They must send a message to  Congress:  ""Get our  budget  and  deficits  under control. If necessary, I'm willing to  freeze or trim my favorite program as long  as everyone else is willing to do the same.""  While the many interest groups that rep resent our diverse society will always be a  force on Capitol Hill, their influence should  be tempered by larger concerns. We cannot  forget that while we may be Social Security  recipients or veterans or businessmen or  government employees, before anything else  we're Americans-the most important ""spe cial interest"" of them all.

482,1463,1,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to Charles P. Pizzi, an outstanding  public official, a great Philadelphian, and a  very good friend.  After 12 years of public service, Charlie  Pizzi is leaving the government arena. I want  to take this opportunity to bring to the atten tion of Congress the many contributions that  this man has made to the city of Philadelphia,  and to the Delaware Valley.  As director of commerce  for  the city of  Philadelphia since October 1986, Charlie Pizzi  has lead the economic development effort for  the mayor. During his tenure, Mr. Pizzi has at tracted new businesses  to  the city, helped  many organizations remain in the city, and set  in motion a number of exciting economic de velopment projects.

483,1463,1,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker,  last week, Dr.  Stephen H. Schneider, the head of the Nation al Center for Atmospheric Research's climate  system program, presented  to members and  staff an overview of the level of current scien tific understanding of  the greenhouse effect.  He  emphasized  that  the mechanisms  of  greenhouse heating of  the atmosphere are  well understood and that scientists agree that  if carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  continue to be released at current levels, an  increase in global temperature is inevitable.  Researchers however, disagree as  to  the  extent, rate and effect of future  temperature  increases. Such  increases will  depend,  of  course, on many factors, but especially on the  level of fossil fuel use. Researchers generally  predict, however,  that we have already com mitted ourselves to an increase in temperature  of 1.5-4.5 C in  the next 100 years. Possible  effects of  this  increase  include shifts  in  the  world's grain belts, coastal  flooding and  in creased mortality due to heat.  Dr. Schneider explained that natural climac tic variations have occurred  throughout  the  history of the Earth. The danger of man  in duced greenhouse warming, however,  is not  only  in  the change  itself, but  in  the  rate of  change. Given time, man, undoubtedly, would  adapt  to a warmer world.

MARTIN  LUTHER KING, JR.  <Mr. CLEMENT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.>  ",1988
485,6,5,Mr. CLEMENT.," Mr. Speaker, next  Monday, April 4 marks the 20th anni versary of  the assassination of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.  I was in the city of Memphis that  day and I vividhy recall the shock, the  grief, and  the pessimism which  the  residents of Memphis and the citizens  of our Nation felt when they heard  the news of Dr. King's murder. Dr.  King's dream, which had become our  own, seemed even more unattainable.  In the 20 years since that event, our  citizens have worked hard to realize  many of Dr. King's goals. And we  have,  in  fact,  made  substantial  progress. We all enjoy greater civil  rights since 1968. But we also realize  that a  great  amount of work  lies  before us, particularly for the econom ic equality of all of our citizens.  Next week, Mr. Speaker, as Members  of this body meet and talk with their  constituents, I hope we will pause to  observe the anniversary of Dr. King's  death. And, as we do, I hope we will  ask ourselves what we all can do  to  move Dr. King's goals closer to realiza tion.  TRIBUTE TO GEORGE KERBY  JENNINGS  <Mr.  HUBBARD  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  ",1988
486,6,5,Mr.  HUBBARD.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  having heard the complimentary re marks of my friend and colleague, the  gentleman  from Kansas CMr.  SLAT TERY], regarding the accomplishments  of  the University  of Kansas  and  Kansas State University in the 1988  NCAA Basketball Tournament,  I'm  tempted at this time to speak about  the  basketball  achievements  of  Murray State University, University of  Kentucky, and University of Louisville  in the NCAA tournament.  However, my purpose  in speaking  now on the House floor is to pay trib ute  to  a  longtime  friend of mine,  George Kerby Jennings, who died Jan uary 26 at age 84 at his home  in  Murray, KY.  Kerby  Jennings  published  the  Murray Democrat newspaper with a  fear less style of  journalism-winning  majy honors-for more than 35 years.  He  also  published  a  history  of  Calloway County, KY, in 1980.  Kerby Jennings served with distinc tion as an outstanding State repre sentative in the Kentucky General As sembly from 1946-50.  The only political campaign Kerby  Jennings lost was a contest for  the  U.S. House of Representatives in the  early 1940's against then-Congressman  Noble  J. Gregory, of western Ken tucky.  From 1956 to 1960, he was a member  of Calloway County Board of Educa tion. During this time, he never ac cepted any compensation for his serv ices,  turning the money back  to be  used for purchasing school lunches for  needy students. He also was  instru mental  in getting  the parking  lots  paved at many of the county schools.  In recognition of his efforts to estab lish park sites along the Calloway and  Marshall County shores of Kentucky  Lake during this time, a lengthy trail  alongside  the  lake  is named  in his  honor, the Kerby Jennings Trail.  In this effort, he went to Knoxville,  TN, and secured from the Tennessee  Valley Authority an allotment for 18  easement locations.  Among  the park  areas  and boat  launching sites established along this  trail were the Happy Chandler Park,  the Harry Lee Waterfield Park on Jon athan Creek, at Cypress Creek and  Pine Bluff.  Survivors are his wife, Mrs. Dorothy  Jennings; three daughters, Mrs. Doris  Frazer, Chattanooga, TN, Mrs. Jane  Gresham, Taylor, MI, and Mrs. Edna  Kerby Merrell, Murray; two sons. O.J.  Jennings  III, Shelbyville, KY,  and  Edwin Hagen Jennings, Murray.  His 13 grandchildren are Dorisanne  Conners, Gene Dale, <Chip> Steely Jr.,  Caroline Kerby Starks, James Hagen  Jennings, John Kerby Jennings, Shaw nee Gay Hill, Renee Grace, Cory  LeeAnn Jennings, Dorothy Ann Mer rell, Shellie Perusse, Monica Nichols,  Mike Gresham, and Mark Gresham.  Also  surviving are 13 great-grand children and 1 brother, Charles Jen nings, Imperial, CA.  One  daughter, Dorothy Caroline  Jennings, died in 1942.  My wife Carol and I extend to our  friend Dorothy  Jennings  and  the  other members of the Kerby Jennings  family our sympathy and best wishes.  PROPOSED  LEGISLATION  WOULD REQUIRE EVALUATION  OF  WATER  RESOURCES  PROJECTS  <Mr. UPTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.>  ",1988
487,6,5,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  today I  will introduce legislation requiring the  Army Corps of Engineers to consider  the  impact  of  any water  resource  project on recreational and commer cial development.  Recreation is of paramount impor tance to the entire Great Lakes region,  as well as other sections of our Nation.  While its primary mission must always  be to improve the navigation of water ways, the corps should not be allowed  to continue to ignore the recreational  and commercial uses of many water re source projects. My bill does not re quire the Corps of Engineers to build  recreational projects, but merely  to  more closely examine  the effects of  construction and repair projects on ex isting recreational and commercial ac tivity.  A recent Corps of Engineer's project  to  strengthen  a  breakwater  in  a  harbor  in Holland, MI clearly  illus trates what can happen if this consid eration is neglected. While the corps  evaluated the impact of this project on  water quality, aquatic life, historical  values,  and  endangered  species;  it  failed  to consid~r the effect of  the  project on recreational and commer cial fishing along the Holland piers.

It  makes sense to proceed on that basis.  ",1988
512,45,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Chair will note that as a general un derstanding when a Senator seeks rec ognition he or she will be recognized.  ,1988
513,45,5,Mr. DODD.," I thank the Chair.  I yield myself 5 minutes, if I may.  Just briefly, Mr. President, let me  try to describe what this package in cludes, and why the Senator intends to  support this package as it has been  proposed.  It is the same package that passed  the House of Representatives yester day. It is not a complicated package, I  say to my colleagues. Resolution 523 is  designed for the sole purpose to aid  and abet the peace process in Central  America.  As we all know, that process got a  significant boost March 23 when Hum berto Ortega and Adolfo Calero signed  a 60-day cease-fire agreement in the  Nicaraguan border town of Sapoa.  In recognition of the fundamental  importance and historical significance  of the Sapoa agreement, House Joint  Resolution 523 states clearly:  No authority contained in this Joint reso lution  is  intended to be exei:cised  in any  manner that might be determined by the  Verification Commission established by the  Sapoa Agreement to be  inconsistent with  that Agreement or any subsequent agree ment between the Government of Nicara gua and the Nicaragua democratic resist ance.  In other words, Mr. President, this  legislation is basically designed to do  the same thing, and only one thing: It  is  designed  to  support  the  interim  cease-fire agreement and to help lay  the groundwork for a permanent ces sation of hostilities.  In order to achieve these objectives,  Mr. President, the legislation before us  authorizes the transfer of $17.7 mil lion through September 30 to be used  for humanitarian assistance  for  the  rebel forces. Humanitarian assistance  is  narrowly  defined  to  cover  only  ""food, clothing, shelter, medical serv ices, and medical supplies    ."" The  only exception to this is an allowance  for basic communication equipment,  and providing such equipment is con sistent with the Sapoa agreement.  Mr. President, the total package is  $47.9 million, roughly $48 million. The  $17.7 million that I have already re ferred  to  is  in humanitarian assist ance. There is an additional $17.7 million to be provided for children who  have been wounded and maimed  in  that conflict in Nicaragua, who have  been victimized by this conflict. And  that money will be handled through  nonpolitical and voluntary organiza tions, and international relief organi zations.  There is $10 million in this legisla tion for the purpose of assisting the  activities of the verification commis sion established by the Sapoa agree ment. As my colleagues know,  this  commission is composed of His Emi nence  Cardinal Miguel Obando  y  Bravo and His Excellency Ambassador  J oao Baena Soares. They are charged  with verifying compliance with  the  cease-fire accord and these funds will  assure that they can effectively carry  out their responsibilities.  Last,  there  is $2.5 million  to  the  Agency for International Development  to be used by them in order to carry  out and to provide the delivery of hu manitarian assistance.  With respect to the transportation  and delivery of these items, the legis lation  once  again  insists  that  the  Agency for International Development  be  the agency charged with the re sponsibility for providing those deliv eries, and it also does not permit the  delivery  of any mixed  loans. That  would be self-evident.  Mr. President, again the details,  I  am sure, people will want to explore a  little bit further today. I  think it is  worthwhile to note that in the House  Chamber yesterday there was a strong  bipartisan vote in support of this reso lution which was 345 to 70. It was an  overwhelming vote in favor of this res olution. It is the first time in 7 years  that we have had a vote of that magni tude on  this  issue. Normally  it has  been one or two or three votes that di vided.  Certainly in this Chamber we have  seen most recently a margin of one or  two  votes  that  separated  those  in  favor and those opposed to the Contra  aid package.  I want to emphasize that this pack age, of course, like anything else is not  completely satisfying to either side of  this issue. I know my colleagues have  supported Contra aid and would like  to  see  expedited  procedures. They  want to see some military assistance  included. Obviously, had that been the  case, this package would have been ap proved. On the other side, there are  people who  think we should not be  providing any Contra aid, and  they  would not have approved of this no  matter what was up.  This package strikes a balance, and  it is designed specifically and for the  sole purpose of assisting that agree ment reached in Sapoa. In the absence  of that Sapoa agreement we would not  be here doing this today.  ",1988

Whereas, on February 26, 1988, President  Reagan reaffirmed that the United States  continues to recognize President Devane as  head of the government of Panama;  Whereas, General Noriega has refused to  accept an offer of asylum from the govern ment of Spain and has rejected all efforts to  enable him to peacefully relinquish his posi tion as head of the Panamanian Defense  Forces;  Whereas, General Noriega has arbitrarily  replaced officers of  the Panamanian De fense Forces who have attempted to support  civilian control of the military and has al legedly brought into Panama large quanti ties of arms shipped by the Government of  Cuba;  Whereas, General Noriega has used the  military and security forces of Panama to  brutally  repress  the general strike being  conducted by the people of Panama seeking  to restore the democratic process;  Whereas, General Noriega has used taxes  and fees paid in cash by U.S. companies op erating in Panama to aid him in breaking  the general strike and continuing to deny  the people of Panama representative demo cratic government;  Whereas, it is  the policy of the United  States to support the restoration of genuine  democracy in Panama, to assist the Devane  government in its effort to establish civilian  control  over  the  Panamanian Defense  Forces and to encourage the Defense Forces  as a professional military institution: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved, That  it  is  the  sense of  the  Senate that the President, using the author ity granted under Sec. 201 of the National  Emergencies Act <50 USC 1621) and Secs.  202 and 203 of the International Emergency  Economic Powers Act (50 USC 1701 et seq.)  <a> find that, with respect to the events in  Panama, an international economic emer gency exists with respect to the events in  Panama which poses an unusual and ex traordinary threat to the national security,  the foreign policy and the economy of the  United States.

I would  only add if, in further research, we dis cover other means to accomplish the  same objectives, or the administration  can find  them,  I would rather they  found those other means than to use  the International Emergency Econom ic Powers Act. This  is not,  in  the  normal sense of the term, an economic  emergency. If this is all we have, then  so be it, and we should use it. If there  are other powers, I hope that we make  legislative history  that  those other  powers would be used in preference.  I thank the majority leader.  Mr. DURENBERGER addressed the  Chair.

TITLE I  Page  47,  line  13:  Under  section  4<c><15><G><D of the Bank Holding Compa ny Act of 1956 <added by section 102 of the  bill), a bank holding company that has ob tained the Federal Reserve Board's approval  to engage in certain underwriting, distribu tion, and dealing activities under section  4<c><8> of the Act must obtain the Board's  approval under section 4(c)(15) or discontin ue those activities. The amendment makes  that requirement effective six months after  the bill becomes law in order to allow time  for such bank holding companies to apply  for approval under section 4<c>Cl5) and for  the Board to consider those applications.  Page 52, line 2: ""As enacted into law"" is  deleted as superfluous; the activities covered  by section 4<c><15><K><iD would not be ""au thorized pursuant  to  a  joint  resolution""  unless the joint resolution were enacted into  law.  Page 57,  line 2: The amendment makes  the civil money penalty provisions of section  18(j)(4)(A) of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act applicable to violations of the restric tions imposed by the following amendment.  Page 57,  line 25: Section 18<J><3> of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act <amended by  section 107 of the bill) restricts affiliations  between FDIC-insured banks and securities  underwriters and dealers. The definition of  ""security"" in section 18(j)(3) is drawn from  section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934. The amendment provides that a  contract of insurance is not a ""security"" for  purposes of section 18(j)(3), even  if  that  contract is a security under section 3(a)(l0).  Page 57, between lines 2 and 3: Section  4(c)(15)(F)(iii) of the Bank Holding Compa ny Act (added by section 102 of the bill) pro hibits a bank or thrift institution affiliated  with a securities affiliate from directly or  indirectly extending credit-or issuing or en tering into a standby letter of credit, asset  purchase agreement, indemnity, guarantee,  insurance, or other facility-for the purpose  of enhancing the marketability of securities  that are being underwritten or distributed  by the securities affiliate.  The amendment applies the same rule to  securities underwritten or distributed by  any FDIC-insured bank or any subsidiary or  other affiliate of such a bank, if the under writing or dealing involves the new munici pal revenue bond authority granted by sec tion 108<a> of the bill.  Pages 58, lines 22 and 25: ""Authorizing"" is  inserted before ""statute"" to make it clear  that ""statute"" refers to the statute that spe cifically authorizes national banks to under write the securities in question, rather than  to the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Page 59, line 4: ""Organized"" is deleted as  redundant. Similar amendments are made  ",1988
534,188,5,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to join as a cosponsor of  legislation  introduced  by  Senator  DURENBERGER calling for the establish ment of 25 rural long-term care dem onstration projects. The purpose of  these projects  is  to provide specific  data on the most effective means for  delivering  long-term care services  to  elderly persons living in rural areas.  Today, people who  require assist ance  in conducting routine activities  due to chronic conditions often find it  difficult to obtain the help they need.  Not only are appropriate services  in  short supply, but they are also beyond  the means of many Americans. No  matter how hard one has tried to plan  for the future, it becomes nearly im possible for most to meet the costs of  continuing care year after year after  year.  As our older population grows, par ticularly in the 85-plus age group, the  need for quality long-term care serv ices will become even more pressing.  Given these concerns, it is not surpris ing that there is growing attention to  the inadequacies in current long-term  care arrangements. A number of legis lative proposals have been put  for ward, and Congress will undoubtedly  be taking action in this critical area  over the next few years. I think it is  terribly important that we do so.  The demonstration projects author ized by Senator DURENBERGER'S legisla tion would off er important guidance  as to how we best structure any long term care program to meet the needs  of the rural elderly. Currently, there  are over 500 rural counties in which at  least 15 percent of the total popula tion is comprised of individuals age 65  and over. A  substantial number of  these counties are located in my State  of Kansas, so I am very much aware  that programs which work well  in  urban areas do not always make sense  for rural America.  Too many times in the past, the re alities of life  in rural America have  been ignored in the design of Federal  legislation. The special problems faced  by rural hospitals under the Medicare  prospective payment system is but one  of many such examples.  I believe that careful evaluation of  the  broad  range  of  demonstration  projects envisioned by this legislation  will allow us to avoid this kind of prob lem in the development of long-term  care legislation. These demonstrations  will encompass the full range of sup portive services. Because most of these  services are not covered under existing  Federal programs, the demonstrations  will also give us a better sense of the  costs involved.  Meeting long-term care needs poses  many complex questions. In the ab sence of solid information, it will be  extremely easy for rural interests to  get lost in the shuffle. The legislation  introduced today helps assure that we  will have a basis  for designing pro grams which make sense for the rural  elderly, and  I hope  the Senate can  move promptly in approving it. e  By Mr. PROXMIRE (for him self, Mr. RIEGLE, Mr. DODD, Mr.  WIRTH, Mr.  DOMENICI, Mr.  CHAFEE, Mr. BOND, Mr. STE VENS, and Mr. McCAIN):  S. 2256.

This bill is intended as a modest but  necessary step  to restore confidence  shaken by the extraordinary market  volatility suffered during the last 6  months. The disaster of October 19,  1987, represents only a warning shot  of further financial calamity.

543,240,5,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to speak on behalf of George  M. Marovich, who has been nominated  by President Reagan  to  serve as a  judge on the U.S. District Court for  the northern district of Illinois.  George M. Marovich earned both his  undergraduate and  law degree  from  the University of  Illinois, my own  alma mater. Following his graduation  in 1954, Judge Marovich became an at torney for Chicago Title & Trust Co.  dealing with all types of chancery pro ceedings.  Simultaneously,  he main tained a general practice in Richton  Park, IL. In 1959, he became a partner  in the firm of Jacobs & Marovich, a  general practice in South Holland, IL.  There, Judge Marovich handled a wide  variety of criminal and civil litigation.  From 1966 to 1976, he served as vice  president  and  trust  officer  at  the  South Holland Trust & Savings Bank.  He had  legal  responsibility  in  the  areas of commercial law, probate, real  estate, taxation, trust law and estate  planning.  In 1976, he was elected to the Circuit  Court of Cook County, where he has  served with distinction for the last 11  years.  In his first 9 months on the  Cook County bench, Judge Marovich  was assigned to the criminal division  and tried major felony cases. In this  capacity, he presided over  the  first  repeat offender court and disposed of  more than 3,000 major cases involving  violent crimes. Since 1985, Judge Mar ovich has been assigned to the chan cery division, where he has tried com plex civil litigation, involving equitable  injunctive relief.  Further, Judge Marovich has been  active in the Illinois Judicial Confer ence, serving as chairman of the con ference's section on evidence, and vice  chairman of the committee on injunc tion and declaratory  relief. He also  serves on the nominating committee of  the Circuit Court of Cook County,  which is a five-judge committee that  screens and nominates candidates for  associate judgeships, board of election  commissioners  and other court  ap pointees.  The degree  to which Judge Maro vich  is  respected is  reflected by the  fact that he has been rated exception ally well qualified by the Illinois State  Bar Association, well qualified by the  Federal Bar Association and qualified  by the Chicago Bar Association. The  Chicago Bar Association praised Maro vich saying he ""has proven ability in  both the criminal and civil areas of  law. He is hardworking and possesses  judicial common sense. He has also  demonstrated his ability to learn new  areas of law."" The Chicago Council of  Lawyers declares, he ""possesses the in tellectual ability to write well and that  his exceptional abilities in other areas  would make him a  solid addition to  the Federal district court bench.""  Finally, in addition to his profession al  credentials,  Judge Marovich  is  highly praised by attorneys who have  practiced before him for his fairness,  integrity, intellectual capacity, practi cal judgment, and ability to conduct  trials.  Mr. President,  I  believe  that  this  review  of  Judge Marovich's  record  demonstrates his strong qualifications  for  a  seat on  the Federal District  Court. I believe he will be a valuable  addition to the Federal bench. I urge  my colleagues to support this nomina tion.  LEGISLATIVE SESSION  ",1988

554,253,5,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation to amend the tariff sched ules of the United States to increase the tariff  on bone chinaware. This proposed increase is  necessary to ensure the successful attempt of  an  infant U.S.  industry  to enter  the bone  chinaware market  in  the United States. No  U.S. company is currently manufacturing bone  chinaware in the United States. The Pfaltzgraff  Co., of York, PA, a U.S. manufacturer of din nerware and accessory items made of earth enware, has made the decision to change that  situation by establishing U.S. manufacturing  operations producing bone chinaware.  The Pfaltzgraff Co., is currently manufactur ing, but has not yet begun the sale of, bone  chinaware in its factory in Pennsylvania. In at tempting  to  gain  a  foothold  in  its  home  market, Pfaltzgraff is confronted by the pres ence of numerous low-priced imports of bone  chinaware with which  they must be competi tive  to establish a U.S. industry in  this  field.  The very  low prices at which many of those  imports are sold-prices in many cases below  Pfaltzgraff's cost of production-raise con cerns as to the ability of this infant industry to  become established.  For example,  in  1987  imports  of  bone  chinaware from Japan accounted for 45 per cent of all bone chinaware  imports, making  Japan the single  largest exporting country of  this product. Despite  the dramatic exchange  rate  fluctuations which have occurred  in  the  value of the dollar vis-a-vis the yen, the Japa nese bone chinaware producers are continu ing  to  sell  bone  chinaware  in  the United  States at  roughly  the same prices at which  bone chinaware was sold several years ago.  Other countries with a significant presence  and name-recognization  in  the U.S. market  are also selling bone chinaware at very  low  prices in the United States.  These circumstances make  it very difficult  for any U.S. company to enter the bone china ware market. The Pfaltzgraff Co., is one of the  few U.S. producers of earthen dinnerware that  has continued as a viable company  in  the  United States despite the impact of low-priced  imports on its business operations. Pfaltzgraff  is a well-run, modern, and efficient company.  Unfortunately, when competing with very low priced and often unfairly traded foreign goods,  even modern and efficient companies such as  Pfaltzgraff have difficulty being competitive in  their home market.  To assist in the success of Pfaltzgraff's ef forts to establish a new American industry and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to create additional jobs in the United States, I  have proposed  this  tariff increase. The  initial  tariff increase would permit the Pfaltzgraff Co.,  a period of time to establish a sales base  in  this market, and the ultimate tariff level would  ensure that Pfaltzgraff could maintain its com petitive posture in the United States.  The legislation that I have proposed would  raise the current tariff on bone chinaware of 8  percent to a level of 35 percent ad valorem.  This  rate would  be  gradually  reduced  in  stages over a period of 7 years, to result in a  26-percent ad valorem rate of duty at the end  of that period of time.  The 35 percent  rate proposed  is  the rate  currently applicable to imported hotel and res taurant chinaware. Prior  to 1980, both bone  chinaware and hotel and restaurant chinaware  were governed by  the same  tariff category  and subject to a 17.5-percent rate of duty. As  of January 1, 1980, this category was divided  into two items. The rate for institutional china ware was increased to 47 percent, from which  it has been gradually reduced  to  its current  level of 35 percent. The rate for bone china ware, however, was reduced to 16.3 percent  in 1980, from which it has been continually re duced to its current level of 8 percent. Thus, a  significant disparity exists in the rates applica ble to the institutional chinaware and the bone  chinaware.  The ultimate  rate of duty of 26 percent  which is proposed to result at the end of the 7  year period of time is the rate of duty currently  applicable to chinaware sold in sets at a value  not over $56.  I believe this is a realistic per manent tariff on bone chinaware  in  that the  bone chinaware category, unlike the category  for non-bone chinaware sold  in sets,  is not  subdivided into a low and high end of prices  with varying tariffs for each subdivision. There fore,  imports of bone chinaware at very  low  prices equivalent to a set sold at not over $56  would all be classified under the same  tariff  number. These low-priced imports will provide  significant competition  for Pfaltzgraff  in  the  long-term in its efforts to compete in the bone  chinaware industry. Accordingly, it is reasona ble  to make  the permanent  tariff on bone  chinaware equivalent to the rate applicable to  low-priced non-bone chinaware, which  is 26  percent ad valorem.  To assist  the efforts of a U.S.  industry  to  establish operations and  to be competitive  with foreign goods, I urge my colleagues to fa vorably consider this proposed legislation.  RAIL LINE PRESERVATION AND  EMPLOYEE PROTECTION ACT  HON.THOMASJ.TAUKE  OF IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 30, 1988  ",1988
555,253,5,Mr. TAUKE.," Mr. Speaker, last week I intro duced legislation to equitably resolve the cur rent uncertainties surrounding the creation of  regional railroads. The Rail Line Preservation  and  Employee Protection Act, H.R.  4261,  strikes a balance between the legitimate con cerns of railroad employees who face job ter mination and the  interests of the sellers and  purchasers of new regional railroads.  6229  Before describing  the content of my bill,  I  would first like to offer my perspective on how  we arrived where we are today.  In  the years  leading up to 1980, the railroad industry was  suffering the negative effects of cumbersome  Federal  regulation. Nearly 25 percent of  the  Nation's railroads had  fallen  into bankruptcy  and much of the rest of the  industry was  in  deep financial  trouble. In an effort to reduce  operating  costs,  railroads attempted  to  re structure  their  light density  lines. However,  Federal  laws  required  labor protection pay ments whenever a railroad attempted to con solidate, merge, or abandon a rail line.  In response to the stiff labor protection re quirements, railroads embarked on a strategy  of abandoning service  in order  to abandon  lines. By driving business off  light density  lines, railroads could  reduce  the number of  workers who would qualify for labor protection  benefits when  the  line was eventually aban doned. During the decade of the 1970's, the  mileage of our Nation's largest railroads de clined by 37,000 miles.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 brought  about dramatic changes in the railroad indus try through deregulation. Under Staggers, rail roads were given a new opportunity to ration alize their systems through  line sales. These  line sales have become a popular alternative  to abandonment.  The Staggers Rail Act allowed the Interstate  Commerce Commission  [ICC]  to exempt  line  sales from labor protection requirements if the  purchaser was a nonrailroad entity. The  ICC  further expanded  this authority by voting  to  exempt all sales  to nonrailroad companies,  and to consider these transactions under ex pedited procedures.  Regional railroads are generally not encum bered by the same work rule restrictions used  by major  rail carriers. This enables  regional  railroads to turn profits on what would other wise be very marginal lines for major carriers.  The  ICC's blanket exemption  from  labor  protection standards has enhanced the finan cial  feasibility of sales of  light density  lines  and has led to tremendous growth in regional  railroads. Since 1980, 179 new regional  rail roads,  including 1 O  in my own State, have  been created. These  railroads now operate  more than 17,000 miles of line.  Although employment in the railroad indus try continues to fall, a majority of the Nation's  regional  railroads employ more people today  than they did on their first day of operation. In  addition, a majority of the employees of these  railroads work under union contracts. Never theless,  the authority of  the  ICC  to exempt  line sales from  labor protection requirements  has been questioned.  The authority of  the  ICC  to exempt  line  sales from  labor protection requirements has  been  the subject of  judicial  review. Unfortu nately,  conflicting  Federal  court  decisions  have now clouded, more  than clarified,  the  issue. It appears that final judicial resolution of  this issue will not be forthcoming for at least 2  years, until a case reaches the U.S. Supreme  Court.

556,266,5,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the wake of  Jesse Jackson's political campaign  for  the  Presidency,  I am pleased  to share with my  colleagues  two enlightening articles  that ex emplify  the problem of  race  in  this country.  The first article entitled ""If Jackson Loses So What?"" appeared  in  the Cleveland Plain  Dealer on March 24, 1988. The article deals  with the realities of Jesse's bid for the Demo cratic nomination.  The second article entitled, ""A New Kind of  Racial Put-Down"" appeared  in  the Washing ton Post on March 28, 1988. This article disEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cusses a new phenomenon of hidden  racial  prejudice in this country relative to the Jack son campaign.  Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to share these  articles with my colleagues.  [From the Cleveland <OH> Plain Dealer,  Mar. 24, 19881  IF JACKSON LOSES-SO WHAT?  <By Mike Royko)  It's possible that when the primaries are  over and the Democratic National Conven tion begins.  Jesse  Jackson will have  the  most delegates. Not enough to automatical ly win the nomination, but more than any  of the other bumblers.  If that happens, what do the Democrats  do?  From what  they're now  saying,  they'll  look at the other candidates, decide which  one is the least feeble, then try to convince  the voters that they have found someone of  heroic stature.  Then this person will run and almost cer tainly  lose  to George Bush, who will be  propped up by Ronald Reagan, and all these  tens of millions of dollars in paid TV politi cal propaganda will have been wasted.  Since  they're  almost  certain  to  lose  anyway, why don't the Democrats  show  some imagination and do something differ ent, make a little history, put some pizzazz  into the whole thing.  What they should do is this: If Jesse Jack son has the most delegates going into the  convention,  they  should  nominate  him,  make him  the Democratic candidate  for  president.  That would be  the fairest  thing  to do.  After all, the Democrats have gone to great  pains to get away from the old-time back room dealing,  the delegate swapping and  the  brokering. When George McGovern  came  in with the most delegates, he was  nominated. When Walter Mondale was the  leader, they threw the convention to him.  So why not do the same if Jackson is the  leader?  What's that you say? Jackson will be a  cinch to lose? That's probably true, but so  what? George McGovern was a  cinch  to  lose, but that didn't stop  the Democrats.  Walter Mondale was a cinch  to  lose and  they went right ahead and let him do it.  Not only did they lose, but they left no  legacy  that would benefit the Democratic  Party in future campaigns.  By nominating Jackson,  the Democratic  Party would create a legacy by putting the  national conscience to a true test. We would  be having a referendum on racial discrimi nation, which is  the most destructive and  persistent of all our domestic problems.  Name any of our urban miseries-poverty,  crime, unemployment, education, housing and it boils down to race. Add up the costs,  not only in dollars, but in fear and distrust,  and the bottom line is race.  So why should the country waste time lis tening to some white neo-liberal, pseudo-lib eral, old-time liberal or whatever the rest of  these Democrats are, talking about all these  social problems when we can have the genu ine  article-someone who  has  lived  the  social problems. In fact, some might even  say  that he  is a  living, breathing, social  problem himself.  And what a perfect match-up  it would  be-Jackson vs. Bush. The Southern-born  black man  from  the humblest of back grounds against  the white Eastern aristo crat.  If Jackson got up and talked about what it  was like to ride in the back of the bus, to be  March 31, 1988  told he couldn't eat at a greasy spoon lunch  counter, to have the job doors slammed in  his face,  to sip from a separate drinking  fountain, how would Bush respond-by de scribing the difficulty finding  reliable do mestic help these days?  It's said that despite our glorious Consti tution, our statement of commitment  to  equality, we are really a racist nation. Even  our allies say it. The British scolded us all  during the 1960s civil rights demonstrations.  After all, it's one thing to shoot a few trou blesome Irishmen, but what we did in Selma  was absolutely unsporting.  So this will be our opportunity to demon strate that maybe we aren't as bad as they,  and many of us, think we are. Or maybe we  will find that we are as bad. Either way,  we'd learn something.  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 28, 19881  A NEW KIND OF RACIAL PUT-DOWN  <By Meg Greenfield>  The white people  I know who  remain  trapped in the residual racial prejudice of  our culture-and that, I fear, includes great  numbers of them who would swear other wise-do not use racial epithets or compara ble invective in their speech and probably  do not even think such things in private. On  the contrary, the tip-off that they are con cerned exclusively with the skin color of a  black person and don't begin  to  think of  him as an equal comes not in rudeness, but  in its ostensible opposite. This is the adop tion of a heavy-handed, clearly simulated,  relentlessly smiling and ultimately friend ship-suffocating tone of ""respect"" -or what  is meant to pass for respect. It is unyielding  and impenetrable, and the black person can  get no other response, no matter how hard  he tries. All this adds up to the new voice  and body  language of racial put-down. If  you want to see the phenomenon in action,  turn on your television set almost any day  of the week and notice how many of his  white critics, competitors. interlocutors and  even admirers approach Jesse Jackson this  way.  Maybe it was inevitable, and is merely a  way station en route from a bad place to a  much better one that we will reach in time.  But right now this well-mannered and im penetrable indifference isolating the black  from all others strikes me as simply a new  form of segregation. Certainly it is a defin ing feature of this campaign where Jackson  is  concerned. Fellow Democrats, who do  each other  the courtesy of combat,  just  smile condescendingly at Jackson, unwilling  to argue with him in public. They and the  million or so political kibitzers and analysts  on the case have apparently also not real ized until  lately how  racially arrogant  it  looked to keep on asking, as Jackson racked  up one success after another, ""What does he  really want?"" Belatedly the implication of  the question-that he could neither have  nor surely even suppose he could have the  presidency-became plain  to  them. They  were then at pains to say that they didn't  mean  Jackson couldn't be nominated or  that they did mean he couldn't be nominat ed, but that was only because he couldn't  win, which in turn was either not because  he was black but because he was controver sial or because other people wouldn't vote  for a black. Or something. Meanwhile, Jack son of course  flourished, not because of  their trepidation but because he is a hell of  a campaigner.  The Democrat's preoccupation with and  anxiety about Jackson's race and the pitiful  ",1988
557,279,5,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to salute the Torrance YWCA, a fine or ganization as it honors the YWCA Women of  the Year on April 16, 1988. Jean Adelsman,  Judith Borek, Shirley Borks, Dee Hardison,  Beulah Helgerson,  and Grace  LaPoint  all  share the qualities of generosity of spirit and  the kindness of concern for others.  Jean Adelsman faces enormous responsibil ity as managing editor of  the South Bay's  community newspaper, the Daily Breeze, while  still finding time to contribute to her communi ty. She has been selected  to serve on  the  Pulitzer Prize nominating committee and has  implemented a weekly feature article highlight ing activities of nonprofit organizations.  Ms. Adelsman holds the position of secre tary for the board of directors of the volunteer  center and has been a human  race board  member for 2 years.

Judith Borek serves as both an administra tor and counselor of children and their families  in her role as director of programs at Switzer  Center. Her deep  compassion  and  under standing  of  disabled  youngsters  extends  beyond Switzer Center, as she is responsible  for  the establishment of a summer  job pro gram open to all special education students in  three South Bay cities. Since  the establish ment of First S.T.E.P. in 1985, more than 60  high  schoolers  have  received  employment  training and placement  in summer  job pro grams, many of whom have been retained for  year-round, part-time employment.  Ms. Borek  is a member of  the Council of  Exceptional Children, a member of the Council  for  Children  with  Behavioral  Disorders,  member of  the Council  for Children with  Learning Disorders, a member of Pi Lambda  Theta, an honorary educational organization,  and past officer of CAPSES [California Asso ciation of Private Special Education Services].  Shirley Borks is an educator, teaching third  grade at Seventh Street School in San Pedro  where she  is a  training and demonstration  teacher.  Her  community  service  extends  throughout the bay area from the South Coast  Botanic Garden Foundation, where she is cur rently on the board of trustees to the League  of Women Voters, where she serves as water  and natural resources chair.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Ms. Borks is currently on the board of trust ees of the Community Association of the Pe ninsula [CAP] where she oversees the Multi cultural Committee and acts as historian.

Dee Hardison's civic activities are outlined  by her participation in the Torrance City Coun cil, Torrance Planning Commission and  the  Torrance Park and Recreation Commission.  Dee's contributions  to  the community go  far  beyond her official  titles. When she sees a  need, she throws her considerable talents and  energies into accomplishing the task at hand.  Ms.  Hardison  has worked  tirelessly  for  better schools both as a volunteer and teach er, she has received the PTA Honorary Serv ice Award and Continuing Service Award. The  School Board Association honored her with  the Golden Bell Award and as a  leader  in  preservation of parks and open spaces she  received  commendation  from  the National  Recreation and Park Association.  Beulah Helgerson was selected volunteer of  the year for giving more than 4,000 hours of  service  to  the Retire Senior Volunteer Pro gram  [RSVP].  Her  community  service  is  boundless by the vital energy she shares and  the enthusiasm she exhibits when undertaking  each project. She excells in her ability to ar range  for and disseminate  information which  is of help to South Bay senior citizens and the  needy.  Ms. Helgerson hosts the Seniors in Action  Program which airs weekly in  the South Bay  area on the local cable network. She assists  with set-up and distribution of cheese and  other surplus items to the needy of the area  and has brought  the  ""Silver Saver"" Senior  Discount Program to many.

It is a pleasure to share  the news of this  special tribute to so many community activists  with my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep resentatives. Their spirit, energy and generosi ty is to be applauded and commended.  6255  UNIQUE HINDU TEMPLE SOCIE TY OF LEHIGH VALLEY HOLDS  FESTIVAL  HON. DON RITTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 31, 1988  ",1988
558,279,5,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, the Lehigh Valley  has been blessed during  its entire history by  the existence of strong, proud, ethnic groups  in its population. One of the most recent and  must active ethnic additions to our population  are the Indian community.  Although the first settler from India came to  the Lehigh Valley  in 1960,  in 1977, a  large  group of immigrants from  India settled in my  district in Pennsylvania and formed the Hindu  Temple Society of Lehigh Valley. The purpose  of the society was to create a religious-cultur al center where old and young could meet  and participate in  religious and cultural  func tions. This was especially important for young  children so  that  they could  learn of, while  older members retained, the rich, 7,000-year old Hindu culture while adapting to their new  land. Now there are about 400  Indian-Ameri can  families, mostly professional and many  highly  successful,  in medicine,  engineering  and science, education, and business.  As a scientist and now a Congressman,  I  have enjoyed numerous working relationships  and  friendships with  this creative and high achieving group of people. As  their Repre sentative  in  the Congress  of  the United  States, I am proud of new and healthy dimen sions our Indian families have brought to the  Lehigh Valley.  The Hindu Temple Society  raised  the necessary funds within  their com munity and have built a unique Temple  in  Bethlehem, PA. Mr. Speaker,  this is the  first  temple in the world where all the four religions  of  Indian origin-Hinduism, Buddhism, Jain ism,  and Sikhism-are worshipped  on  the  same pulpit.  The Vedas,  the old Hindu scriptures date  back to more than 5,000 years B.C. We also  know,  in education, great Indian minds gave  birth to the decimal system, digit system, and  the concept of zero which became the foun dation of mathematics and the ensuing scien tific endeaver of mankind.  India also gave  birth  to a great man-Mahatma Ghandi-a  wonderful soul who showed the world a new  dimenstion of nonviolence. India as a beautiful  spring day, has brought  forth much beauty  and wisdom for the world to use. Not only in  my district, but around the Nation, we can all  point with pride to the  Indian-Americans who  are fellow citizens and good neighbors.  Indian-Americans have enriched my life and  the  lives of my constituents. And  I believe  their contribution to our society is only begin ning. Mr. Speaker, on  the occasion of  the  April 9 Holi Festival of Colors at the Temple,  which heralds the start of spring, I ask my col leagues to join with me  in conveying our ap preciation for the contributions from the grow ing Indian-American community.

559,292,5,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I am today in troducing the ""Winding Stair Mountain Nation al Recreation and Wilderness Area Act,"" a  comprehensive plan of wilderness, botanical,  recreation and scenic and wildlife areas com ponent designations to benefit future genera tions of Oklahomans and the United States.  For the  last 2 years, we have spent hun dreds of hours developing  this plan which  I  believe  is  the  right combination of designa tions and needed management changes and  is acceptable to those interested in the man agement of the Ouachita National Forest  in  Oklahoma. The plan I offer to the Congress is  one of very delicate balance and was crafted  after local hearings, formal and informal meet ings, field visits to the forest and one-on-one  conversations with  interested parties.  I have  remained objective and allowed the same lati tude and openness to each group.  Without question, this bill has been probably  the most difficult piece of legislation on which  I have worked during  the 12 years  I have  been in the Congress. However, with passage  of this bill it will be one of the most personally  satisfying things that I will have accomplished  in the Congress. What began as a look at only  RARE II  lands for wilderness designation was  expanded greatly to include a comprehensive  effort that will allow many people from across  this great country from this and future genera tions enjoy the Oklahoma portion of the Oua chita National Forest.  First, let me say I have never been one to  think  that we  should  set-aside  land  for a  single purpose that would not allow flexibility  and the utilization by a broad base of constitu encies. Each of the groups for or against wil derness have expressed to me the ""right"" po sition  to  take  in  this matter.  I could not be  honest with myself if, after looking at our com plete natural resources,  I could not say  that  some of the area  is deserving of being set aside untouched for future generations. When  I say untouched, I mean from the time of en actment of this legislation. All of the Ouachita  National Forest lands in Oklahoma were cut over by timber companies at the turn of the  century.  It  is only now  that the  forest once  again flourishes with diversity. We do not have  virgin  timber areas, but we are proud of the  resources we have.  Some of those opposed to wilderness admit  that  it needs  to be done but ""not now.""  If  something is not done now, then it will take at  least another 50  years  before  the  timber  would grow back provided it was cut. Some times you know down deep the right thing to  do and it is with courage you must pursue in  the face of adversity. That is my choice.  My staff and I have been working for sever al years with interested parties to find a sensi ble balance between the needs to preserve in  a pure state some of the undeveloped lands  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  while  also  accommodating  the  economic  needs of the area, State, and Nation.  This bill  is one  that  is well balanced and  provides  for  the  interests of  loggers-small  and  large-environmental  groups,  wildlife  groups-deer and  turkey-soil conservation  groups,  including  the  resource conservation  and development councils, tourism and recre ation  interests,  local civic organizations,  local  and State elected officials, and  local school  system officials.  Of the four areas on the Oklahoma portion  of the Ouachita evaluated under the RARE  II  study,  and  later  reevaluated,  Black  Fork  Mountain was recommended for wilderness at  a  level of 4,072 acres and Upper Kiamichi  was recommended for wilderness at a level of  8,852 acres. The bill I propose includes 4,523  acres for Black Fork Mountain Wilderness and  9,371 acres of Upper Kiamichi River Wilder ness. Had the Upper Kiamichi River tract not  been designated wilderness, it would have re ceived some  form of protection almost as  strong as wilderness because of  the scenic  sensitivity in the area which adjoins the Tali mena Drive.  The comprehensive plan should  result  in  little or no loss of revenues from Federal re ceipt sharing because of wilderness area  in volved  is  such  a  small  part of  the  total  1,591,849  acres  in  the Ouachita National  Forest  in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Changes  in management should have no  impact as  long as reductions  in  timber receipts do not  occur  in  other parts  of  the Ouachita.  In  McCurtain and LeFlore Counties alone, there  are a total of only 249,205 acres of Federal  forest  lands and  this bill only deals with a  small portion of that total.  Moreover, tourism and recreation enhance ment  to  the area will bring  revenue  to  the  local area to boost local earnings.  LeFlore County is becoming a major attrac tion for business and industry in the northern  part of the county while the southern part of  the county offers the most unique tourism and  recreation in Oklahoma. The enhancement of  tourism and  recreation opportunities will at tract more business and industry who look for  these kind of opportunities before locating in  an area. Areas that are not crucial to a viable  tourism  industry are available for commercial  timber activities. LeFlore County has the kind  of combination that most counties desire in at tracting business and industry.  Inholdings are held  to a minimum  in all  areas  that are proposed  for designation,  in  fact, a preliminary check has  indicated  that  most owners of inholdings are willing sellers.  The general rule is that inholders will have the  same access in wilderness and other desig nated areas as they did prior to the enactment  of this bill.  Let me make clear that this bill only affects  LeFlore County  in Oklahoma and  not any  other county  in Oklahoma or Arkansas  that  has portions of Ouachita National Forest.  Specific principal provisions of the ""Winding  Stair Mountain National Recreation and Wil derness Area Act"" are as follows:  First. The bill creates a 13,894-acre national  wilderness area which includes 4,523 acres as  Black Fork Mountain Wilderness Area and  9,371 acres as Upper Kiamichi River Wilder ness Area. Language  is  included  to protect  March 31, 1988  the area in the event of fire, insect outbreaks,  or disease. Careful consideration was given to  allowing roads for access as close as possible  when wilderness boundaries were drawn. No  buffer zones are to be established around the  designated wilderness areas. The  legislation  also ""frees"" other wilderness areas which had  been studied and designated as possible wil derness areas.  Hunting,  fishing, and  trapping, as well as  camping, will be allowed in wilderness areas,  except to meet special circumstances estab lished by the Secretary of Agriculture, or his  designee. Wildlife management activities per mitted under the Wilderness Act will continue  to improve the supply of game. ""lnholders"" people who own private property within  the  boundaries of the designated areas-generally  will have the same access to and use of their  properties as they do now.  Second. The bill designates 26,445 acres  as the Winding Stair Mountain National Recre ation Area.  ""Unevenaged""  timber manage ment-which means selective cutting-shall  be used within the recreational areas.  Timber harvest and sales shall be designed  so as to not detract from the scenic values of  the area. Management practices  that would  detract  from  the scenic quality and natural  beauty within view from the T alimena Drive or  Helson Valley Road would not be allowed in  the recreation area. This area would be princi pally managed  for the public enjoyment and  second  for wildlife. Further  landscaping at  turnouts,  improved picnic areas, and other  benefits to public use and enjoyment would be  enhanced.  lnholders should not be affected  by this designation.  Third.  The  bill  designates  a  8,026-acre  Robert S. Kerr Memorial Arboretum, Nature  Center and Botanical Area which would en compass the existing acreage at the Arbore tum and adds Rich Mountain-considered for  wilderness-which contains unique plant spe cies and vegetation similar to that contained  at  the arboretum. The bill does not change  the way the arboretum is now managed. No  commercial or Federal  timber harvesting will  be permitted on  this  tract, although mecha nized cutting for trail building shall be allowed.  Improvements and expansion of roads and fa cilities shall be permitted in the vicinity of the  Kerr Nature Center.  Fourth. The bill also designates 400 acres  near Beech Creek as the Beech Creek Botani cal Area. The same criteria for management  would be applied to Beech Creek as applied  to the Kerr tract.  Fifth. To best promote  the entire area for  tourism purposes, all of  these designations  shall be known on maps as the Winding Stair  Mountain National Recreation and Wilderness  Area.  Sixth.  In addition, a special ""esthetics and  wildlife management area""  is  to be estab lished along and  in view of Talimena Drive  and  the Helson Valley Road,  collectively  known as the Indian Nations National Scenic  and Wildlife Area. Management practices that  would detract from the scenic quality and nat ural beauty shall not be allowed in the area as  viewed  from any  location on  the Talimena  Drive and Helson Valley Road areas.

As immunized tes timony may not be used against a wit ness in a criminal case, Independent  Counsel Lawrence Walsh will be re quired  to demonstrate  to  the court  that he has obtained his  evidence  from other sources and that his case is  not tainted by immunized testimony.

566,331,5,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise today to introduce a joint resolu tion which authorizes and requests the  President  to designate  the week of  September 25, 1988, through October  l, 1988, as ""National Historically Black  Colleges Week.""  This  is  the sixth consecutive year  that I have authored this legislation.  Once again, I am proud to have such a  strong display of bipartisan support  for this resolution as is demonstrated  by the 55 original cosponsors. Several  of these cosponsors do not have his torically black colleges and universi ties located in their States. However,  they appreciate, as do I, the great con tributions made  to our Nation  by  these institutions.  Eight of the 117 historically black  colleges,  namely  Allen  University,  Benedict College, Claflin College, Clin ton Junior College, Denmark Techni cal College, South Carolina State Col lege, Morris College,  and Voorhees  College, are located in my home State.  These colleges are vital to the higher  education system of South Carolina.  They have provided thousands of eco nomically disadvantaged young people  with the opportunity to obtain a col lege education.  Mr. President, hundreds of  thou sands of young Americans have  re ceived quality educations at these 117  schools. These institutions have a long  and distinguished history of providing  the  training necessary  for participa tion in a rapidly changing society. His torically black colleges offer  to our  citizens a variety of curriculums and  programs through which young people  develop skills and talents, thereby ex panding opportunities  for continued  social progress.  Recent statistics show that histori cally black colleges and universities  have  graduated  60  percent  of  the  black pharmacists  in  the Nation, 40  percent of the black attorneys, 50 per cent of the black engineers, 75 percent  of the black military officers, and 80  percent of the black members of the  judiciary.  Mr. President,  through passage of  this joint resolution, Congress can re affirm  its  support  for  historically  black colleges, and appropriately rec ognize  their  important contributions  to our Nation. I  look forward to the  speedy passage of this joint resolution,  and I ask unanimous consent that a  copy of the joint resolution appear in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.J.

567,370,5,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in sup port of H.R.  1975,  the Federal Cave Re sources Protection Act. I was pleased to intro duce this legislation with the cosponsorship of  my colleagues Mr. CRAIG and Mr. JOHNSON as  well as 29 other Members. I also want to com mend our colleague Mr. RICHARDSON  from  New Mexico for his valuable contributions with  respect to caves located on Indian lands.  This bill enjoys endorsements from the Na tional Speleological Society, National Wildlife  Federation, American Cave Conservation As sociation, Defenders of Wildlife, Bat Conserva tion International, Sierra Club and the National  Audubon Society. Senator DASCHLE has intro duced a companion measure in the Senate, S.  927.  The purpose of H.R. 1975 is to strengthen  the ability of Federal agencies to protect and  manage cave resources when they are situat ed on lands under the jurisdiction of the Sec retaries of Agriculture and Interior or on Indian  lands. There are two key questions which go  to the heart of this legislation: why are caves  worth protecting, and why  is  this  legislation  needed?  I will address each of these ques tions in turn.  Caves are worth protecting due to their di verse resources. Caves are home to a rich va riety of species, and many as-yet-undiscov ered species are  thought  to dwell  there as  well. These abundant and diverse species  provide a gene pool which is valuable for sci entific study and advancement. Caves are  also an  important conduit  for underground  rivers which serve as water supplies for many  rural  communities. Equally  important, caves  are a favored recreation site for visitors enjoy ing both their pristine and unusual beauty and  the adventure of cave exploration.  Caves are  in particular need of protection  because  they are nonrenewable  resources:  once caves are destroyed they are gone for ever. A decorative rock formation which took  hundreds of years to form can be destroyed in  moments. Exacerbating  this situation  is  the  fact that cave ecosystems are delicately bal anced and easily damaged.  The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act  is needed because  there  is a management  gap in present Federal law through which bal anced management of our Federal cave  re sources has slipped. For example, the Nation al Forest Management Act and  the Federal  Land  Policy  and Management Act, which  govern  the management of  the majority of  lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretaries  of Interior and Agriculture, do not specifically  mention caves as a resource to be considered  in the management of public lands.  A  report by  the Congressional Research  Service on cave protection stated  this prob lem succinctly,  ""It appears  that  the existing  land management laws are broad enough to  permit management of cave  resources, but  they do not expressly address  that goal or  compel that result.""  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In the absence of such direction, manage ment of caves on Federal  lands is inconsist ent and  inadequate.  In several New Mexico  caves, for example, colonies of Mexican Free  Tail bats have been decimated by vandals. In  Idaho, toxic waste was abandoned in a cave  and leaked into its soil. Throughout the United  States, graffiti and litter in and removal of sta lactite and stalagmite formations  from caves  on Federal lands have increased. The Federal  Cave Resources Protection Act addresses  these concerns by both empowering and di recting the Secretaries of Agriculture and Inte rior to include cave resources in land manage ment plans.  The act also authorizes the Secretaries of  Agriculture and Interior to withhold information  on the nature and location of a cave on Fed eral land when disclosure of such information  would create a substantial risk of harm  to it.  Although the caving community has more ex tensive  files on  the  location and nature of  caves on Federal lands than do Federal agen cies, it is hesitant to share these files with the  Federal Government out of concern that wide  distribution of the information would result in  vandalism and looting of unprotected caves.  This exemption would encourage the caving  community to come  forward with  its informa tion, thereby enhancing Federal land manage ment. For example, a Forest Service  land  manager has  related  to me  the hazards of  planning Federal timber sales without knowing  the location of caves in the harvest area.  Ig norance of a cave's location poses a danger  to  equipment and  loggers who  could  fall  through hidden cave openings.  There  is a precedent  for  this withholding  provision  in  the Archaeological Resources  Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA). ARPA's with holding provision has worked effectively  to  protect archaeological resources while provid ing exemptions for the disclosure of informa tion, and  I am confident  that H.R. 1975's  nearly  identical provision would work equally  as well.  In addition  to  the  land management and  withholding provisions, H.R. 1975 encourages  coordination of  information between Federal  agencies and the public, requires permits for  the  collection  and  removal  of  natural  re sources from caves, establishes criminal and  civil penalties for activities which are damag ing  to  the cave  resource, and authorizes a  special fund for the benefit of damaged cave  resources.  In preparing H.R. 1975,  the willingness of  volunteers  from  the  caving  community  to  share  their expertise and educate  the public  about cave resources has been impressive. In  administering this measure, I would hope that  Federal agencies would avail  themselves of  the caving community's expertise in the areas  of cave management and safety procedures.  At this time, I would like to make special note  of  the hard work which  caving  volunteers  Janet Thorne, Jer Thornton, Phil Lucas and  David Foster have contributed to the advance ment of this legislation.  Caves are  the  repository of diverse  re sources and are in need of enhanced protec tion. The Federal Cave Resources Protection  Act affirms that it is the policy of the United  States to protect cave resources on Federal  lands and provides the specific authority to do  April 11, 1988  so.  I urge my colleagues  measure.  to approve  this  BALDWIN  PARK  UNIFIED  SCHOOL DISTRICT A CENTURY  OF QUALITY EDUCATION-18881988, BALDWIN PARK, CA  HON. ESTEBAN EDWARD TORRES  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 1988  ",1988
568,370,5,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  recognize 100 years of quality education  in  the city of Baldwin Park. During the past cen tury  this school system has garnered many  honors and has consistently provided the stu dents,  parents,  community and  employees  with an educational program  in which  they  could be proud. On May 7, 1988 the Baldwin  Park Unified School District will hold a ""Cen tennial Celebration.""  According  to  county  records dated April  1888, the Vineland School District was estab lished under the laws of the State of Califor nia.  It became the Baldwin Park School Dis trict on August 10, 1914. When  formed  in  1888, the district consisted of a one teacher,  15 pupil, one-room school house on Los An geles Street. Today,  the  school district  is  made up of 12 elementary school, 4  junior  high  schools,  two  comprehensive  high  schools, one continuation high school, a chil dren's center, an adult school center, an ad ministrative center and employs 1 ,550 employ ees.  Since 1924, there have been  five superin tendents,  J.  Hampton  Watts,  1924-35,  Charles D. Jones, 1935-44, Dan B. Lucas,  1945-54, Darcy Skaggs 1954-70, Jerry D.  Holland, 1970-88. Mr. Holland retires in June  after 18 successful years. His successor  is  David Barker who has been with  the school  district since 1975.  During  the  last decade,  the Baldwin Park  Unified School District has become a leader in  academic achievement and excellence in the  34th Congressional District and throughout the  State.  In 1983-84,  the Baldwin Park Unified  School District led other districts in implement ing the SB813 school reforms such as strong er graduation requirements, teacher proficien cy policies and longer school year/school day.  The distirct's bilingual program was chosen as  one of the five outstanding programs in Cali fornia.  During the 1984-85 school year, the district  was named one of the top achievers  in  the  California Assessment Program  [CAP]. The  Academic Pentathlon was established by the  board  of  education  to  provide monetary  awards to high school students.  The Baldwin Park School District received  many honors during the 1985-86 school year.  Three schools, Central, Walnut, and Tracy,  were nominated  for  the National Elementary  School  Recognition  Program  and  Central  School was 1 of 4 7 chosen from California to  reach  the  national  finals.  The Children's  Center Program was  rated outstanding and  the district was chosen as 1 of the 158 agen cies in  the State to operate a Latchkey Pro gram. The Sierra Vista High School Dons  ",1988

DAN DANIEL ARMED FORCES  RECREATION CENTER  ",1988
570,383,5,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill <H.R. 4155)  to designate the  Armed Forces Recreation Center at  Fort DeRussy, HI, as the ""Dan Daniel  Armed Forces Recreation Center.""  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 4155  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That the  Armed Forces Recreation Center at Fort  DeRussy, Hawaii, shall be known and desig nated as  the ""Dan Daniel Armed Forces  Recreation Center"".

The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Mississippi [Mr. MONTGOMERY].  ",1988
572,383,5,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker,  the gentleman  from  Virginia, Dan Daniel, died on January  23 of this year. He was a close friend  to a number of us here in the Congress  and one of this country's great patri ots.  Dan was an inspiration to all of us  because of his devotion to a strong na tional defense. He worked hard as  chairman of the Armed Services Read iness Subcommittee, and it is because  of his love for country and his commit ment to our military that we are here  today.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  support of this legislation to name the  Armed Forces Recreation Center at  Fort DeRussy after Dan Daniel. This  bill does not appropriate any money  and it does not change the name of  Fort DeRussy itself. It simply renames  the recreation center there in honor of  our former colleague by adding  two  words.  Dan was always aware of the dedica tion of the military men and women  who serve under difficult conditions  all around the world. He also had a  genuine concern for their morale.  Naming this recreation center after  Dan Daniel will ensure that his work  to keep morale high, and to provide  for  the recreational  interests of our  military personnel will be remembered  in the years to come. This center will  be  used  by our military  stationed  throughout the Far East Command, as  well as the people of Hawaii.  This is a very small gesture of appre ciation for Dan's lifetime of commit ment to a strong national defense, but  it is a fitting tribute, because it means  his legacy will live on with the men  and women he worked so hard for our  Armed Forces.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  4155 in tribute to our friend and col league from Virginia Dan Daniel.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. MARTIN of New York. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Mississippi for  introducing this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to sup port naming  this  recreation  center  after Dan Daniel.  All of us who knew Dan remember  him  for  his most  remarkable  at tributes of kindness and compassion  for people. Dan had a special place in  his heart for the welfare of the mil lions of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and  marines who devote themselves so un selfishly to the defense of our Nation.  His support for the well-being of the  military man and woman was repeat edly manifested in his unswerving sup port for resources to support the con tinuing effort to provide for an adequate quality of life for the American  military.  On many occasions we witnessed  Dan Daniel  rising on  the  floor  to  speak out for the welfare of the mili tary community. He also worked hard  behind the scenes at every opportuni ty to guarantee our military the bene fits to which they deserve and are en titled.  The  Armed  Forces  Recreation  Center in Hawaii had a special mean ing for Dan Daniel. He fought hard to  make  it the kind of place  that our  military could enjoy and be proud of.  Today, the Armed Forces Recreation  Center at Fort DeRussy provides de served  rest and relaxation for hun dreds of thousands of military people,  reciprocating  for  their devotion  to  duty.  Dedicating this center to Dan Daniel  would salute his passionate support  for our military personnel and allow  those who visit  this area reason  to  pause and reflect upon the memory of  our dear colleague.  Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, the  gentleman  from Virginia  [Mr. Dan  Daniell was one of the true gentlemen  I have ever had the privilege of serv ing with in any capacity.  ",1988
573,383,5,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 2 minutes  to  the gentleman  from Missouri [Mr. SKELTON] who also  serves on  the Committee on Armed  Services.  ",1988
574,383,5,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  this  bill is certainly a fitting tribute to one  of  the  real gentlemen of  the U.S.  House of Representatives.  Dan Daniel, the gentleman from Vir ginia who recently passed away, was a  member of the Committee on Armed  Services and as chairman of the Sub committee on Readiness spent a great  deal of his  time  to ensure that the  men and women of the Armed Forces  were maintained properly and  that  their recognition and welfare had a  high priority.  He  also  felt  very  strongly  about  equipment and facilities being in good  shape and properly maintained  for  these people.  Naming this Fort DeRussy Recrea tion Center after Dan Daniel  is  a  proper thing because of his interest in  the  soldier and  the sailor and  the  marine and the airman and their wel fare.  0 1230  Dan Daniel was a good friend. He  not only worked with us, he shared his  advice and his thoughts freely. Having  a distinguished career in the Virginia  House of Delegates, former chief of  the American Legion of  the United  States, a World War II Navy veteran,  he brought his expertise and his abili ty to get things done in the U.S. Con gress to this place and made it all the  better, not just for the fighting men  ",1988

576,396,5,Mr. STARK.," Mr. se Speaker, it is with both  pride and sadness that I bring the accomplish ments of Hayward city manager Don Blubaugh  to the attention of my colleagues. While I am  proud to say that Don has been an excellent  city manager for the past 9 years, implement ing innovative and exciting changes within the  government of Hayward, I am sad to say that  he will soon be leaving us to start his new po sition as city manager of Walnut Creek.  Don  is  the  kind  of  constituent  every  Member of Congress dreams of. He not only  Mr. Speaker, several million boys,  girls, men, and women  suffer  from  eating disorders. These disorders are  best treated if detected early. But that  is not always easy, since  the person  with the disorder may be a model stu dent, with good grades and good be havior.  Mr. Speaker, on personal note,  a  member of my family was 15 when she  developed anorexia and later bulimia.  Her disease went undiagnosed for 1  full year. Then she was hospitalized  and underwent a 4-year life-and-death  struggle.  She  won  that  struggle.  Today, 15 years later, she has a hus band and a young child and is leading  a full and active life.  Her suffering would have been far  less had her disorder been diagnosed  earlier. That  is where  this bill can  help. Awareness week aims to increase  preventive efforts and to educate the  public  and  professionals,  such  as  teachers and coaches.  Nonprofit support groups  through out the country have organized activi ties for this week. Their theme: ""It's  What's Inside That Counts."" Through  conferences, speaking in schools, and  on  television  and  in  print,  these  groups will focus on early intervention  and will seek to puncture the myth  that  being  thin  necessarily means  being happy and in control of one's  life.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  look  forward  to  action in the Senate, where BARBARA  MIKULSKI has introduced a companion  bill, Senate Joint Resolution 259.  ",1988

Concentrating on  long-term plans and yet  never forgetting the smallest details, Don has  streamlined Hayward's  government,  saving  both money for the citizenry and aggrevation  for the participant. He has been hailed for his  forsight in his implementation of a new gener al plan and the institution of a 5-year capital  improvement program. Among his many other  contributions to the city are his improvements  to the Hayward Airport,  the expansion of the  Hayward Main Library,  the many streets and  boulevards that he has facilitated the improve ment of, and his efforts at enhancing  the  image of the city as a whole.  Never content with the great strides he has  already taken, Don will soon be moving on to  a new challenge, having accepted the position  of city manager of Walnut Creek.  I join many  others  in professing my gratitude  for Don's  dedicated service  to both  the city and  the  people of Hayward. Good luck to both the city  and the people of Hayward.

597,435,5,Mr.  CONRAD.," Mr.  President,  I  wanted to take a few minutes to try to  put in perspective the importance of  the debate that we have been engaged  in for the last several hours. The im portance of this debate is that it has  real world effects on the economy that all of us are affected by in this  country.  When we look at the question of the  budget that is in front of us and the  specific amendment of the chairman, I  think we have  to put in perspective  where we are today. I brought several  charts to outline where we are, where  we are going, what the effects are on  all of us in this economy and why we  might want to make some fundamen tal changes such as the one proposed  by the chairman.  Mr. President, this first chart shows  the Federal spending and revenue pat tern from 1980 to the present. The top  to  line is  the spending line of the U.S.  Government. The bottom line  is the  revenue  line. In red are the deficits  that we have accumulated.  I  think it is abundantly clear. The  spending line goes up at a steady pace;  the  revenue  line, which  had been  tracking closely with the spending line  of the U.S. Government, took a U turn  with the 1981 Tax Act. The result was  that the deficits of this country abso lutely exploded. We went from $50 bil lion a year of deficit to $200 billion a  year of deficit for as far as the eye  could see.  Mr. President, I am asked repeatedly  by my constituents where  is all  the  money going, where are we spending  all of this money? This chart shows  the composition of Federal spending  for fiscal year 1987, and it shows that  28 percent of our money is going for  defense, about 20 percent for Social  Security, 7 percent for Medicare, and  14 percent for interest on the debt.  We have heard repeatedly in the last  2 years: We cannot touch Social Secu rity. We cannot touch defense. In fact  we have to give defense a big increase.  Obviously we cannot touch interest on  the debt. The trick in Medicare is to  hold down the increase.  Mr. President, just those four areas  are 70 percent of all Federal spending.  Some have said we can cure the deficit  problem just by cutting spending. If  you accept the notion that all four of  these areas are out of bounds, you  cannot touch them, then what we are  left with is about 30 percent of all Fed eral spending, or about $300 billion.  The deficit last year was $150 billion.  So, Mr. President, if we are to accept  the notion that we cannot touch Medi care, Social Security, defense, or inter est, we would have to cut every other  Federal program in half; every agricul ture program,  every  education pro gram, every veterans' program, every  highway program,  every parks pro gram,  every other Federal program  would have to be cut in half.  What is the result of the spending  pattern that  I have described? The  result is that the public debt of this  country has gone from less than $800  billion in 1977 to $2.8 trillion in 1989.  In 12 years, we will have more than  tripled the public debt.  My constituents ask, so what? What  difference does that make to me?  Very simply the difference  is  this:  this next chart I have prepared shows  what has happened to what we call  long-term real interest rates. Real in terest rates are the difference between  the interest rate that you pay and the  level of inflation.  Mr. President, this chart shows over  a very long period, from 1962 to 1987  what has happened  to  real  interest  rates. Real  interest  rates are what  really matter, because they are what  ",1988
598,448,5,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, as  we consider the budget resolution, it is  important to look at the effect of that  budget on our  long  range economic  goals. More  than  any other  single  piece of legislation, the budget is the  reflection  of  the  Federal Govern ment's goals and priorities. In the near  future,  the Senate will  take up  the  conference agreement on the Omnibus  Trade and Competitiveness Act. It is,  therefore, especially appropriate that  we examine the budget resolution in  the context of our efforts to improve  America's economic competitiveness.  In recent months,  the administra tion has all but proclaimed our com petitiveness problem over. Yet,  last  year's historic  trade deficit has not  disappeared. Productivity growth  in  the United States lags behind that of  our economic competitors. The United  States  is  still  the world's  largest  debtor nation. We continue to add to  the $2. 7 trillion Federal debt at a rate  where interest payments on the Feder al debt  in  fiscal year 1989 will by  themselves exceed the total, combined  budgets of the Departments of Agri culture,  Commerce,  Education,  Energy,  Interior, Labor, and Justice,  the Veterans' Administration, the En vironmental Protection Agency,  the  National Science Foundation, and the  National Aeronautics and Space Ad ministration.  The  administration's  rosy  predic tions notwithstanding, we  still have  not dealt with the stagnating standard  of living for working Americans. Real  wages are below where they were 10  years  ago. The median  real  family  income is stagnated. The recently re leased report by the Corporation for  Enterprise  Development  entitled  ""Making the Grade: The 1988 Devel opment Report Card"" sums up the sit uation when it states:  One of the most jarring impacts of the  rapid restructuring of the American econo my during the 1980s has been the decline of  well-paid, low-skill jobs and the rise Of low paying, moderate-skilled jobs. Caught in be tween are people who once could support a  family by their labor and now cannot.  In area after area-trade, technolo gy, human  resources, capital  forma tion,  and  international  economic  policy-our competitiveness problems  remain. This is not to say that we have  not made progress, we have. But, con trary  to  the administration's claims,  we still have a long way to go.  Mr. President,  to begin  to correct  our problems, we must continue  to  make the restoration of our economic  competitiveness, with the purpose of  raising the standard of living, a major  priority of our economic policy. Deficit  reduction  is  important  to  improving  our competitiveness, and  the budget  currently under consideration fulfills  the deficit reduction commitment we  made  last year.  In  this  regard,  this  budget is a major step toward solving  our competitiveness problems. But, we  should keep  in mind  it  is only one  step. As we consider the budget resolu tion and move through the budget and  appropriations process, I urge my col leagues  to continue  to focus on the  larger problem of sustaining our com petitive position in the world economy.  FISCAL YEAR 1989 BUDGET RESOLUTION AND  CIVILIAN PAY RAISES  ",1988
599,448,5,Mr. GLENN.," Mr.  President,  the  White  House-Congressional  Budget  Summit Agreement of November 20,  1987, reduced civil services and postal  spending by $1.7 billion over 2 years.  However, while  these spending cuts  have been enacted into law, they were  taken from postal operating and cap ital cut-backs and Federal retirement  benefits. They were not made through  reductions in pay.  The budget summit agreement con tained no specific assumptions with re spect to fiscal year 1989 employee pay  raises because it capped the aggregate  level of discretionary appropriations  that fund pay raises. Therefore, as the  President's budget assumes, employee  pay raises cannot increase total Gov ernment spending, whatever the rate  of increase, under the terms of the ap propriations cap.  Would the chairman of the Budget  Committee clarify what assumptions  for Federal pay raises are contained in  the pending budget resolution?  ",1988
600,448,5,Mr. CHILES.," The situation concern ing pay raises is highly unusual and  different this year than in all previous  years. This year, there are caps on the  amount of funds that can be spent for  domestic programs and  for defense.  The amounts for domestic pay raises  are included under the domestic cap.  Therefore, changing the civilian pay  raise assumption will have virtually no  effect on total spending or on the defi cit. However, any increase in the pay  raise assumption means that there is  less money available for other domes tic programs under the cap and any  decrease in the pay raise assumption  means there is more money available  for programs under the cap. In addi tion,  since  the  funding  for  pay  is  spread among all the programs under  the cap, it was decided to show these  amounts in each function and not to  show the total separately in function  920. Therefore, there is no easily avail able amendment  that could change  the pay raise assumption. A Senator  who  offered  an  amendment would  have to change every domestic func tion total. Similarly, there was no need  nor any reason to reconcile the Gov ernmental Affairs Committee for any  pay savings this year.  There is a very small technical effect  that the pay raise assumptions have  on the deficit. Pay raises marginally  affect the amounts included in func tion 950  for  the employer contribu tions to the retirement funds. Thus, in  putting together a budget resolution,  it was necessary to make some assump tions about civilian and military pay  raises. Until overturned,  the Presi dent's proposal for a civilian pay raise  would stand. At this point, it is pre sumed that the President will formally  propose the same pay raise that he as sumes in his budget-2 percent. There fore, this is the assumption contained  in the budget resolution.  However,  if  the budget  resolution  were passed, there is absolutely noth ing to preclude any Senator from of fering legislation that provides for a  higher pay raise for civilian workers or  which overturns the President's pay  proposal-assuming  that,  in August,  he proposes a 2-percent pay raise for  civilians. No point of order would lie  against such legislation, as long as the  funds for the pay raise came under the  appropriations cap. Thus, for example,  this budget resolution could accommo date a higher pay raise for all Federal  civilian workers.  ",1988
601,448,5,Mr. GLENN.,"  If I understand  the  Senator from Florida, a higher civilian  pay raise would be consistent with the  terms of the budget resolution.  ",1988
602,500,5,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, today I  appeared  before  the  Energy  and  Water Development Subcommittee of  the Senate Appropriations Committee.  I submit for the RECORD  the text of  my statement submitted to that com mittee.  STATEMENT OF SENATOR DAVID PRYOR  Mr. Chairman, it is my high honor and  personal privilege  to appear before  this  committee alongside the representatives of  the Red River Valley Association, the Ar kansas River Basin Interstate Committee,  the Ouachita River Valley Association and  the Lower Mississippi River Valley Flood  Control Association. On  behalf  of  our  friends and constituents from these areas of  Arkansas  and  the  surrounding  states  I  thank you Mr. Chairman for your diligence  in helping guide the Senate through some  very difficult economic times in recent years  while managing to keep our nation's public  works programs moving forward. It is no  small accomplishment, and you and your  staff are to be commended. I know our con stituents from these areas of the lower Mis sissippi River Valley and the Arkansas River  Basin, who are here today, fully recognize  and appreciate your efforts.  HELENA HARBOR AND PORT OF YELLOW BEND  Mr. Chairman, this past year this Com mittee took decisive action on two harbor  construction projects in Arkansas situated  on the Mississippi River that I believe are  absolutely crucial to economic recovery in  the Mississippi River Delta region. I speak  of the Helena Harbor project, which was au thorized in the Water Resources Develop ment Act of 1986, and the Port of Yellow  Bend, which was authorized under Section  107 of the Chief of Engineers' continuing  authority. The Committee acted on these  projects in the face of opposition from the  Administration, and that kind of courage  ought to be recognized.  How the Reagan Administration can con tinue to oppose economic development for a  seriously depressed region of our country on  the one hand, and tout economic recovery  as a tenet of Reagan achievements remains  a mystery to me.  Mr. Chairman, I anticipate continued ef forts by this Administration to avoid the ini tiation  of  construction  of  the Helena  Harbor project, and I want to assure you  that this Senator is going to continue his  unwavering efforts to see it constructed. I  hope and ask that you continue your sup port and ensure  that this Committee di rects,  in language and funding,  the Army  Corps of Engineers to move forward swiftly  with their design plans and specifications  and be prepared to commence construction  in FY 1989.  I believe that the Corps is committed to  constructing the Port of Yellow Bend, Mr.  ",1988
603,513,5,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, as Americans we  all feel a burning desire to help the oppressed  people of  the world  in  the struggle against  their tyrants. We observe these people's tire less  fight  to secure a better  future  for  their  children and embrace  their struggle as  if  it  were our own. We share in their pain, sorrow,  frustration, and especially their commitment.  However, many  times  these  feelings  lead  some to foolishly embark on a quest to cure  the world of  it's many  ills. The world has  come  to realize  that an American on a cru sade can be as threatening as the Red Army  itself. Such is the case in South Africa today.  It has been almost 2 years since the passing  of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act and  black South Africans are no closer to achiev ing political and economic  freedom.  In  fact,  the  repercussions of  these sanctions have  dealt a hard blow to the black community. It is  time  to reexamine  the value of sanctions to  the cause of the South African blacks. Amer ica cannot continue to be a negative influence  on the black's struggle against apartheid.  The effect of sanctions on  the South Afri can economy are quite disturbing. By initiating  the exodus of over 170 U.S.  businesses,  these  sanctions have greatly hindered  the  blacks  in  their quest  to achieve economic  freedom. While whites  have  eagerly  pur chased  these companies at  firesale prices,  the blacks have suffered. They can no longer  benefit  from United States business spon sored employee welfare programs and are  now subject  to  the wrath of  the new Afri kaaner owners, who have systematically fired  their black workers. We all know that the key  to the establishment of a free, democratic so ciety is a strong middle class, yet we persist in  impeding the black community from achieving  this prerequisite for freedom. The blacks need  our help-the key  to  their  future  lies  in  the  continued presence of United States busi nesses in South Africa.  In addition,  the  sanctions have wreaked  havoc on South Africa's political establish ment. By threatening the security of the Afri kaaner community,  the sanctions have en hanced the political standing of the rightwing.  In the most recent elections, the liberal Pro gressive Federal Party [PFP] was defeated as  the  official  opposition  to  Prime Minister  Botha's administration. Moreover,  the once  moderate Botha has toughened his stance on  the black opposition for fear of losing popular ity within the white electorate.  Is  this  the  ""moral backbone"" so many of  my colleaguP.s demanded when they overrode  the President's veto and passed these sanc tions? When President Reagan vetoed  the  Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, he did not  do so under disdain  for  the South African  blacks. He foresaw the effect these sanctions  would have on the black community. But why  did so many Congressmen  ignore his warn ings? Was it a lack of foresight? Or did they  simply use  the black's struggle  to enhance  their own public image?  I challenge my colleagues  to open  their  minds and put the interests of the South Afri can blacks ahead of  their own.  Instead of  searching for praise from the media, we need  to search  for answers. Answers which will  assist the black community achieve economic  prominence as  the. first step  in securing a  future of freedom for their children.  For a deeper insight into the present situa tion in South Africa, I highly recommend an ar ticle entitled  ""The Scandal of Sanctions""  in  the March 1988 edition of the American Spec tator.   [From the American Spectator. March  1988]  THE SCANDAL OF SANCTIONS  <By Fleur de Villiers)  In the fall of 1986, fueled by moral out rage and high moral purpose, the United  States Congress set out  to punish South  Africa and express solidarity with its black  oppressed masses.  Its  chosen  instrument  was the imposition of sanctions that would  excommunicate  South Africa  from  the  world's economy until the apartheid state  was brought to its senses, if not to its knees.  Those who wielded bell, book, and candle  blithely  ignored  the  fact  that  sanctions  without the threat of direct military inter vention have had a dismal record in the con duct of  international affairs.  Indeed,  the  question of whether or not sanctions would  achieve the abolition of apartheid and the  transfer of power to the black majority was,  one suspects, always secondary. The main  aim was  not  to  liberate South African  blacks, but to free the U.S. Congress from  the frustration of doing nothing.  Moral outrage and an instinct for med dling in areas that few politicians visit and  even fewer understand are American quali ties the rest of the world has come to dread.  There are  few  spectacles on earth more  alarming  than American  legislators  in  search of a quick fix of other people's prob lems. But if this addiction has too frequent ly made United States foreign policy  the  diligent pursuit of folly, seldom has it been  more diligently or more blatantly pursued  than by those who believed that the only  way to bring South Africa into the family of  civilized nations was to remove all traces of  American influence.  Now, eighteen months since the passage  of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act,  the full extent of that folly should be ap parent  to  all-except  those  congressmen  and senators who, having saddled the sanc tions horse, are determined to ride it all the  way to this year's elections. But before one  examines  their  failure  to win  anything,  except possibly the approval of Jesse Jackson, it is important to reflect on just what  they  thought  they would achieve  in  the  heady days of October 1986 when Congress  overrode a White House veto to secure the  first humiliating defeat of a hitherto all conquering President.  It is perhaps not too cynical to suggest  that that was part of the attraction. But  other motives were confused and contradic tory. For  some-the high-minded  rather  than  the  ruthless-excommunication was  the only way  to convince Pretoria of the  error of  its ways; white South Africans  would feel  the pinch and, putting wealth  above racism, would force their government  to change, thus effectively preventing the  expected bloodbath. For others revolution  was  the solution, not  the problem. Sanc tions, they calculated, would so impoverish  black South Africa that, with nothing left  to lose, it would rise up against its fatally  weakened white oppressors and thus usher  in the Utopia where all men were equal in  poverty and which would no longer make  any claim on America's conscience <only on  its purse). Those who felt a  little queasy  about inflicting further penury and depriva tion on South Africa's black citizens were si lenced with the answer that this  is what  South Africa's black leaders themselves de manded.  In any case,  it was suggested, sanctions  would  be  felt more  keenly  by wealthy  whites than by blacks who had little enough  anyway-a proposition that ignores the inte gration of the South African economy and  the simp1e fact that if you take food away  from a fat man he will suffer, but if you  take it away from a thin man he dies.  Above .and beyond all these considerations  was the conviction that a successful transfer  of power to the black majority was inevita ble, if not imminent, and that it was impor tant for America's long-term interest in a re source-rich region to ""get on the right side  of history""; failure to do so would hand the  area over  to Moscow and  its surrogates.  That belief was shared not merely by sanc tioneers  in Congress-Senators Kennedy,  Simon, Lugar, and Cranston and Congress men Wolpe,  Solarz, Gray, Rangel,  and  Leland-but by state and municipal govern ments  across  the United States which,  through boycott and threat of boycott, have  at the latest count sent 170 American com panies in South Africa stampeding for the  exit.  But just how effective has the whole sanc tions package been-disinvestment  includ ed? How have the promises survived more  than a year of practice?  The first answer was not long in coming.  President Botha cashed. in quickly, using  this unexpected American bonus to call and  win an election  in early May, calculating  correctly that external threat would induce  the white electorate to rally round the flag.  In a country in which history has bred a  strong  strand  of  isolationism,  he  could  hardly go wrong. But South Africa is not  unique. Other histories have-or  should  have-instructed us that a people who be lieve  their security  is  threatened will put  that security above material considerations.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

604,526,5,Mr.  LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  it  gives me great pleasure to set-aside this time  to recognize Father Peter D. Costarakis of St.  Prophet Elias Church of San Bernardino, CA.  Father Costarakis will be honored on May 1,  1988, for serving 25 years as a priest of the  Greek Orthodox Church. I would like to honor  him today by saying a few words about his ac complishments during his distinguished career.  Mr. Costarakis was born  in Dara, Greece,  on June 10, 1937. His father, a priest of the  Greek Orthodox Church in Greece, was invit ed  to serve the Greek Archdiocese of North  and South America. The family arrived in the  United States on December 23, 1946, settling  in Lewiston, ME.  In 1963, Peter Costarakis received his bach elor of arts and bachelor of divinity in theology  from Holy Cross Seminary in Brookline, MA. In  1970 he received an S.T.M. from St. Vladimir  Seminary  in New York. He was ordained on  March 17, 1963, by Metropolitan Germanos at  the St. Sophia Church  in Albany, NY. Father  Peter Costarakis represents the  fifth genera tion of his family to enter the priesthood.  Father Peter has exemplified a dedication to  the ministry which few possess. From 1963 to  1964 he dutifully served  the entire State of  Montana as a missionary priest after which he  moved to Troy, NY, where he served as priest  for 14 years.  During his stay in New York, Father Peter  founded and served as president of the St.  Andrew Orthodox Brotherhood of upstate New  York and was cited by Nelson Rockefeller for  his accomplishments.  In addition  to his al ready demanding church duties, Father Peter  also served on the board of directors of the  New York State Red Cross.  In 1978 he moved  to San Bernardino, CA  where he still resides and continued his phil anthropic ways.  In southern California, Father  Peter has served on a multitude of Church  councils and commissions. He  is a member  and past president of the Southern California  Orthodox Clergy Council. He also occupies  the position of orthodox chairman of the Or thodox-Roman Catholic Dialogue Commission  of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Further,  he presently serves on  the Diocese of San  Francisco Mixed Council, the Diocese of San  Francisco Presbyters Council, and  the San  Bernardino Ministerial Association.  Although  Father  Peter's  service  to  his  church  is  in  itself commendable,  the honors  and  awards  Father  Peter  has  received  throughout his professional  life represent the  feelings of those who have been most familiar  with  the work he has accomplished.  In addi tion  to  the honors previously mentioned,  in  1979 Father Peter was awarded  the  title of  steward of  the church and  later was named  protopresbyter of the Diocese of San Francis co. Father Peter currently holds the position of  liturgical officer of the Greek Diocese of San  Francisco, and in June 1988, will be awarded  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the title of protopresbyter of the Ecumenical  Patriarchate of Constantinople.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in salut ing Father Peter Costarakis. He serves as an  outstanding example to us all  for his dedica tion to the improvement of his church and his  community.  It is with great respect that I pay  tribute to him today.  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  HON. PETER W. RODINO, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 12, 1988  ",1988
605,526,5,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago  our Nation lost a leading voice for justice and  freedom. The assassination of Martin Luther  King, Jr. on April 4, 1968 was one of the most  tragic events in American history.  Dr. King was still a young man when he was  killed and he was deprived of the richness of  a long life. We were also deprived of the pres ence and  the wisdom of  this great man.  I  know  that  I still miss his voice of  inspired  leadership as deeply now as during  the  first  months after his death. Throughout the past  20 years as we worked to honor our commit ment to ensuring a fair and just society for all  Americans, Dr. King's firm, resolute, and confi dent voice would have provided  inspiration  and encouragement.  But Martin Luther King, Jr.'s voice does live  on because his dream was stronger than life  and more powerful than death.  It lives on  in  the effort to guarantee a decent quality of life  for every citizen.  It  lives on  in  the vigilance  necessary to preserve equal opportunity for all  Americans.  It  lives on  in  the  international  struggle  for human  rights. Throughout  the  world, wherever  people  are  searching  for  peace or striving  to overcome  injustice-Dr.  King's voice and his dream continues to pro vide inspiration and comfort.  Dr. King's voice also lives on  in the hearts  and minds of all Americans as we continue to  nurture his dream. This was reflected  in  the  outpouring of respect and emotion across the  United States on  the 20th anniversary of his  death.  Mr. Speaker, my own city of Newark, NJ  honored  the memory of Dr. King on April 4,  1988 with a ceremonial groundbreaking  for  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Courthouse.  I am  proud  to  have  sponsored  the  legislation  naming this new courthouse after Dr. King.  It  will serve as a living memorial and reminder to  future generations of  the  true greatness of  Martin Luther King, Jr. With your permission, I  would like to include the following article in my  remarks.  [From the Star Ledger, Apr. 5, 1988]  KING HONORED-OFFICIALS BREAK GROUND  FOR COURTHOUSE  <By Frederick W. Byrd)  Ceremonial groundbreaking  for  the $60  million Martin Luther King courthouse in  Newark was held yesterday afternoon as  speakers, noting it was the 20th anniversary  of King's death, said the building would be  a symbol of his life's ideals.  ""Years from now, little children will look  at this building and ask, 'Who was Martin  April 12, 1988  Luther King?'"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg  <D-N.J.). ""So the story will be told again.""  Construction of the $60 milion, five-story  federal courthouse is to begin this year and  be completed in 1990, acording to spokes men for the General Services Administra tion <GSA>.  It will add 15 new courtrooms to the seven  federal courtrooms now located in Newark.  GSA  spokesmen  estimate  the  350,000square-foot structure will provide about 800  jobs.  . While praising the building, Newark offi cials said there was a ""downside"" to the de velopment in that it is another building in  Newark that will not pay property taxes.  ""It is my hope and the hope of my council  colleagues that the federal government will  provide  an  in-lieu-of-tax  payment ""  said  Council President Henry Martinez.  '  The audience assembled  in  the second floor conference room of the Rodino Feder al Building for the formal ceremonies and  unveiling of a model of the new building.  They held a 30-second silent  tribute  in  honor of King, who was assassinated on  April 4, 1968, while arranging a march to  help sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn.  Then  the officials went outside  to  the  courthouse  site-Walnut  and  Orchard  streets-to turn the ceremonial first shovel fuls of dirt.  Mayor Sharpe James noted King came to  Newark during the last week of his life.  ""I remember he spoke at South Side High  School  <now Malcolm X  Shabazz High  School) which is my alma mater and Mayor  (Edward> Koch's alma mater.  ""He told the youngsters to 'burn the mid night oil ... learn, baby, learn.'""  ""Even in death,"" the mayor said, ""he lives  on, he still shines like a bright star.""  ""This building underlines his  idea  that  justice should never be out of reach for all  Americans,"" he added.  ""If Dr. King were alive today he would be  concerned about justice for all. By dedicat ing this courthouse we can relive the whole  dream and purpose of this great humanitar ian.""  Lautenberg, who along with Rep. Peter  Rodino <D-lOth Dist.) sponsored legislation  naming the structure after King, said, ""He  told us injustice anywhere is a threat to jus tice everywhere. The courthouse will be a  daily reminder of that.""  John Alderson, acting national adminis trator of the GSA, said naming the building  for King is appropriate because ""he gave his  life in pursuit of justice for his fellowman.""  The courthouse will mean ""a net expan sion of the number of judges and facilities  in Newark, making Newark truly a federal  judicial center,"" said William Diamond, the  GSA regional administrator.  Essex County Sheriff Thomas D' Alessio  said  the new courthouse will further  the  ends of justice in Newark. ""This centralizes  the location and is a great honor for the  city,"" he said.  Allen Trousdale, the project director. de scribed  the building  as  a  contemporary  design, ""but an interpretation of the neo classical style of  the existing government  buildings nearby.''  ""We set the roof line of the King building  at  the same  level as  the cornice of  the  present courthouse across Walnut Street""  he said.  '  ""There is a one-story stone base to sup port the main facade. The main body of the  building has a portico and colonnade of pi lasters, capped with a cornice of  the top  floor.""  ",1988

609,539,5,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, yes terday I did not attend the Democratic  caucus, and I regret I was not able to  be there. I was shocked and surprised  to read that our distinguished majori ty leader is going to step aside and will  no longer be the majority leader in the  next session.  I will not be here, but I want to say a  word or two about the majority leader.  Mr. President, Senate majority lead ers come in just about every hue of  the rainbow. In the 30 years I have  been here, we have had the all-encom passing,  dominating  leadership  of  Lyndon Johnson; the every-Senator-is a-leader, consensus leadership of Mike  Mansfield;  the  gentle,  behind-the scenes masterful compromising leader ship of Howard Baker;  the  forceful  and yet always considerate leadership  of BoB DOLE; and the diligent, persist ent,  truly  dedicated  leadership  of  ROBERT BYRD.  Now our leader, BoB BYRD,  is going  to step down, not out but down.  BoB BYRD has given this country a  very great deal. Obviously, he  is a  leader who knows the Senate rules as  no other leader in my 30-year memory.  Majority Leader  BYRD  runs  this  body  by  consensus. We Democrats  have constant caucuses, and I can tell  you as one who was here when Lyndon  Johnson was here, we did not have  regular Democratic  Party  caucuses  then. We would have a party caucus  literally only once every 2 years, at the  beginning  of  the  new  Congress.  Lyndon would deliver what we called  Lyndon's ""State of  the Union Mes sage,"" and that was it. There was no  need  for  a  caucus because Lyndon  would decide everything, and I mean  everything, the Senate would act on.  The Senate was a one-man show. We  have had quite a change since Lyndon  Johnson left. Senator BYRD has been  emphatic in his insistence that all Sen ators have a voice in how the Senate  proceeds.  We Democrats  now  have  regular  weekly caucuses where  the majority  will of our party in the Senate is deter mined. Senator BYRD also works close ly and respectfully with the Republi can leadership. He listens. He recog nizes where the votes and the majority  will is and he moves the Senate along  accordingly.  As a majority leader, he recognizes  the ultimate decision has to lie with  the Senate and with the side that has  the most votes. But he never, not once  in the many years he has been leader,  has  compromised on  the principles  and convictions that dominate his life.  Just  yesterday, Mr.  President,  I  called Senator BYRD to ask him to vote  with me on a matter of great impor tance  to  this Senator. He  flatly  re fused. I entreated him. He replied, ""No  way!"" He said, ""This is my position  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions ~hich are not spoken by the Member on the floor.  ",1988
610,552,5,Mr. BYRD.," The  recording  clerks  cannot be held  responsible  for  this.  They do a good job in a very difficult  situation. They can hardly hear the  responses themselves. Many Senators  respond, and they are not heard be cause of all the noise in the Chamber.  I think that we all ought to just un derstand that it is up to each Senator  to see that he gets here to the Cham ber and votes, and he can walk right  up to the desk there and see if he has  recorded his vote.  I once missed a rollcall vote at one  point of time, being right out here in  the reception room. I knew a vote was  going on, but I was talking with con stituents and, before  I knew  it,  the  vote was announced. Yet,  it was my  fault that I missed the vote.  It is with chagrin that Senators miss  votes, especially when they are here in  the Chamber.  I certainly feel much empathy for  Mr. DECONCINI and the other Senator  who missed the vote.  ",1988
611,552,5,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I was  in the Chamber during the vote on the  Stevens amendment. However,  I did  not hear the chair call for the end of  the vote, and thus,  I was unable to  cast my vote. I would like the record  to show that if I had been able to cast  my vote, I would have voted in favor  of the Stevens amendment.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, will  the Senator yield?  ",1988
612,552,5,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, I am glad to yield  the floor.  Mr. D'AMATO. I would like to make  an observation.  ",1988
613,552,5,Mr. BYRD.," Yes.  Mr. D'AMATO. It seems to me that  in the short period of time that I have  been privileged to be a Member of this  body we  have adopted policies and  rules at least by way of implementa tion  that seem  to work against  the  congeniality, that does not necessarily  add any great efficiency.  I object to the time of 15 minutes  when there is not the kind of urgent  pressing business, given the transpor tation dilemma that many who are in  the Hart Building have, and it is a di lemma, saying, when we are coming  from committee hearings and work,  ""unless one is here in 15 minutes we  will cut them off.""  I had occasion some weeks ago to be  with a number of my colleagues when  there was a number of people who  were handicapped-they were blind had  trouble getting on and off  the  cars, and about seven or eight Sena tors missed that particular vote.  This seems to me, I say to the major ity  leader, and I make  this observa tion-it is not personal-that the aura,  the dignity, the solemnity of the office  is demeaning when we get  into  this  business of cutting off a vote after 15  minutes, that we cannot, as it relates  to the comity of this Chamber, find  out that, yes, there is a Senator who  will be here shortly. I am not suggest ing someone hold the vote for a half  hour, and that had been done. But  when someone  is on  the way,  there  should be a comity that we attempt  unless  there are clear defined mes sages  that we have 40  amendments  waiting, we have a restricted period of  time.  That  is  a matter which  I  believe  makes much more sense, and that is  this Senator's personal observation.  I  do not understand why we are  taking away from that which is impor tant to the dignity of this body, and it  makes no sense to this Senator.  I understand once the Chair has said  that there are no further votes, he has  made his decision  and  you  cannot  open it up again, but I am suggesting  that I think we have lost an awful lot  in a period of time.  ",1988
614,552,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I certain ly respect the personal viewpoint of  the distinguished Senator. He has a  right to that viewpoint. I do not be lieve, however, that it is demeaning to  the Senate to require that Senators be  here and answer to their names during  a period of 15 minutes, which seems to  me  any Senator could do  here.  anyone might complain, it should be  Senator STENNIS. But  I  have never  heard a complaint from Senator STEN NIS in that regard.  Some of us who are not as young as  we were when we came to the Senate  can walk it easily from the Hart Build ing in 15 minutes. I do it often. I do  this to get a little exercise. I can walk  it easily from  the Hart Building by  starting when the first bells ring.  I  understand all  the problems of  Senators when they are having com mittee hearings. I have been around  here  long enough  to experience all  these inconveniences.  I also know that I can get to this  Chamber in 15 minutes and register  my vote.  If I am here and there is so much  noise, and I walk out of the Chamber  and do not vote, that is my fault. That  can happen.  As to whether it is more demeaning  to the Senate in that respect than it is  to be a constant complainer about how  this institution works and about how  demeaning it is  to have to answer a  rollcall vote in 15 minutes, I will leave  it up to Senators to weigh one against  the other and decide for themselves as  to which is the more demeaning.  I think ""The fault, Dear Brutus, is  not in our stars but in ourselves.""  If  I  again express my empathy with  Senator DECONCINI  and others who  from time to time, really through no  fault of their own-they get engaged  in a conversation-miss a vote now and  then.  The  voting  record  of  Senator  DECONCINI  can  stand  up,  I  think,  almost to match anybody else's in the  Chamber. He  has  stated  for  the  RECORD the reason he missed this vote,  and I am sure he will indicate for the  RECORD how he would have voted if he  had voted.  Mr. President, this Senate does not  have all day to wait on Senators. I am  not addressing my remarks to the dis tinguished Senator from Arizona, but  I am responding to the distinguished  Senator from New York who said that  he thought it was pretty demeaning. I  hope that Senators will just try a little  harder to get here on time. There is a  warning bell, and many times, in order  to give Senators a little advance warn ing we put in a quorum call.  Senators had ample notice of this  vote even from last night when I an nounced that there would be a rollcall  vote today at 11 o'clock and that the  call  for  the  regular order would be  automatic at the expiration of the 15  minutes. They had plenty of time and  they had plenty of advance notice.  To me it is not demeaning to expect  Senators to get to the floor and vote  within that 15 minutes especially after  they have had all the notices in ad vance.  ",1988
615,552,5,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, will  the majority leader yield?  ",1988
616,552,5,Mr. BYRD., I am happy to yield.  ,1988
617,552,5,Mr. DECONCINI.," I thank the major ity leader.  I have no problem with the enforce ment of the rule of 15 minutes. I think  we are better off when we do that.  My concern  is  that being on  the  floor, both Senator HARKIN and myself  standing there-and I take the respon sibility for my actions of missing the  vote-it concerns me that there would  not be a waiver by the leader or others  that permits a Senator to cast a vote  when the vote was overwhelmingly 75  to 5, something like that.  Now, if it is a vote that would tip it  one way or the other, I could see the  objection to that. That troubles me.  But,  in any event, Mr. President,  what has happened has happened. I  do want the RECORD to show that had  my vote been cast it would have been  cast in the affirmative in favor of the  amendment  of  the  Senator  from  Alaska. I have been a strong supporter  of that for a long time.  I  am,  quite  frankly,  disappointed  that my vote is not registered.  ",1988
618,552,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  yield the floor.  I must say, again, for those who may  be  interested or who may not,  that  there are two rules which cannot be  I will  ",1988
619,565,5,Mr. GRAMM., Would  guished Senator yield?  Mr. DOMENIC!. I will be pleased to  yield.  ,1988
620,565,5,Mr. GRAMM.,"  I would  just like  to  remind our colleagues  that we have  adopted four amendments to the origi nal Chiles amendment. The  logic of  the original Chiles amendment said  that  the big  trust  fund  surplus  in  Social Security ought not  to count  toward the deficit. The amendments  we adopted simply extended that logic  to include trust funds related to high ways,  airports,  to  the  FDIC,  the  Comptroller of the Currency, the Fed eral Reserve Bank, military retirees,  civil  service  retirees,  the unemploy ment trust fund, and the independent  Postal Service.  Now,  if we adopt  the amendment  pending we will, in essence, have gone  back and stripped away  those  four  amendments  that we  have  already  voted on and adopted.  May I remind my colleagues that if  this amendment should be adopted  and if the amendment of the distin guished Senator  from New Mexico,  which I support, fails, then each one  of these amendments that we have al ready adopted will be in order. I can  assure Senators that they will be of fered. And I assume that unless people  on the same day are going to vote two  ways  on  the  same  issue,  all  four  amendments will  be  readopted. We  will then have spent all day adopting  amendments,  stripping  the  amend ments off, and then readopting them.  I do not think this makes any sense. In  fact, in the 10 budget debates I have  been involved in, I would have to say  that  the debate  in  the  last 2 days  makes  less sense  than any of  those  other debates.  But  I want  to assure people  that  after  having  adopted  four  amend ments, some of  them by voice vote,  that if we come in here and strip them  off and then the amendment of the  distinguished  Senator  from  New  Mexico is unsuccessful, we can expect  to vote on those amendments again.  I yield back  the remainder of my  time.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President, the  distinguished  chairman  is  here.  I  ",1988
621,604,5,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  rise to echo the remarks of the Sena tor from Ohio, the distinguished and  able chairman of  the Governmental  Affairs Committee, Senator GLENN, on  the issue of Federal employee pay.  I am proud to represent over 250,000  hardworking  and dedicated Federal  civil  servants,  and  another  130,000  Federal  retiree  annuitants,  in  the  State of Maryland. Many of  them  have given up the chance for lucrative  employment in the private sector to  serve their country.  The pay proposal  in  the Senate  budget resolution,  I believe,  is  inad equate to meet the economic needs of  our Federal civilian work force. Our  Nation's civil  service  suffers  today  from severe morale, retention and re cruitment problems. Unless we recog nize  this growing problem, and take  the steps necessary to address it, we  will face a crisis in continuing to be  able to attract the Nation's best and  the brightest to public service.  In the  last 8 years,  the country's  Federal employees and retirees have  been  forced  to shoulder more  than  their fair share of deficit reduction.  From fiscal year 1981-88, Federal em ployees and retirees have been forced  to absorb $82 billion in deficit cutting  measures according to estimates of the  Federal Government  Service  Task  Force. They should not be forced to  take further cuts and should be able  to expect from their Government fair  pay and sound retirement benefits.  It is my hope that we will fashion a  more equitable approach  to Federal  pay in the upcoming conference with  the House. Without taking this action,  the quiet crisis among America's civil  servants will become a problem of far  greater magnitude that will be even  more difficult to correct.  MORNING BUSINESS  ",1988

624,604,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, as in ex ecutive session, I ask unanimous con sent that the injunction of secrecy be  removed  from  the  treaty with  the  Commonwealth of The Bahamas on  Mutual Assistance  in Criminal Mat ters,  treaty  document No.  100-17,  transmitted  to  the Senate  today by  the President; and ask that the treaty  be considered as having been read the  first time; that it be referred, with ac companying papers, to the Committee  on Foreign Relations and ordered to  be printed; and that the President's  message be printed in the Record.  ",1988
625,604,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  The message of the President is as  follows:  To the Senate of the United States:  With a view to receiving the advice  and consent of the Senate to ratifica tion, I  transmit herewith the Treaty  between the United States of America  and the Commonwealth of The Baha mas on Mutual Assistance in Criminal  Matters, signed at Nassau on June 12  and August  18,  1987, with  related  notes. I transmit also, for the informa tion of the Senate, the report of the  Department of State with respect to  the Treaty.  The Treaty  is one of a  series of  modern mutual legal assistance trea ties being negotiated by  the United  States in order to counter criminal ac tivities more effectively. The Treaty  should be an effective tool in prosecut ing a wide variety of modern criminals,  including members of drug cartels, and  ""white-collar criminals."" The Treaty is  self-executing  and  utilizes  existing  statutory authority.  The Treaty provides  for  a  broad  range of cooperation in criminal mat ters. Mutual assistance available under  the Treaty includes:  taking testi mony or statements of witnesses; (2)  provision of documents, records, and  evidence; (3) execution of requests for  searches and seizures; < 4)  transfer of  persons in custody for testimonial pur poses; (5) serving documents; (6) locat ing persons; < 7) exchanging informa tion;  immobilizing  forfeitable  assets; and (9) any other matter mutu ally agreed upon.  (1)  (8)  I  recommend that the Senate give  early and favorable consideration  to  the Treaty, with  related notes, and  give its advice and consent to ratifica tion.  RONALD REAGAN.  THE WHITE HOUSE, April 13, 1988.  GUNARS ASTRA, LATVIAN  PATRIOT  ",1988
626,604,5,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, on April 6,  Gunars  Astra,  Latvia's  foremost  human rights activist, died in a Lenin grad  hospital  following  extensive  heart surgery.  We do not know  all  the circum stances surrounding Mr. Astra's death.  But I hope a  request made by his  widow,  that a non-Soviet pathologist  be allowed to conduct an independent  autopsy,  is  complied with  by  the  Soviet authorities.  Gunars Astra was only 56 years old  when he died. And 19 of those years  were spent in a Soviet gulag, accused  of ""anti-Soviet agitation and propa ganda."" He had been released from  prison camp only 2 months ago and  was visiting  in Leningrad when he  became ill.  During his  last  trial,  in 1983,  the  Soviet procurator  accused Astra of  being ""Andrei Sakharov's comrade in  thought."" Well, for  those of us who  value the right of man to live, think,  work in freedom, that is no accusation,  it is a high compliment.  Astra decried Soviet oppression of  non-Russians  living  in  the  Soviet  Union-in Latvia, Mordovia, Bielorus sia, and the Ukraine. His commitment  to his own people, their destiny, their  preservation, was  total. And Astra's  untimely death once again highlights  the  human  impact  of  the  Soviet  Union's illegal occupation of the Baltic  States.  Mr. President, I hope and trust that  at the upcoming summit meeting in  Moscow, President Reagan will reiter ate the United States commitment to  guaranteeing basic human rights to all  Soviet citizens. That is the very least  we can do  to show our unwavering  support for brave patriots like Gunars  Astra whose whole life was dedicated  to the hope that the Latvian people  would some day be free and independ ent.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BYRD  ",1988
627,604,5,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, despite  the  announcement made  yesterday,  this  is  no  time  for  eulogies  that  ROBERT c. BYRD  is leaving. After all,  unless  the voters of West Virginia  suffer a temporary loss of sanity, he  will be back here next year. And when  he returns, he will return as the chair man of  the Appropriations Commit tee-certainly not an insignificant po sition.  ",1988
628,643,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Wiscon sin  [Mr. MoonY],  a  distinguished  former member of the Committee on  Interior and Insular Affairs.  ",1988
629,643,5,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of S. 858, the Aban doned Historic Shipwreck Act, and in  opposition to any weakening amend ments.  This bill  is long overdue. Congress  has been trying for many years to pass  legislation  to  protect  our  historic  shipwrecks. Now is the time to enact  the Abandoned Historic  Shipwreck  Act to ensure that our historic sub merged resources are preserved.  Any amendments to this bill would  sink  this  carefully  crafted  compro mise. S. 858  is an excellent bill that  has balanced the interests of historic  preservationists,  archeologists,  and  sports divers.  Removing the jurisdiction of historic  shipwrecks from the admiralty courts  to the States is an excellent proposal.  The States  are better qualified  to  manage  historic  shipwrecks. Where  admiralty courts focus on salvage in terests, the States balance the inter ests of the salvager with the interests  of the environment, historic preserva tion, and recreation. States are clearly  in the best position  to regulate and  protect our irreplaceable historic and  cultural artifacts.  We do not allow important historic  objects to go unprotected on land. It is  now time that we set up similar pro tection for our submerged artifacts. I  urge adoption of S. 858 without weak ening amendments.  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen tleman  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.  STUDDS].  ",1988
630,643,5,Mr.  STUDDS.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  apologize to the Members because, not  having heard all of the debate, I run  the  risk  of  repeating  a  couple  of  things.  I  simply want  to say I  think,  for  once, we have an issue before us that  is perhaps simpler than it has been  made out to be. That is not often the  case here.  This is not a very complex problem  we seek to resolve, and it is not a very  complex solution  that your commit tees have suggested.  The real issue presented by the legis lation  is whether or not we assume  that  the States  can manage  their  waters and  the shipwrecks  lying  in  them in a proper and responsible fash ion.  If you assume-and this Chamber, at  least as far as I can recall, is full of  folks who give a great many state ments  about States  rights-if  you  assume that States can exercise their  responsibilities  properly,  then  you  should support this bill; if you assume  that States will be fair to their own  people, you should support this bill; if  you assume that a stable, predictable  regulatory system to govern the exca vation of shipwrecks is better than one  that would probably require a Federal  lawsuit every time you want to recover  an underwater  artifact,  you  should  support this bill.  The Chamber  is  full of Members  who think the States are perfectly ca pable of carrying out their general re sponsibilities with respect to the man agement  of  lands  and natural  re sources, police and safety and other  functions. If we do not fear our States,  if we do not have a disrespect for their  elementary  capabilities  elsewhere,  there is no reason on this Earth that  we should not vest in them unequivo cally and clearly and beyond legal dis pute this responsibility.  I urge Members to support this bill.  ",1988
631,643,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Wash ington [Mr. LOWRY], the chairman of  the  Subcommittee  on  Merchant  Marine and Fisheries, my counterpart.  ",1988
632,643,5,Mr. LOWRY of Washington.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I commend the sub committee chairman for his leadership  as well as others who have worked on  this important legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to rise in  strong support of S. 858,  the aban doned historic shipwreck bill.  I  feel  that this bill is a good piece of legisla tion and merits passage by the House.  As Members are aware, S. 858 was  considered by the House on March 28  and  failed  to  receive  the  two-thirds  needed to pass under the suspension  of  the  rules. However,  the bill had  strong support, evidenced by the dis proportional vote of 263  to  139.  I  would also like to point out that S. 858  is strongly supported by the adminis tration.  At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would  like to briefly explain what S. 858 does  and what it doesn't do, and give some  brief background in terms of the con text of the bill.  First, S. 858 is very similar to H.R.  74, which was originally introduced by  our colleague, Mr. BENNETT, who has  been  a  leader on  this  issue  for  a  number of years. The primary purpose  of S. 858  is for the Federal Govern ment  to assert and  transfer  to  the  States  title  to  certain  abandoned  shipwrecks which  are  embedded  State-submerged lands, State-protect ed coral formations, or are determined  eligible for  the National Register of  Historic Places.  The legislation also requires the Sec retary  of  the  Interior  to  prepare  guidelines to assist States in develop ing  legislation  and  regulations  for  managing these shipwrecks. Specifical ly, these guidelines include the follow ing:  First, the enhancement of cultural  resources;  in  Second, the fostering of partnership  or  cooperation  among  sport divers,  fishermen, archeologists, and salvors;  Third, the facilitating of recreation al access; and  Fourth, the recognition of the inter est of those engaged in discovery and  salvage.  Finally,  the  legislation encourages  States to create underwater parks and  clarifies that funds from the historic  preservation  fund may  be  used  to  study, interpret, protect, and preserve  historic shipwrecks.  To reiterate, Mr. Chairman, the pri mary purpose of this legislation is for  the Federal Government to assert title  and transfer to the States the title to  certain abandoned shipwrecks which  are  found  in State waters only.  In  effect, Mr.  Chairman,  this would  remove certain shipwrecks which are  of historic and archeological signifi cance to the States from Federal admi ralty court jurisdiction and the ""law of  finds.""  I might add,  this does not  mean  that  the  historic  shipwrecks  could not be salvaged. It only means  that the State would clearly have title  to the shipwreck and would be in a po sition to ensure that any salvage oper ation was carried out properly. The  State would be able to ensure that the  plan for the recovery of the ships val uables include the careful documenta tion which goes along with preserving  the ships historical and archeological  values as a window into the past.  I would like to stress here that the  recovery of a ship's treasures, its cul tural and historical resources, is a one time opportunity-and  it  should be  done properly. I believe that this legis lation would assist the States in ensur ing that it is done properly.  In addition, Mr. Chairman, I would  like to respond to some of the points  which have been raised in opposition  to this legislation. First, this bill does  not deny access to shipwrecks for rec reational divers. In fact,  the bill en courages recreational access  to ship wrecks.  Second, this bill does not affect all  shipwrecks in territorial water as al leged by some of its opponents. It only  affects those classes of vessels which  are:  First,  embedded  in  submerged  lands of a State; second, embedded in coralline  formations protected by a  State on submerged lands; and third,  on submerged lands of a State and in cluded on  the National Register of  Historic Places. Given the States' in centive  to only  include those vessels  which are truly of historical and ar cheological significance, and given ac companying  report  language which  further clarifies the term ''embedded,''  it  is very clear  that  this  legislation  does not apply to all vessels in the ter ritorial sea.  Finally, opponents assert that this  bill is inconsistent with international  ",1988
633,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1988
634,656,5,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield to the gentleman from Minneso ta.  ",1988
635,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I think  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  raises some serious questions.  I appreciate the concern of the gen tleman from Pennsylvania about this.  The  fact  is,  as  he  indicated,  the  amendment had not been reviewed by  staff or by anyone else. The fact  is  that the gentleman's question is not  one that I am aware of that came up  in hearings.  The  concern  that he  raises with  regard to relationship  to other laws,  and this is section 7 in the bill that  deals with that, and clearly the intent  here is that in fact, of course, this act  should not change any of the laws of  the United States. Relating to ship wrecks, or those to which the act ap plies, my interpretation would be that  we would have the full ability to do  the drug enforcement activities,  the  Coast Guard or whoever else has re sponsibilities in those areas.  Furthermore,  if  the  gentleman  would continue to yield, we do not an ticipate the establishment of protected  zones. With regard to this, there are  no protected zones.  The law, of course, excludes where  there are Federal jurisdictions, where  there are maritime or maritime sanc tuaries, marine parks,  that are now  regulated.  I understand the problem  the gentleman anticipates.  Clearly  the nature of  the amend ment that he is offering is not appro priate but I  think the language ad dresses  the concern, and as  I men tioned  to  the gentleman,  the States  are a vital part of the law enforcement  activity, and surely their mere regula tion of a small number of shipwrecks  which  are  in  the State  submerged  lands would be one that would take  into consideration any type of problem  that would deal with this.  I would hope  that the gentleman,  with this clarification, might withdraw  his amendment. I would try to appeal  to the gentleman that it is not drawn  in such a way that it is artfully drawn,  and I think the question and the collo quy that perhaps we have had would  straighten out the problem.

636,656,5,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman,  let  me say  to  the gentleman  I  do not  think that we have addressed my con cern here with the problem.  I am sorry the gentleman does not  think  it  is  very  artfully  drawn.  I  thought it was very artfully drawn; it  was made germane to the bill, and it  was a work of art.  Let me say to  the gentleman that  when he refers to section 7 that this  amendment goes to as well, it does say  this act shall not change the laws of  the United States  relating  to  ship wrecks.  The laws I am concerned about here  have absolutely nothing  to do with  shipwrecks. They have to do with nar cotics trafficking. I want to make cer tain we do not have any kinds of prob lems with regard to narcotics.  ",1988
637,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, if the  gentleman would yield,  that is what  this  legislation  deals with  is  ship wrecks. We do not deal with any other  laws.  ",1988
638,656,5,Mr. WALKER.,"  I understand what  the gentleman is  telling me. What I  am saying to the gentleman is that he  now tells me that I have raised a legiti mate  concern. The gentleman  now  tells me I have raised a legitimate con cern and that he does not particularly  like the way that it is drafted. Never theless, it does speak to that concern.  It seems  to me  it makes very clear  what our intent is.  Our intent is  to make certain any  kind of protection provided  to these  shipwrecks does not, in fact, go to pro tection that would keep our drug en forcement people from being able to  get there to enforce the laws.  The amendment is  totally germane  to the bill. It seems to me it does speak  to a real problem, and I would hope  that  the amendment would  be  ap proved.  ",1988
639,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr.  Chairman,  this  amendment  really has nothing to do with the legis lation and the limitations before us in sofar as they would be a concern.  When the gentleman asked me the  question about shipwrecks and wheth er or not, in fact, States would have  the control over Federal agencies and  so forth, I was, of course, thinking in  the context of salvage or in the con text of basically historic preservation  as to what they would be doing.  As  far as  law enforcement, clearly  we have ample precedent of the Na tional Government,  the Federal  law  enforcement agencies working within  our national parks, working within our  national historic sites, and other his toric resources.  Insofar  as  this  problem were  to  exist, there is nothing created by this  legislation  that  the  gentleman  is  trying to remedy, a problem that has  not been addressed. The fact is that  most of these ships that are historic  not  address  I  does  ships have not been  trafficking  in  drugs. They  are  generally  over 50  years old, many of them, of course,  embedded in coral or in the bottom of  the ocean floor or in these State sub merged lands.  This  legislation  this.  ",1988
640,656,5,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1988
641,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  ",1988
642,656,5,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I want to make the point to the gen tleman from Minnesota that there is  nothing in my amendment that even  implies  that  the shipwrecks we are  talking about are shipwrecks of ships  trafficking in drugs. What I am saying  is that we are establishing protected  zones that could now be used to drop  drugs into only a couple of miles off  our shore and thereby have protected  zones in terms of enforcement.  ",1988
643,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, reclaim ing my time, I am relieved that the  gentleman from Pennsylvania realizes  these Spanish galleons are not  the  same as coming from South America  carrying an  illegal  substance.  I  am  glad the gentleman is aware of that.  ",1988
644,656,5,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1988
645,656,5,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  to the gentleman from South Caroli na.  ",1988
646,656,5,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Chairman, this  question is for the edification of the  Members who have not been here all  this afternoon.  Has it not been pretty well estab lished today that these amendments,  regardless of how fine or how pure the  motives of the membership proposing  them may be, will result in us having  no shipwreck bill  in the  lOOth Con gress?  ",1988
647,656,5,Mr. VENTO.,"  I  think  that  is very  probable  in  terms of  the Senate.  I  would  further point out  that while  drugs and drug enforcement is an im portant issue in our nation, that trying  to solve it on the basis of dealing with  sunken ships is hardly appropriate.  ",1988
648,656,5,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1988
649,656,5,Mr. VENTO., I yield  man from Florida.  ,1988
650,656,5,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would just like to point out the trepi dation and worry that the gentleman  from Pennsylvania raised had  to do  with wilderness areas where laws were  already  established  and  said what  could be done. What we are dealing  with here is dealing with something in  futuro. So I thank the gentleman for  raising the question, because no State  is going to have any regulation which  prohibits  law  enforcement  from  coming in there and protecting it, and  it is looking in futuro, the States will  to the gentle ",1988
651,786,5,Mr.  DE LUGO.," Mr. Speaker,  the  beautiful  island of St. Croix  in  the  U.S. Virgin Islands has just hosted its  first  annual  American  Paradise  Triathlon, and it was a great success.  Some of the world's very best athletes  came to St. Croix to swim, bicycle, and  run amid our magnificent scenery, and  the event will be shown on national  television on July 3.  This first  triathlon was a  triumph  for many people-the athletes,  the  people of St. Croix, the hundreds of  volunteers who helped, and, above all,  for  the  prime  organizer,  a  young  Virgin Islander by the name of Renny  Roker.  A year ago, when Renny began dis cussing his plans  for  a world-class  triathlon on our shores, he was greet ed with doubts and laughs. But Renny  was not daunted. He used his great tal ents and promotional skills to get the  cooperation of  the  community  and  pull of a major, international sporting  event. Now people can't wait to see it  again next year.  NBC was  so  impressed with  the  American Paradise Triathlon that it  moved up the broadcast date to July 3,  right  after  the Wimbledon Men's  Tennis Finals.  I urge everyone who  wants to see the Virgin Islands at its  best to tune in on July 3.  [From the Daily News, Apr. 12, 19881  A GLOWING TRIATHLON  St. Croix,  its people and visitors were  aglow Sunday, basking in the success of the  first America's Paradise Triathlon.  And what a success it was.  It pitted  the world's  top  triathletes  against one another on one of  the most  grueling courses in the world.  It brought  together  residents,  visitors,  athletes,  volunteers,  families,  spectators,  vendors,  the  curious,  the dedicated,  the  skeptical-thousands of people who wanted  simply to be part of a historic event.  It put St. Croix, and the Virgin Islands, on  the map as the site of a major, exciting,  well-organized, world-class sporting event.  We congratulate Renny Roker and his  team on a  job well done. We congratulate  Mike Pigg and Kirsten Hanssen-the win ning triathletes-on their victories. And we  congratulate everyone on St. Croix for pull ing  together  to make America's Paradise  Triathlon an event that has all of us bask ing in the glow.  [From the St. Croix Avis, Probe Magazine,  Apr. 11, 1988]  PERSON OF THE WEEK  A year ago when he spoke of a major na tionally  televised  sporting  event  in  the  Virgin Islands most people scoffed. Few be lieved he could pull it off.  But Renny Roker believed he could, and  yesterday he did. By all counts his Ameri ca's Paradise Triathlon was a stunning suc cess.  Just months ago the triathlon seemed in  jeopardy. Roker was unable  to  raise  the  money or lure the volunteers he needed to  swing the event.  With  the possiblity of  failure hovering  over the event Roker plowed ahead, taking  to the airwaves and print to bring money  and hands into the fold.  This was not the first major accomplish ment for the many-sided genius of Roker.  Since his teenage days he seemed marked  for fame.  While a teenager, he won local popularity  as  a  radio  personality. He would  later  appear in more  than 300  television shows  and 20 movies.  Not bad for a boy born thousands of miles  from the glitter of tinsel town.  But his accomplishments don't end there.  He has produced and directed 200 television  shows and produced three motion pictures.  Roker is also the only black event producer  to be listed in the top ten of billboard maga zine's top 100 event producers for five con secutive years.  In recent years Roker is best known for  his Through the Eyes of a Child television  specials. A dramatic series featuring  local  youths in shows meant to highlight V.I. cul ture and history.  But now it is perhaps the triathlon that  will linger in people's minds. Raker's bold  attempt to sell his island and his skills has  paid off.  In August, NBC Network will air Raker's  race as an hour special. It will be a wonder ful showpiece for the territory.  So once again Roker has lived up to his  promises, and the Virgin Islands  is better  off for it.  So we have chosen Renny Roker as our  Person of the Week. The brilliant actor has  demonstrated he has the ability to make his  dreams a reality.  0 1815  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE FOR  TOMORROW  <Mr. LOTT asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)

671,825,5,Mr. NOWAK.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to  bring  to my  col leagues' attention an essay that Deanna Lee  Dascomb, a student from Cheektowaga, NY,  in  the  33d Congressional District which  I  proudly represent, wrote for the annual voice  of democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest,  sponsored by  the Veterans of Foreign Wars  and its ladies auxiliary.  A senior at Maryvale High School, Ms. Das comb's essay was chosen from thousands of  other entrants to represent New York State in  a national competition. Her essay,  reprinted  here, entitled  ""America's Liberty-Our Herit age"" poignantly describes that essential qual ity that makes America truly a unique nation  and an inspiration to the world.  AMERICA'S LIBERTY-OUR HERITAGE  <By Deanna Lee Dascoinb)  Liberty. This one simple word takes on so  many different meanings. During the Revo lutionary War, people wanted  this more  than anything. Men fought for  it,  risked  their lives for it, and even died for it. Why  was  this so  iinportant  to not  just a  few  people, but an entire nation? To them, liber ty meant a personal freedom from tight re strictions  placed  upon  them  that were  beyond their control. It meant being able to  express  themselves  and  act  freely  upon  their emotions. It meant being an individual  and living life by their own standards and  not someone elses. Life can only be a mere  existence without  the  freedom  that our  country enjoys so much. The sense of liber ty was so enormous, that it spread to other  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  countries throughout the world. Thousands  of immigrants poured into America during  the 1800's and the earlier part of the 20th  century. They brought along with them a  desire  to  lead a better life and become a  better people. Why did they choose Amer ica? What drew  them  to our country,  in stead of some other land? Freedom is the  answer. Our  ancestors  that made  their  homes in America all came here for the end less benefits that freedom brings, and those  benefits have remained the same for today's  generation.  Each person has their own definition of  liberty, but  the major points will never  change. When I think of America, a number  of things come to mind; freedom, opportuni ty and a strong sense of individuality which  sets this country apart from the rest. Here  in our country, freedom serves as the build ing block in the construction of the entire  nation. Without freedom there would be no  intermingling of cultures or a variety of be liefs and values, because everyone would be  living under the same roof. There would be  no chance for opportunities because there  would always be a limit on social mobility.  Without opportunity, there couldn't possi bly be a growth of  individuality because  people would be looked upon as a whole.  This  is what America was  like before we  won our  independence and  this  is what  caused men to fight and die for the freedom  that meant more than life itself.  Walking hand-in-hand with liberty is op portunity. Behind this  lies a wide assort ment of choices which are open to anyone  who has an ambitious soul to choose. Pursu ing goals in America has one great reward,  and that's accomplishment.  There  are many  different  goals  that  people want to reach, and because the world  has so many careers and vocations to offer,  almost every skill has a use. Everyone who  enters this country has a chance to become  the creator of his or her destiny. Being able  to choose one's own lifestyle is a basic free dom everyone should have, but those who  weren't blessed with that, entered the doors  of America.  One of the finer aspects of a free nation is  the elasticity of opportunity.  Jobs don't  have to remain jobs forever, but can grow  into a career. Freedom also involves moving  up the ladder to a higher position if one de sires to do so. Not only does this raise the  standard of living, but it also brings along a  sense of pride and self worth. A perfect ex ample is the unknown cook hidden in the  back of a fast food restaurant. He may start  out working for minimum wage, but as years  go by, he may be the head chef in an elite  restaurant or the meal planner for a chain  of hotels. There will always be a thirst for  self improvement and a desire to live up to  one's  fullest  capability, but without  the  freedom of social mobility, this craving can  never be satisfied. In Ainerica, the only dry  souls are those who wish to stay that way.  Our ancestors were  in search of  this ad vancement, and it meant so much to them  that  they  left  their homes and  traveled  overseas to find it.  The key  to  advancement  is  education.  Moving up is made possible by the many fa cilities set up to increase learning. All over  the nation there are colleges and universi ties specially designed to serve the needs of  motivated students, wishing to make their  mark in the world. Without education, the  doors to many careers will remain locked.  Millions of people have taken advantage of  this  by making  an  investment  in  their  future. This could only happen in a nation  6801  that wants only the best for its people, and  with this sort of quality anyone would find  America a great place to live.  Because of  the  countless opportunities  available  to  us  and  the many different  people of all nationalities and character, our  country has become a land of wide diversity.  I like to think of America as being one giant  coloring book, and each person who is a part  of it is given a different color crayon. We all  shade in our part, and when it's done, the  result is one big beautiful picture of Amer ica. Each color has its own purpose, its own  value and its own significance. Without even  one color, the picture could not be complete.  This  is what American liberty stands for.  This  is what brought shiploads of people  into our harbors, and this is why we should  all value our freedom and honor our pride.  If our nation were to become anything less,  America could only be black and white.  LEADERSHIP  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 13, 1988  ",1988
672,825,5,Mr. HAMIL TON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington Report for Wednesday,  April  13,  1988  into  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD:  LEADERSHIP  Everywhere in southern Indiana, Hoosiers  talk to me about the need for good leader ship. Candidates for the presidency are also  talking about a leadership gap in Washing ton. Each candidate argues  that he can  supply something missing, and he defines  that absent quality as leadership. Yet for all  our talk about leadership, it seems to me  that we are never really sure what we mean  by leadership and what we are looking for  in our leaders. American voters seem to be  yearning  for  something we  cannot quite  define.  People ask me repeatedly why there does  not seem to be another Jefferson, another  Lincoln,  or  another Franklin Roosevelt  among the current presidential contenders.  The voters seem uneasy that no one seems  to have the formula for governing America  effectively. But it  is hard to define what  makes a great leader. It has been noted that  while  the  accomplished  general Ulysses  Grant made a not-so-great president, Lin coln, a man with a less distinguished record,  became a great president. Thinking back on  John Kennedy's 1960 campaign, I do not re member finding Indiana voters terribly ex cited by the man who would later become a  new American legend.  Although leadership qualities are desired  in our elected officials,  I  am always  im pressed by the ambivalent feeling of voters  toward most political  leaders. Americans  recognize  the necessity of political skills,  but they do not seem to put political leader ship high on their list of personal values. Al though political figures often dominate the  lists of the most admired people, few par ents come  to me and say that they want  their children or grandchildren to be politi cians. Even so,  they recognize that politi cians can have a great influence on their  daily lives-that their actions can help or  hurt people, or can contribute or fail to con tribute to social progress.  There are many  leadership qualities  re vered  by Americans:  experience,  intelli",1988
673,838,5,Mr.  MOLINARI.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley  is  to be commended for the forceful  initiative his Department is taking in  investigating the management and fi nancial fitness of the Texas Air Corp.  to fly commercial air passengers.  The  fact  that yesterday  the FAA  also  announced a  proposed  fine of  close to $1 million against Eastern Air  Lines for safety violations on top of  the $9.5 million it previously received  clearly demonstrates  the need for a  special investigation of Texas Air.  We have seen a continuing pattern  of problems at both Eastern Air Lines  and Continental Airlines, both owned  by Texas Air. It is disturbing that in  1984 the NATI inspection program re ported Eastern Air Lines' very poor  safety record. Now, 4 years later, East ern's record is still poor.  Ten months  ago  I wrote  to Mr.  Burnley's predecessor and asked for a  white gloves or thorough inspection of  Eastern's fleet. No action was  taken  then, but I am pleased to see the spot light of Federal scrutiny being focused  on Texas Air at this time.  Through his announcement yester day, Secretary Burnley is sending the  right message  to Texas Air manage ment and to the management of all  commercial air carriers. This is abso lutely essential to ensuring air safety,  and the Secretary has made an impor tant move in that direction.  PROPOSED STATUTE OF LIMITA TIONS ON  SOCIAL  SECURITY  OVERPAYMENT COLLECTIONS  (Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1988
674,838,5,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am  introducing  legislation  to assure  that our senior citizens shall not be  forced to pay for the errors that are  made by the Social Security Adminis tration.  This problem was brought to my at tention by a constituent, Effie Ander son, 71 years old, of Lyons, OR. She  received  a  threatening  letter  from  Social Security and had considerable  problems over a number of months  with the agency regarding an overpay ment she ostensibly received in 1969.  Ms. Anderson  contends  that  she  repaid the agency at that time, but  her bank has not retained records over  those 17 years, nor did she, nor do, I  imagine, any Member of this body or  most average citizens retain their fi nancial records over a 1 7 -year period.  My bill would limit Social Security's  notification and collection of overpay ments to a 1-year period so that we  will not put our seniors at this tremen dous disadvantage in their later years.  Social Security with its budget and  computer system ought to be able to  identify and collect from constituents  in that 1-year period, and I believe this  would be a  reasonable modification  and restraint on their powers.  HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF  KOPPERS CORP.  <Mr. RIDGE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1988
675,838,5,Mr. RIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I have in troduced legislation that, in my view,  is essential  to the continued sepera tion of banking and commerce, essen tial to the protection of federally in sured deposits.  This  legislation certainly addresses  an  ongoing  and  questionably  legal  takeover  of  the Koppers Corp.  of  Pittsburgh. But for my colleagues that  are being visited by the army of lobby ists  for  Shearson-Lehman-Hutton American Express and foreign banking  firms, you should understand that this  takeover has implications far beyond  the  immediate  hostile  takeover  of  Koppers.  For the first time, an enormous di versified  financial  services  firm  in tends to use  its resources, which in clude the resources of America's 20th  largest bank, for the purpose of taking  an equity position in a corporate take over of a industrial firm. If Shearson  can carve  itself out this new, prece dent-setting innovative role in the cor porate takeover business, the takeover  of Koppers is only the beginning. No  domestic bank or bank holding compa ny could undertake this role because  American  laws protect  federally  in sured deposits from this risk.  Second, this takeover has a foreign  bank holding company, National West minster Bank,  engaged  in  activities  that the U.S. bank holding companies  cannot undertake.  Mr. Speaker, this takeover involves  risk for federally insured deposits, in volves a foreign bank effort to disman tle a U.S. company with the assistance  of Wall Street and foreign financiers.  The takeover reeks from lack of con cern for Koopers employees, communi ties,  and  long-term  investors. Pitts burgh  today,  and  your  community  may be the target tomorrow.  TRADE BILL VETO THREATENED  <Mr. OBEY asked and was given per mission  to address  the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1988
676,838,5,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, the news papers have carried headlines indicat ing that the White House is threaten ing to veto the trade bill unless the  Congress drops  from  that trade bill  provisions giving the public the right  to know exactly how much foreigners  are investing in this country and also  that we drop the provision which gives  workers the right to know when plant  owners are going to pull the plug on  them and leave town.  I simply want to say I think it is out rageous for the White House to expect  us to vote on a  trade bill which re quires the dropping of either of those  items. This is a pure and simple ques tion of right to know.  The American people have the right  to know who is investing in America,  and American workers have a right to  know who is going to pull the plug on  their futures, and I would urge  the  conferees not to knuckle under, and I  would dare the White House to veto a  bill on the grounds that those two pro visions  were  contained  therein.  I  would  love  to see  the White House  have  to  explain  to  the American  people why they insisted to take out  those  two  provisions  before  they  would support a trade bill.

680,851,5,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr.  President,  I  think what  the Senator  from Con necticut asks would kill the SSC.  What you have seen with respect to  NIH  is a situation where we are  in creasing that agency by some $600 mil lion this year. I am a strong supporter  of NIH.  I  fought  for  the cause of  infant mortality. I am the author of  the catastrophic  illness bill now  in  conference. I appreciate and support  those concerns.  Let me tell you what has happened  to research in this country. In 1979,  foreigners got 36 percent of the pat ents issued in the United States. Last  year,  they got 47 percent.  In 1986,  General Electric, which had led in get ting  patents  in  this  country, was  bumped to No. 2, because Atachi came  in and became No. 1. Last year, G.E.  bumped down to No. 4 because Atachi,  Canon, and Toshiba had taken over.  We had better pay some attention to  research in this country. We have to  recapture our leadership.  The Senator  from Connecticut  is  talking about NIH and he is  talking  about health, and I share his concerns.  But where do you think the CAT scan ner came from? It came from linear  accelerator research.  The country that gets the SSC will  be host scientists and students from  around the world. You get the cross pollinization of  ideas  as  they come  here, if we have the SSC.  Not kill the program? I think there  is a very high risk that the amend ment will. The decision on the site of  the SSC is being made in November; it  will be confirmed in January. That is  near the beginning of the fiscal year,  so the money can be used for the con struction during the rest of the fiscal  year. If you let today's enthusiasm for  the SSC wane, you will have a very  difficult time reviving this project.  My own State, mired in the toughest  economic circumstances I have seen in  my  lifetime, has agreed  to  tax  its  people to the extent of $1 billion so  that they can be a part of this process.  Texas agreed to do this because we be lieve there will be great spinoffs in the  way of research for this country.  I do not think any of us can calcu late the ultimate rewards of research,  but we know they are there. Take a  look at the situation with respect to  the GNP in our country today. One third of the GNP in our country today  comes from the beakthroughs in un derstanding the atom. So it is terribly  important, I  think, that we build the  SSC here.  Earlier work with the linear acceler ator led to things  like high-powered  oscillator tubes for broadcasting. You  have a whole  list of breakthroughs  that have been made through linear  accelerator research. The SSC is  the  same. What it does is that it says to  the scientists of this country that they  will be able to better understand the  constituents that make up atomic par ticles. This basic science will not be  done if the SSC is not built.  We made. room for  the  things we  think are critical in this budget. We  have done it for national defense, and  for basic human needs, even though  we understand that budgets are tight.  But we should provide the means to do  the  basic  scientific work  that will  propel this country into the next cen tury. That  leadership  is essential  to  our economic growth, our  industrial  competitiveness, and our Nation's se curity. That is why we need the SSC.  ",1988

688,851,5,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I rise in  opposition to this amendment, and I  do not do so because I disagree with  what the Senator from Connecticut is  trying to accomplish. The money he  seeks is for a very worthwhile purpose,  and I do not disagree with that.  However,  in this budget resolution,  we must take from one place to give to  another. I have been extremely con cerned about space and science and  technology, known as  function  250.  While the case is being made that this  does not come out of anything but the  super collider, there is a certain fiction  we all accept when we debate a budget  resolution. This fiction is that we here  are taking specific amounts on a line  item basis, that we are taking the in crease from a particular area-in this  case, the super collider-and putting it  into a different function. That simply  is not the case.  In budget resolutions, we deal with  general categories, and we are not able  to talk about specific line items. The  only place that can be done is in the  Appropriations Committee, on 302<b>  allocations. But it  is meaningless  to  designate in this particular resolution  that it will come out of a particular  function. It will reduce the 250 func tion; and when we get to the Appro priations Committee and start with  our 302(b) allocations,  it could come  out of many different areas. It could  the National Science  come  out  of  Foundation.  It could come out of the space shut tle. It could come out of the space sta tion.  So I hope my colleagues understand  that fiction, that on this budget reso lution it is not coming out of a particu lar function.  That is what I want to address my  remarks to,  the whole area of space,  science, and technology.  Mr. President, in this second session  of the  lOOth Congress we confront a  profound decision point for our Na tion's Space and Science Program. Dr.  James  Fletcher,  Administrator  of  NASA has called it a ""make or break  year"" for our civilian space program  and Mr. Erich Block, Director of the  National  Science  Foundation  has  called for the enactment of the Presi dent's budget request to ""address the  dangerous erosion of the U.S. position  in research competitiveness.''  In the abstract, it is difficult to get  excited over  these pronouncements.  We  in Washington  are  constantly  hearing such dire and ominous rheto ric. Unfortunatley, Mr. President,  I  fear that calling ""wolf"" this year may  be appropriate. Indeed, it is the most  accurate description of the threat cur rently confronting our civil space pro gram and of our scientific and techno logical position in the world.  This most striking and  immediate  issue is the budgetary requirements of  our Nation's Space and Science Pro gram. For NASA, the President has re quested  a  30-percent  increase  in  budget authority. For  the NSF1  re search budget,  the administration  is  seeking an increase of over 20 percent.  These increases, although amply justi fied by both program  requirements  and by the critical need to renew and  improve our Nation's efforts in space  and science, are virtually impossible to  achieve unless the Congress, and the  American people, understand the criti cal values of these programs.  Mr.  President,  I  am  very much  aware  that there  is a vast array of  unmet current human needs which  compete for a larger share of the Fed eral budget, and too many people erro neously view  the space and science  programs as an expensive luxury.  But if our Nation is to continue to  prosper-and to afford to reach out to  the poor and needy, it must maintain  its competitive position in the world.  We must  invest  in programs which  provide for the future-or we will all  be poor and needy.  Therefore, it is imperative that the  importance that our space and science  program be made clear as we consider  this budget resolution. Recently, the  Senate ratified the Montreal Protocol  on Substances that Deplete the Ozone  Layer. Despite  its  limitations,  the  Montreal protocol is the most signifi",1988
689,864,5,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  before  I  yield  the  floor  to my col league and friend from Texas, Senator  GRAMM, I want to explain briefly how  we are going to pay for it.  The amount of money is not great:  $100 million next year; $200 million in  the year following,  if you believe the  static analysis. We base  this on the  Treasury Department's estimate that  it would cost $600 million over 6 years.  Experience  has  shown,  however,  that every time we have increased the  capital gains rate, revenues have de clined. When we have cut the capital  gains rates, revenues have  increased.  However,  under  the  formula which  binds us and which we are obligated to  adhere to in this proceeding, $600 mil lion is a reasonable estimate of the 6year cost of this matter. So we have  projected $100 million the first year  and a $200 million the second year.  We pay for it, in effect, in a rather  unusual way because ordinarily outlay  amendments are paid  for by  reduc tions in outlays, and tax amendments  are paid for by tax changes. In this  case, however, we are suggesting to ac commodate this small change in the  revenue base by reducing spending ac cordingly in function 450. That would  be up to individual Senators where in  function 450 they wanted to save this  $100 million, but $100 million would be  only 3 percent of the CDBG grants.  That  is  one place where we  could  make the savings.  It would be possible to make the sav ings without  touching CBDG,  if we  wanted to take it out of UDAG, EDA,  and the Appalachian Regional Com mission. There  is  an argument  for  taking it out of any of these or all  three of these.  The Appalachian Commission has,  frankly, fulfilled its purpose, at least  in  large measure.  Incomes  in Appa lachia have risen close to national av erage. One argument would be it has  done its job.  You can certainly argue UDAG has  been proven to be wasteful and used  for a  lot of  things  that perhaps  it  should not be used for. It was nearly  abolished by a vote of the Senate. We  did not quite come up with the votes  to abolish UDAG, although the Presi dent recommends we do so.  You do not have to abolish UDAG or  EDA,  frankly,  but  just make  fine tuning adjustments in function 450 to  pay for this.  That is the theory of it. That is how  we pay for it. It is an amendment that  has been endorsed by practically every  business group or taxpayer group  in  the country at one time or another. It  enjoys at least the conceptual support  of the administration. In principle, it  has been previously approved by the  Senate, although I grant you not in  the last couple of years. It has at some  times in the past been endorsed by the  House of Representatives. It is a good  idea, and I hope the amendment will  be adopted.  Mr. President, how much time do I  have remaining?

692,864,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.  ,1988
693,864,5,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I thank  the distinguished Senator from Colo rado for yielding. He has done such an  excellent  job explaining this amend ment that I can add only a brief 5minute addition to his remarks since I  think the issue is very clear.  I often wonder, as we debate  the  budget, if it is clearly understood on  Main Street America that we spend all  this time simply talking about how we  are going to divide up the cake that we  took out of the bakery of the working  men and women of America to give to  all  the people  riding  in  the wagon.  That is what this whole budget debate  is about.  I think it is very interesting that this  year in the budget for the whole Fed eral Government, $1.1  trillion,  there  was not one single program that we  proposed to eliminate. In the entire  budget there is not one single major  priority we wanted to reorder. Of all  the programs we  funded  last year,  there was not one we have decided not  to have this year.  What is clearly happening is that all  the special interest groups are looking  over our right shoulder, sending let ters back home  telling people which  Members care about the poor, the old,  the sick, the tired, the bicycle rider and the  list goes on and on. These  groups are the reason why we are not  terminating a single program in the  budget.  Now, the distinguished Senator from  Colorado has offered an amendment  that does something not for all  the  people riding in the wagon, complain ing they are not getting enough, com plaining the people pulling the wagon  are not pulling it hard enough; he is  doing something for the people who  do the work, pay the taxes, pull the  wagon, and pay all of these bills that  we run up here in the Senate and in  our sister body across  the way,  the  House. His  amendment  is  a  very  simple amendment.  It says  that we  have a  lot of programs  that, quite  frankly,  few  people  think  are  any  good. In these programs we are spend ing money subsidizing private activi ties that are already profitable, build ing great hotels and other activities  that are not worthy of the taxpayers'  money. The Senator from Colorado is  saying that we should not spend so  much money there, instead let us let  our grandparents who are about to sell  their house adjust the value of that  house for inflation so they have more  money to take into retirement.  Basically, that is the issue. If your  mother went out and bought a house  in 1954 and paid $11,000 for it and she  sells it next week for $81,000, she has  to pay a capital gains tax on $70,000.  The problem  is  that she cannot re place that house for $11/lOO. She is  paying taxes on inflation, and that is  not right. What the Senator from Col orado says  to your mother and my  mother  is,  ""Look,  take  you spent 30 years ago, adjust it for  the inflation rate, and then pay taxes  on what has happened  to  the  real  value of that house.""  Now,  I  a8k my colleagues,  is  that  more worthy  than UDAG,  is  that  more worthy than EDA, the Economic  Development Agency, with  all  the  great and wonderful works that have  that $11,000  ",1988

697,916,5,Mr. PELL., I yield 5 minutes to the  Senator from Massachusetts.  ,1988
698,916,5,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I will  not take 5 minutes.  I just want to clarify a couple points  that have arisen in the course of the  most recent moments of the debate.  First of all, I really want to make it  clear to my colleagues that this is not  lashing out. This is not an effort to be  tough. It is not an unreasonable spur of-the-moment, moment-of-the-month  respose  to  the headlines of  recent  days.  I was a cosponsor of this amendment  last year,  and  I  thank  the distin guished ranking member of the For eign Relations Committee  for  once  again joining as a cosponsor this year.  We had a  standard by which  to  measure  last year. This  is  the same  debate we had last year. Not too many  words have changed except  that we  have a new report that measures the  language of cooperation.  Mr. President,  I heard  the distin guished Senator from Connecticut say:  ""Why aren't we talking about all these  other countries?"" Well, Mr. President,  we did look at all those other countries. We made the judgment that Co lombia extradited Carlos Lehder, had  its Minister of Justice assassinated, its  Attorney General assassinated, half of  its  supreme court assassinated,  and  was still taking risks in trying to fulfill  the limits of  its ability. We made a  judgment about the other countries.  But the fact  is  that the State De partment report says 50 to 60 percent  of all the marijuana and cocaine that  enters  the  United  States  comes  through  the Bahamas and 30  to 35  percent of all the marijuana and co caine  entering  the United  States  comes through Mexico.  So, Mr. President,  if you  take  the  low end of the estimate, we are dealing  with 80 percent of the drugs that come  into the United States. And if you take  the high end of the estimate, we are  dealing with 95 percent of the drugs  that  come  into  the United States  through  these  two  countries  alone.  That is not lashing out. That is not  unreasonable. And  it is fair that we  make  the  tough  judgment about 95  percent of the drugs coming into the  United States of America.  Mr. President, the State Department  report used words  like: ""much more  needs to be done""; ""no court proceed ings  to date""; ""the government does  not vigorously enforce""; ""the lack of  meaningful enforcement""; ""they have  yet  to  demonstrate  the  necessary  will""; ""the Nigel Bough proceedings  continue.""  This is not just one issue. It is not  just one item of noncooperation. It is a  pattern.  Now,  I  respect the letter from the  President of the United States, but it  was very carefully crafted. The letter  said seizures are up and it said oper ational  cooperation  is  good.  That  means the Coast Guard gets what it  wants.  Let me read to you from a New York  Times February article. This is the tes timony of David Westrate, Assistant  Administrator for Operations at the  DEA. He said:  The Drug Enforcement Administration  has often been willing to overlook allega tions of official corruption to insure contin ued cooperation with  its operations. Mr.  Westrate compared the level of cooperation  in the Bahamas to that of the drug agency  received from General Noriega. He said the  agency  has  ""never made  a  request  in  Panama that hasn't been honored.""  If that does not tell the story about  all this operational claptrap and about  seizures.  Do you know what they do? We had  a wonderful bit of testimony from two  different witnesses,  both  of whom  made a  living  smuggling drugs and  now they are spending, between them,  about 63 years in  jail. Do you know  what they said? That the Government  of Mexico seized some ships, counted  it as a seizure, and escorted them to  the other side of the gulf and let them  go. That is a seizure.  Do you know what happens to the  drugs when  they  seize  them? The  police go out and sell them later. And  we have had testimony of how one of  the defendants even made a deal to  get  away by giving  the police  the  drugs and they let him fly off into the  sunset, Mr. President.  If we cannot make it a tougher judg ment about seizures and operational  cooperation,  if General Noriega has  not taught us a lesson, I am not sure  what is going on.  The law is clear. The law sets stand ards.  The  question  here  today  is  whether the U.S. Senate is going to  uphold its own laws or whether we are  going to make a mockery of this proc ess.  I yield back my time.

702,916,5,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, this is a  very tough question before us today.  Should we reject the President's cer tification  that  the Governments of  Mexico and the Bahamas are cooper ating fully in controlling narcotics.  In other words, should we deny fur ther U.S. assistance to our neighbors  to the south.  In 1986, the Congress passed a major  new drug  law <Public Law  which included a get-tough policy on  international narcotics control. Specif ically,  the new  law dictated that 50  percent of U.S. aid be delayed to those  countries on the drug-producing and  drug-transit list until they can show  the United States that they have coop erated fully in reducing drug produc tion and/ or transshipment in their re spective countries. Once such coun tries  have  cooperated,  the United  States will grant  them certification  which qualifies  them  for  the other  half of their intended foreign aid.  The rationale for such action and  the intent were admirable. However,  considerable  confusion  has  arisen  around the phrase ""cooperated fully.""  Other than stating that such coopera tion can be with the United States or  on its own,  the law does not specify  what is meant by ""cooperated fully.""  I believe that such ambiguity was a  great weakness in this law. The certifi cation process this year and last year  clearly demonstrates  that weakness.  In my opinion, many countries have  been granted certification for U.S. aid  which never came close  to anything  resembling full cooperation.  Last year the Congress approved my  amendment to the continuing resolu tion <H.J. Res. 395) which provides a  platform to strengthen the new certifi cation process.  ",1988

705,942,5,Mr. HELMS., I yield 5 minutes to the  Senator.  ,1988
706,942,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from New York is recognized  for 5 minutes.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, it was  not too long ago that this Senator cast  a vote, and that vote was cast with  regard to the same law-a law, by the  way,  that was  passed 2 years  ago,  before congressional elections, 1986.  People  became  concerned  about  drugs.  In  that  concern,  Congress  passed unanimously Public Law 99570, which basically said  that those  countries  that produce  and  transit  narcotics will be certified only if they  have cooperated fully with the United  States, and that may pose some diffi culty-cooperating  fully-or  taken  adequate steps on their own to control  narcotics production,  trafficking, and  money laundering.  So it is not just cooperating fully. It  is ""or taken adequate steps on their  own.""  It was on that basis that this Sena tor cast a vote, and it was a trouble some one, as it related to whether or  not we should certify the Bahamas as  taking those adequate steps in relation  to drug  trafficking and money  laun dering. In my opinion, that is open to  reasonable  doubt. But  I  think we  should at least give them that oppor tunity, because, as it relates to drug  trafficking, they have undertaken cer tain  cooperation with  the United  States that allows hot pursuit by our  airplanes-hot pursuit as it relates to  those who come over the waters, and  in relation to the Coast Guard. Those  cooperative efforts have been under taken.  Let us look at Mexico. We debated  this last year. We said let us give them  an opportunity. My colleagues voted  for certification, giving  them ample  warning.  What about hot pursuit? Do  they  allow our Air Force, our Navy, or our  Coast Guard,  to pursue  those drug  smugglers? The answer is no.  What about money laundering? Do  they allow us access, cooperatively, as  it  relates  to  the money  launderers,  who  launder  billions  of  dollars  through their banks? And the answer  is no.  So much for this oversimplistic pap  about what  is  full cooperation. Not  only have we not gotten full coopera tion, but  there are not being  taken  adequate steps.  What about the killing of U.S. citi zens  who  are  drug  enforcement  agents? What about those who were  charged with that killing only because  of incredible pressure upon the coun try of Mexico by this Nation and by an  outraged public and by one commis sioner who had the guts to stand up  and do something-Willie von Raab?  Caro Quintero  lives  in  luxury with  women, drugs and everything supplied  to him, and that is supposed to be ade quate prosecution. And we talk about  a war on drugs.  We ought  to be ashamed of our selves. And it is also oversimplistic to  say that if we decertify Mexico that it  ends, that we won the war.  What kind of commitment can we  tell the people of this country that we  are willing to undertake if we are not  willing to stand up and to say that, in  Mexico, there is not even the slightest  cooperation?  Are we worried about the  interna tional  bankers? What  is  going  to  happen? They may be off ended. It is  about time we told them they should  be offended, because we are offended  by the ravaging of our cities and com munities and the killing of our chil dren.  A month ago, I went to the funeral  of Ed Byrne, 22 years old. Sitting in  his patrol car at 3:30 in the morning,  he was  executed-executed  by  the  drug lords who said, ""Go out and get a  policeman.''  Mr. President, Eddie Byrne's father  made an appeal. Let me tell you what  he said. It is tough language for this  Chamber. It is part of what is taking  place in America. We have to start the  battle here at home and abroad and  let people know we are serious. That is  what this is about. It is not about the  State Department doing business as  usual. It's about maybe rattling some  cages.  Here  is what Matt Byrne said,  a  former police officer himself, retired,  the father of that 22-year-old boy. He  said, ""If a police officer can be wasted  by scum, then none of us is safe, and I  do not care where you live.""  He said something else. I think that  we  should  take cognizance. He said,  ""Don't let my son's death be in vain.""  Let us make this appeal a  turning  point, not only as it relates to this res olution, but to a commitment that will  galvanize us to work together, Repub licans, Democrats,  liberals,  conserv atives. Only our total commitment will  bring about a meaningful crusade to  ",1988
707,968,5,Mr.  SASSER.," Mr. President, I  rise  as a cosponsor of the legislation being  introduced today by my distinguished  colleague, Senator HEINZ of Pennsyl vania. The issue, and indeed the legis lation that Senator HEINZ is introduc ing,  is  timely. We have pending  in  Congress major legislation governing  both the role of banks in the securities  business, and corporate takeovers gen erally. Senator HEINZ' proposal is ap propriate for  incorporation  in either  bill.  The legislation addresses a situation  where an investment bank has made  an unprecedented equity interest in a  highly leveraged hostile takeover-in  effect  acted  as  a  corporate  raider,  rather than an offeror of investment  advice. Most importantly, this invest ment bank has done this at the same  time it is in the highly unusual posi tion of owning the 20th largest f eder ally insured bank in the United States.  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say  that  the  banking  industry  in  this  country  traditionally has followed a  philosophy of conservatism and avoid ance of risk. When it has strayed from  this course it has gotten into trouble.  Thus, when the owner of a bank, for  whom the Federal Government is pro viding  insurance,  takes an enormous  equity interest in a highly leveraged  hostile acquisition, I  think it is  time  for us  to pause and  reexamine  the  laws that permit this to occur.  The separation of banking and com merce has been a basic tenent of bank ing law in America for generations. It  is good public policy. The separation  of banking and commerce is a check  against conflicts of interest. It protects  federally  insured deposits  from  risk,  and  it prevents  these deposits  from  subsidizing nonbanking activities.  Mr.  President,  so-called  nonbank  banks are somewhat of an enigma in  this  scheme.  In  last year's banking  bill, we grandfathered over 100 such  banks to be owned by diversified com panies. I supported this legislation and  still do. However, we did not foresee a  situation where  a  federally  insured  nonbank bank would be a very, very  large part of a company's operation, at  the same time the company engaged  in corporate funding.  Thus, Senator HEINZ'S bill has much  merit. Quite simply, it says that when  a bank comprises over 10 percent of a  financial services company's business,  that company cannot make an equity  investment in a nonfinancial services  firm of greater than 5 percent. Indeed,  the proposal parallels just one of the  many restrictions on traditional bank  holding companies-the provision of  the Bank Holding Company Act that  limits equity investments in nonbank ing activities to 5 percent.  Mr. President,  it's often said  that  banks occupy a  special place  in our  economic system. We confer certain  advantages on both banks and their  owners and in return expect them to  fullfill certain obligations.  I  respect fully submit that corporate raiding is  not one of these obligations.  In closing, I want to note that the  Koppers Co.,  that has unfortunately  become a takeover target recently, has  been an outstanding public citizen of  my home State for over 50 years. Its  forest products division services some  400 sawmills statewide, and its Stone  Man Construction operation is an im portant part of  the east Tennessee  economy.e  By Mr. LEVIN:  S. 2289. A bill to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986  to restore the  deduction for two-earner married cou ples, to provide for maximum individ ual tax rate of 38.5 percent, to elimi nate  the personal exemption phase out,  to insure a maximum individual  long-term capital gains rate of 28 per cent, to provide income averaging for  farmers, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Finance.  TAX REFORM REFORM ACT   ",1988
708,968,5,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, 2 years  ago, I voted against the Tax Reform  Act of 1986 because, among other rea sons, I believed that it would result in  a tax increase for millions of middle and low-income taxpayers and because  it did nothing to reduce  the deficit,  and, in fact, would make it harder to  deal with  this  dominant  problem  facing our Nation.  Last  year,  I  introduced  the Tax  Reform Reform Act of 1987, S. 670,  which was designed to remedy some of  the most glaring problems with  the  1986 act. S. 670 provided for a maxi mum individual tax rate of 35 percent,  a partial restoration of the two-wage earner deduction, and a restoration of  income averaging for farmers. The net  effect of  this legislation would have  been to decrease the deficit by $12 bil lion over 3 years,  reduce  taxes  for  more than 20 million taxpayers and in crease  taxes on  the 600,000 highest  income taxpayers.  This year,  in  spite of  the White  House-congressional budget agreement  enacted in December 1987, we are con fronted with a deficit mired  in  the  $160 to $170 billion range. At the same  time, an increasing number of taxpay ers-particularly two-wage-earner cou ples-are becoming  aware  that  the  Tax Reform Act of 1986 meant a tax  increase for  them, at the same time  that it has meant very large tax cuts  for most of the highest income  tax payers in the country.  It is this need for greater deficit re duction and for greater equity in the  Tax Code for average taxpayers that  has led me to introduce today the Tax  Reform Reform Act of 1988. This leg islation, which would  take effect  in  1989, follows the basic outlines of the  bill I introduced last year. However, in  order to generate greater revenue to  reduce the deficit further and to pro vide for more middle-income tax relief,  this legislation sets the maximum indi vidual income tax rate at 38.5 percent,  the same maximum rate that was in  effect in 1987, for married taxpayers  filing  joint returns with  taxable  in comes of $155,000 and for single tax payers  with  taxable  incomes  of  $93,350.  Information  from  the Con gressional Budget Office suggests that  this proposal would only affect  less  than 1 percent of the total number of  taxpayers. Under current law, the tax  rate for these taxpayers has dropped  to 28 percent. The legislation that I  am introducing would retain this 28percent rate for capital gains income.  In addition, the legislation I am in troducing today would reduce the mar riage penalty tax by re-establishing a  two-wage earner deduction to a maxi mum of $1,000. It would be calculated  by allowing for a deduction of 5 per cent of  the  lesser earning  spouse's  income up to an income of $20,000. As  such, this provision calls for a larger  deduction  than did  the bill I  intro duced last year, but not as large as the  deduction of $3,000 that was available  to  two-wage earner couples prior  to  the passage of tax reform in 1986. Re storing the full  two-wage earner de duction is an admirable goal, but the  reality of the budget deficit and the  need to do something about it forces  us to look to a more limited approach.  Nevertheless, this provision would still  reduce taxes for over 20 million tax payers.  Furthermore, this legislation would  restore income averaging for farmers.  Even the version of the Tax Reform  Act of 1986 which passed the Senate  included  income averaging for  farm ers. However,  it was dropped in the  conference with the House of Repre sentatives.  I believe  that  it  is once  again important  to  try to make  the  option of income averaging for farm ers available  to  them as  the  farm  sector struggles for economic recovery.  Finally, even after the partial resto ration of the two-wage earner deduc tion and income averaging, the legisla tion I am introducing today would still  allow for substantial deficit reduction.  According to the Joint Committee on  Taxation,  restoring  the 38.5 percent  bracket these highest income taxpay ers would  increase  revenues by $6. 7  billion in fiscal year 1989, $13.3 billion  ",1988
709,981,5,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  wish to call my colleagues' attention  to an excellent article by Tom Clancy  entitled ""America's Favorite Whipping  Boys."" Like me, many of my  col leagues may  have  read  some  of  Clancy's books, such as ""Hunt for Red  October""  and  ""Red Storm Rising.""  They are outstanding.  So is this article. It points out that  the success or failure of a country's de fense depends most upon its soldiers  and  sailors, who need  support and  proper training. As he shows, the men  and women who serve in our Armed  Forces have  taken a  few bum  raps  through the years, and they haven't  always  gotten  the  credit  they  de served. I think his article expands the  reader's understanding and apprecia tion for our Armed Forces.  Maybe  I  like  it so well because  I  have never been part of the Blame  America First crowd. How could I be,  after walking down the gangplank of  the S.S. Majestic on December  23,  1935, finding refuge with my mother  and father  in a  country which has  since allowed me such success?  Defense spending is never popular,  and yet is as necessary as the lock on  the door or  the policeman  the  street. As my colleagues know, most of  the defense budget  is not spent on  heavy strategic systems, but on sala ries and support for the people in our  Armed Forces.

710,994,5,Mr. BRYANT.," Mr. Speaker, Bob Bullock,  Texas' Comptroller of Public Accounts for the  past 13 years, has been a fixture in the public  life of Texas for more than three decades and  is,  in his own  inimitable way, a symbol of  Texas.  He's left his indelible mark along the way as a member of the Texas House of Repre sentatives, as an assistant attorney general,  as a lobbyist, as legal counsel to a Governor,  as secretary of state and chief elections offi cer, and as comptroller.  As comptroller, the State's tax collector, he  breathed  life  into  an  archaic bureaucracy,  making  it  the model  of modern  efficiency  other State agencies and other States emulat ed.  Bob Bullock is a tough task-master. He de mands the utmost of friends and employees.  He's creative and  innovative and expects no  April 14, 1988  less of others than the best they can produce.  He  is  loved and  feared, but mostly admired  and respected.  A recent profile  in Texas Business maga zine, which I share with my colleagues, paints  an excellent portrait of Bob Bullock, the man  and the public servant. Bob Bullock clearly is  a unique individual and a credit to the State of  Texas.  [FROM THE TEXAS BUSINESS MAGAZINE, APRIL  1988]  Calling the Shots  <By Michele Kay)  Bob Bullock sits back  in a comfortable  chair in his office, stretches his legs, and  turns on his special brand of down-to-earth  Texas charm. ""There's an attitude problem  in Texas,""  says  the state comptroller of  public accounts. ""People are skeptical that  we've turned the corner when, in fact, we  are pulling out of the recession. The trouble  is  that when I was warning Texans  that  things were getting worse, they'd accuse me  of playing politics. Now  that  I'm telling  them the economy is finally improving, they  don't believe me.""  Bullock  shrugs  and  smiles.  Texas  is  headed for brighter days, and so is he. He  feels he's long overdue. After  struggling  first  through personal problems, followed  by state budgetary crises and tough political  decisions, things are going his way.  For a start, Bullock has at least shed his  role as the perennial bearer of bad news.  The economy is on the mend, he says, and  good tidings are in the offing. When Bullock  goes bef01 e the Legislature next year with  his biennial revenue forecast, chances are  his numbers will be cheered. He's confident  the picture he paints in 1989 will not inspire  the same budget impasse Texas witnessed in  1987.  At the same time, Bullock is getting satis faction from the new attention being paid  to the state's system of taxation. In recent  sessions, he went blue in the face trying to  convince  the Legislature  that Texas was  badly in need of tax reform. His plea for  long  fell on deaf ears, but  finally  crisis  proved him right. Last year the Legislature  appointed a landmark tax equity committee,  inviting Bullock to participate as an ex-offi cio member. He's refrained from saying, ""I  told you so"" or ""It's about time."" Bullock  also has refused to predict the committee's  eventual recommendations. Whether or not  he agrees with  the final outcome of  the  committee's work is not the issue; the very  fact that the state's tax system is being de bated is a victory for Bullock. ""What we  have  right now  isn't a patchwork.  It's a  quilt,"" he complains.  Bullock now faces a new challenge. After  13 years as state comptroller, he's making a  run for the job of lieutenant governor. Al though elections are more than two years  away, Bullock is already campaigning with  the same  intensity he brings  to bear on  every task. ""I haven't found any opposition  to my candidacy,"" he says firmly.  Equally important, he seems to have dis carded much of the personal baggage that  once upon a time impeded his professional  progress.  Back in the 1960's and 70's, Bullock's life  was marked by a series of chaotic and cata strophic events, allegedly triggered largely  by alcoholism. But Bullock says he hasn't  had a drink since 1981, a claim supported by  the fact that he hasn't made a public spec tacle of himself since then. Gone are the  ",1988
711,1007,5,Mr. LUJAN.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I want  to  bring to the attention of my colleagues a very  important technological advance that was re cently made by engineers and scientists at  Sandia National Laboratory,  the Department  of Energy national  laboratory  located  in my  hometown of Albuquerque, NM.  For years computer scientists  in  industry  and academia have believed  that no matter  how many processors were tied together in a  computer,  the problem-solving speed of  the  computer could only be increased by a factor  of between 50 and 100. This speedup limita tion  was  called  Amdahl's  law.  However,  Sandia National Laboratory personnel recently  demonstrated that this practical barrier to in creasing the speed of computers doesn't exist  when  they were able  to  link together 1,024  computer processors  to  reduce  the  time  re quired to solve complex problems by over a  factor of 1,000.  In parallel processing, the computer first di vides a problem into smaller pieces that may  be solved by different sections of the comput er. Various steps of the solution can then be  performed at the same time rather than wait ing for completion of a previous step.  The most capable off-the-shelf supercom puter available today is the Cray X-MP I 416,  which has four processors operating in paral lel-in comparison  to Sandia's 1,024 parallel  processors. The Sandia discovery opens the  door  to  the development of new, massively  parallel computers  that will solve problems  that no  computer  in  existence  today  can  tackle. For example,  it will be possible  to  solve problems in nonlinear wave simulation,  circuit analysis, structural mechanics, and fluid  dynamics which arise in  technology areas as  diverse as nuclear  reactor safety, explosive  technology,  electronics  circuit  design  and  packaging, nuclear waste storage containers,  and vertical axis wind  turbines  for electricity  generation. This breakthrough will permit the  optimization of designs in ways previously be lieved not to be possible.  I would especially like to congratulate and  call attention  to  the Sandia staff who made  this  important  breakthrough. Bob Brenner,  John Gustafson, Gary Montry,  and David  Womble were  the primary members of San dia's team  that did  this work. Recognition  is  also due  to Gil Weigand, Pat Eicker, Ed  Barsis, and Venky Narayanamurti. Members of  this  team have already  received  two major  computing awards: The Gordon Bell Award  and  the Karp Challenge Award. Their work  has been  reported  in  the New York Times,  Newsweek, Time, and my colleague from New  Mexico, Senator DOMENIC!, has already enEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tered  into  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the  March 14 front page story from the Washing ton Post.  In  recognizing  Sandia's  achievements,  I  also want to emphasize the importance of the  ties  that Sandia has  to American  industry.  I  believe that these ties are largely responsible  for the success that Sandia continually exhib its as our Nation's leading national engineer ing laboratory. Many are unaware that Sandia  National Laboratory has been operated by  AT&T-now AT&T Technologies,  lnc.-since  1949 when President Truman had the wisdom  to ask AT&T to undertake this vital manage ment task for the Atomic Energy Commission,  the predecessor of  today's Department of  Energy. Few Americans are aware that AT&T  has performed this public service without fee  or profit for nearly 40 years. AT&T has vast  experience in organizing and managing  inno vative electronics  technology  from  research  through development and into production, and  it brought these management skills to the op eration of Sandia.  In  these critical  times when we are con cerned about  the competitiveness of our in dustries, I invite my colleagues to visit Sandia  National Laboratory to learn of their many re search accomplishments and how these ad vances have been converted  into products  that are manufactured by private  industry.  I  believe that it is critical that our national lab oratories be managed by institutions such as  AT&T  that understand and work effectively  with both universities and private industry. It is  becoming clear that innovation done in an iso lated  research environment can experience  long delays before  it is converted  into prod ucts that can  improve our competitiveness.  I  congratulate Sandia and AT&T for these ad vances in computer technology and urge them  and others  to quickly  turn  these discoveries  into commercial products.  HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN  AMERICA  HON. DOUG WALGREN  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 13, 1988  ",1988
712,1007,5,Mr. WALGREN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my  Pennsylvania  colleague, Congressman  TOM  RIDGE,  in  introducing a very  timely piece of  legislation designed to protect American com panies,  American  workers,  and  American  cities from  the havoc threatened by a unique  brand of hostile takeover.  The bill we are introducing today addresses  the unique and highly questionable nature of a  hostile takeover attempt recently  initiated by  Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., a subsidiary of  the American Express Co., in concert with two  British entities, Beazer PLC, a construction  materials company, and National Westminster  Bank.  Shearson's target is Koppers Co.,  Inc., an  industrial  company  headquartered  in  Pitts burgh, which employs 1,300 people  in  the  Pittsburgh area. Koppers employs a total of  12,300 people across 40 States.  In early March, after  it had unsuccessfully  solicited Koppers to become a client, Shear6983  son announced  that  it was a partner  in a  $1.27 billion hostile tender offer for Koppers.  The Shearson bid marks the first time that a  major investment banking  firm has  taken an  equity partnership  in a hostile  takeover at tempt.  Shearson  initiated  these events almost 1  year ago by proposing  the  takeover  to  its  client, Beazer PLC, and agreed  to provide a  bridge loan of nearly one-half billion dollars to  finance  it. At  the same  time, Shearson pro posed to invest its own funds in financing for  the shell  company  that would attempt  the  takeover.  If this deal succeeds, Shearson will  own almost 50 percent of Koppers.  Also implicated in this transaction is Nation al Westminster Bank, PLC, one of the largest  commercial banks in England and the parent  company of several FDIC-insured banks in the  United States. NatWest has committed  itself  to providing up  to $300 million  to Beazer to  assist in financing the tender offer.  Shearson's conduct raises disturbing ques tions concerning the proper role of an invest ment banker  in  takeover bids. Whether any  securities firm should be permitted to provide  merger advice while simultaneously making an  equity investment in a takeover contest, illus trates a serious potential conflict of interest.  Equally  disturbing  is  the  fact  that  both  Shearson and NatWest own major FDIC-in sured  banks.  Shearson/ American  Express,  own the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Co.,  the Nation's 20th largest bank with over $15  billion in assets. They have escaped the regu latory safeguards of the Bank Holding Compa ny Act, which would normally not permit their  investment banking activities, by virtue of a  grandfather clause.  In the recent debate over the repeal or par tial repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act that cur rently separates banking and commerce ac tivities, both House and Senate banking com mittees agreed  that equity underwriting by  commercial banks at the present time is too  risky.  I do not believe that Congress intended to  permit one of  the  largest  securities  firms,  owning the Nation's 20th largest FDIC-insured  bank, to become engaged in the risky use of  their own capital to finance hostile takeovers  through equity acquisitions.  The legislation we are introducing today at tempts to address this problem. It would pro hibit a financial services company, like Shear son Lehman, that owns an FDIC-insured bank  from  taking more than a 5 percent equity in terest in a company that is not involved in fi nancial services.  The bill would also prevent  foreign bank  holding companies, like National Westminster,  which owns one or more U.S.  federally-in sured banks,  from engaging  in activities not  permissible for U.S. bank holding companies.  Namely,  no  foreign bank holding company  that owns U.S. banks could use their financial  resources to acquire interest in a non-banking  company in the United States. This prohibition  would be effective as of March 30, 1988. Any  foreign bank holding company  that had al ready acquired such an interest prior to March  30, 1988, would be required under the bill to  divest these shares within 60 days of date of  enactment of this bill.

713,1020,5,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to introduce, along with my distinguished col league, FRANK WOLF,  legislation designating  September 15, 1988, as National Drug Abuse  Resistance Education Day.  This  resolution  commends DARE  as  an  outstanding drug  abuse education program. Similar legislation is  being introduced in the other body.  DARE offers a 17-week curriculum teaching  fifth and sixth grade children how  to  resist  pressure  to experiment with drugs and alco hol. The DARE curriculum  teaches decision making skills, assertive response styles, and  resistance techniques. Other DARE units help  students  understand  self-image,  recognize  stress and manage  it without  taking drugs,  and analyze and  resist media presentations  about alcohol and drugs.  The DARE Program  is  taught by veteran  police officers who have direct experience  with the tragedies and crimes caused by drug  abuse. Each police officer completes a special  2 week  training program which  includes  in struction  on  teaching  techniques,  otficer school  relationships,  development  of  self esteem, child development, and communica tion skills. The DARE Program provides  the  opportunity  for  law  enforcement,  teachers,  and school administrators to work together to  reduce drug abuse.  April 14, 1988  Independent  research  has  confirmed  the  success of the DARE Program. DARE gradu ates are less accepting of drug use, and more  able. to resist peer pressure to use drugs. The  DARE Program also contributes  to  improved  study habits and grades, decreased vandalism  and gang activity, and a more positive attitude  toward the police and school.  The success of DARE is also demonstrated  in a student-parent survey  taken  in  the Los  Angeles Unified School District. Before taking  the DARE Program 51 percent of the students  surveyed equated drug use with having more  friends. After completing the DARE Program,  only 8 percent of the students made this as sociation.  Similarly,  before witnessing  the  DARE presentation,  61  percent of parents  thought that there was nothing parents could  do to prevent their children from using drugs.  However, after the DARE presentation, only 5  percent of the parents believed this.  The DARE Program is one of a number of  innovative drug prevention programs  spon sored by law enforcement in my district. Los  Angeles County is sponsoring a similarly ef fective program known as SANE,  the Sub stance Abuse Narcotics Education Program.  SANE  is taught in 54 school districts in Los  Angeles County, and over 60,000 students  have participated to date. The SANE Program  offers a flexible curriculum, which can be tai lored  to  the needs of each  individual school  district.  In addition  to classroom  instruction,  SANE emphasizes programs which reach the  PTA and community groups.  I commend  law enforcement for its willing ness to sponsor innovative and effective pro grams  like DARE.  It  is making an  important  contribution to fighting the abuse of drugs by  our young people.  I am pleased to have the  opportunity to recognize this outstanding pro grams. A copy of the bill follows:  H.J. RES. 540  Whereas D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance  Education)  is  a  semester  long  program  which  teaches fifthand sixth-grade chil dren how to resist pressure to experiment  with drugs and alcohol;  Whereas the D.A.R.E. program is also pro vided  to  kindergarten  and  junior  high  school students and their parents;  Whereas D.A.R.E. targets children when  they are most vulnerable  to  tremendous  peer pressure  to try drugs or alcohol and  teaches the skills to make positive decisions  and resist pressure to participate in negative  behaviors;  Whereas more than 500 communities in 38  States now teach the D.A.R.E. program in  their schools, and a pilot program has been  implemented for use internationally in the  Department of Defense Dependent Schools;  Whereas almost 1,500,000 students have  been reached through D.A.R.E.;  Whereas because school children are fre quently much more sophisticated about sub stance abuse than are classroom teachers,  the D.A.R.E. program is taught by veteran  police officers with direct experience with  ruined lives and crimes caused by substance  abuse;  Whereas each police officer teaching the  D.A.R.E.  program  completes  an  80-hour  training  course  including  instruction  in  teaching techniques, officer-school relation ships, development of self-esteem, child de velopment, and communication skills;  ",1988
714,1033,5,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, today is Yorn Ha shoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. This  day is designated each year by Congress and  the State of Israel to commemorate the brutal  deaths of more than 6 million Jews who per ished under the cruelties of the Nazi regime.  The systematic program of genocide must  continue to be remembered and studied if we  as a free democratic nation are to prevent its  recurrence.  It  is our obligation  to  remember  the horrors of the Crystal Night,  the Warsaw  Ghetto,  the gas chambers at Auschwitz,  the  children of Terenstadt, the mass shootings at  Sabi Yar, and other massacres suffered by  the Jewish people during  the  1930's and  1940's.  While there were heroes, such as the Gies  family that housed Anne Frank, and the Swed ish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg,  too many of  us simply turned and  looked  the other way.  This day serves as a permanent reminder of  what happened during  the Holocaust and  what we must pass on  to our children  to  ensure  they remember the horrible atrocities  that took place-to remember the past so we  do not repeat it.  Because so many of our children were born  after the Holocaust,  they need  to be made  aware of  the Nazi  ""solution""  that  left post World War II Europe without its Jewish people  and culture. On  this day,  the most important  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  element that we can pass on to our young is  not only  the memory of  the Holocaust's evil  but the memory of the 6 million Jews who per ished. We must  remember  these events  in  order not to repeat them. Holocaust Remem brance Day gives us just the opportunity to do  so.  KILDEE HONORS MRS. ROBERTA  V.  COURTS,  DR.  THOMAS  COURTS, MRS. CLARA SMITH,  AND MR. WILBURN BANKS OF  THE S.S. STEWART COMMUNI TY SCHOOL  HON. DALE E. KILDEE  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 14, 1988  ",1988
715,1033,5,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  bring  to  the attention of my colleagues and  the Nation an appreciation dinner that will be  held Saturday, April 23,  in Flint Ml, honoring  Mrs. Roberta V. Courts, Dr. Thomas Courts,  Mrs. Clara Smith,  and Mr. Wilburn Banks.  These  individuals are being honored by  the  Stewart School Community Advisory Council  for their unwavering dedication to S.S. Stewart  Community School.  Mrs. Roberta V. Courts has  taught  in  the  Flint community school system  for 28 years.  Her dedication and creativety has had a last ing  impact on  the quality of education in our  community and in the lives of hundreds of stu dents. Mrs. Courts, who  is retired  from Coo lidge Elemenatry School, has played a vital  role  in  shaping  educational  programs  that  meet  the  real needs of our children  in  the  most  impressionable  stage  of  their  young  lives. As a former kindergarten teacher at S.S.  Stewart Community School, she has set an  extraordinary example for the future leaders of  our country.  Dr. Thomas Courts has played an essential  role in the progress of S.S. Stewart Communi ty School. As  the  founder and pastor of the  Vermont Christian Church, which  is  located  around the corner from S.S. Stewart Commu nity School, Dr. Courts has unselfishly given of  his  time  to provide our schoolchildren with  spiritual  inspiration and good judgment quali ties. He has continually assisted in  the plan ning and organizing of many school activities.  Dr. Courts has  distinguished himself as a  highly successful pastor and as a community  leader.  As the first woman principal of S.S. Stewart  Community School, Mrs. Clara Smith  has  proven herself a most distinguished leader in  education as well as an asset to the Seventh  Congressional District. Her selfless dedication  to improving the lives of thousands of children  and adults who passed  through her office  door is extraordinary. Since retiring from S.S.  Stewart Community School, Mrs. Smith has  spent many hours continuing her public serv ice by volunteering at agencies and  institu tions  in our community. Mrs. Smith has suc ceeded  in making Genesee County a better  place in which to live.  Mr. Wilburn Banks has spent a lifetime de voting himself  to maintaining  the beauty of  S.S. Stewart School. He began his career at  7009  S.S. Stewart Community School in 1955 as a  custodian. Mr. Banks, however, has reached  far beyond his custodial duties. He brought joy  into many children's  lives by playing Santa  Claus at Christmas time and gently counseling  children when  they were mischievous. Since  his  retirement, Mr. Banks has been  sorely  missed by not just the children but by the fac ulty as well.  Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Roberta V. Courts, Dr.  Thomas W. Courts, Mrs. Clara Smith, and Mr.  Wilburn Banks have distinguished themselves  as  fine examples of  the highest degree of  good citizenship. They have touched the lives  of many individuals, and they inspire those of  us who know them to ask more of ourselves. I  am congratulating them on their accomplished  careers.  A TRIBUTE TO COACH PAULIE  MILLER  HON. ROMANO L. MAZZOLI  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 14, 1988  ",1988
716,1033,5,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to Coach Paulie Miller, who recent ly retired after 18 years of service as Jeffer son County Circuit Court Clerk. Paulie, who  was elected for three terms,  is a past presi dent of the Kentucky Circuit Court Clerk's As sociation.  Many  Louisvilleians,  however,  respect  Paulie mostly  for his enormously successful  career as a  football coach at Flaget High  School and at the University of Louisville.  At Flaget, Paulie coached six future college  All-Americans  including ""Golden Boy,"" Notre  Dame's Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hor nung, and Kentucky All-American, Miami Hurri cane Coach and current University of Louis ville head  football coach, Howard Schnellen berger. Among his many honors during his 18  years at Flaget, Paulie won  four State  titles  and became  the only coach  in Kentucky  to  win Coach of the Year three times.  Upon his retirement from coaching in 1970,  Paulie's immense popularity made him a suc cessful public figure throughout the Common wealth.  Paulie,  a  strong  supporter of  the  Democratic Party in Kentucky, was extremely  influential  in shaping  the political careers of  former Kentucky Governors  Jullian Carroll,  Martha Layne Collins, and U.S. Senator Wen dell Ford as well as my own career.  But it was upon the little people with whom  Paulie had his greatest  impact. As a coach,  Paulie reveled  in  taking young people under  his wing and instilling in them the same work  ethic and burning desire for success which he  has displayed throughout his entire life. As cir cuit clerk, Paulie continued this philosophy by  paying extra attention  to  those citizens who  were less fortunate than himself.  Paulie's  legacy  in  the Commonwealth of  Kentucky will  continue  for many  years  to  come.  In addition to the many people I've al ready mentioned, Paulie's fine son Tony, was  recently elected as his replacement as Jeffer son County Circuit Court Clerk.  So, Mr. Speaker,  I join all  the citizens of  Louisville, Jefferson County, and  throughout  ",1988

725,1046,5,Mr. ROTH.," Mr.  President,  today  marks the first filing deadline under  the Tax Reform Act of 1986. As  the  American people struggle with  their  new but not necessarily improved tax  forms, their anger and frustration has  risen.  I am wearing a black arm band to  express my sympathy for the Ameri can taxpayer as they face the conse quences of the 1986 tax reform bill.  The new  law obviously has done  nothing for tax relief or tax simplifica tion in 1987. Many taxpayers are sur prised at  the big  tax payments  re quired  for  this  tax year. This  is  a  result, of course, of the act's delay of  full rate reduction in 1987 relative to  the full  repeal of deductions  in  the  same tax year.  By restricting IRA's, the tax bill dis courages, rather than encourages, the  American people from saving money.  This was a major factor in my deci sion  to vote  against  the  Reform Act. Although I  favored  the  marginal tax rate reductions, inspired  by the earlier example of Roth-Kemp,  the base broadening was done in a way  potentially harmful to  the economy.  Fortunately, the underlying economy  was extremely strong, plowing ahead  despite the tax bill and the decline of  the stock market.  Many taxpayers are probably asking  themselves how and why  their  tax  payments  are  going  up  this  year.  Anyone unfortunate enough  to deal  with any of the extra forms is espe cially unhappy. After all, was not tax  relief and tax simplification part and  parcel of tax reform from the begin ning? For example, the Treasury's pro posal was called tax reform for fair ness, simplicity, and economic growth.  Well, the final product didn't move  us  in  the direction of any of  these  worthy goals. As one wag said at the  time: ""Today I hold in my hands 925  pages of tax simplification."" What he  did not say is that the explanation of  these  provisions  took  another  pages.  The Tax Code is so complex, accord ing to a new GAO report, that even  IRS goofs 38 percent of the time in ad vising taxpayers. This shouldn't be too  surprising, since IRS issued over 1,000  pages of new regulations  implement ing  the 1986 Tax Act. According  to  Arthur Andersen & Co., IRS has also  issued ""82 'advance notices' outlining  future regulatory changes, 74 press re leases, 32 revenue rulings, and 20 reve nue procedures.""  This same source reports that IRS  officials are very nervous about other  hidden ""gremlins"" in the new tax law.  Dealing with certain provisions of the  new code are indeed reminiscent of the  movie  ""gremlins,"" which portrays a  community tormented by cute cuddly  886  ",1988
726,1059,5,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I send  an amendment to the desk and ask for  its immediate consideration.  ",1988
727,1059,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  amendment will be stated.  The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr.  proposes  an  amendment  num bered 1947 to amendment No. 1946.  RUDMAN]  ,1988
728,1059,5,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.  ",1988
729,1059,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  On page 10, line 14, strike all through line  21 and insert in lieu thereof ""or"".  On page 10,  line 24, strike all  page 11, line 5.  On page 5, line 19, strike "", legislative, or  judicial"" and insert in lieu thereof ""or legis lative"".  through  ",1988
730,1059,5,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President,  this  amendment would eliminate a massive  loophole in this bill which was created  for  the  purpose  of benefiting  one  group  of  already  privileged Ameri cans-attorneys. Although  the spon sors portray  this bill as  imposing a  wide ban on contact between current  and  former Government employees,  they have included an exemption for  all  contact  by  a  former  employee  where  that person  is  representing a  party on a matter  likely  to  involve  legal action.  For civil cases,  the exemption ap plies to all contact after a complaint  has been filed, and for criminal mat ters,  it applies where  the party has  been the subject of an arrest, warrant,  information, indictment, or grand jury  investigation. The complaint  in civil  cases need not be filed by the Govern ment. It could be filed by the former  Federal  employee who,  accordingly,  has  the  option  of  initiating  some  minor action for the unstated purpose  of exempting himself from the bill.  Now, Mr. President, who does that  help? Ninety-nine percent of the bene fit of this amendment will go to attor neys. Since I am an attorney, the easi est  thing would be  for me  to keep  quiet. But, quite frankly, I cannot sit  by in good conscience while the Senate  considers a bill of draconian nature  which proposes to partially exempt 62  out of the 100 Members of this body,  those that are lawyers, and I dare say  the percentage is even higher in the  House of Representatives.  My colleagues might be interested in  the background on this provision. S.  237 originally  included a  limited ex emption for attorneys, but only for ap pearances  in courtroom proceedings.  The committee report justifies that on  the grounds that without it, attorneys  might not be willing to enter the Gov ernment and that ""such a result could  discourage many  talented  individuals  from entering Government service.""  During discussions with the commit tee staff a few months ago, my staff  noted that the committee's provision  was meaningless because an attorney  was  ethically barred  from  taking a  case when he could not discuss it with  opposing counsel.  Unfortunately,  the  response  from  the bill's sponsors was not to go back  and take a  look at the scope of the  entire bill. Instead, the response was  to create a massive loophole for attor neys.  Well, albeit it may have been inad vertently,  that  is  the  result and  I  think everybody  agrees  that  is  the  result.  Mr. President, I have three points to  make and I will then yield the floor.  First, there are a lot of talented indi viduals who are not attorneys, one of  whom is sitting in the chair, who may  be discouraged from entering Govern ment because of S. 237 as now drafted.  We should address that issue for all  Americans, not just that fraction of a  percent who happen to be lawyers.  Second, there is no exemption for at torneys, partial or otherwise,  in cur rent law.  Third, the sponsors of this bill are  attorneys. Most Members of Congress  are attorneys, including almost every  Member of  the Judiciary Committee  which reported this bill. A high per centage of congressional staff are at torneys. What is good for the goose is  good for the gander. If this is a good  bill, everyone should have to live with  it equally. We should not publicly pre tend  to be bringing Congress under  the scope of the postemployment laws,  and then on the sly give ourselves a  partial exemption.  It is my understanding with a small  revision which I made, a technical re vision to the amendment, this amend ment may well be acceptable. But be cause this well might be controversial  in the House of Representatives, I be lieve it would be good to have a record ed vote of the Senate and therefore I  ask for the yeas and nays.  ",1988
731,1059,5,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  Is  there a sufficient second? There is a  sufficient second.  The yeas and nays were ordered.  ,1988

733,1059,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from South Carolina.  ,1988
734,1059,5,Mr. THURMOND.," Since the distin guished Senator from New Hampshire  has made his remarks on this bill, I  just want to say we do not agree at all  with many of the remarks he made.  We will  be  glad  to  consider  any  addressed  the  the  amendments he has offered. He has  offered one here now. We think it is  all right. We are willing to accept it. If  he wants a rollcall, we have no objec tion to that. We will be glad to vote  for it either way.  Mr. METZENBAUM addressed  Chair.  ",1988
735,1059,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Ohio.  ,1988
736,1059,5,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I want to concur with the comments of  the Senator from South Carolina.  I  think the Senator from New Hamp shire has done yeoman work in point ing out this change in the bill. I think  it will improve the bill. We have sug gested one change. I think it provides  an element of fairness  in connection  with the legislation. I want to join the  Senator from South Carolina and the  Senator from New Hampshire in sup porting the amendment and will urge  my colleagues to vote yea.  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.  ",1988
737,1059,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Pennsylvania.  ,1988
738,1059,5,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  think it might be worth saying a word  or two about the provisions in the bill.  I believe there is merit to the provi sion which is currently in the bill and,  at the same time, I acknowledge the  merit in the arguments made by the  distinguished  Senator  from  New  Hampshire, but I do think there ought  to be a word of explanation as to why  the bill is crafted in its current form  to excerpt attorneys at law in a litiga tion context. This provision is included  because where you have a position of  prestige which might yield undue in fluence in governmental circles after a  person leaves government, that situa tion is not likely to occur in a context  of litigation where there is an adver sary proceeding.  If you have a  lawsuit, customarily,  many  times  it  is settled  in advance.  Most controversies are settled before  litigation ensues.  So if you take it to a point where a  complaint is filed, an answer is filed,  and you go to court, it is in an adver sarial  relationship and  there  is not  likely to be inappropriate influence on  the governmental official.  If you have a former ranking govern mental official or a former Senator or  former Member of the House of Rep resentatives and they have not been  able to work it out, then certainly any  suggestion of influence has been ne gated when it comes to a point where  there is litigation.  Similarly,  if  there  is  a  potential  criminal prosecution,  the practice  is  frequently  followed where a counsel  for a prospective defendant, perhaps  during a grand  jury proceeding, will  negotiate with governmental officials  to see if a defense can be offered in ad vance. It may be that in such a situa tion,  a  former  Senator,  a  former  ",1988

Before I yield to the Republican  manager of the bill, I believe it would  be  appropriate  to  dispose  of  the  amendment. Therefore, I send to the  desk an amendment and ask for its im mediate consideration.  ",1988
740,1072,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  amendment will be stated.  The assistant  legislative clerk read  as follows:  The Senator  RocKEFELLER]  number 1950.  from West Virginia CMr.  proposes  an  amendment  ,1988
741,1072,5,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  I ask unanimous consent that reading  of the amendment be dispensed with.  ",1988
742,1072,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  On page 23, strike lines 1through12.  ",1988
743,1072,5,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  this amendment would delete section 8  of the bill, which contains a conform ing amendment to section 4064(b) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. As  the Commerce Committee observed in  its report, section 8 was designed  to  ""clarify that the lower energy content  of the alternative fuels covered by this  bill do not trigger the so-called 'gas  guzzler' tax provisions of current law.""  <S. Rept. 100-271, page 13). Specifical ly, section 8 would have addressed the  determination of any tax that might  apply under  that provision  of  the  Code by making clear that the deter mination of the tax for a methanol,  ethanol, or natural gas powered auto mobile or dual fuel automobile shall  be based on the fuel economy rating  established under section 503(d)(4) of  the Motor Vehicle  Information and  Cost Savings Act as added by this bill.  Mr. President,  in our  judgment, a  proper interpretation of the gas guz zler tax by the Internal Revenue Serv ice should ensure that the tax law is  not applied in a way that is at cross  purposes with S. 1518 and its encour agement of production of alternative  fuel vehicles. For that reason, I would  like to say in deleting section 8 from S.  1518 that we believe the interpretation  of the law should remain exactly the  same as it was with section 8 in the  bill.  The reason for deleting the section  is that some have suggested that the  clarifying amendment might be viewed  as  a  revenue  related matter  that  should originate in the House of Rep resentatives. While I am not persuad ed that is the case, I have offered this  amendment to eliminate any procedur al questions regarding the bill. Since  the amendment was merely a clarify ing amendment, it is not necessary to  retain the language of section 8 in the  bill; and, as the sponsor of S. 1518, I  want to say that I believe that the in terpretation of the law should remain  the same as when section 8 was in the  bill.

747,1085,5,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, alcohol  is the most widely used drug in Amer ica. It is the most lethal, deadly drug  in our society  A recent Department of Health and  Human Services study indicated that  health warning labels on the contain ers of alcoholic beverages can be effec tive as part of a comprehensive cam paign  to educate  the American con sumer on the adverse consequences of  alcohol consumption. Earlier this year,  I was pleased to be an original cospon sor of legislation to require rotating  health warning labels on alcoholic bev erages. That bill, S. 2047, was spon sored by Senator THURMOND and has  received strong bipartisan support in  the Senate. It has also  received en dorsements from a wide range of orga nizations including the American Med ical Association, PTA, American Acad emy of Pediatrics, National Associa tion of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Directors, National Education Associa tion, National Council on Alcoholism,  the March of Dimes and many more.  Mr. President, 55 of these organiza tions have joined together to express,  in writing, their support of S. 2047. I  ask unanimous consent that a copy of  that letter follow my remarks in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I also urge my  colleagues to join me in support of S.  2047.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  MARCH 16, 1988.  Hon. TOM HARKIN.  Senate Hart Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR  SENATOR HARKIN: We,  the under signed organizations, are writing to express  our strong support of S. 2047, a bill to re quire health and safety warning labels on  all alcoholic beverages. This legislation was  introduced in the United States Senate on  February 4, 1988, by Senators Strom Thur mond, Howard Metzenbaum, Dan Evans and  Tom Harkin. We urge you to lend your sup port and cosponsor S. 2047.  The bill would require five rotating labels  on beer, wine and distilled spirits. The labels  address the dangers of drinking during preg nancy, drinking and driving,  drinking  in  combination with other drugs, the associa tion between drinking and increased risks of  liver disease, hypertension and cancer, and  the fact that alcohol is a drug and can be  addictive.  We view  labeling of alcoholic beverages  with specific messages as an important com ponent of a comprehensive strategy to ad dress alcoholism and alcohol-related prob lems in this Nation. Furthermore, the label ing of alcoholic beverage containers will in stitutionalize important public health infor mation and cannot help but enhance  the  public's knowledge  regarding health and  safety risks associated with alcohol use.  In a democratic society, consumers have a  right  to know about  the  risks associated  with  the consumption of any given  legal  product. This information is critical if indi viduals  are  to make  informed  decisions  about their use or non-use of alcohol. Alco holic beverages have long been exempt from  a number of consumer information strate gies. In fact, alcohol advertising, which gen erally glamorizes drinking, continues to be  the major and most powerful source of in formation Americans receive about alcohol.  The enactment of S. 2047 will make a major  contribution  to  public  health  education  about alcohol for American consumers.  We urge you to cosponsor S. 2047  today  and to join us in actively facilitating its pas sage in 1988.

748,1085,5,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. President, in 1979,  the Department of Defense published  a  report on  the military balance  in  NATO's central region. Once classified  secret, it was declassified in 1985 and  is now available for public examina tion. The list of those who participat ed  in  its preparation  is  impressive.  Representatives from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, the Office of Program Eval uation and Analysis, the Defense In telligence Agency, and analysts from  both the Central Intelligence Agency  and the National Security Agency all  contributed.  The report assesses the military bal ance  in Europe at  the end of  the  1970's and  then,  on  the  basis  of  NATO's long-term defense plan and  anticipated improvements in Warsaw  Pact forces, forecasts the state of the  balance in 1984. The report's assess ment came at the end of the 1970's, a  period in which the U.S. defense estab lishment had reportedly suffered seri ous neglect, and before the major mili tary buildup of the Reagan adminis tration. Nevertheless, it does not por tray only a NA TO of weakness and a  Warsaw  Pact  of  overwhelming  strength. Both alliances are seen  to  have advantages and vulnerabilities.  The report is lengthy; well over 100  pages. Today, I offer an excerpted ver sion of its executive summary for your  consideration. It provides the report's  major conclusions on the state of the  NATO/Warsaw Pact balance, and a  series of recommendations for improv ing the defense posture of our alliance.  I commend it to your attention.  I ask unanimous consent that the  summary be printed in the RECORD at  this point.  ",1988

Mr. President, John Amos  is  to be  congratulated for his contribution to  America and I ask that the Forbes ar ticle be printed at this point in the  RECORD.  The article follows:  [From Forbes magazine, Jan. 11, 19871  PATIENT INSURER  In the lexicon of remarkable innovations,  consider  the achievement of John Amos.  The 63-year-old founder and chief executive  of Columbus, Ga.-based American Family  Corp. took a product that was controversial  in the U.S.-cancer insurance-redesigned it  and in 1974 shipped it off to Japan, a coun try with one of the biggest, most well-en trenched  insurance  industries  anywhere.  American Family has now emerged as one  of the 20 largest insurers in Japan, covering  one of every six families. Last year 66% of  the company's revenues and 70% of aftertax  earnings came from Japan.  Amos' strategy is simple: ""Stick to niche  marketing and you're not big enough  to  scare anyone. Then you've got to be patient  as Job and figure out how to do things the  Japanese way."" Back  in  the Seventies he  came up with an  idea guaranteed  to win  favor with  the Japanese Ministry of Fi nance: Use retired Japanese workers to sell  his  product  to  their  former  colleagues.  ""Their  retirement benefits weren't good  enough to last them forever, so American  Family became a little like their social secu rity,"" he recalls. American Family now em ploys about 10,500 mostly retired Japanese  workers.  Tragically, Amos  himself  is  currently  grappling with lung cancer. But he remains  involved in company affairs and has devoted  himself in recent weeks to preparing Ameri can Family's listing on the Tokyo Stock Ex change. The firm's 25.5% return on equity  last year led the major U.S.  life  insurers,  thanks  to  favorable currency  translations  and Amos' decision in late 1986 to sell most  of his Japanese stockholdings.e  MOTHER'S PEACE DAY  ",1988
750,1098,5,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, on May  5,  the Metro Detroit Chapter  of  Women's Action for Nuclear Disarma ment [WAND] will celebrate Mother's  Peace Day. The  theme  this year  is  ""It's Up  to  the Women,""  a  quote  which can be attributed  to Eleanor  Roosevelt. This is an appropriate title  to give to such a day. Women have cer tainly been at  the  forefront of  the  peace movement.  On  this special day, Mary Diskin,  the  director  of SANE/FREEZE,  a  local peace group with 18,000 mem bers, will receive W AND's Peace Day  Award. Ms. Diskin  is being honored  for her contributions toward assuring  world peace. In her own words, she  feels she has a mission to ""help rid the  planet of nuclear insanity.""  Ms. Diskin grew up near the Strate gic Air Command base in Omaha, NE,  in the fifties. She lived with the daily  fear of destruction. It left its mark on  her, and in 1982 she joined FREEZE.  In 1986 she coordinated the Michigan  section of the U.S. Peace March, and  in 1987 she became the coordinator of  the Michigan Peace March for Global  Disarmament.  Mary Diskin continues  to support  and work for special projects which  promote peace. I congratulate her on  receiving this important award and I  commend  the women of WAND  for  recognizing her achievements.e  THE PASSING OF WILLIAM C.  HUFFMAN  e Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I  rise today to express my sorrow upon  the death of a community leader and  good friend of mine, Mr. William C.  Huffman. I came to know Bill when he  was the adviser of my fraternity, Phi  Kappa Tau, at the University of Louis ville.  When Bill passed away on April 8,  the community of Louisville and the  State of Kentucky lost a selfless, dedi cated  individual whose contributions  to the community included a career at  the  University  of  Louisville  that  spanned four decades. While at  the  university, he was a professor of busi ness administration, dean of the uni versity college, and vice president of  the University of Louisville Founda tion, Inc.  But  his  active  participation  in  campus activities didn't stop there. He  developed the program that led to the  creation of a master's degree in busi ness  education  and  established  the  General Electric workshop in econom ics for the school's summer session. In  addition to being a member of the Na tional Adult Education Association, he  served as director and president of the  American Association of Evening Col leges.  Bill's  duties  did  not  exclusively  center around the university campus.  He served for 6 years as a member of  the Louisville and Jefferson County  Planning Commission. Other organiza tions with which he was affiliated in clude the Advisory Board of Kentucky  Educational Television, the Louisville  Chamber  of  Commerce,  and  the  Rotary Club of Louisville.  Bill Huffman was a great man and a  dedicated individual who will be sorely  missed by all who knew him and by all  who  benefited  from  his  service  to  others. Mr. President, I know that my  colleagues join me in sending our most  sincere condolences to Bill's widow, his  daughters, his sister, and his grand child.

753,1124,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I  thank  the  Chaplain  for  his  provocative  prayer, his thoughtful prayer, and a  prayer which is very much needed in  these  times.  I hope that it provokes  thoughtfulness on the part of all of us  and a desire on the part of all of us to  lift  ourselves  above  the  horizontal  thinking of our day.

BICENTENNIAL MINUTE  APRIL 17, 1850, FIRST WOMAN IN THE SENATE  PRESS GALLERY  ",1988
754,1124,5,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, it was 138  years ago this week, on April 17, 1850,  that the first woman reporter was ad mitted into the Senate Press Gallery.  Jane Gray Swisshelm, a fervent abo litionist,  convinced  Editor  Horace  Greeley to publish her occasional let ters  from Washington  in  the New  York Tribune. Once  in Washington,  she set about convincing Vice Presi dent Millard Fillmore  to grant her  access to the press gallery. The Vice  President thought this was a  terrible  idea. He warned her that she would  find the company of the male report ers unpleasant, and that her presence  would attract excessive attention. But  Mrs. Swisshelm had so set her mind on  her objective that Millard Fillmore ca pitulated.  On April 17, Mrs. Swisshelm  took  her seat in the Press Gallery in the  Old Senate Chamber, and she was not  disappointed  in  the scene below. ""If  you had only been here to see!"" she  wrote back to editor Greeley. ""Such a  scene  as  our Senate Chamber  did  present  an hour  ago!"" During  the  debate over the compromise of 1850  that day, Mississippi Senator Henry S.  Foote pulled a pistol to protect him self from the wrath of Missouri Sena tor Thomas Hart Benton. ""Stand out  of the way and let the assassin fire!""  Benton had shouted melodramatically,  before the  two men were separated.  ""Here was all confusion,"" she wrote,  ""the  President's  gavel  going  but  scarcely heard, the men in the gallery  swearing,  the Members of  the  floor  rushing up and calling all manner of  order and disorder.""  ""I sat in the reporters' gallery, di rectly opposite the gentlemen,"" Mrs.  Swisshelm recorded, ""and saw it all.""  Although the Press Gallery largely re mained a male bastion until the 20th  century,  an  increasing  number  of  women journalists today follow in her  path, sitting in the Press Galleries and  seeing it all.  STRIKE AT IRANIAN  TERRORISM  ",1988
755,1124,5,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, within the  past 10 hours, our naval forces in the  Persian Gulf have struck back at Iran,  in retaliation for its mine attack on a  United States frigate.  In a situation where,  literally,  the  smoke has not yet cleared, it is imper ative that we hold our rhetorical fire.  In particular, it is premature to com ment on specific military operations,  with some military action continuing.  It is worth noting,  though,  that re ports to date indicate there have been  no U.S. casualties. We all pray that  will remain true as events unfold.  I, and the other Members of the con gressional  leadership, were consulted  last evening on the planned mission  against  Iranian  targets-well before  the mission was underway. I indicated  my support for that planned action, as  a fully justified response to Iran's con tinued unprovoked attacks on our ves sels. The President intends to provide  the Congress with a  report on  this  action promptly-I expect we will see  it yet this afternoon.  In short, the President has brought  us in on the takeoff, and intends to  keep us fully informed and involved as  this action evolves. I hope we will keep  that in mind as we ponder the ques tions about war powers that almost in evitably will arise.  In my view, now is the time to send  only one message to our adversaries:  That  the United States-the Presie This ""bullet"" symbol  identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

I  cosponsored  this bill, because  I  firmly believe that the United States  must move in the direction of decreas ing its dependence fossil fuel. This bill  would provide incentives and promote  the manufacture of duel, or alterna tive fueled vehicles.  Mr. President, this bill will not only  help the agriculture, coal and sugar in dustries  of  the United States, but  would also promote a cleaner environ ment.  Senator ROCKEFELLER'S efforts have  insured the passage of this bill.e  BUDGET SCOREKEEPING  REPORT  e ",1988

This report  was prepared consistent with standard  scorekeeping conventions. This report  also serves as the scorekeeping report  for the purposes of section 311 of the  budget act.  This report shows that current level  spending is under the budget resolu tion by $900 million in budget author ity, and by $2.9 billion in outlays.

758,1202,5,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, on April 17,  1988,  I had  the opportunity  to speak at  the  dedication of a new building on the State Fair  Community College campus  in Sedalia, MO.  This new facility, the William C. Hopkins Stu dent Services Building, was dedicated to the  memory of my long-time friend and adviser Bill Hopkins-who devoted much of his life to  the  founding and  improvement of State Fair  College.  Bill Hopkins was one of the most outstand ing individuals I have ever known, and estab lishing a building in his name is a more than  fitting  tribute  to a man who served  for 20  years  as  chairman  of  the  board  for  the  school's trustees. Further, Bill's horizons ex tended well beyond the college campus to a  concern for the community as a whole. As a  member of several  local civic organizations,  he was recognized by all who knew him as a  man who  selflessly devoted  his  time and  energy to making the world a better place. Bill  was  also  a  successful  businessman  and  served for 12 years as a special agent for the  FBI.  Although Bill Hopkins passed away in 1986,  his dedication and generosity obviously have  April 18, 1988  left their mark on his Missouri community. The  student services building  that was dedicated  in his name at State Fair Community College  will serve as a reminder to current and future  students of Bill Hopkins' legacy of service to  the Sedalia area.  HISPANIC  WOMEN'S  COUNCIL,  INC.  SALUTES WOMEN  FOR  SUCCESS  HON. ESTEBAN EDWARD TORRES  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 18, 1988  ",1988
759,1202,5,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker,  the Hispanic  Women's Council, Inc., is a nonprofit organiza tion which provides the motivation and oppor tunity for women  to become effective partici pants in their communities.  It is dedicated to  improving  the  status  of Hispanic women  through education and career development  activities. The council strives to enhance the  leadership skills and social consciousness of  women while providing positive  role models  and motivational programs for the young. On  Thursday,  April  21,  1988  the  Hispanic  Women's Council will hold its seventh annual  ""Women for Success"" Awards Dinner in Los  Angeles.  This year's honorees are: Elizabeth Pena  for Woman of the Year, Ana Barbosa for com munity service, and Genoveva Arrellano  for  Woman of Promise. Special recognition will be  given to Jaime Escalante for his tremendous  contribution  to excellence  in education and  Pacific Bell has been chosen  to  receive  the  ""Corporate Award"" for its many years of sup port to HWC and the community.  Elizabeth Pena-Woman of the Year, 1988.  Elizabeth was born in Cuba where she spent  most of her first 8 years before immigrating to  the United States. Her love of acting began at  an early age in large part because of her par ent's involvement in the business. Her father,  Mario,  is  an  actor/writer/director and  her  mother Margarita, is the administrator for the  Latin American Theatre Ensemble,  an  off Broadway bilingual  theatre in New York. She  attended New York's High School of the Per forming Arts, and Elizabeth has appeared  in  more than 20 off-off-Broadway plays and had  studied dance mime and clowning.  Elizabeth  is probably best remembered  for  her portrayal of the vivacious maid, Carmen,  in the box office hit ""Down and Out in Beverly  Hills"" and  for her  role as Rosie,  the  late  Richie Valens sister-in-law,  in  ""La Bamba.""  This summer, Elizabeth will be seen in a fea tured role in  the film ""Vibes"" with Jeff Gold blum and Cyndi Lauper. 1987 was an incredi ble year for this young actress with her own  TV series, and two major film releases.

Halverson,  Jr., offered the following prayer:  Let us pray together:  Our Father in Heaven, it is written  that: Unless the Lord build the house,  those who build it labor in vain and  unless the Lord watches over the city,  the watchman stays awake in vain.  We sometimes wonder whether or  not in the midst of our labors and our  watchings, You are still with us in this  project of building this Nation. And  we ask  the question: Lord,  is  there  something we  are  doing  that we  should not be doing? Or is there some thing that we are not being that we  should be? And we tremble at the pos sibility  that You would  take Your  Holy Spirit from us.  And  so,  very,  very  humbly  this  morning we come to You and ask that  You would  be  the  invisible  divine  builder  in our midst. We pray  that  You would assist us in all of our labors  and in all of our work and not only for  the household of  this Nation do we  pray, but also for our own homes and  families.  We pray for those children of ours,  and grandchildren, and wives and re lated  family  and members  of  our  neighborhoods. We pray  there,  too,  that You would be in our midst and  assist us.  We do not presume upon Your pres ence, Lord. We love You and we need  You and we come to You as one who,  for the sake of only a few righteous  men, would save an entire city which  was woefully evil.  By the grace of God we ask these  things in Christ's name. Amen.  APPOINTMENT OF ACTING  PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE  ",1988

Under the standing order,  the  majority leader is now recognized.  THE SENATE PRAYER  ",1988
762,1215,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the Chap lain for today is the illustrious son of  the illustrious Chaplain of the Senate.  I thank him for his prayer. He has ex horted us to be builders. And he has  admonished us that, unless God is at  the center of our thoughts and unless  we  look  to Him for guidance in our  works, we will not ultimately be suc cessful in our good objectives.  He  importunes us  to  take note of  this, not only as a nation and as we  seek to do the public's business, but  also in relation to our own private af fairs.  He  quotes  those  Scriptures  which say, ""Except the Lord build the  house, they labor in vain that build it;  except  the Lord keep  the city,  the  watchman waketh but in vain.""  I am grateful that today's Chaplain  has  reminded us not only of  these  great and beautiful passages of Scrip ture, but also of the fact that they are  as important today in our public and  private lives as in the days when they  were written.  There is a bit of verse that I will  seek  to  recall which puts  the same  lesson in rhyme and perhaps more in formal words:  I  I saw them tearing a building down,  A group of men in a busy town;  With a ""Ho, heave, ho"" and a lusty yell,  They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.  said  to  the  foreman,  ""Are  these men  skilled  The type you'd hire if you had to build?""  He laughed, and then he said, ""No, indeed,  Just common labor is all I need;  I can easily wreck in a day or two,  That which takes builders years to do.""  I said to myself as I walked away,  ""Which of these roles am I  trying to play?  Am I a builder who works with care,  Building my life by the rule and square?  Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,  Patiently building the best I can?  Or am I a fellow who walks the town,  Content with the labor of tearing down?""

764,1215,5,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, it  has been widely accepted as an article  of faith that the INF Treaty will be  overwhelmingly  ratified  by  the  Senate. The general view is that the  treaty might enjoy the support of 80  or more Senators. It should. Here is  why: First, here  is a  treaty that re quires the destruction of three times  as many Soviet nuclear weapons as  American nukes. Second, in the past  arms control treaties with the Soviet  Union have been opposed by a single  primary argument: The Soviets will  cheat. They will not comply. In the  case of INF,  the administration has  met that argument with verification of  compliance provisions  that go much  further  than  in any United States Soviet treaty to date. In fact, INF veri fication  requires  such  intrusiveness  that our own military has complained  that our negotiators may have gone  too  far  in  giving Soviet  observers  access to the United States nuclear ar senal. Since maximum  intrusiveness  provided in the INF Treaty certainly  gives our open society an advantage  compared to the Soviet tightly closed  system, from our standpoint this is an  impressive plus for  the INF Treaty.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

767,1267,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1988
768,1267,5,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Madam Presi dent, the Senator from Kentucky has  an amendment that is pending at the  desk. I, frankly, do not have any objec tions to it, but I think it is only fair to  point out that it does not really fall  within the parameters of this legisla tion. I am not opposed to it, but those  who have been more involved than I in  connection with  campaign  finance  reform and campaign spending ought  to be  aware of  the  fact  that  this  amendment does provide that anybody  who lends money from his own funds,  or  anybody  from  his  immediate  family, may not, after the election is  concluded, then solicit funds in order  to pay off the debt.  Have I stated it correctly?  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from  Ohio has stated it correctly.  I might say that this measure was  not a contentious item when the group  of eight met, prior to the demise of S.  2,  to  try to work out a compromise  campaign finance bill. This item was  not in contention. The group of eight  agreed without dissent that this provi sion should be included in any kind of  campaign finance reform bill that we  could come up with on a bipartisan  basis. We did not succeed  in doing  that, unfortunately.  This provision, I might say, Madam  President, simply does this: It says, in  effect,  that  if  you  take your own  funds, or funds  that you personally  obtain from a lending institution, and  put those funds into a political cam paign, you cannot recover those funds  after  the election  from postelection  contributions. It is intended to prohib it  the unethical practice of shaking  down special interests after an election  to repay personal campaign debt.  One of the items that has driven up  the cost of campaigns in recent years  has been  the  infusion  of  personal  funds  into  campaigns. The pattern  often has been that, as soon as the  election  is  over,  the winner  goes  around town, to political action com mittees or individuals, and repays him self  from  postelection gifts.  It has  become almost a modern spoils system.  In my judgment, this is an issue of  ethics. Before us  today, we have an  ethics  in  postemployment  bill. My  amendment requires ethics in postelec tion fundraising. In my judgment, it is  relevant. Further as I said, again, this  measure  is not something  that was  contentious in the discussions that we  held on this and other campaign fi nance proposals.  ",1988
769,1267,5,Mr. METZENBA UM.,  I understand  the Senator from Kentucky. Will he  yield for a question?  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.  ,1988
770,1267,5,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Does the Sena tor from Kentucky want to stand by  the  statement  that making  a  loan  from an outside source, from a bank,  for  example,  and  then  repaying  it  would be in violation? I do not believe  the language of your amendment so  states. I just want to be certain.  Mr. McCONNELL. It is  the  inten tion of the Senator from Kentucky to  prohibit a candidate for Federal office  from repaying either himself or a lead ing  institution,  from  contributions  raised from others once the election is  over.  ",1988
771,1267,5,Mr. METZENBAUM.," I am prepared  to accept it, but I do not want this col loquy on the floor of the Senate to be  interpreted as indicating that I think  that making a loan from a financial in stitution could not be  repaid after ward. I do not read the language that  way, but, obviously,  the language of  the legislation will speak for itself.  Mr. McCONNELL. It seems to me it  is a distinction without a difference, in  terms of the problem we are seeking to  get at there, whether the funds come  out of a candidate's savings account or  whether they come from an institu tion  from which  he  borrowed  the  money personally.  The problem that we are seeking to  address here  is putting up  a  large  amount of money or money that we  are obligated to repay and then, after  the election, going around recouping  those dollars from special interests or  from individuals. It would not entirely  solve the millionaire's loophole, which  was created by Buckley against Valeo,  but it would at least say that if you  are going to try to buy the election out  of your wealth, you better be pre pared, as my teenage daughter would  say, to eat the whole thing.  ",1988
772,1267,5,Mr. THURMOND.," As I understand  the purpose,  this amendment would  apply when a candidate is responsible  for the loan made to the campaign, is  that not correct?  the elec Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.  ",1988
773,1267,5,Mr. THURMOND.," And,  therefore,  he should not to be allowed to borrow  a large amount of money and loan it  to his campaign for election, and then  call on others to repay it?  Mr. McCONNELL. After  tion.  I would say to my friend from South  Carolina, this would not, in the opin ion of  the Senator from Kentucky,  prohibit a candidate to put in some of  his own money into a race early on in  a campaign just to solve a cash flow  problem and repay himself ..  ",1988
774,1267,5,Mr. THURMOND., Not prior to an  election.  Mr. McCONNELL.  It would  only  apply to the situation after the elec tion. That would seem to the Senator  from Kentucky to be an ethics viola tion.  ,1988
775,1267,5,Mr.  THURMOND.," Madam  Presi dent, we are willing to accept it on this  side.  ",1988
776,1267,5,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Madam Presi dent, I want to say that I want to be  fair to all parties concerned. I do not  have any problem with the thrust of  the Senator's amendment, but we are  in an election cycle at the moment. I  am prepared to represent on the floor  of the Senate that I have no intention  of doing anything prohibited by this  legislation and you have my word on it  that I will not. But there may be other  candidates  who  already  borrowed  money or have taken similiar steps.  Since the entire thrust of this legis lation is to be effective 9 months after  the date of enactment, if the Senator  from Kentucky would be willing  to  amend that language with respect to  applicability, which I think is entirely  fair,  then  I would be prepared  to  accept it.

802,1332,5,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of H.R.  2641,  the National Trails  System Act amendments and urge my col leagues  to suspend  the  rules and pass  this  legislation.  Since  enactment  of  the National  Trails  System Act,  the Federal Government has  been encouraging  the conversion of aban doned  railroad  tracks  into  trails  for hiking,  biking, jogging, and horseback riding. My own  State of Oklahoma has  taken advantage of  these programs  to develop  trails. The River  Parks Trail in Tulsa is an excellent example of  a  rails-to-trails conversion. The Tulsa River  parks system has become an  important part  of that city's recreation and tourism industry.  The Oklahoma State Department of Tour ism is working now to get access to an aban doned line for the creation of a trail between  the cities of Henryetta and Durant. The Tulsa  River  Parks Authority  also  is working  to  expand  the  trail system by converting addi tional nearby track  into trails. Oklahoma has  nearly 2,000 miles of abandoned railroad track  which could be converted  into a system of  trails.  Under existing law, taking advantage of the  rails-to-trails program  is not easy. State and  local governments face a mess of bureaucrat ic redtape at the  Interstate Commerce Com mission  to  get  access  to  the  abandoned  tracks. H.R. 2641 streamlines the process and  should lead to increased conversion of aban doned railroad tracks into recreational trails.  Oklahoma outdoor recreational activities al ready attract thousands of visitors each year.  Tourism is the State's third largest industry. A  statewide system of trails could complement  the existing outdoor resources and enhance  Oklahoma's tourism potential. H.R. 2641 will  make  it easier  for State and  local govern ments  to convert abandoned  railroad  tracks  into trails, increasing the State's attractiveness  as a vacation spot for out of State visitors and  expanding the recreational and fitness oppor tunities for residents within the State.  I am pleased to support this legislation and  I urge the House to vote ""yes"" on H.R. 2641.  ",1988
803,1332,5,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker, before us today  is  the National Trails System  Improvements  Act, H.R. 2641,  legislation  to encourage  the  conversion of abandoned  railroad  rights-of way on Federal  lands to recreational  trails.  I  urge support for this important measure.  The legislation would convert thousands of  miles of abandoned rail  lines into recreational  trails. Abandoned  railroads  follow a gentle  grade and are  ideal  for a number of  recre ational acativities. In addition, they would pro vide  for  important wildlife habitat and would  help prevent soil erosion. This bill would also  help to prevent further erosion of the Nation's  trail system.  It  is estimated  that  in  the next 15 years,  10,000 to 20,000 miles of Forest Service trails  will be  lost. The problem of increasing num bers of hikers and backpackers crowding onto  trails has diminished the value of the experi ence for many people and caused unaccept able environmental damage.  In the State of Washington alone, 48  loca tions have been identified in the Mount Baker Snoqualmie National Forest as being seriously  damaged due to the overuse of trails. At the  same  time  that  these wilderness areas are  being destroyed, other beautiful nonwilderness  areas  lie unused, simply because  they have  no trails.  Conservationists in Washington State have  recently proposed a Trails 2000 Program  to  rebuild  the  trail system  in Washington State.  The proposal would restore the trail system in  the State  to  the approximately 2,000 mile  system that existed in the late 1930's, by the  year 2000. Specifically,  it would replace land  lost to logging and off-road vehicles [ORV's],  and  reopen 200 miles of abandoned  trail  in  the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.  As  the population and  interest  in outdoor  recreation  increase,  the demand  for  trails  is  growing rapidly. This is especially true in those  natural areas  located close  to urban areas.  The  result  is overcrowding of  these hiking  trails and  damage  to adjacent areas. The  answer is an increased emphasis on the res toration, maintenance,  and  construction  of  hiking trails.  The legislation before us today provides an  opportunity  to  reverse  the  trend  toward a  shrinking  network of  trails  in  this  country.  Abandoned railroad  lines can be put to good  use by converting  them  to hiking  trails and  bike paths. Please join with me today in voting  to  support H.R.  2641,  the National Trails  System Improvement Act.  ",1988
804,1332,5,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2641,  the National Trails System Improvements Act  is a great idea. This bill will allow communities  in my district to take abandoned railroad beds  and  rights-of-way and convert  these  ribbons  of land into trails.  The real beauty of the bill  cost taxpayers a thing.  Miles of railroad track are abandoned each  year. With the right program to convert these  miles we can add considerably  to our park  and  recreation  inventory while not increasing  the budget burden.  Throughout  the country, suitable park and  recreation land is at a premium, and, while my  constituents are asking for a greater Federal  commitment to recreation, we are facing ever increasing pressure on  limited  financial  re sources.  Expanding our trail system is a good way to  balance our recreation needs with budgetary  is that it doesn't  restraints. A trail is a simple yet versatile rec reational asset. Plus, as more  land goes into  buildings, malls, and subdivisions, anything we  can do  to break up developed  tracts with  greenbelts will be appreciated now and in the  future.  I hope my colleagues will support Repre sentative BYRON'S hard work by  voting  to  pass H.R. 2641.  ",1988

808,1345,5,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, while being prepared  and strong in the preservation of our  own rights, we must never fail to ex plore  thoroughly with  the other su perpower  those  avenues which  can  lead to a  reduction  in  tensions. The  challenge is to make the world a safe  place within the national security in terests of both countries. That is vital.  One thing is for sure: There is over whelming  bipartisan  support  for  House Resolution 422,  legislation  in  support of the INF Treaty, in the Con gress and among the American people.  Support for this resolution, is support  for  something other  than an unre stricted, unregulated arms race. There  must  be  something better  for  the  future of mankind and it falls on the  leadership of both countries  to  take  the steps necessary to see if we cannot  arrive at that point.  Mr. Speaker,  credit  should go  to  President Reagan and this administra tion for negotiating the INF Treaty  and for continuing discussions on all  other matters of equal  importance strategic  arms  reductions,  chemical  warfare, nuclear testing, and ultimate ly and hopefully conventional arms re ductions.  As has been made clear by the lead ership in the executive branch and in  the Congress and restated by the gen tleman  from Michigan  [Mr. BROOM FIELD] and myself when we met with  General  Secretary  Gorbachev  in  Moscow, agreements in these areas are  welcome. Even though it might be dif ficult to conclude such agreements, it  is essential that we do so, and it is es sential that we get the approval of the  American people and the Congress of  the United States to do so.  Such action would lead to a  reduc tion  in  tensions between  the super powers and depends not only on these  agreements but on a whole host of  other issues which are interrelated but  do not necessarily have to be formally  linked but are linked as a matter of  fact. I shall only mention two. One is  regional disputes. There is no way that  any permanent reduction in tension or  way of life can be agreed to between  the superpowers  if  the Soviets have  the  idea that they can extend their  system with impunity whether by mili tary means  directly  or  indirectly,  whether  economically or politically,  directly or indirectly, anywhere in the  world. The Soviets cannot expect to do  this without meeting  a  challenge.  Right now that challenge is being pre sented  to  the Soviet Union by  the  United States and the West and other  peoples in the world.  Mr. Speaker, the saddle is on us be cause we are a superpower with the ca pability to fundamentally make that  challenge and we have done it and we  will continue to do it. There is no hope  for the future of mankind unless the  reduction in tensions between the su perpowers makes it possible for us to  live  together, and one of the things  that has to be considered in this strug gle is the fact that the Soviet Union  cannot go with impunity everywhere  in  the world and  try  to  impose  its  system without facing a challenge.  D 1330  Mr. Speaker, I think that the Ameri can people have made it abundantly  clear-not only  in the Persian Gulf,  but everywhere-that people have the  right to make their own decisions.  The other point, Mr. Speaker, is on  the question of human  rights. We  have made  it abundantly clear,  that  while it may be Soviet domestic policy,  the fact is that under generally accept ed principles of humanity and interna tionally-recognized  human  rights  standards. Soviet mistreatment of its  own people-whether they are Soviet  Jews, or Pentecostals, or  those who  simply want  to  express an  adverse  opinion, or commemorate the millen nium of Christianity in Kiev-will be  considered  by  reasonable  people  in  other parts of the world to be brutaliz ing of their own people and that will  be an obstacle to the reduction of ten sions between superpowers.  We have seen an amelioration on the  part of  the Soviet Union under the  leadership of Gorbachev. We should  welcome this. We may have reserva tions, we may be concerned, but on all  of these issues there has been some  change.  We in the United States, the West  and in the free world need to continue  to  be  strong  enough  and willing  enough to take up that challenge to do  everything we can in order to make  the world not only a safer place  in  which  to  live, but a more pleasant  place in which to live.  So, Mr. Speaker, ratification of the  INF Treaty, which House Resolution  422 supports is a historical step, not  only in the history of this country, but  ",1988
809,1371,5,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1988

""Vote no on  the previous question."" So yes,  they  understand what is going on here.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia [Mr. BLILEYl.  ",1988
813,1371,5,Mr. BLILEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong opposition to the rule before us  today.  I oppose  this rule because  it  represents  just one more attempt to  sidestep  the  issue  of  dial-a-porn  through clever procedural gimmicks.  It's precisely this type of gimmickry  that has put us in the situation we're  in today.  Five years ago, I began the crusade  against dial-a-porn when I sought to  have this type of service banned from  our  Nation's  telephone  system  through an amendment  to  the FCC  authorization bill. Unfortunately, the  amendment was altered in a manner  that, for the first time, legalized com mercial obscenity over the phone lines.  A vote for this rule is-in essence-a  vote to maintain the only place in the  entire United States Code where com mercial obscenity is given legal protec tion.  That is precisely the thrust of the  language that is included in the con ference report-language that was in cluded in the conference report with out the conferees on that issue ever  having met in open public session as  required by rule 28 clause 6.  Let's look for a moment at the pro posed conference language. Will it be  effective? No; the FCC, as the expert  agency in the field of telecommunica tions, has provided us with an analysis  of the conference language, They say  it won't work. What effect will it have  on live, obscene sex services that are  billed through personal credit cards?  Absolutely none. What effect will  it  have on dial-a-porn services where the  phone company provides billing infor mation to the dial-a-porn vendors, but  doesn't do the billing itself? Absolute ly none. What about rural areas where  digital  switching  technology  is  not  available and phone companies do not  have  the  ability  to block customer  phones? No effect. What about pay  phones? No effect. What new burdens  or  obligations  does  the  conference  report language place on: dial-a-porn  vendors? None. It doesn't impose one  ",1988
814,1488,5,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. MARTINEZ].  ",1988
815,1488,5,Mr. MARTINEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to support the bill and to commend  Chairman HAWKINS on the excellent  job he's done in providing us with a  bill that truly deserves bipartisan support.    His staff and all of the conferees'  staff should be commended also  for  their outstanding effort to resolve the  differences of the Members and  the  House and the Senate.  It is approriate  that  this bill has  been named in recognition of Chair man Gus HAWKINS who, as a Member  of the House for the past 26 years, has  been one of the most stalwart advo cates of education and training pro grams in this effort to open opportuni ties for all Americans.  H.R. 5 reauthorizes over a dozen ele mentary and secondary education pro grams.  It strengthens accountability  by ensuring program improvement in  schools with  lagging chapter  I  pro grams; it sets priorities for chapter II  block grants, and strengthens data col lection and evalation, as well as  re forming audit procedures.  The compromise on N AEP strikes a  reasonsable balance and it helps meet  our nation's need for quality information  on  educational  achievement,  while  avoiding  wasteful  spending,  biased or misleading data, or creation  of a national curriculum.  Kindergarten is too late if we want  cost-effective  educational  excellence.  Head Start and other programs show  that an ""ounce of prevention"" in early  childhood education boosts  achieve ment and saves  taxpayer dollars by  preempting  school  failure,  dropping  out, and unemployment problems. The  Federal Government saves $6 eventu ally  for every dollar spent on high  quality preschool programs. The ""even  start"" program will provide preschool  education  to younger children,  and  provide a bridge between Head Start  and programs for older disadvantaged  children.  Mr.  Speaker,  another  important  aspect of the bill deals with our Na tion's high dropout rate. Dropping out  of  school means  dropping  off  the  ladder of achievement and economic  independence. H.R.  5  establishes  a  Dropout Prevention Program to keep  at-risk students in school and to help  those who have dropped out get back  into the classroom.  At a  time when command of  lan guages  is  increasingly  important for  American competitiveness and securi ty,  and when  the  limited English  school population is growing at a rate  three times that of the general school  population, America needs to invest in  our language resources. Bilingual edu cation and improved foreign language  education programs do this.  As author of  the  legislation  reau thorizing  the Emergency  Immigrant  Education Act, and coauthor of the  legislation reauthorizing bilingual edu cation I've worked with other Mem bers to meet this important need.  With  other Members  we  have  worked for flexibility in bilingual edu cation  including  acceptance  of  the  Senate provisions on  innovative pro grams  and  improved  assessment of  achievement in building English lan guage proficiency. Along with foreign  language programs, developmental bi lingual classes that build student pro ficiency in two languages are an essen tial part of America's investment  in  language resources for commerce and  community. The department currently  funds just 2 developmental programs accounting for one fourth of 1 percent  of part a funds. It is essential that title  VII's  flexibility  include  increased  funding  for developmental bilingual  programs. Other changes in title VII  strengthen parent  involvement  and  enhance service to minority language  handicapped students.  It is ironic that America's first chil dren have yet to receive the kind of  educational services they are entitled  to-in part due  to  the department's  effort  to  unreasonably  restrict  the  participation of LEP American Indian  ",1988
816,1501,5,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support  of the School Improvement Act of 1988. I am  especially pleased that drug abuse education  has been extended in this legislation.  Our children are our future and they are en dangered by drugs and  the criminal activity  that surrounds  it. Although  the national  inci dence of drug abuse is decreasing, its use by  children  is  increasing dramatically. Drug use,  in part, accounts for the marked  increase  in  violent activity by children in recent years. Acto Mr. Payne of New York's Family  cording  Court:  We've had almost a 50-percent incease in  drug crime. Crack is the main reason. We  are seeing kids as young as 10 or 11. They  can make $800 a week. They only stay in  school because that's where their constitu ency is.  Children are used as lookouts and couriers  for gangs running drugs. Police in Washington,  DC, have discovered  that child couriers are  used  to escort drugs on planes  from New  York City to Washington, DC.  Children  in  the  inner city are  in greater  danger of being drawn into increasingly violent  gangs, gangs  that are better equipped with  the weapons that their drug money affords.  According to an investigator in the Manhat tan homicide unit,  the new gangs seem  to  have ""less respect for human life"" than previ ous and older drug dealers.  They kill to intimidate.  They shoot their victims in public, crowded  places, often in broad daylight: walking up to  them and  shooting  them  several  times at  point-blank range.  A New York Times article tells of two sus pected gang members who were shot and  wounded as  they alighted  from a Mercedes  limousine. An 18-year-old woman  in  the car  was shot and paralyzed; her 6-month-old fetus  was killed.  By supporting measures against drugs, we  in Congress reaffirm our commitment to eradi cating  substance  abuse  in  our  Nation's  schools, college campuses, and communities.  The School  Improvement Act will provide for  drug abuse education, counseling,  family and  school based prevention programs, treatment,  referral and  training.  I urge passage of  the  conference report.  ",1988
817,1501,5,Mr. DREIER.," of California. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in support of the conference report to ac company H.R. 5,  the comprehensive 5-year  reauthorization of most Federal elementary,  secondary, and adult education programs.  H.R.  5  increases  Federal  authorization  levels  for education programs by about $1.5  billion a year. Among  the programs reauthor ized by H.R. 5 are chapter 1, supplementary  services for educationally disadvantaged chil dren; chapter 2, a flexible block grant program  for State and local educational agencies; math  and science programs; magnet schools;  the  Drug-free Schools and Communities Act;  the  Indian Education Act; and  Impact Aid. H.R. 5  provides additional funding for alternative bilin gual education programs such as ""English as  a second language"" and ""immersion"" and es tablishes a number of new programs,  includ ing Even Start,  to provide educational and  social  services  to very young  children and  their parents; ""Star Schools,"" to support edu cation by satellite technology; and a dropout prevention program for secondary school stu dents.  I am especially pleased that we will have an  opportunity  to vote on a provision  to bring  dial-a-porn  telephone services  to an end.  I  have  received hundreds of  letters  from my  constituents who share my outrage over these  obscene telephone services and want to see  the Federal Government intervene.  In 1983, Congress passed an amendment,  with my support, to the Federal Communications Commission reauthorization bill to outlaw  sexually explicit telephone communications to  minors. The FCC has attempted to satisfy the  requirements of  this amendment  twice,  yet  neither attempt has survived court challenges.  A third attempt was proposed last July, but no  final rules have yet to be issued. The problem  with the 1983 amendment is finding a way to  differentiate between the minor and adult call ers.  Rather than continue the search for a way  to satisfy  the  1983 amendment,  the Bliley  amendment prohibits dial-a-porn services alto gether,  for both minor and adult callers. As  originally brought before the House, H.R. 5 did  not  include  the Bliley  language,  so  I am  pleased that we will now have an opportunity  to vote on the Bliley language and I am hope ful that it will pass.  Again, Mr. Speaker,  I support  the confer ence report accompanying H.R. 5 because it  recognizes the importance of education of our  Nation's children  and  I support  the Bliley  amendment which prohibits obscene dial-a porn telephone services.  ",1988
818,1501,5,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  strong support of the conference agreement  on  the school  improvement amendments. As  a member of  the conference committee,  I  commend  the chairman and my conference  colleagues for their bipartisan efforts. I believe  we have a strong and effective omnibus edu cation package dedicated  to excellence  in  education.  These amendments reauthorize 14 Federal  elementary and secondary programs, extend ing  them  through 1993  to avoid a  ""patch  work"" approach  to our most vital asset:  the  education of our children.  In the future, these  programs will be considered comprehensively  so as  to better coordinate education policy  and resources.  The core of  this  legislation  is chapter 1 ,  compensatory  education  for  disadvantaged  children. Education enhances one's daily life  but more  importantly,  education  can  help  break the cycle of poverty. Chapter 1 is com mitted to just that:  improving the educational  achievements of disadvantaged children to in crease  their opportunities as well as enrich  their lives.  The changes adopted in this bill greatly im prove chapter 1 . First, chapter 1 is expanded  into  preschools  and  secondary  schools.  Second,  funds will be  targeted  for dropout  prevention, a critical problem for minority and  disadvantaged  students.  The  amendments  also target funds to those with greatest need.  As  the representative of a rural State,  I was  pleased agreement was reached on a concen tration grant  formula which shifts a greater  portion of funds to poor, rural areas.  The school improvement amendments also  reauthorize  the Bilingual Education Act. My  district is over 40-percent Hispanic. Thus, the  Spanish  language  is an  integral part of our  culture and heritage. More importantly, Span ish  is often the first language of many of our  children. As a result, I want to emphasize the  importance of developmental programs in the  Bilingual  Education Act. Developmental  or  dual language programs are an effective way  to bridge  the gap  in acquiring English  Ian",1988

851,1540,5,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, even pithy col umnist George Will has outdone himself with a  superlative piece on the importance of the Na tion's infrastructure, appearing in  the April 25  issue of Newsweek.  [From Newsweek, Apr. 25, 1988]  LISTEN TO THE BRIDGES  <By George F. Will)  New York, New York,  it's a wonderful  town [song-writers are not under oath], the  Bronx is up and the Battery's down. And so,  almost, is the Williamsburg Bridge. That 85year-old suspension span across  the East  River connects Manhattan with America,  which may not be in the national interest,  but nearly a quarter of a million people use  in daily. Used it. Since last Tuesday only pe destrians and bicyclists do. It is not quite  collapsing-yet-but it is unsafe for vehicu lar traffic, and that is a considerable defect  in a bridge.  The discovery  last week of  its corroded  condition was serendipitous. The discovery  occurred while  the three surviving Demo cratic presidential candidates were careering  around the Empire State promising to make  America into a paradise and, in their spare  time, pacify  the Middle East. The mere  crumbling of a bridge  is  too mundane a  matter to arrest the attention of candidates  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  who are bent on the betterment of all man kind. However,  the sounds made by  that  tired  old  bridge <it was  screeching  and  squealing ominously) should be listened to.  It tells us more about our future than the  candidates do. The nation has a huge bill  coming due for the neglect of its infrastruc ture, meaning bridges, roads, airports, wa terways, water and sewer systems-all the  things that make everything else possible.  This neglect, which reflects a weak ethic  of common provision, may be consequence  of our  individualism.  Individually, Ameri cans are exercising more and eating more  sensibly  to maintain  their personal  infra structures while the nation's physical plant  deteriorates. In the years dead ahead that  physical plant is going to force itself upon  our attention. It will be something to think  about while we creep along in increasingly  congested  traffic, or wait for our delayed  flights to take off at overburdened airports.  The National Journal reports that one out  of  four  bridges  is  considered dangerous.  More than 4,100 are closed. Every two days  a bridge collapses. Sixty-five percent of the  Interstate Highway System is in need of re habilitation. The average age of  the 1984  principal  locks  on  the  inland waterway  system is 40 years. The Army Corps of Engi neers says 3,000 dams in populated areas are  hazardous. Air traffic has doubled in the 14  years since the last new commercial airport  <Dallas-Ft. Worth)  opened.  Los Angeles  needs to spend $111 million more every year  just repairing streets or 60 percent of them  will be unusable by the end of the century.  The Environmental Protection Agency says  $108 billion will be needed between now and  then just for construction of new sewage  treatment plants.  OK, some of these numbers may involve  overreaching and attention seizing and an  appetite  for pork. Still,  there are many  needs and not enough money. The cost of  public-works investment is substantial, but  so is the cost of underinvestment. Millions  of worker-years are lost as congestion and  detours sap economic efficiency. The cost of  Los Angeles County congestion is estimated  to be nearly half a million hours a day and  half a billion dollars' worth of working time  <and 72 million gallons of gas) a year. Unfor tunately, blocking the road to a solution is a  mountain-Mount Deficit.  The deficit is the numerical expression of  a cultural tendency, the national tendency  to  live  for  the moment and beyond our  means, consuming more  than we produce  and investing too little, heedless about the  future. A government devoting 14 percent of  its budget to pay interest on its debts-to  rent money-has not enough money for the  physical prerequisites of efficient and com modious  living. Four federal  trust funds highway, transit, aviation and waterways had a combined cash balance of about $24  billion at the end of 1987, all of it from user  fees that can be spent only on infrastruc ture. But our leaders, ever  imaginative at  cooking the books to make the deficit seem  smaller than it is, are hoarding the money.  This is done so that deficit estimates will be  smaller and the Gramm-Rudman knife will  be easier to avoid.  INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS  An earlier, more robust America had more  energetic  leaders  regarding  ""internal  im provements."" On March 9, 1832, a candidate  for the Illinois General Assembly distribut ed an open  letter  to  the people of his  county. The first plank in his platform was:  ""Time and experience have verified        the  public  utility  of  internal  improveApril 19, 1988  ments,""  such  as  roads  and  navigable  streams. Lincoln lost, but he soon won and  authored a flurry of bills such as those per taining to ""a state road from the Wabash to  the yellow banks of the Mississippi River""  and ""a canal upon the valley of the Sanga mon River.""  In 1808  Jefferson's Treasury  secretary,  Albert Gallatin,  issued  his  ""Report  on  Roads and Canals,"" a proposed network of  projects, most of which were built over 60  years. It is unfortunate they were not built  sooner. In 1816 John C. Galhoun, who even tually would sow seeds of secession, intro duced a bill for  internal improvements at  federal expense. He warned that New York  and other Northern states had public and  private  financial  resources  sufficient  for  such improvements, but that the South did  not. Without federal help the South would  be consigned to inferiority, and ""disunion""  might result. President Madison,  taking a  crabbed view of federal power, vetoed the  bill  as  unconstitutional. Denied  federal  help,  the South's dependence on slavery  grew, as did its sense of separateness.  Disunion is not a danger today. Decay is.  That is a pity because public works are the  sort of things government is good at. The  Tennessee Valley Authority and the Inter state Highway System were not just good in  themselves, they were good for the morale  of government, which  periodically needs  some inspiriting successes. Alas, in election  years we have this sort of dispiriting experi ence:  You are driving warily down a street cra tered with potholes deep enough to serve as  silos for the MX missile. Your car radio is  emitting the sounds of candidates promising  to provide ""meaningful jobs"" and ""a sense  of community""  in ""model cities""  in a dis armed world. And  you  are  thinking  (if  thinking is possible as you jolt along, your  radio chattering and radial tires disintegrat ing): Thanks a lot, but could we please start  our  trip  to utopia on a well-paved street  leading to a structurally sound bridge?  WORLD POPULATION  AWARENESS WEEK  HON. STEPHEN J. SOLARZ  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 19, 1988  ",1988
852,1540,5,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  today to call the attention of my colleagues to  the statement of the Honorable Mario Cuomo,  Governor of New York, proclaiming the week  of April 17-23 to be ""World Population Aware ness Week.""  The global problem of overpopulation is one  which  requires  long-term attention and plan ning. Overpopulation has disastrous conse quences, especially  for  those nations which  already  face any sort of  resource shortage.  The problems of inadequate health care, envi ronmental decay, and poverty are worsened  when a nation has no strategic population  policy.  I commend Governor Cuomo for his recog nition of this serious issue.  The following is a proclamation of the State  of New York, executive chamber.  ",1988
853,1553,5,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, last weekend the  town of Erving celebrated its 150th anniversa ry. I want to offer my sincerest congratulations  to Erving on  the achievement of  this mile stone. While  the  festivities  commemorating  the  town's 150 years will continue all year,  last weekend this Franklin County community  celebrated  in a unique way-in a way  that  tells us a lot about the town of Erving. Aside  from dining and dancing  together  last week end, the people of Erving lent historic posses sions and photographs  for a display at  the  Erving Elementary School, so  that their chil dren may learn more about the origins of their  town. Later this year, neighbors will open their  historic homes to each other to share in the  rich history of this tightly knit community.  It is telling that these good folks came to gether  to celebrate. The citizens of Erving  pride themselves on their close community of  neighbors. Pride and camaraderie are strong  bonds which bring  them together to share in  the history of this hard-working New England  mill town. These are truly American people.  Mr. Speaker, in 1752, John Erving first pur chased  the  land  that now bears his name.  However,  the  first settler didn't arrive until  1801, when Col. Asaph White, supervising the  construction of the 5th Massachusetts Turn pike, settled in Erving. There he built a house,  a sawmill, and a dam across Miller's River.  The abundance of lumber and water power at tracted other settlers. Its numbers still grow ing,  the  town of Erving was  incorporated  in  1838.  In  those early days, Erving was a  lumber  town, with numerous woodworking shops, a  chair  factory and a piano case  factory. The  Erving Paper Co. was  founded  in 1905 and  has grown to become one of Franklin County's major employers. This  firm  is a principal  supplier of paper goods to the Nation and the  Nation's Government.  Paper  napkins  from  Erving bearing  the Great Seal of  the United  States can be  found  in American embassies  around the world.  This hardworking community has also been  a responsible one. The town's commitment to  its environment began when the Civilian Con servation Corps  first beautified Laurel Lake  and the surrounding Erving State Forest in the  1930's. More recently, the  town and  the  in dustries of Erving have launched a program to  clean up the river that has allowed its paper  industry to flourish. The town Selectmen, the  industries and  the Federal Government com bined forces to return Miller's River to a clean  and natural state so that it could be used for  recreation and the enjoyment of all.  I remember the honor of participating in the  celebrations marking  the  opening  of  the  wastewater treatment plant in 1975. This am bitious town wasn't content with resting on its  laurels. The  same  celebration marked  the  ground-breaking of yet another sewage treat ment plant. Just 2 years later, I was back for  .  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the opening of that plant, which today refines  30 million gallons of waste water a day from  the Erving Paper Mill as well as domestic  sewage from the town of Erving.  Since that time Erving has been able to add  to these facilities in order to continue the fight  against pollution.  I proudly salute  this  town  which has committed  itself  to maintaining a  clean, healthy environment, and hold it up to  you today as a model for others to follow.  While a  look at Erving's past  shows a  strong history of community spirit,  I urge you  to visit the town today.  It is a real pleasure.  The present citizens of Erving are as strong,  hard-working, and community-minded as their  forebearers, with  the same commitment  to  maintaining  the beauty and  friendliness  of  their beloved town.  Mr. Speaker,  the celebration planned  for  this 150th anniversary is yet another example  of  the commitment  felt by  the  residents of  Erving  to  their community. Without a doubt,  the people of Erving have banded together to  create a sense of community not  found  in  most areas. The people of Erving have good  reason  to be proud of  their town, and  I am  pleased to pay tribute to Erving on the occa sion of this auspicious 150th anniversary.  JOHN L. DESMET RECEIVES  GEICO PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD  HON. G.V. (SONNY) MONTGOMERY  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 19, 198 8  ",1988
854,1553,5,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  ear.h  year since 1980, the Government Employees  Insurance Co. [GEICO] has recognized Feder al employees  for  their outstanding contribu tions to and special achievements in the Fed eral system. Award  recipients  represent  the  very best in Government. GEICO Public Serv ice Award recipients are selected based upon  their contribution  to  the public good and  the  extent to which they serve as an inspiration to  others,  thereby bringing credit to the Federal  service.  Five times since the award's inception, em ployees of the Veterans' Administration have  been  recognized  for  their particular contribu tions to that fine system and to our Nation's  veterans whom it serves.  This year, on March 14,  the GEICO Public  Service Award  in  the  field of alcoholism pre vention and  treatment was given to Mr. John  L. Desmet, chief of the Alcohol and Depend ency Treatment Program at the Veterans' Ad ministration Medical Center in Roseburg, OR.  Mr. DeSmet was recognized  for his contribu tion both professionally at  the VA hospital  where he has served since 1975, as well as in  the community at large. He has organized VA  alcohol and drug  treatment programs  in his  medical district  into an  informal network  to  better enable  them  to  respond  to patient  needs. He has also served on many communi ty boards and task forces oriented toward the  problems of alcoholism and drug abuse. And  he devotes much of his free time  to provide  alcohol education  in schools and other com munity settings.  7529  Mr. Speaker, alcoholism touches the lives of  some 17 million Americans. The  tragedy of  this disease cannot be overstated. Therefore,  the contributions of John Desmet and others  like him who have devoted their  lives to as sisting  individuals afflicted with alcoholism to  help them overcome that burden are most sig nificant.  Mr. Speaker, John DeSmet typifies the out standing commitment, dedication and skill re flected in the performance of so many Veter ans' Administration employees. Their dedica tion to serving that very special clientele, our  Nation's veterans,  is an occasion of pride to  me personally as chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, and should be for all Amer icans as well.  THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF  THE TUNA CLUB  HON. ELTON GALLEGLY  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 19, 1988  ",1988
855,1553,5,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, on  the occa sion of the 90th anniversary of the Tuna Club  of Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, CA, I extend  my sincere congratulations to the oldest fish ing club in the United States.  The Tuna Club board of directors, President  8.G. Williams, Vice President Jim Martin, Sec retary Harry Westover, Treasurer Albert Her bold, and Director David Denholm, lead a cur rent membership of over 200 honorary, senior,  active, and associate members.  The Tuna Club was organized June  15,  1898, by  ""the  little band of six,"" under  the  leadership of Dr. Charles Fredrick Holder. Dr.  Holder,  rightfully  called  the  ""father of  the  Tuna Club,"" had heard of a wonderful game  fish, then called ""leaping tuna,"" that surround ed Santa Catalina Island. He used his experi ence with  salmon  to work out  tackle  that  would be of sufficient strength  to cope with  the mighty fish.  It was his desire to give the  quarry a better than even chance of survival,  matching human skills against the instinct and  strength of  the  fish. On June 1, 1898, Dr.  Holder successfully landed a 183-pound tuna  with  rod and  reel,  the  first such catch on  record.  The charter members decided  ""the object  of this club is the protection of game fishes of  the State of California and to discourage hand  line  fishing as unsportsmanlike and against  the public interest.""  Little has changed in the goals of the Tuna  Club  in  the ensuing 90 years. Current Tuna  Club angling and tournament rules state ""the  underlying spirit of angling should be that it is  a sport in which the skill of the angler is pitted  against  instinct and strength of the  fish,""  to  that end,  it  is common  for Tuna Club mem bers to fish for and catch tuna and marlin with  line testing 12, 20, or 30 pounds. These fish  can weigh in exces of 250 pounds. In addition  to  fishing with  light tackle, Tuna Club mem bers  in  the  interest of conservation, consist ently catch and release more game fish annu ally than they take.  Salt water fishing today is recognized as a  multi-million dollar industry. Tackle and fishing  ",1988

857,23,11,Mr. STEVE  GUNDERSON.,  ,1988
858,23,11,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  want to compliment the gentlewoman  from Nebraska for her work on this  bill, and obviously it is a piece of legis lation I will be supporting.  But I have consistently come to the  floor over the last few years to discuss  funding  for  the Commodity Credit  Corporation. Unfortunately I  think I  ought to forewarn my colleagues that  the chances are very good we will be  back with a supplemental appropria tion to fully fund the CCC based on  this  legislation. The  reality  is  this  year, we are spending $211 billion for  the CCC. The President asked for $9.8  billion  for 1989;  the committee bill  before us only appropriates $6.8 bil lion. So  there  is  a  significant gap  there.  The committee assumes that the $3  billion difference between their fund ing level and the administration's can  be made up by selling off $3 billion of  ",1988
859,36,11,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Chairman, I re serve a  point of order against  the  amendment.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Let  me indicate at the outset, Mr. Chair man, this is an amendment that I feel  very strongly about but I understand  that a point of order may rest against  the amendment and I would expect to  withdraw the amendment. But I do  wish to introduce the amendment, to  offer it at this time and explain it to  Members of  the House and explain  what we might do as a result of the  point of order this morning, what we  might do to try to pursue it.  This deals with  the drought. We  have had some discussions today. The  gentleman from Minnesota described  what is happening in the part of the  country  that  is  suffering  from  the  drought.  Let me say that this san urgent situ ation. This is not just somebody saying  we have not had enough rain so we are  not getting the yields on our crops  that we would expect.  We have a very urgent situation in  our part of the country. We are going  to lose about one-half of our crop ac cording  to  economists  at our  land  grant college.  0 1155  One-half of our crop is gone even if  it rains from today until the end of  July. We have already lost a substan tial amount of our crop. This is a dev astating economic calamity to a State  like North Dakota. If you lose half of  the income from the single largest in dustry in your State, you have very se rious problems.  What does this mean when you lose  half your income? Well, it means that  you have suffered the kind of drought  where we have had less rain in some  parts of North Dakota than we had in  the 1930's. That is the kind of condi tions we have out there.  What happens  to  the agricultural  producer, the farmer?  (a) They  lose  their crop, and  then  (b)  the target  price for wheat, corn, or barley that  they expected to get, which represents  a price the Government would like to  see  them  receive, which  represents  something close to the cost of produc tion-not quite, but something close to  it-the target price provides a deficien cy payment to the farmer which repre sents  the  difference  between  the  target price and the market price.  The problem  is  that  the drought  means  less product,  less wheat,  less  barley, and less corn is produced, and,  therefore,  the market  price  is  in creased. But that does not help the  farmer because most of the farmers do  not  have  any  crop.  So while  the  market prices increase and the farmer  is sitting there without a crop to take  advantage of  the market price  in crease, the market price increase then  reduces the deficiency payment to the  farmer,  because  the  difference  be tween the market price and the target  price  represents  the deficiency. The  farmers, therefore, become double vic tims here. No. 1, they lose their crop;  and No. 2,  they lose their deficiency  payment  because  the  drought  in creases market prices for which they  had no crop  to market, and  it de pressed their deficiency price.  What I would like to do is provide  some protection for  those deficiency  prices in order to try to minimize the  damage. One way to do that is to use  the Low-Yield Disaster Program that  was put in place in the 1985 farm bill.  I had a resolution to offer, and that  has now been  introduced, and  this  amendment asks the Secretary of Ag riculture to use, if necessary, the Low Yield Disaster Program for that pur pose to try to make whole those farm ers on the deficiency payment.  The gentleman from Kansas  [Mr.  GLICKMAN], when I talked to him the  other day about it, said that that is ex actly what the Low-Yield Disaster Pro gram was designed for, just exactly for  this kind of situation.  I understand that a point of order  will rest against this amendment, and  I,  therefore, will withdraw it at the  end of my 5 minutes. But I would like  to state  that  the chairman of  the  Committee on Agriculture said that he  supports  this amendment.  I  visited  with my friend, the gentlewoman from  Nebraska [Mrs. SMITH], and she sup ports this general concept. The chair man of the Committee on Agriculture  indicates that he will bring this with  me to the drought task force which  has been formed and will attempt to  move this along.  Again let me say that we have an  urgent problem, and I think the pro ducers across this country are trying  to analyze what we can do about it.  We cannot make it rain, but we surely  can use  the disaster and emergency  programs that are available in an at tempt to minimize the economic ca lamity that exists in the farm belt.  ",1988

861,36,11,Mr. COLEMAN  of Missouri.," Mr.  Chairman, the gentleman has stated  the problem, and  that  is  that  the  target prices and the cash prices, be cause  of  the  artificial  prices  the  drought has created, have put a crimp  in the farm program as we envisioned  it, and I would welcome the gentle man's cosponsorship of a bill which I  dropped  in  4823,  which attempts to say also that where  we have advanced deficiency payments  yesterda~. H.R.  ",1988
862,49,11,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," That is my con cern. I have no quarrel with the distin guished chairman whom I appreciate  very much, and whom I  respect and  admire. I know that in his heart he is  always trying to do what is best.  My concern is that these examples,  if they do not legislate, they are on  the verge of legislation and we are set ting a dangerous precedent, by going  beyond the norm of the authorizing  legislation in perhaps what could be  parliamentarily acceptable, but if it is  not, then switching to the report and  giving guidance beyond the norm of  the statute and/or  the  authorizing  committee's intent. I would hope that  as we continue to work in the future,  that  the distinguished chairman of  the Committee on Appropriations and  the members of the Committee on Ap propriations  know  and  understand  that we are readily available, that we  are  in  cooperating with  them, that we are in good faith willing  to work with them and that there is  no problem that, together, we cannot  resolve for the benefit of those whom  we attempt to serve.  Are there any further amendments  to title I?  ",1988
863,49,11,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words and then I hope we can move  ahead.  intP!""<:;~l,e~  Mr. Chairman, we have made this  point many times that the report is  not the law, that is true. The report is  the intention of the subcommittee and  the full committee. Sec. 1301 of title  31 of the United States Code provides  that money shall be spent for the pur pose for which appropriated, and the  report is the best evidence of what was  intended. So putting the two together,  it is binding on anybody who wants to  follow what Congress intended.  May  I point out  that  in 8 years,  261,000 farmers have gone broke, hun dreds  have  committed  suicide. The  farmers are  the only group  in  the  world that was  told by the Govern ment they had to pay in 1 year every thing they owed. This occurred even  though the Government caused their  financial problems by withholding the  farmers  commodities off  the world  markets and by using the PIK pro gram. Under PIK we reduced 11 per cent of our production while our com petitors overseas increased their pro duction by 11 percent.  Now we have an amendment that is  coming up that will make it so  the  farmer is the only one in the country  who will not be able to get re-estab lished  after  the Government  has  caused his financial problems. Farm ing  is  the biggest  industry we have.  Without it the rest of the country will  go down. May I say that in the last 8  years our national debt increased from  $900 billion to $2.6 trillion.  Our exports have gone  to where  they are far below our imports. We  look on every hand and see what has  happened over the last 8 years. We  need the gentleman from Texas's help,  we need everybody's help if our coun try is going to bail out of its financial  difficulties. Under present conditions  foreign countries are buying up our  country right and left.  As I point out in our report and this  appeared in The Washington Post on  March 13:  During the past five years nearly $800 bil lion  in foreign capital washed across  the  United States buying up companies, banks,  luxury hotels,  retail chains, building new  factories, established bank accounts, and fi nancing a major portion of  the national  debt.  Now can you tell me that it will ever  be sound for us to do what this amend ment wants to do? Is it sound to tell a  farmer who lost his farm because the  Government would not sell his prod uct in world trade, that the Govern ment now will not help you straighten  it out?  I just cannot believe it.  Their is no reason to argue whether  the report is binding or not, because it  is clear what was intended and that is  the best evidence of what the appro priation is for. So putting the two to gether it should be binding.  Now I agree with my colleague from  Texas that the group in charge of ag",1988
864,62,11,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from New York [Mr. LAFALCE]  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1988
865,62,11,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, for the past 6  years,  I have been closely  involved  in  the  issue of Third World debt.  I consistently sup ported the administration and, specifically, the  Treasury Department  in  their efforts to deal  with this crisis. In 1985, when Secretary Baker  announced his three-pronged strategy aimed  at encouraging growth,  I once again offered  my whole-hearted support.  We  now  have  the  benefit of hindsight.  Nearly  three  years  after  the  Secretary's  speech in Seoul, the situation has shown very  little  improvement.  Administration  rhetoric  aside, debtor countries are not growing their  way out of  the debt problem.  Instead,  they  have had to endure a reverse net transfer of  resources amounting  to some $30 billion a  year.  in other words, underdeveloped coun tries are  transferring  to developed countries  about $30 billion more than they are receiving.  This is unconscionable and unsustainable.  Standards of living continue to fall or stag nate in most debtor countries, debt servicing  ratios are not improving, and  if interest rates  bump up, we could be  faced with  imminent  disaster.  The solution  is not to continue  to muddle  through hoping that somehow voluntary com mercial  lending will  resume and  resolve  the  problem. The  current situation demands a  concerted effort on the part of the major in dustrialized countries to find ways  to reduce  the total stock of Third World debt.  Our European  allies  have  recently  an nounced their intention to forgive some loans  to the world's poorest countries  in order  to  ease the enormous burden of debtor nations.  These proposals put forth by the French and  the Germans would primarily help  to relieve  the debt obligations of sub-Saharan African  countries. It is especially encouraging to note  that these proposals are likely to be discussed  at the upcoming Economic Summit in Toronto.  I was pleased to Jearn of Secretary Baker's  comments at the recent annual meeting of the  African Development Bank.  In  those com ments, he outlined that the United States was  no longer going to stand in the way of interest  rate relief or debt forgiveness offered by other  governments in the case of the poorest Afri can countries. However, the administration re mains instransigent on the real issues related  to Third World debt. As Secretary Baker ad mitted  in  his  testimony before  the House  Banking Committee  yesterday,  ""more  still  needs to be done"" to alleviate this problem.  He claims he remains open to various debt re duction schemes as  long as they are volun tary. But the so-called flexibility of the Baker  plan has yet to be demonstrated.  The Reagan administration has a rare and  final opportunity to show its commitment to re solving  this  crisis. By  including  the much  greater problem of debts owed by the larger  Latin American countries on the agenda of the  Economic Summit, Secretary Baker would  truly be confronting this problem. Many of our  allies hoped that by placing the issue of debt  relief  for  the poorest African nations on  the  Toronto agenda, we could begin  to address  the  new  approaches  being  developed  to  reduce Third World debt.  One such approach worthy of serious con sideration is that outlined by James Robinson,  chairman of American Express. Mr. Robinson,  like many in the business community, has rec ognized that it is in our own best interest to  find imaginative new solutions to the problem  of debt. The prospects  for  improving U.S.  trade with Latin America are dim unless the  debt service obligations of these countries are  significantly reduced.  I would strongly urge President Reagan and  Secretary Baker  to  raise  the  issue of Third  World debt at  the next week's summit. By  continuing to dig in  its heels, the administra tion only perpetuates this crisis, and ultimately  could precipitate an even more devastating  disaster.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  ",1988

870,62,11,Mr.  LEVINE  of  California.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank very much the gen tleman from Texas [Mr. GoNZALEZ] for  his graciousness in yielding to my spe cial order.  Mr. Speaker, this special order today  that I have called pertains to the Jap anese  noncompliance with market  access provisions of the United States Japan semiconductor agreement, and I  called this special order at this time to  bring this matter to the attention of  my colleagues  just before the Presi dent begins to engage in the economic  summit meetings  that  he will  be  having next week.  Mr. Speaker, I come to the House  floor raising this issue from a back ground of generally opposing what  had been labeled protectionist amend ments  and provisions of  legislation  that have come before this body in the  three  terms  in which I have served  here in the House. Members who are  familiar with my own voting record  and my own attitudes and views with  regard to issues that have been I think  oversimplified  in  terms of being  la beled between free trade and protec tionism will see that my votes fall very  much on the so-called free trade side  of that spectrum. And I have consist ently resisted and opposed a variety of  efforts to move toward a much more  restrictive  and  protectionist  trade  regime.  It is with that background in mind,  Mr. Speaker, that I felt that it was ex tremely important and timely to raise  to  the membership and  those who  might be interested some of the back ground and history that has led to the  exasperation that a number of us feel  with regard to the Japanese perform ance within  the  provisions  of  the  United  States-Japan  semiconductor  agreement.  One of the most important economic  issues facing our Nation today I think  we all agree is the trade deficit. With  Japan alone our deficit was in excess  of $60 billion in 1987. A central part of  the solution to that trade deficit prob lem between our country and Japan  must be increased penetration of the  Japanese market  for manufactured  American goods.  The United States-Japan semicon ductor agreement, which is now nearly  2 years old,  offers  the promise of  achieving  a  significant  increase  in  United States semiconductor exports  to Japan. To enforce a solemn interna tional agreement, to review the com petitive disadvantage of American in dustry, and  to  reduce our bilateral  trade deficit with Japan, the United  States, I believe, must remain firm and  ",1988

There is one  which I think may not be known, and  it  is  time  it was  recorded on  the  Senate floor; and that is  that, as a  young scholar, a combat-decorated vet eran of the Second World War, he was  at the Harvard Law School. While at  the  law school, with a  very distin guished career there, somehow-and it  baffles me how, but the fact remains he managed to engage himself in the  pathbreaking research of delinquency  and  family  structure  which  the  Gluecks, husband and wife,  two soci ologists, w~re carrylng out in Somer ville, MA.

The re search triangle is only a little triangle,  but it is started. We are making that  beginning. We are changing those di rections and moving in the direction  that TERRY SANFORD has pointed OUt  for two generations. I am deeply grate ful for his remarks.  Mr. President, I hope Senators will  hear that we are on the floor, that the  addressed  the  thank the Sena bill is open to amendment. We are not  seeking amendments, but that is the  right of a Senator. The Republican  leader, the distinguished Senator from  Kansas, was just here and mentioned  to his side of the aisle that the bill is  here.  Mr. President, we will  stay  right  here on  this floor until  this bill  is  passed, this day. This bill, I think, is  going to be one that we will be proud  to have had on our calendar.  I  thank  the Senator  from North  Carolina.  ",1988

884,114,11,Mr. MOYNIHAN.,"  It's  high time the Federal Government in stitutes a measure that will  improve  our current aid  to families with de pendent children program. Today, the  Senate has an opportunity to pass leg islation that will do just that.  Our present AFDC program lacks in centives to encourage recipients to get  off of the welfare rolls. Consequently,  welfare recipients are easily trapped in  a cycle of poverty that is becoming in creasingly difficult to break. And the  frustrations of being trapped in this  cycle of poverty are what leads to the  fraud and abuse that we have in our  present AFDC program.  As my colleagues have stated, one  child in every four born in America  today is born in poverty. And one child  in five spends his or her youth in pov erty. These  startling  statistics hold  true in my home State of Tennessee.  The poverty in Tennessee affects all  walks of life from the farmers in rural  Tennessee  to  the urban pockets of  poverty in Nashville and Memphis. In  fact, Mr. President, our largest city,  Memphis, has the highest poverty rate  of the 100 largest metropolitan areas  in America with more than 150,000 of  its citizens living in poverty.  Forty-seven percent of all black fam ilies and 13 percent of white families  in Memphis live in poverty. Even more  startling  is  that  the median family  income for blacks is one-half that of  whites.  The welfare reform legislation that  we are considering  today  takes  the  first step toward breaking this cycle of  poverty. It is an improvement over our  current system because it establishes a  sort of social contract between  the  Government and welfare recipients. In  this contract, the Government guaran tees that it will provide  job training  and/or welfare benefits for all who are  eligible. In return, welfare recipients  guarantee that they will participate in  job  training  programs  designed  to  remove them from the welfare rolls.  This type of understanding is essen tial in breaking the cycle of poverty  that exists in America today.  ",1988
885,127,11,Mr. BENTSEN.," I  thank the distin guished Senator from New York.  So we have the compromise amend ment which has committee support  and  the  support of Senators DoLE,  PACKWOOD, MOYNIHAN, and myself. I  want to emphasize that it is a compro mise on the part of everyone who is in volved. Everyone has given some  in  the process.  The amendment includes five major  modifications of S. 1511, and they are  as follows: It provides first for a sunset  of the Medicaid and child care transi tion provisions after 5 years. That will  give us a chance to really study them  and see how  they are working and  review them at that point.  It requires the States to include two  types of work activities as part of their  education and training program.  It establishes participation rates for  the JOBS program, and we will have a  colloquy later to further refine that  we  mean  participation  should  be  meaningful.  It requires a welfare  recipient  to  accept a job if the State assures that  the individual's family will experience  no net loss of cash income.  It deletes the provision authorizing  broad waiver authority for State and  local demonstration programs.  Let me describe each of those pro grams and provisions in a little more  detail.  First,  the amendment provides for  the termination of the Medicaid and  child care transition provisions at the  end of 1993. A study by the Secretary  of Health and Human Services of each  of these provisions will be due on Jan uary 1 of that year. That will give the  Congress a full year to study the Sec retary's  findings  and  recommenda tions, and to decide whether to extend  these  provisions, with  or without  modification.  The  IRS debt collection provision  that is in the committee bill will also  expire at the end of 1993. That,  in  tum, of course, will provide a source of  revenue to fund the extension, should  the Congress at that point, after the  study, decide to do so. I would be quite  optimistic that it would.  Second,  the  amendment  requires  every State to include as part of its  JOBS Program two of the three fol lowing activities: job search, grant di version, and either a community work  experience or other work experience  program allowed by the Secretary.  These activities will be in addition to  the basic education and skills training  activities already required by the com mittee bill.  Third,  the  amendment  requires  States to engage a specific percentage  of able-bodied adult welfare recipients  in the JOBS Program; that is, it estab lishes participation standards.  The percentage of nonexempt wel fare recipients who must participate in  an approved JOBS activity is as fol lows: 10 percent in fiscal years 1990  and 1991; 14 percent in 1992 and 1993;  and 22 percent in 1994. States will not  be penalized if they fail to meet the  participation requirement in the first  fiscal year.  One of the problems is that some of  the States have none of these provi sions  in effect. And they must have  some  transition  time  in order  to be  able to meet this requirement.  If a State fails to meet the required  percentage in fiscal years 1991 to 1994,  its Federal matching  rate  for  the  JOBS program will be reduced to 50  percent. That is a substantial penalty  at that point.  States are normally eligible for 90percent matching under the WIN hold  harmless provision and 60-percent to  80-percent matching  for  costs  they  incur above  the WIN hold harmless  amount.  The Secretary will have authority to  waive all or part of the penalty with  respect to a State if he finds that the  State: First, is in substantial compli ance with other requirements of the  JOBS program; second, has made a  good-faith effort to meet the partici pation requirements; and,  third, has  developed a corrective action plan de signed to enable the State to meet the  required participation rates within a  period specified by the Secretary.  In general,  the participation rates  will be determined by calculating the  average monthly number of partici pants in the JOBS Program in relation  to the number of individuals required  by the bill to participate in the pro gram.  However, the amendment recognizes  that  participation  levels may  vary  somewhat throughout the year. Obvi ously, it will not be possible to keep  levels totally constant, and that is par ticularly a problem in the early years  as States begin gearing up their JOBS  Program.  The Senator from New York made  some very pertinent points as we ar rived at that consensus.  For this reason, in fiscal years 1990  through 1993, the monthly participa tion rates are calculated in a way that  gives special emphasis to months when  participation levels are highest.  The participation rate provision will  expire at  the end of calendar year  1994. The Secretary of HHS  is  re quired to issue a study and recommen dations with respect  to performance  standards,  including  participation  rates, within 5 years after enactment.  This study will give the Congress the  information it needs to determine ap propriate participation rates for years  after 1994.  Fourth,  the  amendment modifies  the language in S. 1511 with respect to  protecting  individuals  from  loss  of  income as a result of being required to  accept employment under the JOBS  also  in technical  Program. This  is  the part that was  very important to quite a number of  participants.  The amendment provides that an in dividual may be required to accept a  job only if the State assures that the  individual's family will experience no  net loss of cash income.  Fifth,  the amendment deletes  the  provision  in the committee bill that  allows up to 50 State demonstration  programs under waiver of the statuto ry requirements of the Social Security  Act.  Finally,  the  amendment  cludes  several minor  and  provisions.  Mr.  President,  this  compromise  amendment moves  us  a  good  deal  closer to getting a welfare reform bill  enacted  into  law  this year. Welfare  reform  has  been  on  the Senate's  agenda for the last two decades. Now  we  have  an  opportunity  to move  beyond debate, and to set an entirely  new direction for an outdated and in effective  system  that we  inherited  from the Depression days.  I want to thank my colleagues for  their  diligent  work,  contributions,  effort, good will, and compromise. The  distinguished Republican leader con tributed a great deal  to bring  this  about. My  friend,  the distinguished  Senator from Colorado, who had some  very strong views on  these subjects  and participated  in our discussions,  was quite helpful.  Senator MoYNIHAN, the ranking mi nority member of the committee, was  a driving force  in working out these  compromises  and bringing  them  to  fruition. He is one who always came in  at a time when we seemed to be at a  deadlock and was able to break the ice.  So I am most appreciative of that. I  believe with this amendment we will  have  a  strong majority support on  both sides of the aisle. I am optimistic  that we will have true reform of the  welfare system.  ",1988

He has been willing  to compromise  and-I do not want to say back down  because  that  sounds  like  a  retreat  from principle but compromise where  people of genuine concern had ques tions, and we now have a bill that is  worthy, Mr.  President,  of  trying,  worthy of trying to see if we can make  a dent in the welfare problem in this  country.

DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR DE.  VELOPMENT AND USE OF COMPUTER  ""CREDIT"" BENEFIT CARD TECHNOLO GY IN MAKING BENEFIT PAYMENTS.  (a)  IN GENERAL.-Section  1115  of  the  Social Security Act  (42 U.S.C.  1315),  as  amended by sections 502 and 503 of this Act,  is further amended by adding at the end  thereof the following new subsection:  ""(f)(l) In order  to encourage States  to  plan,  design,  develop,  and  implement  a  system  for  making  benefit  payments  through use of  intelligent 'benefit credit'  cards <using  computer chip design),  any  State may establish and conduct a demon stration project under  this subsection de signed to test whether the use of such a  system with respect to either of the pro grams under titles IV and XIX can enhance  the efficiency and effectiveness of program  operations while ensuring that individuals  receive correct benefit amounts on a timely  basis.

899,153,11,Mr. MOYNIHAN., May I thank the  Senator  from Pennsylvania  for  his  thoughtful remarks and continuation  of our discussion on Tuesday morning  when we talked about Leon Sullivan's  work in Philadelphia which is a model  in this regard.  I would hope that the report of the  conferees when it comes back will con tain  references  very  specifically  to  Senator SPECTER's views.  I share them completely. I am sure  the conference will. I know the Senate  does.  ,1988
900,153,11,Mr. SPECTER.," I  thank the distin guished Senator from New York for  those comments.  I would very much appreciate con sideration of  the conference  to  the  extent that is possible because I want  to see this bill crafted as I know the  Senator from New York does as com prehensively as possible. The real ob jective here is to see to it that we pro vide a bridge or  transition  to move  people from the welfare rolls to the  payrolls. If this legislation is to be suc cessful it is going to have to provide  the basic education,  skills,  training,  prevocational literacy training, and on  the job training needed by the educa tionally disadvantaged. Further, there  is going  to have  to be a  sufficient  bridge so that two-parent families are  not taken off cash assistance peremp torily.  I hope  the States will not utilize  their ability to take people off cash as sistance in 6 months, that there will be  sufficient AFDC and Medicaid to carry  them over the bridge and that there  not be creaming; that is, the direction  not be limited to those who are easy to  train or to those who are temporarily  out of a job.  This  legislation will move  to  the  hardcore unemployed. I have seen the  marvelous  results-and  we  talked  about  this extensively on Tuesday which Dr. Sullivan has achieved  in  Philadelphia. I saw this police station  house reconverted in 1964 and I saw  what he and other community-based  organizations have been able to do in  this constructive way.  It is a disappointment that we are  not able to include that kind of experi ence to see to it that the States will  carry forward in that manner.  Perhaps my concerns will not be  brushed aside and there will be a com prehensive program put into effect. If  not, the record is established. We shall  revisit it at a later date.  Mr.  President,  I  withdraw  my  amendment and  I  thank  the Chair,  and I yield the floor.  ",1988

902,153,11,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, earlier  this month Congress passed landmark  legislation  with  the  catastrophic  health insurance bill. We have the op portunity to once again pass landmark  legislation with S. 1511, the Family Se curity Act of 1988.  I am pleased to join 64 of my col leagues in cosponsoring this bill which  embodies the very soul of its author,  the very distinguished  and  capable  Senator from New York, Mr. MoYNI HAN. The senior Senator from New  York has enjoyed a very distinguished  career, much of it devoted to eradicat ing  poverty  and  strengthening  the  American  family. Mr.  President,  I  know of no other person so dedicated  to this issue. And I salute the chair man and the ranking member of the  Finance Committee and that commit tee as a whole for their excellent work.  I support this bill because I support  its basic premise-that parents should  be the first line of defense in the wel fare of their children. First and fore most,  this bill strengthens the child  support enforcement system by requir ing award guidelines, by providing for  periodic update of awards, and by pro viding assistance in establishing pater nity. According to 1985 data, 50 per cent of  the women  raising children  alone have court orders for child sup port and are due payment. Of those  women, 52 percent will  receive only  partial payment or no payment at all.  Several years ago,  I authored lan guage  that closed a  l?,Pphole  in the  Bankruptcy Code  that  now  places  unwed parents on equal footing with  all other single parents, whether di vorced or  separated. This provision  prevents unwed parents from declar",1988
903,166,11,Mr. STAFFORD.," Mr. President,  I  want  to  congratulate my  colleague  from New York [Mr. MOYNIHAN]  for  the manner in which he has guided this welfare room bill through the Fi nance Committee and onto the floor  of the Senate. He has once again pro vided us all with a display of his ex traordinary talents.  I cosponsored the bill, S. 1511, be cause I believe we must begin the proc ess of changing our Nation's welfare  laws  in some critical ways. We must  expand  the opportunities for educa tion and  job training. We must find  ways to improve financial and medical  support  for children  living  in poor  households.  When we get down to it, we are talk ing about support for poor children in  our  discussions  about  single-parent  households, and conventional house holds where both parents are unem ployed. We are talking about providing  basic health care, nutrition, and edu cational opportunity to the poor chil dren of this Nation. We must keep our  sights on those objectives as this bill  works its way through the legislative  process.  This thought brings me to some ob servations that I find troubling about  the measure reported by the Finance  Committee. Two provisions of the bill  that concern me include, first, new op tions that permit States to impose ad ditional restrictions on the AFDC-Un employment  Parent  Program  and,  second,  the expansion of  the State  demonstration  programs  under  the  broad waiver  authority  that  could  result in the loss of rights and protec tions otherwise guaranteed  for  the  poor.  I am inclined to agree with those ad vocates of the poor that,  if each of  those provisions were implemented in  a State, poor children and their fami lies could  turn out  to be worse off  than under current law.  The JOBS Program does not ensure  that parents with  limited education  and work experience will get the nec essary support they need  to become  self-sufficient. Those Americans with  the least education and work experi ence require more time and resources  to get them into the work force. Limi tations placed on  the  resources can  only weaken our efforts to help poor  families rise out of poverty.  S. 1511  is near the mid-point of its  journey to become the law of the land.  After the bill passes the Senate, it will  have  to go  to conference with  the  House version. The House bill differs  with the Senate bill in the areas that  concern me most. It is my hope that  Senate conferees will agree with that  view and that the final version of this  bill will be closer to the House provi sions in these key areas.  I  intend to vote for Senate passage  of S. 1511, and I shall also oppose any  weakening amendments. However,  I  cannot at this time pledge my support  for final passage in the event Senate  conferees fail  to accept some of the  more  enlightened provisions of  the  House bill.  ",1988
904,166,11,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, as a  cosponsor of the ""Family Security Act  of 1987,"" I rise today in strong support  of this important legislation. I would  like to commend those members of the  Finance Committee who worked  so  diligently to make this bill,  in many  ways, a better bill than was originally  introduced.  Mr. President, for years our country  has struggled to end welfare depend ency and move those on the welfare  rolls into jobs that enable families to  support themselves. We have sought  ways to offer the children of disadvan taged Americans a better future. We  have sought ways to keep families to gether in times of crisis, rather than  to  force  them apart. Sometimes we  have been successful, other times, we  should have done better.  Joe Califano put  it well when he  called welfare reform the Middle East  of domestic  politics.  It is  an  area  where we have continuously sought so lutions, but have found them elusive.  Since  the  ""War  on Poverty,""  the  Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan ad ministrations all have had their ideas  on welfare reform. Some were imple mented, some never made it through  Congress, and others, such as the 1981  changes  pushed  through  by  the  Reagan administration, are major rea sons for our current debate.  But today, we have a unique oppor tunity. Today, we can help those de pendent on welfare take a critical step  toward self -sufficiency.  The mere mention of the word ""wel fare""  evokes  strong  emotions.  For  some,  there are  thoughts of welfare  cadillacs  and  welfare  cheats.  For  others, there is the vision of impover ished children, broken families,  and  struggle to find a way out of depend ency.  ",1988

912,205,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  today I am introducing legislation au thorizing State attorneys general  to  enforce the Federal Trade Commission  Act's prohibition on unfair and decep tive business practices. I am pleased to  be  joined by Senators  INOUYE  and  KERRY in this effort.  This bill will allow State AG's to en force  this prohibition in any Federal  district court and to obtain any relief  available under the FTC Act, includ ing injunctions and monetary redress  for injured consumers.  This bill does not change the Feder al Trade Commission's traditional role  as the chief Federal agency with au thority to police unfair and deceptive  business  practices  throughout  the  country.  It simply  supplements  the  FTC's powers by giving the States the  authority  to enforce  legal standards  established  by  the  FTC  and  the  courts.  This bill reflects the reality that the  States, not the Federal Trade Commis sion, have taken the lead in consumer  protection enforcement. Budget cuts  over the past 7 years have severely re stricted  the FTC's ability  to police  unfair and deceptive business prac tices. Since 1981 the Commission has  suffered  dramatic  losses  in  agency  funds and staff. Its regional offices traditionally among the strongest en forcement arms of the Commission have been hit hardest, having  lost  more than 50 percent of their people  over the past 6 years.  During this period the FTC has de voted its diminished resources to rela tively small-scale cases of fraud and  deception, while  ceding  the bigger,  more significant cases  to the States.  The States have willingly  accepted  and done a superb job in carrying out  this responsibility. Most of the recent  major national advertising cases,  for  example, have been brought not by  the FTC, but by a State attorney gen eral. In a word, the State's AG's have  become  indispensable  surrogates  of  the Commission, discharging the en forcement  responsibility  that  the  Commission  is no  longer willing or  able to discharge itself.  The effectiveness of the State attor neys general  is  limited, however, by  the fact that they are only able to stop  deceptive  business  practices within  their jurisdictions. For example, a de ceptive land sales scheme may operate  in several States or may move from  State to State when local officials take  ",1988

922,218,11,Mr.  PELL.," Mr.  President, while  much of the current cultural exchange  between  the United States and  the  Soviet Union focuses on the major arts  institutions of each country, there are  also some important exchanges taking  place  that highlight  the  less well known but very distinctive art being  produced  in  regions of  the United  States.  One such exhibition now on display  at the Exhibit Hall of the Moscow Art ists' Union features the work done by  a group of Rhode Island artists known  as Nineteen on Paper. One of these  artists, Jan Swearer, was responsible  for making the contacts that eventual ly  led  to  this wonderful showing of  work that is so representative of my  State's artistic community.  The Newport Daily News, June 9,  1988, included an editorial about this  exhibition in Moscow and I ask that it  be reprinted here for my colleagues to  read.  The editorial follows:  NINETEEN R.I. ARTISTS EXHIBIT WORK IN  Moscow  The Rhode Island art group, ""Nineteen on  Paper,"" is showing its work at the Exhibit  Hall of the Moscow Artists' Union in the  Soviet Hall  of Art  <Moscow,  U.S.S.R.)  through the end of June. This is the group's  second show in the Soviet Union. In Febru ary their works were on display at the Spaso  House Gallery  in the American Ambassa dor's Moscow  residence, where  they were  viewed primarily by invited guests.  That show has been  transferred  to  the  public exhibition space of the Moscow Art ists' Union, where it will be accessible  to  Russian artists and the general public.  Moscow art-lovers, accustomed to seeing  regional art exhibits in the various galleries  of the huge Soviet Hall of Art, will  find  themselves face-to-picture with a  regional  show from the other side of the world. This  exhibit was arranged by artists  in Provi dence and Moscow through contacts made  by Jan Swearer, one of the ""19,"" who was in  the Soviet Union looking at art for an arti cle on the Soviet contemporary art scene,  ""Summer 1987 ."" Her husband, Howard R.  Swearer, president of Brown University, was  simultaneously furthering contacts between  Brown and  the A.M. Gorki  Institute of  World Literature, the Space Institute and  the USA-Canada Institute.  Dr. Dmitri M. Urnov, of the A.M. Gorki  Institute, has been involved in a program  with Brown University, and he arranged an  informal dinner in the studio of Myron Lu koanov, graphic artist and painter. Several  months later, when the show at the Ambas sador's residence became fact, ""Nineteen on  Paper"" decided  to  seek a way  to  reach  beyond diplomatic circles with their art.  Lukoanov,  a  respected member of  the  Moscow Artists' Union, offered to arrange a  general public showing under the Union's  auspices. The Artists' Union is the means by  which Soviet artists interact within the art  scene. Now it is also the means by which  Rhode Island artists can reach the Moscow  art community.  The 19 Rhode Island artists produce work  in a variety of media and techniques (prints,  drawings, paintings, photographs), present ing images from the totally abstract to the  representational,  each  a  strong personal  statement and  together an  indication of  trends in the New England area.  ""Nineteen Rhode Island Artists on Paper""  was formed in 1986 to provide a forum for  the sharing of many aspects of the creative  process,  including  the  presentation  of  groups of works for exhibition and the sale  of members' works in portfolios. The group  has exhibited twice  in NewPort,  in Provi dence, and Boston and plans  to show  in  London and Rome in the coming months.  Group members are Barbara Alpert, Su zanne D'Avanzo, Candis Dixon, Wendy Ed wards,  Isabelle Famiglietti, Lea Feinstein,  Bunny Harvey, Liz Horan, Mary Hutchins,  Rebecca Jenness, Riva Leviten, Paula Most,  Sylvia Petrie, Margot Rubin, Judith Sing sen, Nancy Spencer,  Jan Swearer, Gail  Whitsitt-Lynch, Estyn Williams, and Caro lyn Wolf.e  HONORING THE RETIREMENT  OF ANN E. SMITH   Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise  today to pay special tribute to Ann E.  Smith, who retires this year as execu tive  administrator  for  the Nassau  County Board of Cooperative Educa tional Services. For more  than 40  years Ann has dedicated herself  to  serving the citizens of Nassau County  through her work  in  the  fields of  health and education. I am pleased to  express my personal appreciation for  her many contributions to the Nassau  community.  Prior  to her  tenure with Nassau  BOCES, Ann served  the community  well in her position as head nurse of  the surgical unit at Central Islip State  Hospital. She has  also  spent more  than 8 years as a school nurse in the  Northport public schools, where she  implemented a number of innovative  programs, including an adaptive physi cal education program and a senior in ternship program.  executive  director  at Nassau  BOCES, Ann has succeeded not only  in managing  a  diverse  professional  staff of more than 70 members, but  has also supervised the health andre medial services programs  in 42 non public schools and  the  tutorial pro grams  in several drug  rehabilitation  centers.  Among the highlights of Ann's many  initiatives at Nassau BOCES has been  the comprehensive education program  for pregnant teenagers she inaugurat ed 7 years ago. This program has al lowed pregnant teenagers to continue  working toward a high school diploma  while deriving the benefit of guidance  counseling,  instruction  in parenting  skills, and psychological services. Re markably, of  the 250  students who  have enrolled  in  this program since  1982,  fewer  than  1  percent  have  dropped out of school.  As  ",1988
923,244,11,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, June  1988 has been designated as ""National Recy cling Month."" This resolution is aimed toward  educating the American public about the  im portance of recycling, and I am pleased to be  a cosponsor of this legislation.  Recycling serves countless purposes. For  instance,  recycling  saves energy and  con serves our country's natural resources by re ducing the use of raw materials. For every 1 0  percent of used crushed glass added  to a  glass plant's  furnace, energy costs drop as  much as 5 percent. For every  ton of used  crushed glass  in  the manufacturing process,  up to 1 .2 tons of raw material are saved.  The benefits of paper and glass recycling  are evident, and we have unlimited potential  for  further much-needed conservation. Many  other products such as metal, plastic, and alu minum also can be  recycled. For example,  turning used aluminum cans  into new ones  takes 95 percent  less energy  than  refining  new metal from raw bauxite.  We should recognize and must encourage  the growth of public, political, and economic  support  for  recycling. More  importantly, we  must overcome  the obstacles which  remain,  such as lack of markets for recycled products,  high collection and separation costs,  resist ance to change, and the importance of con venience in waste disposal.  I urge my colleagues to reflect on the bene fits of recycling and encourage your constitu ents to use this excellent method of conserva tion.  It is our responsibility to encourage par ticipation  in educational endeavors  that pro mote waste separation methods, community based recycling programs, and expanded utili zation of recovered materials. All progress we  make in recycling today will help to slow down  the voracious consumption of our rapidly di minishing supply of energy and natural  re sources.  HOUSE  JOINT RESOLUTION 317,  SOWETO REMEMBRANCE DAY  RESOLUTION  HON. CHARLES A. HAYES  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  ",1988
924,244,11,Mr. HAYES of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, to para phrase an  article by Arlene Getz entitled,  ""Apartheid's Troubled Children,"" which ap peared  in  the December 1987 World Press  Review:  South African parents are agonizing over  the problems of raising their children in a  deeply  divided  and  increasingly  violent  racist society. During the past decade, chil dren have been catapulted into  the front  line of  the South African struggle. Black  children have been particularly hard hit by  the chronic violence  racking  their  town ships. Thousands have been detained withEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  out trial; others have been tear-gassed and  shot. According to the Rev. Frank Chikane,  general  secretary  of  the South  'African  Council of Churches, ""They find themselves  either confronting the system or running  away from tear-gas and bullets. For these  children, violence has become a  lifestyle,  leaving still undetermined emotional scars.""  For these children, many of whom are fortu nately too young to have been part of one of  the worst displays of state-sponsored  terror ism of modern times, today is not just another  day of existence under a racist state support ed  system of  repression. Today,  they are  marching with  their parents, if they are lucky  enough to still have them around,  in remem berance of their  fallen brothers and sisters.  On this day in 1976, more than 1,000 children  were brutally murdered by  the South African  police in the township of Soweto. What horri ble crime did  they commit in order to suffer  such devastation? They simply wanted to be  educated  in  their native  language  in  their  native  land-the  land where  their  families  have lived for generation upon generation.  Today marks  the 12th commemoration of  the Soweto massacre and it is in that regard  that I wish to make note of what took place in  that township 12 years ago, and what contin ues to take place even as I speak. On that oc casion, in addition to the more than 1,000 chil dren who were brutally murdered, an addition al  5,000 were wounded  by South African  police. These children were committing no  crime, at  least not by our standards. They  were simply protesting the fact that they were  not allowed to be educated in their native lan guage in their native land.  As we have watched  the South African  Government's response  to  its growing crisis,  we have also seen increased trageting of chil dren. American citizens have been appalled;  first, by the overwhelming violence, and more  recently,  by  the extension of  the  state of  emergency which has hidden most of the bru tality, but has still allowed us to view the num bers-30,000 more detainees since 1985, of  which over 8,000 of them have been children.  In an effort to show solidarity with the chil dren of South Africa and  to show solidarity  with courageous people of all races in South  Africa and throughout the world and are fight ing to end the evil of apartheid,  I introduced  House Joint Resolution 317, a resolution de claring June 16 as  ""Soweto Remembrance  Day."" This resolution, which is nonpartisan in  nature, call on American citizens to participate  in  local activities designed  to commemorate  the martyrs of Soweto and  to work  toward  ending support for the system of apartheid.  To date, 95 of our colleagues have added  their names as cosponsor of House Joint Res olution 317. Unfortunately, House rules dictate  that 218 Members cosponsor such resolutions  before they can be considered on the House  floor. While we are short on cosponsors, it in  no way detracts from the importance of com memorating the tragic event that took place in  Soweto.  I am pleased  to  report  that while House  Joint Resolution 317 will not be considered, at  this time, thousands of American citizens are  spending  this day  in  demonstration,  vigils,  educational events, and  lobbying. The  focus  of these activities is  twofold;  first, as  I have  mentioned, is to show solidarity with people of  June 16, 1988  all races  in South Africa and  throughout the  world who are fighting to end the evil of apart heid, and second, to garner support for Rep resentative RON DELLUMS bill, H.R. 1580, the  Anti-Apartheid Act Amendments.  The  apartheid  system and  its  continued  denial of basic human rights and freedoms to  the 26 million black majority population of  South Africa offends the sensibilities of free dom loving people everywhere. It is repugnant  to the ideals which our Nation's founders em braced  in our Declaration of  Independence,  Constitution, and Bill of Rights. A nation that  embraces such treatment of its citizens should  be condemned by the world community.  While we have seen  fit  to  impose  limited  sanctions on South Africa,  the sad reality of  those restrictions  is  that they have  failed  to  stir any  significant progress  toward ending  apartheid. I believe it is imperative that strong er actions are undertaken by our Government  to continue demonstrating  to  the world  that  the  intransigence of the South African Gov ernment will not be tolerated by what is con sidered the world's No. 1 democratic govern ment. Enactment of H.R. 1580 will not end  apartheid next year or the year after, but it will  show the South African Government that we  have the will and the resolve to do all within  our power to isolate it from the world commu nity until their apartheid system is dismantled.  RABBI STEPHEN ROBBINS'  SERMON ON AIDS  HON. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  ",1988
925,244,11,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker, at the High  Holy Day Services at Temple Emanuel in Bev erly Hills, CA, Rabbi Stephen Robbins deliv ered a most unusual sermon. His  topic was  the AIDS epidemic. The sermon is a frank and  moving discussion of the need to educate our selves and our children about what he calls a  ""simple and hard  reality.*  * * We cannot,""  he correctly states, ""avoid dealing with AIDS.""  Rabbi Robbins described the need not only  to educate ourselves but also  to provide a  support system to people with AIDS,  instead  of becoming  ""enemies who would  isolate  them."" We must ""avoid increased conflict and  prejudice,"" he told his congregation. He talked  about the workshops and programs his temple  would offer because ""We must be active-not  just personally but also politically. You and  I  must not permit this disease to become a po litical  football."" He ended by challenging his  congregation  to  ""dedicate ourselves  to  the  Jewish value of Pikuach Nefesh, the saving of  lives.""  I would very much like to share this moving  discussion with my  colleagues,  and  I am  asking permission that it be reprinted here in  full.

926,257,11,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, Sunday, June 19,  is Father's Day. Like our commemoration of  motherhood a month ago, it is a celebration of  the  family unit, and  the  special  role of a  parent. Dad, daddy, and pop are at different  turns,  the soft  touch,  the disciplinarian,  the  coach and the cook.  There is no greater gift than the love of a  child freely given. But in 1988, fatherhood car ries more responsibility than ever before.  Regardless of where  the discussion  takes  place, in the living room or in a congressional  committee hearing, there is a serious debate  on  family values and  family policy  that con cerns us all. More often than not, that debate  centers on  the children,  the most vulnerable  and dependent people in our society.  It is appropriate that on  this Father's Day,  children and  fathers be  the special  focus of  our attention in the Congress. Ossie and Har riet Nelson are a  fading  sterotype of  the  American  family, and  the meaning of father hood is evolving.  For example, a recent survey on American  voter  attitudes on  child  care  services  re vealed:  More than 70 percent of men believed that  affordable good quality child care is difficult to  find; nearly 60 percent of men believed  that  there are not enough child care services avail able; 67 percent of men believed  that most  parents work in order to make ends meet, and  that Government should help make it possible  to afford quality care for children.  Families are striving to provide a decent en vironment for their children. The Act for Better  Child Care  [ABC], H.R. 3660, sponsored by  Representative  DALE  KILDEE  of Michigan,  would help families confront one of the obsta cles that make that goal difficult to achieve. I  am a cosponsor of the ABC bill, and I give it  my strongest endorsement.  ABC  is a comprehensive measure that will  help make quality accessible child care avail able  to  those  in need. ABC helps disadvan taged  families pay  for good quality services  that are in critically short supply, as well.  19-059 0-89-9 (Pt. 11)  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The 1980's marked the advent of stagnant  family incomes, soaring housing costs, and an  even more mobile society  that dilutes  the  family  support  system.  Families,  especially  children, are under tremendous pressure.  Fathers are not immune to these pressures,  and too many have abdicated our most impor tant responsibility. As the Congress continues  to examine the  issue of day care and other  children's  issues, we may not forget the  fa thers who have forgotten their children.  Too often, some  fathers have chosen  to  ignore the most basic family obligations. Too  many  leave  the  job of child  rearing  to a  spouse, to a grandparent, to the schools, or  far worse, to the juvenile justice system.  In recent years, we have opened our eyes  to acknowledge both the  failure of some fa thers to support their children and our failure  to hold  them accountable. More  than ever,  economic and social realities make raising a  family more than women's work.  In raising our sons and in formulating public  policy, we have an obligation  to  teach and  foster personal responsibility.  But for the great majority of parents, includ ing  fathers, who search vainly  for affordable  quality child care,  the Act  for Better Child  Care is a good beginning.  Providing for our children, for our future,  is  the most important task we face as a society.  Passage of progressive and timely legislation  like  the ABC bill will  take us another step  along that path.  In closing, I want to urge my colleagues to  be responsive to America's families, to be re sponsive to America's fathers, and to support  the Act for Better Child Care.  A  TRIBUTE TO THE EASTERN  HIGH  SCHOOL  BASKETBALL  TEAM  HON. BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker, this spring, the  Eastern High School basketball team complet ed  the  finest season  in  the history of  the  school. Their accomplishments, including a 23  to 1 record and league and sectional champi onships, were a triumph for all of us in Beaver  and southern Ohio.  Head Coach Greg Slone, his assistant Neil  Leist, and manager Jamie Bond, deserve our  congratulations for a job well done. And  the  players-Darren King, Darrell Howard, Eddie  Nance, Bryan Hale, Dustten Alley, Rex Leist,  Blaise Reader, Eric Meredith, Ben Howard,  Jeremy  Linkous,  Peter  Keller  and  Justin  McBee-demonstrated that a true team effort  combines hard work and commitment as well  as skill. They are an example to the Nation of  what can be achieved when  individuals bind  together in dedication  to a singular purpose.  They epitomize what athletic competition is all  about-striving with the support of family and  community to be  the best they possibly can  be. They have made us all very proud.  The players' parents, the teachers and ad ministrators, and all of us had our emotions  rise and  fall with  the efforts of  these  fine  15033  young men on the basketball court. Their vic tory became our victory.  This was a team effort not only in terms of  the players on the court, but the school and  community as well. I want to particularly com mend  the Eastern High School cheerleaders  who kept our spirits up. Let me take this op portunity also to congratulate the great job of  the Boosters Club and  the enthusiasm of a  community for its team.  ""SPIRIT OF AMERICA""  PROGRAM  HON. PHILIP M. CRANE  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 1988  ",1988
927,257,11,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  last night, June  15, was  the ""Spirit of America"" Program as  presented by our U.S. Army.  In the past,  I have had the pleasure of at tending this presentation. Unfortunately, I was  unable to witness last night's patriotic display.  However, after  listening  to my office praise  last night's performance,  I was certain  that  this year's program was as  fascinating as  ever.  I would like to take this opportunity to share  with  everyone  the  importance of such  an  event. During an occasion such as  this, we  must reflect upon America's history and our  constant battle  for peace  through strength.  The U.S. Army, as have all of America's  Armed Forces, has played a critical  role  in  America's protection of peace and freedom.  Last night's program,  through  the use of  music and drama, chronologically presented  the  important contributions of the U.S. Army  to the growth of our Nation. The show encom passed everything from a reproduction of our  revolutionary battle  fields  to  landing on  the  Moon, in a way that rekindled the nationalism  of all in attendance.  The  discipline  the  soldiers  displayed  throughout the performance, as highlighted by  the silent drill team, can and should serve as  an inspiration to all Americans. The event re minded me of  the  importance of patriotism,  which has made  this country great and will  continue to make this country great through out the future.

929,283,11,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, a recent  survey by  the Office of Technology  Assessment found that the majority of  American citizens believe that biotech nology will improve their lives. I think  they are right. I know in the agricul tural sector alone we can expect pro ductive new plants, industrial materi als,  and  livestock  in  the very near  future.  I commend my friend from Florida,  Senator CHILES, for his hard work on  this legislation. It is essential that we  establish a long-term national biotech nology policy to ensure that America  reaps  the benefits of her  scientific  know-how. Senators KENNEDY and Do MENICI  have  been  champions  of  human genome research and of bio technology. I am pleased to join them  in  cosponsoring  the Biotechnology  Competitiveness Act.  Mr. President, I have spoken on the  subject of biotechnology competitive ness many  times and will not go  to  great lengths today. However, it is im portant to recognize that other coun tries are investing great resources in  this technology, and I fear they will  apply our basic science discoveries to  develop products we should make our selves. I heard the other day, for ex ample, that Japan is developing a mi crobe to control the deadly and perva sive  aflatoxins  that  contaminate  grain-the potential for such a prod uct is enormous.  Agriculture will be the first industry  revolutionized by biotechnology. Al ready more than a dozen small-scale  field  tests of genetically engineered  plants have taken place. Our farmers  are receptive to plant biotechnology.  In fact, traditional plant breeding has  been practices for centuries but it has  been a hit-or-miss endeavor, expensive,  and time consuming. Gene mapping of  plants will enable breeders and scien tists to precisely define plant charac teristics and genetic engineering prom ises to accomplish in days what took  Mendell and others years of work.  Despite its importance, however, the  Federal Government has not  suffi ciently invested time and financial re sources in agricultural biotechnology.  The May 6, 1988, editorial in Science  accurately  described  the  need  for  greater efforts in this sector:  Virtually  every  developed  country  and  many developing countries have  targeted  leadership  in biotechnology as a national  goal. In efforts to compete with the United  States in applications of molecular biology  to produce pharmaceuticals, would-be com petitors are latecomers, with limited pros pects. But in agriculture, the picture is quite  different,  and  the United States  could  become second-rate.  ... In contrast to federal support of bio medical research, funds for basic research in  plant biology have been meager and  the  sums provided individual investigators have  been  tiny. Consequently,  the  knowledge  base of the molecular biology of plants is  limited. The level of conventional agricul tural science in other countries is compara ble to that here, and in some instances pos sibly superior.  . . . The crop  surpluses  in  the United  States have been used as an argument for  curtailing  research. However,  if we move  slowly in exploiting new biotechnology, we  will lose competitiveness fairly rapidly.  The race  is on. That is why  it is  more  important  than ever  that we  wisely invest our resources in projects  which will allow us to build consensus  on appropriate and safe uses of bio technology.  Bismark quipped, ""Politics is not an  exact science."" While we have made  great strides in biotechnology, there is  a great deal we do not understand  about how this science works and what  it means for our society. These ques tions cloud the future of agricultural  biotechnology. At  the recent AgBio tech 1988 conference here in Washing ton, one Wall Street expert explaining  investors reluctance to finance agricul tural biotechnology, said: ""The market  does not believe yet that the force is  with you."" And, at a  joint hearing I  chaired of the Agriculture Committee  and  the Judiciary Subcommittee on  Technology and  the Law,  the presi dent of Monsanto Co., Earle Harbison  told committee members that ""There  is  no  discernible  official  attitude  toward this or any other emerging in dustry     . The industry, and those  who regulate it, operate largely in a  political vacuum. There  is no clear  signal from our political leaders to 'go  for it.""'  Today I am offering, along with my  good  friend  from  Indiana, Senator  LUGAR, an amendment to S. 1966, the  Biotechnology Competitiveness Act,  which would ensure that this legisla tion addresses agricultural as well as  biomedical needs. America must aid  agricultural policymakers in their ef forts to promote biotechnology wisely  and to the benefit of industry and citi zens  alike. The policy  coordination  that will result from this amendment  will  give  us  the  force we need  to  remain the world's agricultural leader.  Mr.  President,  this  amendment  would establish a National Advisory  Panel on Agricultural Biotechnology.  The agriculture panel would closely  parallel the National Advisory Panel  on the Human Genome and report to  the National Biotechnology  Policy  Board, also established in S. 1966. The  agriculture panel would  recommend  policies and research priorities for bio technology in the agricultural sector.  Many scientists, for example, believe  that research to map plant genomes  should be undertaken. The genetic  structure of plants is  incredibly com plex,  but  relative  to  the  human  genome,  easier  to understand. The  map needed for practical plant manip ulation need not be as precise as that  anticipated  in human biomedical re search. In factJ many scientists suggest  that mapping plant genomes is an ob vious  first  step  to mapping human  genomes since it will allow scientists to  develop models and  technologies for  uncoding more complex organisms.  Molecular genetic maps for corn, to matoes,  soybeans,  rice,  and  other  plants are being developed. The Feder al Government's contribution to this  vital research has been minimal, how ever. In fact, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture spends less than 5 percent  of its annual research budget on bio technology.  Agricultural  research  spending must  reflect  agriculture's  future, rather than its past. The Na tional Agriculture Panel would assess  the need for agricultural biotechnol ogy research and coordinate Federal  resources in this area.  Additionally,  this agriculture panel  will  coordinate  the development of  risk assessment methods to better un derstand the implications of field re leases of genetically engineered plants.  There is concern about the potential  for genetically engineered crop plants  to transfer their newly acquired genes  to closely  related species  located  in  ",1988
930,309,11,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong support of the pending legisla tion, H.R. 3097, a bill to reauthorize  key provisions of the National Organ  Transplant Act.  In 1984, Congress passed the act to  help  those whose  lives  depend on  whether or not a donor can be found  in time.  We have made progress. Since 1983,  when we began  taking steps  to  im prove the donor system, the number  of  transplants performed has  risen  dramatically. From 1983 through 1987,  the  number  of  heart  transplants  jumped from 172 to 1,411 and kidney  transplants  increased  from 6,000  to  nearly 9,000.  But there is still much to do. Wait ing lists are still long, and many die  each year waiting for a donor, while  studies show a potential for approxi mately 20,000 organ donors per year.  This bill renews our commitment to  help. It will continue Federal efforts  to  strengthen  local organ  retrieval,  and coordinate the various Federal en deavors  in organ procurement  and  transplantation, for another 3 years.  By now, the need for a strong na tional  transplant  policy  should  be  clear. Years of public appeals,  illus trated by such well-known cases as  Baby Jesse, Alex Girard, and Ronnie  DeSillers, have convinced most Ameri cans that the old system was not fair.  The foundation for a new, more eq uitable system based on medical need  was put in place with the 1984 law, by  establishing  the national organ pro curement  and  transplantation  net work-a single nationwide system that,  through  its  broadly  representative  board, sets national policy on organ  transplantation  questions. The  net work also maintains a single national  waiting list of all those in need of a  donor organ.  In October 1986, Congress built on  that foundation by passing transplant  amendments as part of the reconcilia tion bill. Those amendments require  every hospital in the Nation that re ceives Medicare or Medicaid funds to  make certain that families of every po tential organ donor-deaths due  to  cessation of brain function-are made  aware of the option of organ donation.  It also provided  the transplant net work with  additional  authority  to  oversee  the operation of  transplant  hospitals  and  organ  procurement  agencies.  This bill will  assure  a  continued  smooth transition between the old and  new systems.  Mr. President, four years ago we de cided to stop forcing families to leave  the bedside of a dying  loved one  in  order to go out and drum up media ex posure. I believe we are finally getting  in sight of  that goal. This bill will  bring  us  another  important  step  closer.  I urge support for this legislation.  ",1988
931,309,11,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to join the Senator from Mas sachusetts  in support of  the Organ  Transplant Amendments Act, H.R.  3097. This bill reauthorizes legislation  which has contributed significantly to  our Nation's effort  to  increase  the  availability of organs for transplanta tion.  In 1987,  there were an estimated  8,972 kidney, 1,441 heart, 1,159  liver,  and  162  pancreas  transplants  per formed  in this country. In 1986, my  own State of Utah performed  139  ",1988
932,322,11,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, hostile  corporate  takeovers  have been  the  subject of much debate recently. Ini tiators of hostile  takeover attempts  have been branded ""raiders,"" and they  have been accused of a wide range of  abuses including shortsightedness, the  elimination of jobs, and the saddling  of  target  cor.l1panies with  excessive  debt burdens.  Those in management at the target  companies also have been accused of a  wide range of abuses including exces sive concern with their own job securi ty,  failure  to seek  to maximize  the  value  of  shareholders'  investments,  and  denial  of  shareholder  voting  rights.  ",1988
933,335,11,Mr. PROXMIRE., Will the Senator  yield on that point?  ,1988
934,335,11,Mr. SANFORD., Certainly.  ,1988
935,335,11,Mr. PROXMIRE.," I congratulate the  Senator. He is 100 percent right. It is  something that has been missed. The  Senator  from Colorado,  as we  all  know, is extraordinarily articulate and  eloquent. When you come to the spe cifics of actually what we do provide,  it is more information. How can that  hurt the shareholder?  ",1988
936,335,11,Mr. SANFORD.," Of course, the Sena tor is right. It actually protects the  shareholder who does not have  the  inside information.  ",1988
937,335,11,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," That  is  right.  Ninety percent of this bill  is an in crease in disclosure, more disclosure.  For the  life of me,  I cannot under stand why people get up and attack  the bill on the grounds that it is an as sault on the shareholder, which it is  not. I do not know of any provision in  this bill-maybe there are some things  in the law-that would in any way ad versely affect, certainly  in  the  long  run, shareholders.  ",1988
938,335,11,Mr. SANFORD.," If the Senator will  allow a comment, they fail to distin guish between the first-wave and the  second-wave  shareholders. The  first  wave are the shareholders, the small  investors who have been holding on to  their stock and  then without  their  knowledge here come  the raiders  in  the dark of night to reach out and  pick up  the shares before anybody  knows that there is a play on for the  corporation.  So we  are  protecting  shareholders but we are not protecting  the shareholders that most need our  protection, the shareholders who are  there all the time-the small investor.  I might point out that there is a great  deal of testimony indicating that it is  the small investor who is losing confi dence in our system.  ",1988
939,335,11,Mr. PROXMIRE.," The studies done  by people  like Scherer and Lowen stein, for example, show that this is  exactly right. They show that when  the acquirers move in, the price of the  stock almost always goes up temporarily but then the studies over a period  of years show that then the stock de teriorates  in value  time after  time,  after time. And this is not on the basis  of a selection. This is on the basis of  scholars having taken virtually every  acquisition and studied what actually  happens to the value of the stock over  a period of several years. The profit ability of  the enterprise diminishes  and the value of the stock goes down.  ",1988
940,335,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  will the Senator yield for a question?  ",1988
941,335,11,Mr. SANFORD., Certainly.  ,1988
942,335,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," What does the  Senator mean by ""dark of the night?""  ",1988
943,335,11,Mr. SANFORD.," By not having the  requirement  of  full  disclosure,  the  raiders are in place acquiring the stock  ready to pounce before your ordinary  shareholder knows about a  takeover.  In  fact,  your ordinary  shareholder  may very well innocently sell out in a  period when the play is already set but  has not been made public. What this  bill would do, as the Senator knows, is  to require those people who have come  out of the darkness to sneak up on the  shareholders to expose themselves to a  spotlight. That is what I meant.  ",1988
944,335,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, is  the Senator aware that present law re quires that when an investor reaches a  certain threshold of percentage owner ship in a public corporation, that that  person  is  required  to  file  a  public  notice?  ",1988
945,335,11,Mr. SANFORD.," I am well aware of  that, and I think that is one thing we  are trying to tighten up. The period of  time now for  that disclosure simply  does not work in the modern rapidity  of stock transactions.  ",1988
946,335,11,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Is it not true that  under present law the acquirer comes  on when he gets 5 percent of the stock  and 10 days go by? Ten days go by;  meanwhile,  the  acquirer moves  in  before  the  public  knows  about  it.  Under this bill, the public has to be  notified immediately and the acquirer  cannot acquire another share of stock  until the public knows. So far as the  noninsider  investor and shareholder,  this is clearly in his interest.  ",1988
947,335,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, I  do not want to impose on my friend,  and I am really going  to  just ask a  question if he would yield to me. I am  not going to attempt to make an argu ment. But would I be correct, there fore, in assuming that once the public  knows that it is not a darkness trans action, it is his view that the critical  threshold is that the public knows of  the intention of some investor to ac quire a large block of stock?  ",1988
948,335,11,Mr. SANFORD.,"  I  think that that  was the purpose of disclosure in the  first place. I think the whole philoso phy of the SEC has been one of disclo sure, of the public's knowing what is  out there. It is the basis of our securi ties laws. We simply are dealing with  disclosure not in the rapid computer  age but disclosure of years past when  messengers  casually  carried  stock  transactions  from  place  to  place  around Wall Street.  I do not  think  there  is any question that the SEC  needs better and more timely disclo sure requirement in the law now. That  is what  this bill  is doing. My only  quarrel with this bill is it does nothing  much but that.  ",1988
949,335,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, if  I may impose just once more, let me  say I agree with what the Senator has  said on this point and also the obser vations of the Senator from Wiscon sin. I am personally a great believer in  public disclosure, and I think 10 days  in  the modern era of computerized  transaction is much too long a  time.  And I am not aware that there was  any controversy in committee or else where about  reducing  that  time  so  that there is a prompt notice so that  the public has a chance to know that.  ",1988
950,335,11,Mr. SANFORD., There is no question  that more  timely disclosure  is what  the bill calls for.  ,1988
951,335,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG., I thank the Sen ator for yielding.  ,1988
952,335,11,Mr. SANFORD.," I think it is worth while to reflect on just what prompted  the  committee  to  take  action  to  reform the tender offer rules. As the  committee report states, the commit tee's actions  ""were held  against  a  backdrop of the most serious insider  trading  scandals  the Securities and.  Exchange Commission has ever uncov ered and ongoing allegations of collu sion and conspiracy amongst corporate  raiders, arbitrageurs, investment bank ers, and other participants in the cor porate takeover 'game'.""  The  report  goes  on  to  quote  a  number of witnesses who  appeared  before the committee, both Democrat  and  Republican,  some  from Wall  Street and others not. Former Senator  Nick Brady, Chairman of the Presi dent's Commission to examine the Oc tober stock market crash, commented  there  is  something  ""tilted about  a  game in which the same group of raid ers, arbitrageurs, and bankers attack  one company after another,  reaping  profits without ever seeming to take  risks or losses."" He concluded ""Some thing was just not right.""  John J. Phelan, Jr., the chairman of  the New York Stock Exchange, noted  that ""What we see is a relatively new  phenomenon  in which  investment  bankers, institutions, arbitrageurs, ac counting firms, public relations firms,  and law firms  join together"" -he did  not  say  ""in  a  conspiracy,"" but he  might very well have said it-""in take over activities. And in which enormous  sums of money are in the balance."" He  continued that ""Since takeovers have  provided the major opportunity for in sider trading to occur, that indicated  to me that there's a structural prob lem in our system that needs to be ad",1988
953,387,11,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, we  have here a controversy that has been  going on now for almost 45 years. We  have a settlement that has been on  the table for a decade, and we have  not been able to get this matter dis cussed on the floor of the Senate in  the last 10 years.  I think it would serve everyone if we  could bring this bill up for discussion,  if we could talk about the concessions,  the  compromises,  and  the  changes  that we have made to accommodate a  great many of the complaints. If we  could have that kind of discussion, I  do not doubt that we might very well  be able to settle  this matter, which  has been in controversy for a lifetime.  The point is made that it will not do  to commit any area of wilderness with out the total consent of all the Sena tors involved. That is an appealing ar gument. It is an argument that had its  beginning a year after the Wilderness  Act was put on the books. The purpose  was that, as a great many parts of the  country  attempted  to  have  special  areas  included  in wilderness,  there  was, understandably, a lot of dispute.  So  that  rule,  if  it was a  rule, was  adopted under  those  circumstances.  Those  circumstances  simply do not  exist now.  In the first place, the Senate, on a  number of occasions, has gone forward  with designated areas as wilderness,  without any agreement by either Sen ator  involved. So  there  is  no  real  precedent that we need to treat this as  a local matter.  This is not just a matter of appoint ing a Federal  judge or some Federal  appointee, where Senators have to get  together. This is a far more important  matter.  I  contend  that  this  is  a national  issue, an issue of national concern, an  issue .that needs to be  looked at by  each Member of this body as a nation al  opportunity,  one  that only  the  Senate can now decide.  I  remember, as a second grader in  North Carolina, being asked  to con tribute pennies to preserve this great  natural  resource  in western North  Carolina-all the way across the State  from where I live. I remember that we  did contribute pennies.  Where did the money for the nation al park come from? Did it come from  North Carolina?  Is  this  is  a North  Carolina project? Did  it come  from  Tennessee and North Carolina? Is this  a Tennessee and North Carolina prop osition? This is a national proposition  because the Nation bought it.  Now, my pennies helped the State of  North Carolina appropriate $2 million.  The State of Tennessee appropriated  approximately $2 million. And, with  private contributions between the two  States, that amounted to about $5 mil lion.  The Rockefeller Foundation, or one  of the Rockefeller trusts, contributed  an equal amount of $5.1 million. And  then the Federal Government put in  $3.5 million for the purchase. So you  can very well see that this is a national  park purchased with national money.  It had the enthusiastic support of  North Carolina because the legislature  appropriated the initial money. Citi zens all over the State added to the  contributions,  especially  the  school  children. And today we see one of the  great natural resources of this Nation  properly preserved.  No longer are the lumber people in  denuding the mountainside. No longer  are the people in digging for minerals.  Here we have preserved now  for 50  years  one  of  the most  remarkable  pieces of land anywhere in the world  and certainly anywhere in this Nation.  As  an  indication  of  the  natural  values of this park, we are one of the  two or  three places  in  the United  States, the Great Smokies Park is, des ignated as an international biosphere  reserve and a world heritage site. So  this is anything but a little local issue  that has to be decided by local agree ment.  I  think we have to look at it as a  great  national  asset. We  have  to,  therefore, look at it as a national re sponsibility and a national problem.  I have attempted to keep politics out  of this. I have been involved, in a way,  since  I was Governor  in  the early  1960's  when  people  from  Swain  County asked me to get involved with  whether or not a road would be built  or whether or not some other settle ment would be made. And I said  to  them  then  that  I will get  involved  when the local officials concerned, the  local officials who have a responsibil ity, have settled the matter.  Now, they did not agree while I was  in office. They did not agree until  about 7 or 8 years ago. But now the  county commissioners, the elected offi cials,  the people of the only county  ",1988
954,400,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Missouri.  ,1988
955,400,11,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of S. 1323, the ""Tender Offer  Disclosure and Fairness Act of 1987."" I  am pleased that the Banking Commit tee's months of hearings on the effects  of hostile takeovers on the economy of  our Nation have resulted in a piece of  legislation  that  makes  significant  progress  toward making  the  tender  offer process more fair and evenly bal anced. I do not agree with every provi sion of this bill. On balance, however,  it is a modest and balanced piece of  legislation that deserves  the support  of the Senate.  I  believe  that  any  tender  offer  reform should build on the fundamen tal principles of  the Williams Act:  Government neutrality in contests for  corporate control, rules to ensure full  and timely disclosure, adequate  time  for management and shareholders to  make informed decisions, and effective  SEC enforcement of these principles.  These laws are designed to preserve in vestors' faith  in  the fairness of  the  marketplace and ensure that there is a  level playing field in contests for cor porate control.  After carefully listening to hours of  testimony before the committee, I be lieve that the evidence  is ambiguous  about the long-term effect that hostile  takeovers have on the health of the  American economy and the perform ance of corporate management. We  can find a  study  that confirms any  point of view on these issues.  Whatever your own personal preju dice  is, you can find  that somebody  has done that study which conclusive ly proves your point of view.  Hostile takeovers may be necessary  as a check on the behavior of corpo rate managers who do not own  the  assets that they are managing for the  shareholders. On the other hand, we  have seen manipulative  takeover at tempts by raiders who clearly have no  intention of  running  the companies  that they've put into play. The only  beneficiaries of these deals are invest ment bankers and lawyers.  This suggests to me that we have to  maintain the careful balance set up by  the Williams Act. We should make  those changes that we can all agree  on, such as closing the 13(d) window. I  hope that we will limit our efforts to a  simple  package  of Williams  Act  amendments and leave areas such as  corporate governance to the States. As  a  former Governor, I am very reluc tant  to  impose  the Federal Govern ment's wisdom on areas which have  traditionally been the province of the  States.  The  Supreme  Court  has  spoken on this issue in upholding the  Indiana statute, and I believe that we  should  let  these  laws be subject  to  time and  judicial scrutiny before we  hastily preempt them. I hope that the  States will  think about the national  implications of their decisions and the  economic  results  forthcoming,  and  that they will take these into consider ations as  they enact or amend anti takeover laws, and I believe that we on  the Banking Committee should contin ue to monitor their effects.  I also hope that we do not load this  bill down with controversial amend ments which interfere in our market  economy such as  restrictions on the  amount  of  debt  corporations  can  incur.  I am one who believes that an ill considered taxation measure that was  introduced last fall in the House Ways  and Means Committee had a great  deal to do with triggering the down turn of the October 16, 19, and 20 on  the stock exchange.  We will start down a very dangerous  path if we begin to impose legislative  limits on how much money consenting  adults can borrow.  Tender offer reform strikes me as an  area where the ""Law of Unintended  Consequences"" reigns supreme. If we  enact amendments that tilt the bal ance of the legislation one way or the  other, we could be very disturbed by  the results further down the road. Let  us fix the Williams Act and leave it at  that. We can always return to these  issues if events demonstrate that we  need to tinker with the process fur ther.  I  encourage my colleagues  to  vote against amendments which favor  corporate raiders or incumbent management and to support the bill as re ported out by the Banking Committee.  I  thank  the Chair and yield  the  floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",1988
956,400,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, if  the Senator will withhold that, I want  to  do  a  couple  of  things  at  this  moment: First, to congratulate him on  his observations,  for which we  are  grateful. The Senator from Missouri  knows a lot about this subject, having  been a Governor, having been a busi nessman, and having been a participat ing member of the Banking Commit tee. I am really grateful for his inter est in this topic.  Some people may think this is kind  of a difficult,  technical area of  the  law, but in fact it is an extraordinarily  important aspect of the law as it af fects the rights and economic outlook  of people in Missouri, people in Colo rado, and all over the country. So I am  grateful to him for pitching in on this  matter, getting involved, and for his  leadership in helping us to work this  thing out. I thank him for doing so.  ",1988
957,400,11,Mr.  BOND.,"  I  thank my  distin guished colleague from Colorado, who  shows leadership on this as on many  other issues.  ",1988
958,400,11,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," I thank the Sen ator.  I was  relieved a  few minutes ago  when debate resumed to learn this was  not an antishareholders bill; this was  not a bill that in some way was going  to make  it possible  for  entrenched  management  to  continue  to  situate  themselves and to hold a tight grip on  their sinecures. I was afraid we had  gone back  to  the bill we were on  Friday which did have those charac teristics. Now I gather that we have  shifted gears and moved on to another  piece of  legislation altogether.  I am  looking forward to hearing what that  is all about.  Mr. President, during the last few  minutes, I have heard several things  with which I thoroughly disagree, and  I just .want to mention them. It is not  because I want to be cantankerous be cause I  think it is important to keep  the  record straight around here.  In  the first place,  the notion  that  the  reason corporating managers are  fo cused on the short term is because of  the ""hostile takeover craze,"" it is the  most  far-fetched  suggestion  I  have  ever heard.  I happen to believe that it is a fair  concern, a fair criticism, to say that a  lot of companies are run with a very  short  time horizon.  I  think  that  is  poor business practice. I, myself, in my  private practice as an investor would  not dream of being mixed up with a  company like that. The kind of compa nies that do well are those that have a  long-time  horizon,  those  that  look  beyond what the stock price is going  ",1988

960,426,11,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of S. 1323, the Tender  Offer Disclosure and Fairness Act of  1986. This bill was  reported  to  the  Senate by the Senate Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  by a vote of 14 to 6. There was a very  clear majority within the committee in  the  favor  of  this  legislation.  It was  brought out after extensive hearings  on corporate  takeovers held by  the  Senate Banking Committee on Janu ary 28, March 4, April 8, April 22, June  23, 24, 25, and 26. We heard from a  very long list of able witnesses, leaders  in  the  financial  field,  leaders  from  business, leaders from labor, State rep resentatives, Government officials, in stitutional  investors,  shareholders  groups, and so forth and so on.

963,426,11,Mr. PROXMIRE.," I want  to  thank  my good  friend  from Maryland  for  raising this point. I do not think any body has pointed out the hard and de tailed work the committee did. As the  Senator said,  there were 10 days of  hearings. It is very unusual we have  that length of time for hearings. The  Senator pointed out we had all  the  leaders  from  all  sides of  this  issue  itself. We have a very, very substantial  record on this. So the vote of the com mittee which he alluded to, the 14-to-6  vote, was based on a very comprehen sive study of the problem and getting  the opinions of people who were on all  sides of  each of  these  complicated  questions.  I do not think that has been brought  out by anybody. It certainly has not  been by this Senator. I think it is the  kind of information the Senate ought  to understand when we vote on this.  ",1988
964,426,11,Mr. SARBANES.,"  I  appreciate  the  chairman's comment. I think it is im portant.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a section from the commit tee report on this legislation entitled  ""History of the Legislation"" be includ ed  in  the RECORD. That details not  only the dates of the hearings but who  was heard at each of those hearings. I  think  anyone  reading  through  this  hearing record would have to conclude  that the committee did a very careful,  and  extensive  examination  of  this  issue. All sides were heard from. We  appreciated  the  importance of  this  matter. We wanted  to probe  it  in  depth, and that is exactly what hap pened. Furthermore, it took place over  an extended period of time, which, of  course, gave people  time  to reshape  their views if they chose to do so, in  the  light of developing  testimony both members of the committee and  witnesses who were called before us.  We had the leading people who con cerned themselves with this issue, in a  whole range of diverse activities, testi fy before the committee, in consider ing this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have that provision printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the ex cerpt was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  ",1988
965,439,11,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, July 1,  1988 marks Chief Judge Alexander L.  Paskay's 25th year on the U.S. Bank ruptcy Court for the middle district of  Florida. I would like to take this op portunity to thank him for his years  of service on the bench and his contri bution to the legal profession in gener al.  As if 25 years of service on the bench  were not enough, Judge Paskay has  distinguished himself as a legal schol ar and author. Judge Paskay is chair man for the Annual Bankruptcy Semi nar, sponsored by Stetson University  College of Law, a post which he has  held since 1974. As adjunct professor  at Stetson University College of Law,  Judge Paskay has taught courses on  creditors' rights since 1973. Additional ly  impressive,  in 1979, Judge Paskay  was appointed by Chief Justice Burger  to serve on the Advisory Committee on  Bankruptcy Rules. The judge current ly serves on the Administrative Office  of  the U.S. Courts Task Force on  Bankruptcy Forms.  A noted authority on bankruptcy  law,  Judge  Paskay  authored  the  ""Handbook for Trustees and Receiv ers""  and  its  1978  supplement,  and  coauthored the ""14th Edition of Col lier on Bankruptcy,"" which is consid ered to be the leading text in its field.  Judge Paskay serves as a member of  the board of advisors of the Annual  Survey of Bankruptcy Laws and is co author of volume 6 of ""Norton Bank ruptcy Law and Practice,"" published  by Callaghan Co.  Judge Paskay has also  served  the  legal community  through his exten sive  involvement  in  legal  organiza tions. A member of the American Bar  Association, the Florida Bar Associa tion, and the Hillsborough County Bar  Association,  his  reputation  is wide spread. He has served in the past as  chairman of the Bankruptcy Commit tee of the Florida Bar, and presently  serves on the advisory council of the  Consumer Credit Counseling Service  of Tampa and as bankruptcy liaison to  the judicial council of the fifth circuit  on the Bankruptcy Act.  As  further  tribute  to  the  life and  career of  Judge Paskay,  I  think  it  worth mentioning that he has over come much adversity in his early life.  A native of Hungary, Judge Paskay  was deported by German occupational  forces to Germany in 1944, where he  spent the remaining months of World  War II in a  labor camp. After being  liberated by the British forces in 1945,  Judge Paskay joined the British Army  as staff interpreter. He quickly became  chief interpreter for the British War  Crimes  Commission,  interrogating  Germans accused of having committed  war crimes, and later worked for the  French occupational government  in  charge of all displaced persons in the  French zone of occupation.  In 1949, Judge Paskay immigrated to  the United States where he resumed  his  education,  rece1vmg  his  LLB  degree and the degree of juris doctor  from the University of Miami School  of Law. Prior to accepting his judge ship, he was employed as a  research  assistant for the late Hon. Joseph P.  Lieb, a Federal district  judge in the  southern district of Florida.  On  this  occasion,  commemorating  Judge Paskay's 25 years on the bench  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, I wish  to  commend  Judge Paskay  for  his  hard work and dedication to the pro fession of law and wish him the happi ness and pride  that he so well de serves.

984,478,11,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today as  a cosponsor and supporter of H.R. 4150, a bill  that would remove the Postal Service from the  Federal budget.  I join with 357 of my colleagues in support  of this measure. This bill addresses a critical  postal  issue which  is vitally  important to the  survival of the U.S. Postal Service. Last year,  the Postal Service was forced to cut back to  help compensate  for the budget deficit. The  enactment of  the Budget Reconciliation Act  mandated the Postal Service to cut $1.2 bil lion  from  its budget. Because of these cuts,  the  cost of a  first-class  stamp has been  raised, there has been a significant reduction  in  postal  construction  and  modernization  projects throughout the country, and there has  been a reduction in the hours of postal serv ice to the public.  I believe that postal service  to  our  constituents  and  to  the American  people in general must not be compromised.  The Postal Service provides  services  to  every community in our Nation. It delivers over  150 billion pieces of mail annually usually  within 24 hours from the time the Postal Serv ice receives the mail and it does all of this for  less  than  25  cents. With  the  increasing  amount of mail volume,  the Postal Service  must expand  its  facilities. However, due  to  current budget restraints,  it has been unable  to construct improved facilities.  This bill recognizes the unique quality of the  Postal Service-it is self-sufficient and pays its  own bills by selling postal services. The only  appropriations it receives is from revenue for gone as mandated by Congress. The Postal  Service deserves to be independent from Fed eral control.  This measure is extremely important to our  entire Nation. The U.S. Postal Service is dis tinct and needs to be  treated as such. This  measure will enable the Postal Service to con tinue to offer services to every community in  our Nation and it deserves our full support.  I  urge my colleagues  to vote yes  in  favor of  H.R. 4150.  ",1988
985,478,11,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to support H.R. 4150, a bill to restore the U.S.  Postal Service to off-budget status.  This legislation will guarantee that the kind  of reductions in postal operations and sudden  cancellation of postal construction that we wit nessed  recently  and  are  still  witnessing  cannot happen again as a result of the Feder al budget process.  As a result of  last year's deficit reduction  effort,  the  Postal  Service was  forced  to  reduce capital expenses by $815 million and  operating expenses by $430 million.  The Postal Service does not contribute over  time to the Federal deficit because no Federal  funds are appropriated  for postal operating  costs. The Postal Service pays its own way. It  is, therefore, unfair to call on  it to help solve  the deficit problem created by this administra tion at  the expense of customers who have  suffered delays and inconvenience.  Three hundred and  fifty-eight Members of  the House,  including all  the members of the  Post Office and Civil Service Committee, have  cosponsored this bill, attesting strongly to its  bipartisan support.  What this bill does is restore the U.S. Postal  Service  to  the off-budget status  it enjoyed  prior  to 1986. The  legislation would provide  that Postal Service's receipts and disburse ments would no  longer be counted  for  the  purpose of determining  the Federal deficit.  Thus, neither the administration nor Congress  could reduce  the deficit by  increasing stamp  prices or decreasing postal services.  And deficit reduction could not be used as a  subterfuge to meddle in the operations of the  Postal Service and to attempt to micromanage  it.  As a result of  last year's deficit reduction  effort, 7 4 percent of new construction projects  were  deferred  or  canceled.  Post  Office  window hours were reduced by about 10 per cent. Sunday mail collection and processing  were  eliminated.  Administrative  expenses  have been  cut and procurements delayed.  Hundreds  of  construction  projects-new  starts, expansions, and modernizations-have  been affected. Were  these cuts ordered be cause congressional oversight showed  they  would  improve postal service  in  the Nation?  No,  in fact they will probably result in poorer  service. They were ordered because, as an  accounting matter, they result, on paper, in a  lower Federal deficit. This would not have oc curred if the Postal Service were ""off budget.""  The bill,  as amended,  increases existing  statutory  limitations on  the Postal Service's  borrowing authority. Under the Postal Reorga nization Act of 1970 new borrowing is limited  to $1.5 billion per year for capital needs and  $500 million per year for operations. Further,  the aggregate amount of outstanding Postal  Service debt cannot exceed $10 billion.  These borrowing  limits were established  in  the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 when  postal revenues were less than $10 billion per  year. The Postal Service points out that postal revenues  today approaching $35 billion, but  these borrowing ""caps"" have never been ad justed.  It  further says  that  the cap on aggregate  outstanding debt,  if not adjusted soon, could  disrupt  the 5-year capital  improvement pro gram approved by  the Board of Governors  last year.  I know that moving any entity off budget is  a controversial issue. But the Postal Service is  unique. The 1970 act which established it as  an  independent entity mandates that it break  even. After a shaky start, it has met that man date. It pays its own way.  It has broken even  over the last 1 0 years. Since 1982 the Postal  Service has received no appropriations for op erating purposes-moneys are appropriated to  subsidize certain ""preferred"" classes of mail.  It pays its expenses from its own revenues.  And unlike most Federal agencies,  its costs  are driven by a factor beyond its control-mail  volume.  Keeping the Service on budget significantly  distorts Federal deficit figures because of the  way the large postal capital improvement pro gram  is presented, and because  the Postal  Service uses accrual accounting while  the  Government is on a cash basis. In the Federal  budget, postal capital  improvements are  in cluded as budget authority when commitments  are made and as outlays when cash pay ments are disbursed. This  treatment  inflates  the deficit because  it suggests  that postage  should have been collected  to cover all  the  cash payments as post offices,  for example,  are built. This accounting  treatment  ignores  the  fact  that as capital assets are acquired  the Postal Reorganization Act makes provi sion for the expense to be recognized through  depreciation charges and for the assets to be  paid for by postage collected over their useful  lives.  In effect, the Federal budget treats the  standard business-like financing of postal cap ital projects as if it were deficit spending.  There are  those who  have argued  that  moving  the Postal Service off budget will  remove  it  from congressional oversight. But  this is not the case.  The question of whether or not the Postal  Service should be off budget, that is, whether  its income and expenditures should be count ed  in determining  the Federal deficit,  is not  the same as the question of whether or not it  should  be  an  accountable  Government  agency subject  to aggressive congressional  oversight. For 12 years,  fiscal  years 197 4  through 1985, it was off budget. During those  years the Congress amended the Postal Reor ganization Act 33 times; there were more than  400 congressional hearings on postal related  issues; 903 bills dealing with postal  issues  were introduced in the House alone; and Con gress' investigating arm, the General Account ing Office, issued 225 reports on postal mat ters.  All  this occurred while  the Postal Service  was off budget. The argument  that budget  treatment and accountability are related is an  empty one.  The  real  issue  is whether decisions on  postal policy, postal financing, and postal op erations should be driven by political agree ments aimed at reducing  the Federal deficit.  f\s  long as  the Postal Service  is on budget  there are two ways  it can be used as an  in strument for deficit reduction. First,  it can be  required  to  increase  revenues;  that  is,  raise  postal rates. Second, it con be required to de crease expenditures; that is, reduce costs by  cutting services or canceling or deferring cap ital investment.  The authors of the 1970 Reorganization Act  believed it was in the best interest of the post  office, its employees and customers, and the  Nation as a whole  to have an  independent  Postal Service. Today,  that  independence  is  seriously threatened.  We must  insulate  the Postal Service  from  political pressures,  including  those  resulting  from the ongoing battles over the Federal def icit. Returning  the Service  to an off-budget  status is a step in the right direction.  ",1988

991,491,11,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4212,  introduced  by OUr  colleague  CHARLES  RANGEL,  would formally establish the Hamilton  Grange National Memorial  in New  York City so that the site could be  fully restored and interpreted to the  public. Although  the National Park  Service has managed this historic site  for many years, the original1962 legis lation stipulated  that  the Hamilton  Grange National Memorial could not  be established until  the house was  moved  to a new,  less urban, setting.  While a  rural  location was precisely  the setting Alexander Hamilton chose  when he  initially built his house  in  1798,  such  locations are difficult  to  find in New York City today. Further more,  current  practices  of  historic  preservation clearly oppose any such  relocation. H.R. 4212 removes the re quirement for moving the house and  formally  establishes  the Hamilton  Grange National Memorial.  The committee adopted an amend ment  in  the nature of a  substitute  which makes several technical changes  in the bill as introduced. Congress es tablishes the historic site rather than  the Secretary of the Interior. The sub stitute also references a map, allows  for the donation of the land to the Na tional Park Service, directs the Secre tary of the Interior .. to manage the site  in accordance with legislation for the  National Park Service and authorizes  appropriations. Finally,  it clearly di rects  that  the  interpretation of  the  life of Alexander Hamilton be placed  in  the  larger context of  the United  States as a young nation. Too often we  look only at the great man, and not at  the larger society that shaped his life  and that he shaped by his actions. By  placing Alexander Hamilton in a broad  context we are likely to present histo ry both more  accurately and more  completely. Mr. Speaker,  I  endorse  this legislation and seek its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1988
992,491,11,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated early, the  administration and  the Members on  this side of the aisle support this legis lation to commemorate our Founding  Fathers. Alexander Hamilton was an  influential and central figure  in  the  early development of our country and  it is appropriate that we direct the Na tional Park Service to explain the his tory of our country through Hamil ton's country home in New York.  I recommend my colleagues join me  in supporting this legislation.  ",1988
993,504,11,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, today we take up H.R.  3011,  the Home Equity Loan Con sumer Protection Act of 1988. This act  will provide consumers with important  protections regarding open-end home  equity loans.  I want to commend the chairman of  the Banking Committee,  the gentle man from Rhode Island, Mr. ST GER MAIN,  for his cooperation and assist ance in moving this bill along so quick ly. He has been a long-time consumer  champion and his cosponsorship of  this legislation adds to his great con sumer work. I also want to commend  the ranking minority member, of the  committee, Mr. WYLIE, and the rank ing minority member, of the subcom mittee, Mr. HILER, as well as the gen tleman from New York, Mr. ScHUMER,  for their support and cooperation in  producing this legislation. I also want  to  commend  the  gentleman  from  Texas, Mr. BARTLETT, for handling this  bill for the minority side.  Most of all I want to commend the  gentleman from North Carolina [Mr.  PRICE] with whom I have cosponsored  this legislation. Mr. PRICE has been a  tireless worker  in his efforts  to get  this  legislation enacted and he de serves not only the accolades of the  Members of this House, but the grati tude of every American who owns a  home.  Mr. PRICE  is  to be especially com mended for being the first Member in  this body  to  introduce home equity  loan legislation. He worked hard with  Members, consumer groups, and indus try representatives  to balance many  competing  interests. That  is quite a  feat even for  long-time Members of  the House, let alone for a  first-term  Member. His  accomplishment bodes  well for his future in this body.  Mr. Speaker, there was a time when  only termites could do more damage to  a  homeowner  than  a  home  equity  loan. Today, we are changing all of  that. We can't eliminate termites, we'll  leave that to Otto, the Orkin man, but  we  are making  certain  that home  equity loans will be a benefit rather  than a burden to homeowners.  Home equity loans may well be the  fastest growing craze since the hoola  hoop. But  unlike  the  hoola  hoop,  which cost about $1.98 and normally  end up  in yard  sales  after  a  few  months use, home equity loans are not  a nickel and dime proposition. In 1981,  only slightly more than $20 billion was  loaned on home equity loans. By 1986,  that figure had increased 500 percent  with more  than $100  billion being  loaned on the equity built up in a per son's home. The figures for 1987 are  still not available but home equity  loans could well reach the $200 billion  origination mark for this year. These  loans are growing so rapidly that it is  very difficult  to obtain accurate fig ures as to the volume of outstanding  loans.  But by all estimates, even the large  amount of money outstanding in home  equity loans is only a microscopic dot  compared  to  the amount of equity  that American homeowners have built  up in their homes.  It is difficult for me to envision any  dollar amount greater  than  the na tional debt of the United States, which  is currently over $2  trillion. But it is  estimated  that homeowners  in  this  country have equity values  in  their  homes of $4.83  trillion, more  than  twice the amount of the national debt.  It is further estimated that nearly 97  percent of the home equities built up  by homeowners are still available for  borrowing. So while  the  interest  in  home equity  loans has  risen  faster  than a new Bruce Springsteen record,  there is still so much untapped home  equity potential available, 4.83 trillion  dollars' worth, that if all of those dol lars were placed in a stack, it would  reach 32,000 miles in the air and would  weigh 490 million tons.  Home equity loans offer advantages  to consumers. To a large part, the in terest on these loans is tax deductible  while the deduction for other forms of  consumer interest is being phased out.  In addition, home equity loans enables  consumers to tap the equity in their  homes without selling them.  These loans are more flexible than  traditional  second mortgages. They  can give  consumers a  large  line of  credit which can be easily accessed  through checks or credit cards.  At the same time, home equity loans  can present many potential problems.  Many of  these  loans have variable  rates and are often offered with anini tial attractive  low  rate. These rates  can then go up,  taking payments up  with  them. Consumers may be un aware of the potential for escalating  rates and their impact on their month ly  payments. Unexpected  payment  crunches can occur.  The legislation will assure that con sumers get necessary and  important  disclosures  before  they open home  equity  loan accounts. It will enable  consumers  to  understand  fully  the  conditions of  this new form of con sumer borrowing. It will make clear to  them that they risk the loss of their  home in the event of default.  In addition  to  the disclosures  re quired with applications,  the  legisla tion  also  contains  important home  equity protections  for variable  rate  home equity  loans. The  index  rate  must be one  that  is both publicly  available and not under the control of  the  lender. This protects consumers  their  from artificial manipulation of  interest rates.  Lenders are prohibited from calling  in the loan for any reason other than  in three specified instances. Those in stances are:  fraud or misrepresenta tion on the part of the consumer, a  failure of the consumer to meet there payment  terms of  the  account,  or  action by the consumer which adverse ly affects the creditors' security inter est.  Another important consumer protec tion contained in the bill is a ban on  unilateral changes in the terms of the  account. The legislation generally pro hibits  creditors  from  unilaterally  changing  the  terms of  the account.  Changes are permitted in only certain  specified  circumstances. A  creditor  may change the index used for a vari able rate loan, if the old index is no  longer available. The next index must  yield results similar to the old index.  In cases in which there is a material  change in the borrowers financial cir cumstances, a creditor may freeze the  account or reduce the credit line. Simi larly, if the creditor has doubts about  the consumer's ability to repay, or if  the consumer is in default, the credi tor may prohibit new borrowing or  reduce the credit line.  Consumers are also given the right  to have fees they paid refunded until  three days after their receipt of the  disclosures required by the act.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill which  will help consumers interested in ap plying  for  and using  home  equity  loans. These loans can be beneficial to  consumers, so long as they understand  the risks involved. This legislation will  assure that consumers are fully aware  of the terms and conditions of these  loans.  The  legislative  process  has  worked to produce a good piece of leg islation, and I urge its passage.  ",1988
994,504,11,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Mr. Speaker, the legisla tion before us,  the Home Equity Loan Con sumer Protection Act of 1988  is one of the  most important consumer measures to come  before the Congress in years.  Today, millions of homes across the Nation  are being placed on  the  line as security for  loans. When  families enter  into  these  loan  contracts blindly, when they are handed mis leading information, and when the rules of the  game are changed at half-time, homes-usu ally a  family's biggest asset-are placed at  risk.  H.R. 3011, as amended, would provide con sumers with disclosures of all aspects of the  loan commitment-up  front before  the con tract  is  locked  in  forevermore-no hidden  fees, no hidden  terms  that  the  lender can  impose on unsuspecting homeowners.  The  legislation would also establish stand ards  for  the  advertising  of  home  equity  loans-putting an end  to carnival-type adver tising  that lures homeowners  into deals they  can't afford. The bill would also require  that  the interest rates on these loans be tied to an  index outside the control of the lender. Thus,  ",1988
995,517,11,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratu late the State of Israel on the occasion of her  40th  birthday.  Since  its  establishment  40  years ago,  Israel has developed a political,  economic, and  intellectual system  that has  become a model for the world.  I salute them  for their efforts and their consistency.  Beginning a nation ""from scratch"" is not an  easy  task. This  is especially  true when  the  nation  in question  is surrounded by hostile  states. However,  the people of  Israel have  worked together to create the only democracy  in  the Middle East.  Israel has  incorporated  hundreds of thousands of Jews from around  the world, including countless individuals flee ing less tolerant cultures, into an open society.  The United States and Israel share common  goals of peace  in  the Middle East.  Israel's  strong  pro-Western  orientation  gives  the  United States one of its few true friends in the  world. There is cooperation between the two  countries in a host of defense and intelligence  areas, as well as joint air and naval exercises.  As a Member of the U.S. Congress,  I take  special  pride  in  Israel's  celebration.  The  United States and Israel have shared a friend ship dating back to the first day of Israel's ex istence. The United States aided the fledgling  State of Israel in its formation, and immediate ly extended diplomatic  relations  to  the new  state upon  its proclamation of independence  on May  14,  1948. Our  two  nations  have  always been fast friends and firm allies, work ing  together  to secure our common values.  Our relationship has been based on a shared  democratic perspective, one which we can  send to the rest of the world.  Mr. Speaker,  I hope that all Americans will  join me  in  saluting  the 40th birthday of a  friend of America. Let us all wish Israel happy  birthday.  RACE IS NOW A CLASS ISSUE  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 1988  ",1988
996,517,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  throughout the  previous decades our Nation has experienced  the pain and  suffering associated with  the  fight  for racial equality, and civil  rights. Over  the last 20 years, some initial racial problems  have been  resolved, and some blacks have  achieved more political, social, and economi cal autonomy. But, as John V. Lindsay has  written  in a recent editorial  in  the Christian  Science Monitor,  the problem of  race  still  exists; its structure has just changed.  Mr. Speaker, and fellow Members, I believe  it is time that we step back and reevaluate the  crisis  facing  the poor and disadvantaged of  our country. For too long this group of people  have been neglected in our legislative efforts,  and many recent studies are conveying grim  pictures of the progress that has been made  15293  by the Federal Government in combating the  problems of the poor in the last 8 years. This  deteriorating situation  is a direct result of a  widening socioeconomic gap, which not so in cidentally leaves behind blacks and other non white minorities.  I would like to share with you Mr. Lindsay's  article, and as  I read  it,  I hope that you will  keep  in mind  the continuing needs of our  country's disadvantaged.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, May  10, 1988]  RACE IS NOW A CLASS ISSUE  <By John V. Lindsay)  Most reports by presidential commissions  lie forgotten gathering dust in the Library  of Congress. Yet, Americans who hope their  country will practice what its constitution  preaches still invoke the report presented to  President Lyndon Johnson 20 years ago by  the Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,  the so-called Kerner Commission.  This  800-page  document  accused  the  United States of having become ""two soci eties, one black, one white, separate and un equal."" Following the ""long hot summer"" of  racial discord and urban riots in 1967, this  accusation rang true. Our report was unani mous. Whether  liberal,  conservative,  or  moderate,  every  commission member  ac knowledged  incontrovertible evidence of a  racially polarized body politic.  Two decades later that polarization has  taken a new form. The US now confronts a  new  crisis  in  race  relations which  the  Kerner Commission could hardly have an ticipated and which better  leadership  in  recent years might have prevented.  America's nonwhite middle class has ex panded significantly; that is partly because  of the Kerner report and to citizens and po litical leaders who took the findings serious ly. Also, a growing number of blacks and  Hispanics  occupy  leadership  positions  in  city halls and statehouses across the coun try, as well as in Congress.  While  such  changes  are  hallmarks of  greater decency and maturity in our nation al life, many of the poorest of minority citi zens have been left far behind in a  losing  struggle for survival. Backsliding at the fed eral level on commitments to equal opportu nity  in  employment,  job  training,  low income housing, and medical care have had  devastating results.  Rising crime rates, more homelessness, as cending  teen-age birthrates,  lower school  dropout ages, and heavier traffic in illegal  drugs describe  the effect on behavior and  the tragic circumstances of a growing por tion of the population that is disconnected  from society as we have known  it. What  were once regarded as  issues of race have  become,  increasingly,  issues of ""class,""  a  word never heard in our country before.  In the 20 years since the Kerner report,  legislative protections against racial discrim ination have diminished, but not erased, the  problems of poverty suffered by this ""un derclass."" A new commission examining the  difficulties that the Kerner panel investi gated would find two societies: divided these  days more along  lines of economic condi tions and personal conduct  than of  race.  Worse, racial polarization has become fur ther exacerbated by the widening gulf be tween social classes.  This problem, caused by a climate set at  the highest levels of government, can only  be solved by  leadership  that reflects  the  U.S. Constitution's highest principles.  ",1988
997,543,11,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  Banking  Committee  during  the  markup on S. 1323, the Tender Offer  Disclosure and Fairness Act, consid ered adopting a provision regulating  the use of golden parachutes by corpo rations and decided not to do so.  While  the  committee  understood  that golden parachutes can be abused,  it also recognized that boards of direc tors sometimes adopt  them so  that  senior executives will stay with a com pany  and  completely devote  them selves to a company's business during  a change of control contest. With such  agreements  in place, manager's feel  free to bargain hard for shareholders  and against a bidder, even  if it will  later cost their jobs.  Since there were both good and bad  points  associated with  the  use  of  golden  parachutes  the  committee  chose to allow their use to be regulat ed by the States which charter corpo rations. State courts have struck down  abusive  golden  parachute  schemes  when they have reviewed them under  the so-called business judgment rule.  While  I  think  the use of golden  parachutes can be  regulated by  the  States, I also recognize that it would  not be a gross infringement on States  rights and the State chartering of cor porations  to adopt  some  legislation  regulating  the use of golden para chutes.  The regulation of golden parachutes,  unlike the regulation of shareholder  rights plans, miscalled ""poison pills""  by the press, or the voting rules of cor porations, does not strike at the heart  of our system of allowing the States  which charter corporations to regulate  their activities. In fact, Congress has  already established a precedent for a  special Federal interest in regulation  of golden parachutes when it decided  to tax them at a special higher rate in  the Internal Revenue Code. Senator  ARMsTRONG  even refers  to  that Tax  Code provision in his amendment.  While I believe that the State court  review of golden parachute provisions  coupled with  the Federal  tax  laws  have already cured the worst abuses of  this practice, I am prepared, under the  circumstances,  to vote  for  the Arm strong amendment because I do not  think  it will do any harm.  I  think  golden parachutes have begun to dis appear very rapidly because of the tax  involved. The amendment will not ban  the use of such compensation schemes  outright, and as noted above does not  set a precedent for the Federal regula tion of internal corporate matters. For  all of these reasons I will vote for this  amendment.  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I  wish to point out, in rebuttal to the  Senator from Alabama and the Sena tor from Colorado, some of the golden  ripoffs that have been made by people  taking over corporations, compared to  the corporation executives. These are  just Wall Streeters, not people  like  Boone Pickens. The ""Wall Street 100  Index"" indicates how much they made  last year: Jerome Kohlberg, at least  $35 million; Leon Black, of Drexel  Burnham Lambert, at least $12 mil lion; Michael Milken, at least $60 mil lion; Henry Kravis, at least $70 mil lion.  These  are people who made  this  money not for anything constructive  and positive they did. In effect, they  loaded corporations up with debt, put  them in a very serious position, and  cleaned up.  The article asks: ""What do you do  with an annual  income approaching  nine figures?"" You could buy a fighter  plane for $64 million, a Sea Hawk heli copter for $19 million, a $9 million dia mond for the woman of your dreams,  and you could pay $7 million to buy  your own Bahamian island.  While  I will  support  the Senator  from Colorado on this amendment, I  think  that  on  other  amendments  which we should draw  the  line, be cause they go  right to the heart of  State governments and corporations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have the article to which I re ferred printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Financial World, June 28, 19881  STILL THE BEST GAME IN TOWN  <By Stephen Taub with David Carey, Tani  Maher, Richard Meher,  and Ruthanne  Sutor)  Dapper,  flamboyant  and  just  33,  the  founder and president of Tudor Investment,  Paul Tudor Jones II, ranked as the most  highly compensated Wall Streeter last year.  In  one  lunch  hour,  Jones made more  money-about $50,000-than roughly 94% of  Americans make in a full year. He earned  between $80 million and $100 million in 1987  by deftly trading $75 billion worth of finan cial and commodity futures. Jones edged out  George Soros, whose hedge  fund at one  point last year was down $800 million from  its high, but still posted a 13% gain for the  year. For Soros, a $75 million income.  What do you do with an annual income  approaching nine figures? More than the  gross national product of two nations, the  Maldives and Sao Tome and Principe? Well,  Jones could purchase an F-14 fighter plane  for $64 million, a Seahawk helicopter for  $19 million, and still have enough money  left over  to buy  the 85.51 carat diamond  that recently went for over $9 million, for  the woman of his dreams. And, if he gets  bored with his 3,000-acre wildlife preserve  on Chesapeake Bay, he could plunk down $7  million and buy his own Bahamian island.  For his next party, he could lease the QE2  and invite the entire Wall Street 100 clan to  cruise around the world two times. Or, if he  prefers  something  less  ostentatious,  he  could hail a New York City cab and tool  about  the  continent  for  over  11  years  straight. But he can't buy all  the tea in  China. That would take well over $300 mil lion.  Following closely behind Jones and Soros  are Henry Kravis and George Roberts of  the  famed buyout  firm Kohlberg Kravis  Roberts & Co., who made a big killing when  they brought E-ll public last year. In fact,  four KKR principals made the top 20, earn ing a  combined $200 million-more  than  either Reuters or USX made. Robert Mac Donnell, Roberts' brother-in-law, took home  at least $20 million. Jerome Kohlberg made  at least $35 million, and that's not counting  any income that came by launching his own  firm with his son James. LBO rival Forst mann Little didn't do too badly itself. Theo dore Forstmann, William Brian Little, Nich olas Forstmann and John Sprague together  made between $70 million and $80 million.  Altogether,  the  100  top  compensated  people grossed around $1.2 billion, or an av erage of about $12 million per person. But  this doesn't include the 48 Goldman, Sachs  partners who would have made the list. To  prevent this exercise from becoming a Gold man, Sachs yearbook, we separated its part ners from the pack, except for Chairman  John Weinberg, and created another  list  just for them. Had Goldman's partners been  included, the average compensation for the  top 100 would have divided out to about $13  million a head.  And you  thought the October massacre  would finally restore Wall Street's compen sation  to more  earthbound  levels! Sure,  after  the crash, bonuses were mercilessly  slashed at the big brokerage firms,  thou sands  lost  their  jobs and speculators and  FW 100 alumni George Kellner, Alan Slifka  and Arnold Amster lost their shirts. Even  Leon Levy and Jack Nash,  the legendary  Odyssey Partners who each made $20 mil lion  in 1986,  suffered modest  losses  last  year.  Lazard  Freres  Chairman Michel  David-Weill, FW's top earner in 1986, saw  his compensation drop from about $125 mil lion  to about $54 million, still more than  twice than Business Week just estimated it  to be. But, from the looks of this year's list,  no one is exactly heading for the poorhouse.  How does one make so much money in  just one year? Some, like the partners at the  LBO  firms KKR,  Forstman Little  and  Wesray, made their money by being at the  vortex of the megadeals. Jones and Bruce  Kovner guessed right in the futures pits,  which proxy solicitor Donald Carter rode  the coattails of merger mania. But all of  these financiers have one thing in common.  They share  the profits with  just a  few  people.  Jones, Soros and Tom Baldwin own their  own firms, and the gang at KKR still keeps  much of  the profits for  themselves, even  though they have taken on quite a number  of new partners in the past few years. Forst mann Little is basically a four-person oper ation. And although Wesray's 18 partners  are more equal than they would be at an other buyout firm, each deal has a new set  of general and limited partners. d~pending  upon who brought  the deal  in and who  worked most heavily on  it. Even Drexel  Burnham Lambert's Michael Milken seems  to  own  his  own  brokerage  firm within  Drexel, which is private itself and thus not  subject to shareholder scrutiny.  Think big if you hire these men.  KKR and Fortsmann Little, for example,  get about 1.5% of the money committed to  their buyout pools. When they buy a com pany, they take an investment banking fee  equal to about 1.5% of the price tag. Then,  they  keep  20%  of  all  profits. Not  too  shabby.  ",1988

1001,582,11,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  I  join  the Senator from Ohio and others in  urging our colleagues to pass this leg islation. I was just reading a press re lease  from  the National Council of  Senior Citizens, a statement by their  president, Jacob Clayman, who says:  The opportunity to buy at discount prices,  thereby stretching one's income, is especial ly  important  to  the elderly and disabled  who are on fixed incomes.  Mr. President, it is not simply the el derly. It is farmers in Illinois, Nebras ka, North Dakota,  Iowa, and other  States who are facing problems. It is  working men and women who want to  continue to be able to buy things at  the best possible price. That is what  this bill  is all about. If you are op posed to price fixing, if you want real  competition, if you want the free en terprise system to really work, then let  it work. Let us have real competition.  If I may use a personal illustration,  our family just bought a new washer  at our home in southern Illinois. Our  small town of Makanda, IL, did not  have a place to buy a washer so we  had to go about 12 miles away to Car bondale. We  could have  purchased  one, I assume, at a discount store. We  often make purchases at such stores.  We decided however, to pay a higher  price to take advantage of a long-term  service agreement available to us else where.  Those are the things that we ought  to continue to be able to weigh. This  bill will  allow  consumers  to make  those choices and it does not for a  moment prevent a manufacturer from  insisting  that a  distributor provide  service or deal in an ethical way.  The New York Times has an editori al saying, ""The Senate Judiciary Com mittee's bill and a companion that has  already passed the House would codify  the 1911 precedent and spell out what  constitutes evidence of price fixing. It  should be easy for manufacturers to  live with. Indeed,  the puzzle  is why  the Metzenbaum measure is controver sial. If common sense prevails, it will  pass.""  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi dent, that the New York Times edito rial be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the edito rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, May 6, 1988]  LET THE RETAIL PRICE BE RIGHT  Should a manufacturer have the power to  tell retailers what to charge consumers for a  product? The Supreme Court's recent ruling  on this doesn't plow new ground but warns  Congress that a majority of the Court re mains uneasy with forbidding manufactur ers to fix retail prices.  Quick passage of a bill sponsored by Sena tor Howard Metzenbaum would  clarify  these muddy legal waters. It would protect  consumers against price-fixing without im pairing manufacturers' discretion in enforc ing high retailing standards.  According to a 1911 Court ruling, any at tempt by a supplier to influence the price  charged by a retailer is automatically ille gal. In sending the case of a Houston elec tronics dealer back for retrial last week, the  present Court didn't overturn the 77-year old precedent. But it is clear from Justice  Scalia's opinion that the majority believes  consumers may  sometimes  benefit  from  minimum price agreements between suppli ers and retailers.  The Court communicated its ambivalence  by ruling that only agreements explicitly  setting prices were illegal on their face. A  subtle hint from a manufacturer to a retail er about  the evils of discounting might,  however, pass muster.  This  pleased  conservative  ""Chicago  School"" economists. They acknowledge that  price maintenance  is  sometimes used by  giant stores to prevent smaller ones from  competing with discounts. But they worry  more that the law against setting minimum  markups can create inefficiencies.  Take the case of the Blue Ribbon Com puter Emporium, which devotes hours to ex plaining PC's to customers and lumps the  cost of demonstrations into the retail price.  Unless manufacturers  enforce minimum  markups,  conservatives  argue,  customers  will exploit the service at Blue Ribbon but  purchase computers from the No-Frill Com puter Parlor down the block. In the end,  consumers will  lose access  to  information  and manufacturers will  lose showcases for  complicated products.  This ""free rider"" problem is real, but to  combat it by allowing manufacturers to fix  prices is overkill. Manufacturers can still set  high standards  for service and  refuse  to  supply retailers who don't meet them. All  the Court has said  is  that manufacturers  must not fix prices in the process.  The Senate Judiciary Committee's bill,  and a companion that has already passed  the House, would codify the 1911 precedent  and spell out what constitutes evidence of  price fixing. It should be easy for manufac turers to live with. Indeed, the puzzle is why  the Metzenbaum measure  is controversial.  If common sense prevails, it will pass.  ",1988

1005,582,11,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr.  President,  this bill undercuts the antitrust laws.  We need to keep these antitrust laws  as  they are. This bill  reverses  the  Monsanto decision  of  the Supreme  Court of the United States. This bill is  not price fixing. The American Bar As sociation report that I  just read con demns this bill. It is against the bill.  They say it is not in the public inter est. I hope the Senate will not take  time to go into this bill with so many  other important things to do.  ",1988
1006,582,11,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, this bill  S. 430, addresses a very complex issue  of antitrust law. Frankly, I am con cerned by  the provision of  this bill  which would significantly change the  evidentiary  standards  required  for  proving  a  conspiracy  to  set  resale  prices.  I am not a  lawyer, but it appears  that this bill would allow a manufac turer  to be  successfully  sued  for a  price fixing conspiracy based solely on  a complaint about pricing that he may  have received from another retailer.  It is important to keep in mind that  we are  talking about a  lawsuit that  will automatically subject the defend ant to treble damages.  Mr. President, I've heard strong ar guments on both sides of  this bill.  Some have been quite emotional; some  have been heated. North Carolina is  very fortunate  to have some of the  best  furniture  retail  stores  in  the  country. They are known not only for  the quality of their products and serv ice,  but  also  for  their  competitive  prices-probably  some  of  the most  competitive prices in the country.  It is natural, I'm sure, that some fur niture  retailers around  the country  would like to see their North Carolina  competitors out of the picture. That is  exactly the concern of North Carolina  retailers. It is important to them that  our antitrust laws are adequate to pro tect them from those who might con spire to try to put them out of busi ness.  Mr. President, I have met with furni ture  retailers  from North Carolina,  and I understand the concerns they  have  expressed.  I  intend  to  review  their  concerns  thoroughly,  and no  doubt will  be meeting with  them  again.  As I have said, this bill makes a com plex change to the evidentiary stand ards of antitrust  law. Even experi enced  antitrust  attorneys  disagree  sharply on the effect this bill would  have on the market. Proponents of S.  430 claim that the bill will benefit con sumers. On the other hand, I've seen  analyses of  the bill which conclude  that it would hurt consumers. We are  obliged  to  assess  these  conflicting  opinions carefully.  For example, the antitrust section of  the American Bar Association  con tends that the change proposed in the  bill would actually work to the detri ment of consumers in the long run.  These experts make  the point  that  manufacturers would be discouraged  from cooperating with their retailers  in legitimate ways, or from pursuing  improvements  in  their  marketing  strategies.  ",1988
1007,608,11,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  today  I am  reintroducing  important  legislation aimed at reducing the trag edy of drunk driving. This bill is iden tical to S. 2367, introduced on May 11.  With introduction of this new bill, I  look forward to prompt action by the  committees with an interest in seeing  this  important  legislation move  for ward.  This bill would enhance our fight  against drunk driving by encouraging  the adoption of tougher, more effec tive laws. I am pleased to be joined by  Senators DANFORTH,  BENTSEN,  PELL,  GORE, WEICKER,  CHAFEE, MIKULSKI,  LUGAR,  MURKOWSKI,  HEINZ,  and  GRAHAM. Along with groups like Moth ers Against Drunk Driving,  together  we're working toward a simple goal-to  save lives.  With  the passage of  the National  Uniform Minimum Drinking Age Act  in 1984, the Congress took an impor tant step forward in the battle against  drunk driving. As the Senate sponsor  of that bill, I'm proud to see the re sults of  that action. Today,  all 50  States have adopted a minimum drink ing age of 21, eliminating ""blood bor ders."" A 1985-86 study by the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administra tion  found  that over an 18-month  period, almost 850 young  lives were  saved,  largely due  to  the  increased  minimum drinking age. With ""21"" now  fully in effect, we expect to spare 1,000  families the grief of a lost child each  year.  But the battle against drunk driving  is far from over. A drunk driving fatal ity occurs every 22 minutes  in  this  country. Drunk driving has to be re duced among drivers of all ages.  An essential component of our con tinuing efforts must be enhanced en forcement of Federal, State, and local  laws. Our bill would help States meet  that goal.  The bill would  authorize Federal  seed money to States to help establish  self-sustaining drunk driving preven tion programs. In order to be eligible  for this program, States would have to  put  into place a  self-supporting en forcement program, under which fines  and surcharges collected from individ uals convicted of drunk driving are re turned  to communities  for  enforce ment.  States would also have to adopt laws  that provide for the prompt suspen sion or revocation of the license of a  driver found to be driving under the  influence of alcohol. A recent study re leased by the Insurance Institute for  Highway Safety [IIHSJ showed that  such laws reduce drunk driving fatali ties by 9 percent.  In addition  to  being  eligible  for  grants under these two basic require ments, States could also receive sup plemental funds for adoption of either  or both of the following procedures:  First, a means of making drivers  censes of those under the legal drink ing age  readily distinguishable from  those of drivers of legal drinking age;  and second, the mandatory blood alco hol testing of drivers involved in fatal  or serious accidents.  Finally,  the bill would direct  the  Secretary of Transportation to com mission a study by the National Acade my of Sciences on  the appropriate  blood alcohol concentration at which a  driver should be deemed to be under  the influence of alcohol.  li Mr. President,  the  importance of  this legislation is apparent to anyone  who has suffered the loss of a loved  one. Recently, I listened to the tragic  story of Bob Gore. Mr. Gore was vaca tioning in Hawaii with his 24-year-old  son and daughter, when his children  were killed by a drunk driver. This was  not the first time that driver had been  guilty of driving drunk. But he was  still able to drink and drive. That is an  outrage that must be corrected. That's  what this bill would do.  That drunk driver has now been con victed of manslaughter in the death of  the Gores. But in the 15 months be tween their deaths and the conviction,  he was allowed  to go on driving. In  fact, Mr. Gore told us that the last  thing the convicted killer of his chil dren did before leaving the courtroom  was to turn over his drivers license. If  that had been done after his earlier  transgressions, perhaps  that  tragedy  might never have happened.  Nothing can be done  to bring lost  loved ones back. But we can take steps  to keep  tragedies  like  the one  that  killed  the Gores from happening  to  other families. I want to commend Mr.  Gore  for  his  commitment  to  this  effort. He's turning his personal grief  into a positive force,  trying to spare  others. For  that, he deserves  to be  commended.  I'm pleased  to be  joined  in  this  effort by Mothers Against Drunk Driv ing, the Insurance Institute for High way Safety, and the National Safety  Council. This coalition has been suc cessful before, providing crucial force  behind the minimum drinking age bill.  I  look forward  to continued success  with this legislation, and urge my col leagues  to  join  in cosponsoring  the  bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a copy of the bill be included  in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2549  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  That this Act may be cited as the ""Drunk  Driving Prevention Act of 1988"".

Such grants may only  be used by recipient States to  implement  and enforce such measures.  ""(b) No grant may be made to a State  under this section in any fiscal year unless  such State enters into such agreements with  the Secretary as the Secretary may require  ",1988
1008,634,11,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill in troduced by Mr. HuMPHREY on June  14, S. 2512, which would correct an in justice  in our  society-an  injustice  that creates a barrier to young people  and other disadvantaged workers from  obtaining jobs and becoming more ex perienced and more skilled, and there fore higher paid workers.  The barrier I am speaking of has  been described  as  ""cutting off  the  bottom rungs of the ladder, so  that  people with shorter legs can't climb  up."" This injustice is section 6 of the  Fair  Labor  Standards Act,  which  makes it unlawful for someone to offer  a low-productivity job to anyone and  pay them wages commensurate with  productivity.  Of course, there is no law that says  anyone has to accept a low-productiv ity job. Nobody will accept one if there  is a higher-productivity job for them.  It will certainly be a great day in the  progress of our society when all the  jobs are high-productivity jobs. With  labor-saving equipment and comput ers, which will be able to put ""expert  system"" programs into the workplace,  someday we expect all of the jobs in  society will become high-productivity  jobs.  Every American should be eager to  work and  to contribute  to our eco nomic system-but we have to give ev eryone a chance.  It  is only  fair  to  people just starting off in life, and for  those whose  skills  are  lacking,  to  permit  them  to find work wherever  they can, even if it is a low-productivi ty job.  It is sad, Mr. President, but there are  people in this world who do not want  everyone else to be better off. These  malevolent people take pleasure at the  misfortune of others-and  for pur poses of  their own profit and  their  own economic advantages, they create  barriers to economic progress and eco nomic growth.  Of course, no one who is trying to in flict that harm on others will stand up  and say, ""Come help me do this mean  thing to less skilled people.""  Rather, these advocates of injustice  cover their tracks with high-sounding  moralistic words,  such  as  ""nobody  should be poor"" or ""nobody should be  disadvantaged.""  So  they advocate laws and regula tions that simply make it impossible  for disadvantaged or poor persons to  survive by their own efforts. It is a  cruel trick to pretend to oppose mis fortune of others, but to advocate and  impose conditions making it worse.  One particular group of people who  have long supported racism and eco nomic  privileges  aimed  at  keeping  blacks out of the workplace are the  labor unions of South Africa. Indeed  when we look closely into the history  of that unfortunate land, we find it  was white union organizers who first  demanded the government set up spe cial ""job reservations"" for whites.  There is a very good analysis of this  situation in the book by Prof. Walter  Williams of George Mason University,  entitled ""The State Against Blacks."" I  strongly  recommend Professor Wil liams' book to my colleagues, as an il luminating analysis of  the ways  in  which the government itself has pre vented  the full economic and social  participation of many black people in  the modern world.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a brief excerpt from Profes sor Williams' book be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  the ex cerpt was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  WALTER WILLIAMS, THE'STATE AGAINST  BLACKS  <Excerpt)  The notion that it is sometimes necessary  for some individuals to lower their price in  order that some transactions can occur is of fensive to the sensibilities of many people.  These people support the minimum wage  law as a matter of moral conviction motivat ed by concern for equity in the distribution  of wealth. However, white racists' unions in  South Africa have also been supporters of  minimum wage  laws  and  equal-pay-for equal-work laws for blacks. The New York  Times reported that in South Africa, where  the racial climate is perhaps the most hos tile in the world:  Right wing white uniforms in the building  trades have complained to the South Afri can government that laws reserving skilled  jobs  for whites have  [been] broken and  should be abandoned in favor of equal-pay for-equal-work  laws.  . .. The conservative  building trades made it clear that they were  not motivated by concern for black workers  but had come to feel that legal job reserva tion had been so eroded by government ex emptions  that it no  longer protected the  white worker. [November 28, 19721  To understand how  job reservation laws  became eroded requires only two bits of in formation: (1) During the post-World War  II period, there was a significant building  ",1988
1009,647,11,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I had intended to speak in  my  1-minute  this  afternoon  about  drugs, but I, too, had a great admira tion and respect for Lou Hollis. I did  not know that he had passed away.  When one of our fine workers here on  Capitol Hill dies, unless we mention it  here in the well our fellow Americans  do not know about the thousands of  people in this city who served their  country and serve us here in Congress  so well with such great devotion and  efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Louis Hollis  will be sorely missed.  Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from  Ohio  [Mr. McEwEN],  the preceding  speaker, said, there are thousands of  Americans all over this country who  have a beautiful picture of the Capitol  in black and white, and now lately in  color, on their wall with their Senator  or their Member of this great body,  and they will never know the dedica tion of that man Louis Hollis who took  all those excellent pictures.  DRUGS AND WORLD OPINION  Mr. Speaker, the day before yester day I had the opportunity to go  to  Great Britain and appear on their pro gram which is parallel to ""Meet the  Press"" on the subject of drugs. One of  the points that came up on the show  was that it seems many people around  the world  think poverty  is  the sole  cause of drug abuse; which does not  make sense when you consider that co caine  is a very expensive addiction.  However, I had a big problem inform ing my hosts and guests on that show  that Nancy Reagan is correct, wealthy  people and middle-class people who  used their hard-gotten salaries to buy  cocaine  are  truly  accessories  to  murder. This is a problem that crosses  all economic and socioeconomic lines.  BASE  CLOSING  MEASURE  SHOULD BE HANDLED IN CON FERENCE  <Mr.  EMERSON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1988
1010,647,11,Mr. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the best opportunities we'll have this  year to cut wastefull spending in the  military may fall by the wayside due  to the Democratic leadership's refusal  to honor its promise for a floor vote.  The base closing measure, to set up a  nonpartisan  commission  to  recom mend military bases for closure, was  not offered as an amendment to the  DOD authorization bill because  the  Democratic  leadership  wanted  a  chance to consider the bill at greater  length. That earlier promise now looks  more and more like it was designed to  derail this popular idea.  For  this measure  to be successful  this year,  it must be handled in the  conference on the DOD authorization.  The Democratic  leadership has said  that to handle  it  in conference  the  House must first debate it and vote on  it on  the House  floor.  I  urge  the  Democratic leadership to stop playing  politics with this issue and bring this  bill to the House floor before the end  of the DOD conference.  Mr. Speaker, this issue is much too  important to stall around on. Let the  House have a chance to vote on this  measure before  the DOD conference  ends.

1011,660,11,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  express my support for the 1989 Defense ap propriation  and Defense  amendment  bills.  These bills include important arms control pro visions that affirm  the Congress' support for  the arms control process begun by  the  INF  Treaty.  Perhaps the most important achievement of  the 1988 Defense bills  lies  in  the  restraints  they  impose on  the President's SDI or star  wars program. By cutting $600 million  from  the administration's request for star wars, the  Defense bills not only cut the budget deficit,  they also force the star warriors to rethink a  program whose costs and benefits are still un known. After pouring billions of dollars of re search money  into star wars, we are still  in  doubt as to whether a space-based defense is  possible, affordable, or even desirable. For  this reason I voted in favor of a measure that  would have  required a review of star wars  before appropriating more money.  Although  the Defense bills do not include  such a measure, they do limit the amount of  money  the administration can spend on  the  quick-fix version of star wars, phase  I. The  phase I project is intended to deploy part of  star wars before the turn of the century. Since  I  Soviet  technology  advances will  probably  make  it obsolete the day it is deployed,  the  phase I program makes no sense. It is meant  as a showpiece that will convince the taxpay ers to fund the real star wars program. In the  age of record budget deficits, we can hardly  afford multibillion dollar showpieces.  The strict  limits on MX missile  funding  in  this year's Defense bills also serve the arms  control process. As one of the most powerful  and dangerous weapons systems ever devel oped, the MX undermines the sincerity of our  efforts at the START talks. How can we con vince  the Soviets  that we want to eliminate  long range missiles  if we are simultaneously  building our most lethal, most expensive mis sile  ever? Even without  an  arms  control  agreement, restraints on MX should remain a  high priority. The missile's speed, accuracy  and many warheads make it an ideal weapon  for first strikes. By building what looks like a  first-strike weapon, we only frighten the Sovi ets, and a frightened nuclear adversary is the  last thing we want.  The Defense  appropriation  bill  includes  bans on testing weapons of more than 1 kilo ton and on weapons that could destroy satel lites. Both of these measures will help contain  the arms race by slowing development of new  weapons systems.  Unfortunately, the Defense bills do not cut  overall  defense spending much below  the  $300 billion level requested by the administra tion. While we certainly need  to  fund a De fense Department strong enough to fulfill our  obligations abroad and protect our national  security, we do not need to continue offering  the defense industry a blank check for all the  weapons it would like to build. The Pentagon  procurement scandals now emerging demon strate  the  futility of  throwing money at our  problems. This year's Defense bills should fa cilitate arms control. Lets hope next year's en courage budget control.  ",1988
1012,660,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Chairman, as  the Chair man of the House Select Committee on Nar cotics Abuse and Control, I rise in support of  the provisions in H.R. 4781,  the Department  of Defense appropriations bill, 1989, which  relate to drug interdiction.  H.R. 4781 appropriates $410 million for the  Navy  to support Coast Guard activities  for  coastal defense and drug interdiction. Of this  total, the bill provides $350 million for procure ment of equipment including  three E2-C air craft, six helicopters, 1 0 patrol boats, secure  command and control equipment, and air sur veillance equipment. The remaining $60 mil lion  is  to be  transferred by  the Navy to  the  Coast Guard  for maintenance of  this equip ment. This money will enable the Coast Guard  to carry on  its critical drug  interdiction and  coastal defense activities.  Mr. Chairman, in fiscal year 1988, the Coast  Guard was forced to absorb a $103 million cut  in its operating budget, and drug patrols were  cut back 55 percent. Such patrols are respon sible for 90 percent of the Coast Guard's drug  seizures.  The Coast Guard Commandant,  Adm. Paul Yost, testified recently that he has  personnel sitting  in port, because there was  not sufficient money to send them out to sea.  This is a clear waste of valuable, trained man power, and can only have a negative impact  on the morale of the individuals involved and  serious detrimental consequences for the mis sions,  including drug  interdiction,  they would  otherwise perform.  If winning  the war against drugs  is  the  number one domestic concern of American  voters, as public opinion polls say it is,  then  Federal spending patterns should reflect this  concern.  I support the $41 0 million provided  for the Coast Guard in the 1989 Department  of Defense Appropriations Bill. Although  this  amount is not adequate to significantly curtail  the continuous onslaught of drugs which is di rected against America,  it  should at  least  enable  the Coast Guard  to restore  the drug  enforcement activities curtailed by  the 1988  cuts. The House is currently working on omni bus drug  legislation which will be brought to  the floor later this summer. I am hopeful that  at that time we will be able to provide signifi cant enhancements to the Coast Guard's drug  enforcement capabilities.  I am concerned about the continuing pat tern of funding a portion of the Coast Guard's  budget out of the DOD appropriations bill. The  Transportation Appropriations bill the House is  scheduled to take up later this week assumes  the appropriation of the funds included in the  DOD bill. If for some reason the Coast Guard  funding in the DOD bill does not become law,  the amounts included for the Coast Guard in  the DOT bill are totally insufficient to provide  for Coast Guard operations.  In my mind,  this  jerry-built approach  to  Coast Guard funding is no way to fight a war  on drugs. We need to assign a higher budget ary priority to our antidrug efforts and find a  way to ensure  that the Coast Guard will  re ceive directly the funds it needs to do the job  of drug interdiction Congress has assigned to  it.  ",1988
1013,660,11,Mr. BURTON  of  Indiana.," Mr. Chairman,  once again, we  face  the  incomprehensible  myopia of those who want to cut the future off  at the knees.  If Jimmy Carter had proposed SDI,  liberals  would be four-square behind it. SDI is a revo lutionary  concept.  It  is Ronald  Reagan's  legacy.  SDI: ""A shield, not a sword,"" Edward Teller.  Arms control and strategic defense are not  competing objectives. They are  rather,  two  sides of the same coin.  It is a humane, sane alternative to insane,  profane, inane mad.  Not moving forward with SDI would be like  asking  the Orioles  to  take  the  field without  baseball gloves. They'd never win. It would be  like asking the Capitals to play hockey without  a goalie.  We can do it. The technology is there in de veloping. Making great progress. The Soviets  obviously believe it can work. First,  they are  developing  it  themselves; and second,  they  are trying desperately to prevent us from de veloping it.  Offshoot  technology  from SDI  is already  paying dividends and will continue to do so specifically in medicine and technology.

The gentleman does not ultimately  put them down and run them into the  ghettos  that are created by such a  thing. But in fact he creates jobs and  an environment  in which  they can  become the economic force and we all  know that the economic force of the  nation is the force that dictates often  times the politics of a nation.  I  yield  further  to  the gentleman  from Indiana.  ",1988
1015,686,11,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," I  thank  the gentleman  for  yielding  further  and would like to say that I think that  the points  that  the gentleman has  made regarding  these minerals  is so  important. The thing about it that is  interesting is  that they are going to  sell them anyway; the gold, diamonds,  platinum,  rhodium, all  those  things  are needed around the world. It is esti mated 60  to 70 percent of their ex ports will go through anyhow.  So we are really not going to achieve  what we want to by  imposing sanc tions on those people there. The other  thing that is interesting as the gentle man pointed out in the coal industry  5,000 jobs are going to be lost or have  been lost as a result of the price cut ting taking place over there because of  the previous sanctions. BILL BROOM FIELD, of Michigan,  the ranking Re publican on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, estimated that at least 100,000  American  jobs would be  lost  in the  short run, not in the long run, in the  short run  if  this new sanctions bill  passes. So we  are not  talking  just  about what it is going to do to hurt  the blacks and entrench those who are  for apartheid; it is going to hurt Amer icans very severely as well.  Mr. Speaker, I submit a ""Dear Col league"" and a table of selected metals  for the RECORD:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, May 24, 1988.  DEAR COLLEAGUE: On May 18th the Wash ington Post reported on the South African  Black Taxi Association <SABT A), describing  it as ""a major economic force ... its lobby ing potential already has been recognized by  both conservatives and radicals in black pol itics.""  James Ncgoya,  the  president  of  SABT A,  testified before the Subcommittee  on Africa on H.R. 1580, the Dellums-Wolpe  South Africa legislation:  ""I sat in this room yesterday and heard  people say  that  if sanctions make black  people in Africa suffer more, that does not  matter because they are suffering already  and won't mind suffering some more. I even  heard them say that whether more sanetions will help bring down apartheid doesn't  matter,  because  imposing  sanctions puts  America on the right side of history. Does  that mean you really do not care what the  black people of South Africa want? I ask  you to listen to our voices before you decide  what is good for us. Before you decide that  black children must go hungry so you can  be on the right side of history.""  In 13 polls taken over the past four years  by a variety of private research institutes  and newspapers, South African blacks have  opposed  sanctions  and  disinvestment,  mostly by a margin of 3 or 4 to one.

Mr. Speaker, I submit a group of ar ticles for the RECORD:  [From the Washington Post, May 18, 19881  TAXIS GIVE BLACKS A CHANCE AT THE  DRIVER'S SEAT  <By William Claiborne)  JOHANNESBURG.-As dusk settles over the  quickly emptying city and a crush of white  office workers heads in gleaming BMWs and  Mercedes for the M-1 expressway and the  manicured suburbs of northern Johannes burg, another migratory ritual is played out  almost unnoticed in the opposite direction.  Huge crowds of black workers spill off the  sidewalks of Sauer and Bree streets, franti cally pointing fingers in the fading light.  Nothing is said, but the language is under stood: A ""V"" sign means the intended desti nation is Sharpeville or another black town ship in the Vaal River triangle south of Jo hannesburg; fingers circled mean Orlando,  in Soweto.  Long lines of commuters, stretching for a  block or more, slowly shrink as the black  workers crowd 16 or 17 at a time into mini buses, encouraged to move faster by a driver  who can barely make himself heard over the  rock music blaring from his radio.  In an hour, the streets of South Africa's  largest city are practically deserted.  The  metamorphosis  is  accomplished  mostly by the black taxi industry, an in creasingly powerful institution in South Af rican life and one that holds the potential  for political as well as economic muscle for  the country's disenfranchised black majori ty.  In just five years, the membership of the  burgeoning South African Black Taxi Asso ciation <SABTA> has grown from 8,000  to  45,000 licensed jitney-buses, and it has set  its sights on a membership of 100,000, plan",1988
1016,699,11,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, as our distin guished colleagues in the Senate move closer  to passing  legislation  (S. 533), elevating  the  VA to a cabinet level department-the bill has  7 4 cosponsors in the Senate-it is time to re flect on  the negative press  reaction  to  this  popular initiative. In this regard I am placing in  the RECORD a recent editorial by Richard Har wood entitled the VA Question.  Tm: v A QUESTION  It  <By Richard Harwood)  On the 12th day of November, 1987, 69  years after the armistice ending World War  I, The Post, in a manner of speaking, start ed a modest little war of its own. The guns  of its editorial page were unlimbered and  fired off at targets all over town: the presi dent, the Veterans Administration, Congress  and the various veterans' lobbies. The pur pose of this assault, carried out at dawn  when most people were still sloshing their  oatmeal, was to blow holes in a scheme to  grant the Veterans Administration Cabinet  status.  is now  a mere  ""independent""  agency, owned and operated <somewhat like  the Agriculture or Defense departments> by  80 million constituents <veterans and their  dependents> and such patrons as the Ameri can Legion and G. W. ""Sonny"" Montgomery  <D-Miss.>. chairman of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee.  Six days passed with no counterfire from  the politicians. Then, on Nov. 18, the House  responded with a barrage  that shattered  teacups all over the editorial department. It  approved the Cabinet proposal by a vote of  399  to 17. Pow! Take  that, you egghead  scribblers!  The six-day war was over. Before  the  summer is out, the Senate will have passed  the bill, the president will have signed it,  and the next chief of the agency will be ad dressed as ""Mr. <or Ms.) Secretary.""  It is not clear whether the Post editorial ists, perhaps suffering from a white-collar  form of Post Trauma Stress Disorder, recog nized what had happened on Nov. 18, be cause they launched on Nov. 25 a soporific  harassing  operation  against  the  bill.  began with an editorial bearing a half-heart ed headline hinting at broken spirits and a  lack of enthusiasm for the fight: ""Such a  Bad Idea.""  Four months later, the editorial campaign  was  terminated (""quietly,"" as we say) but  not The Post's involvement  in  the  issue.  The news department, initially on the side lines, had by that time joined the fray. It  produced a series of low-key articles devoted  largely  to allegations made by critics of  both the legislation and the VA and to occa sional predictions that the bill was in trou ble.  One of the more amusing stories related  ""fears"" in the Senate that Cabinet status  would ""politicize""  this agency, which hisIt  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  torically has been approximately as nonpo litical as the Democratic and Republican na tional committees. It will spend, under the  direct and constant supervision of the big  veterans' lobbies, $27 billion this year. As a  token of its liberality, it handed out $156  million in overpayments a couple of years  ago, a fact reported with some pride to its  approving partners in Congress.  A counterattack on the news department  was launched on April 10 by the Disabled  American Veterans, a strong proponent of  Cabinet status for the VA. The Blind Veter ans of America, led by John Fales, contrib uted supporting fires. One charge was that  the news and editorial departments were en gaged in a conscious and unethical alliance  to torpedo the legislation. Given the rival ries and frequent intellectual conflicts be tween the two departments, such an alliance  would represent the second great act of de tente in 1988. As Meg Greenfield, the edito rial page editor, remarked to Mikhail Gor bachev during an  interview  last month,  ""Our empire [the Post company] is competi tive within itself ... like all empires.""  The only direct evidence of teamwork on  the VA issue is vaporous, consisting of the  appropriation in one news story of language  obviously borrowed and paraphrased from  an editorial: ""There is no dispute that the  government has a lasting obligation to vet erans wounded in combat and to their fami lies and survivors."" Reporters don't usually  talk or write that way.  Still, there was a clear coincidence of view point in the paper's editorial stance and its  news coverage. It is explained by the princi pal reporter involved, Bill McAllister, as a  simple case of the V A's critics making the  most noise. That is one of those all-purpose,  self-protective  statements  journalists  use  when accused of bias. Taken at face value, it  converts mindlessness into a virtue. Was the  news coverage tilted against the VA plan?  Yes.  Now that the war is over, there is another  question I ask with great trepidation: Who's  running this town anyWay, the press or the  politicians?  15475  tachments and diseases of the retina. He now  practices in Warren, OH, is on the staff of St.  Joseph Riverside Hospital and Trumbull Me morial Hospital, and formerly served as chief  of ophthalmology at both hospitals.  Dr. Shapiro  lives  in Girard, OH, with his  lovely wife Anita Tamarkin,  and  his  three  doting children-Andrea, Sam, and Tom. He is  a past president of the Warren Lions Club, is  a former district trustee for the Ohio Lions Eye  Research Foundation, and  is a member of  both the Cleveland Eye Bank's Medical Policy  Committee and St. Joseph Riverside Hospi tal's Board of Directors. He  is president of  Rodef Sholom Temple, chairman of the Com bined  Jewish Appeal,  and  serves on  the  Youngstown Area Jewish Federation Execu tive Board.  Dr. Shapiro is a man of firsts when it comes  to surgical achievements in Warren. He per formed  the  first  intraocular lens  implant,  the  first phacoemulsification, the first silicone fold able  intraocular lens,  the  first corneal  trans plant, the first radial keratotomy, and the first  televised surgery. He also accomplished  the  amazing  feat of the  first combined cataract,  intraocular  lens  implant, and corneal  trans plant surgery.  Dr. Shapiro is truly a wizard when it comes  to medical surgery, and  through his miracles  he has  improved  the eyesight of countless  people in Mahoning and Trumbull Counties.  I  am proud  to call Dr. Shapiro my friend, and  hope that his successful services to humanity  continue  for a  long  time.

Mar. 25, 19871  THE COMING OIL CRISIS  With domestic oil production falling and  imports rising, this country is looking at a  future threat to its national security and  economic well-being.

1019,712,11,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, my friend, JOHN  DUNCAN, announced May 27 that he will not  seek a 13th term in the House because of ill  health. Shortly after this unhappy announce ment, his son, Knox County Criminal Court  Judge ""Jimmy"" Duncan, Jr., filed his candida cy papers for the Republican Party nomination  for the U.S. Congress to succeed his father as  Tennessee's Second Congressional District  Representative in Congress. As an old friend  of JOHN, his lovely wife, Lois, and their won derful family, I wish to express a few thoughts  on these unexpected events.  The first is that JOHN DUNCAN  is my close,  personal friend, and he is a fighter. He contin ues to  fight  to  regain his health so he can  return to Washington to be with us for the re mainder of his term, and I hope his colleagues  here in the House will remember him in their  thoughts and prayers.  It has been my privilege  to know  JOHN  DUNCAN  for many, many years, and we have  served  together here  in  the House  for 24  years representing adjoining districts  in east  Tennessee. His  record  of accomplishment  and service  to his constituents  is  legendary  throughout the Second Congressional District.  No constituent's problem was ever too small  or unimportant  for him  to  take up and  turn  around  for  the benefit of  the person who  asked him  for help. Most of his colleagues  here associate him with his diligent and effec tive work over a great many years as a  member of  the House Committee on Ways  and Means, where he has served as ranking  Republican Member since 1985. Over  the  years, I have gone to JOHN for advice and as sistance and he has never  failed  to come  through with sound advice and effective as sistance. This is so because of his sound and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  steady  judgment, abundant common sense,  and practicality as well as his great heart and  willingness to help.  So, with his retirement announcement after  24 years of outstanding service in the House,  he has left big shoes to fill. For my money, or  you might say, my 2 cents' worth, there is only  one  person  big  enough  to  fill  those  big  shoes-his sori, John ""Jimmy"" Duncan, Jr.  I have absolutely the highest regard and af fection  for  Jimmy Duncan, whom  I have  known since he was a boy. His father is justifi ably proud of him and the trail he has blazed  in  life. After a solid academic and practical  training in law, Jimmy Duncan has served as a  Knox County Criminal Court  Judge  since  1981. He has built a fine reputation  for firm ness, fairness, and compassion on the bench  in  administering  justice  to  those  brought  before his court. He  is a strong Republican  Party man who knows the Second Congres sional District and its people as few do, and  he  is an energetic and effective worker who  will represent them well in the Congress.  JOHN DuNCAN's shoes are truly big ones to  fill, but I am convinced Jimmy Duncan is the  man who can do so. Because of this,  I am  proud to support him with great enthusiasm in  his campaign  for election  to  the 1 01 st Con gress.  At  the same  time,  I salute Tennessee's  Second  District Congressman, my  friend,  JOHN DUNCAN, and wish him well  in his fight  against cancer.  I know our colleagues in the  House join me in saying to JOHN that we are  thinking of you and you are in our prayers. We  miss you, and we hope to see you back on  the House floor soon. We need your leader ship.  And  to Jimmy Duncan, my best wishes as  you begin to take up the challenges of cam paigning  for a seat  in  the Congress where  your  father serves with great distinction and  the respect and affection of those who know  him.  IN PROTEST OF THE EXTRADI TION OF JOSEPH PATRICK DO HERTY  HON.GEORGEJ.HOCHBRUECKNER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 21, 1988  ",1988
1020,712,11,Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to protest  the decision of Attorney General  Edwin Meese  to extradite political prisoner  Joseph Patrick Doherty  to  the United King dom. Mr. Doherty, who was convicted in 1981  of killing a British Army captain in Belfast, es caped from a Northern Ireland prison and fled  to the United States. The British Government  immediately  initiated extradition proceedings  following his June 18, 1983, arrest  in  the  United States.  In 1984, the United States District Court for  the Southern District of New York after a full  hearing denied the British request to extradite  Mr. Doherty  to Northern  Ireland. The court  found that his offenses were political not civil.  In 1986, after  judicial  review,  an order  to  deport Mr. Doherty to the Republic of Ireland  was issued. This decision by the Board of lmJune 21, 1988  migration Appeals was to end 4 years of litiga tion during which Mr. Doherty remained incar cerated  in  the United States without being  charged of a crime in this country.  Archbishop Cardinal John O'Connor of the  Archdiocese  of New  York,  Bishop  John  McGann of the Diocese of Rockville Centre,  as well as several  Irish-American organiza tions have protested  this situation. Members  of  the ad hoc congressional Committee  for  Irish Affairs, of which I am a member, sent a  telegram to Attorney General Meese on July  14, 1987, urging him to uphold the decisions  of both  Immigration Judge Howard  I. Cohen  and  the Board of Immigration Appeals which  called  for  the deportation of Mr. Doherty  to  the Republic of Ireland.  On June 14, 1988, shortly before the fifth  anniversary of Mr. Doherty's incarceration  in  the United States, Attorney General Meese  overruled  the decisions of  these courts and  ordered the extradition of Mr. Doherty to the  United Kingdom. On June 16, I joined with a  bipartisan group of 14 members of the Com mittee for Irish Affairs in  issuing a statement  strongly criticizing Attorney General Meese's  decision. We declared, 'The Attorney Gener al's decision did not address issues of law instead it was purely a political decision aimed  at not jeopardizing relations with Great Britain  over the problems  in Nortthern Ireland."" We  concluded  that Attorney General Meese ""ig nored the rulings of Federal judges which es tablished  that his crimes were political and  which would bar extradition."" Joe Doherty has  become,  thanks  to Mr. Meese, a  ""political  sacrificial lamb with no regard to any rights he  might have under the law.""  Mr. Speaker, I strongly protest the decision  of Attorney General Meese  to extradite Mr.  Doherty to Great Britain and I urge him to re consider this decision. The extradition of Mr.  Doherty absolutely disregards  the  rulings of  two U.S. courts and it forces our legal system  to become entangled in diplomatic concerns.  According to the U.S. Constitution, the execu tive and judicial branches of our Government  are designed to operate separately and fairly.  By protesting the Attorney General's decision,  this separation can be upheld, and fair treat ment can  be ensured  for every  individual  under the law of the United States.

WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND  RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT  ",1988
1024,738,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  clerk will report the bill.  The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  A bill <S. 2527> to require advance notifica tion of plant closings and mass layoffs, and  for other purposes.  to consider  The Senate proceeded  the bill.  ",1988
1025,738,11,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, this meas ure, which was  introduced by Mr.  METZENBAUM  for himself and other  Senators, deals with an issue that will  not go away-the issue of plant clos ing. I congratulate the Senator for his  introduction of the legislation. It is an  issue that will not go away because the  principle of advance notice strikes a  chord among the American people as  being just plain good common sense,  fair play, and a better way of doing  business.  There has been a great deal of dis cussion over this very modest propos al. I do not understand why the oppo nents of advance notice are adamant  in their opposition to the concept of  advance notice. It makes a whole lot of  sense to me. It makes sense because it  breaks new ground  in management labor relations.  Management and labor in America  have always had an adversarial rela tionship.  Mr. President, this adversarial rela tionship does not help America com pete  in  the world. Once we  could  afford  to elbow each other without  worrying about our foreign competi tion. America dominated the markets  of the free world  in the post-World  War II era. But that time is passed.  America is being out hustled and out  traded by our foreign competition.  Our  foreign  competition  is  going  head to head against us and in a great  many cases they have gotten ahead.  The administration  is  all aglow be cause April's trade figures are down a  wee bit. The Treasury is happy that  we were only mired in $9.9 billion of  red ink for that month-just $9.9 bil lion.  But in  the afterglow of  the April  trade figures,  let us remember  that  when a man is drowning it does not  make any difference whether it is 9  feet of water or whether it is 12 feet of  water in which he is drowning. He is  still drowning. That is America's prob lem when it comes to the trade defi cits. Whether we are $10 billion down  or whether we are $12 billion down,  neither is good for West Virginia and  neither is good for  the country. We  are drowning either way.  By  the end of  last year, we were  about $420 billion or more in debt to  the rest of the world. We are in hock  to the rest of the world. Other govern ments,  foreign  investors, are buying  our notes and bonds, they are buying  our financial paper, and they are col lecting  the  interest, while we  go  deeper and deeper in debt.  Mr. President, America must change  the way  it has been doing business.  One of the fundamental changes must  be  the way management and  labor  confront each other at the negotiating  table. Management and  labor must  forge a new relationship if America is  to compete against our foreign compe tition.  The trade bill passed by this Con gress recognizes that America has en tered a new economic era. Congress  crafted a bill, supported by Democrats  and Republicans in a strong bipartisan  show  of  consensus,  to  help  every  sector of our economy: To smooth out,  streamline,  and  shorten  the  turn around  time  it  takes  for American  business and labor to adjust to new  competition. Central to this new ap proach  is  the  concept  of  advance  notice. Advance notice was put into  the trade bill because it makes good  sense. No matter how hard manage ment and its work force try, some busi ness activity simply becomes uneco nomical. To save the rest of the com pany  the decision  to shut down  a  plant,  although  painful, must  be  made.  But when that situation is about to  occur, every sector of the community management, labor, local government,  and other  local businesses-must be  given time to adjust to an unwanted  and  traumatic business situation be cause not only are the employees hurt;  the communities in which shutdowns  occur are also hurt. It is traumatic for  everyone. This is what a ""good neigh bor"" does.  Advance notice gives workers time to  save some money for  the lean days  ahead. Advance notice gives local gov ernment time to prepare for new bur dens on its retraining and education  programs. And advance notice gives  other local businesses a heads up that  their customers will not be spending  what they have spent in the past.  America is in economic trouble with  our foreign competition because our  Nation's trading policy has not been  managed well. Business  and  labor  must learn to work together. Advance  notice will help  to achieve  that. It  makes good,  common sense,  and  it  meets the American standard of fair ness and decency. It is just plain right.  That is why I find it difficult to un derstand the strong opposition to this  worthy idea. It only affect 2 percent of  the businesses in this country, and it  only affects businesses  that employ  100 or more employees. And  if  the  sudden circumstances that necessitate  shutting down of a business are not  foreseeable by the company, then the  company is exempt from the require ment to give notice under this legisla tion. So what is so bad about it?  I hope that in the days ahead the  opponents of plant closing will  take  another look at this legislation and see  that it is in the best interest of Ameri can workers,  in the best interest of  American business, in the best interest  of American communities, in the best  interest of a strong America competi tiveness position.  It allows the communities and the  workers and management, as well, the  advance notice, the opportunity to put  into place retraining programs, while  there is still time, while the workers  are still getting a paycheck.  Mr. President, several of us are run ning for  reelection  this year. When  the general election is over in Novem ber, on that election night, we will go  to the television sets and we will see  how we came out.  ",1988
1026,764,11,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  I  send a  technical amendment  to  the  desk and ask for its immediate consid eration.  ",1988
1027,764,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  clerk will report.  The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  The Senator from Arizona <Mr. DECON for himself and Mr. DOMENICI pro poses an amendment numbered 2416.  CINI)  ,1988

1030,764,11,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, my  amendment would make two technical  changes in the bill as reported.  First, it would delete the line type  through  the heading ""Unanticipated  Needs"" on page 25 of the bill, leaving  it in roman type. This was inadvert ently line typed by the Government  Printing Office.  Second,  the  amendment  would  transfer section 627 of the bill to title  V of the bill. This section contains the  language mandating  that  any  pay  raise provided in this bill shall be ab sorbed from within the appropriations  provided for the agencies covered by  this bill. Since  the language applies  only to the agencies covered by this  bill, it should be in title V, not title VI.  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of  the amendment.  ",1988

1037,764,11,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of H.R. 4775, the fiscal  was  I  year 1989 Treasury, Postal Service,  and General Government Appropria tion Act, as reported by the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and I urge  its adoption.  I would like to commend my good  friend from Arizona, the chairman of  the Treasury Appropriations Subcom mittee,  for his  leadership and hard  work to produce the bill that is before  us today. It is a bill which balances the  ongoing needs of  the basic Federal  programs and activities it covers with  the need to provide enhanced funding  in some important areas.  The bill, as reported by the commit tee, provides a total of $15.9 billion in  new budget authority for fiscal year  1989 for activities of the U.S. Treasury  Department, the U.S. Postal Service,  the Executive Office of the President,  and a number of important independ ent agencies,  including  the General  Services  Administration  and  the  Office  of  Personnel Management.  Fiscal year 1989 outlays based on the  total new budget  authority  recom mended in the bill, together with prior  year funding actions, are estimated to  total $15.8 billion. Of the total funding  provided  for  appropriated programs  under the fiscal year 1989 budget reso lution, the Appropriations Committee  allocated $15.61 billion in budget au thority and $15.54 billion in outlays to  the Treasury Subcommittee,  to  be  augmented by an additional $0.4 bil lion in budget authority and outlays in  order to provide the fiscal year 1988  funding level for IRS enforcement ini tiatives required to meet the IRS com pliance  target of  last year's budget  summit agreement. The total level of  budget  authority  recommended  by  this bill is under the subcommittee's  302<b> budget authority allocation and  consistent with the outlay allocation,  when rounded.  The total $15.9 billion recommended  for  fiscal year 1989  is $246 million  below the level of the President's re quest and $196 million below the total  funding  level  recommended  in  the  House-passed bill.  The bill recommends a number of  funding  enhancements  above  the  levels  requested  by  the  President.  These include an additional $22 mil lion to enlarge the physical capacity of  the Federal law enforcement training  center  to  handle  the  tremendous  growth in the demand for Federal law  enforcement  training;  an  additional  $80 million to provide an additional  700 full-time equivalent positions for  commercial operations activities of the  U.S. Customs Service; and an addition al $21 million for the Bureau of Alco hol, Tobacco and Firearms to provide  sufficient personnel  for  the  armed  career criminal apprehension program.  I think it is important to emphasize  that the funding recommended in this  bill  for drug  enforcement  activities  under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee exceeds the level of funding re quested by the President. We have rec ommended  the  level of  funding  re quested by the President for the Cus toms Service Air Interdiction Program.  We have provided funds to annualize  the cost of Customs enforcement ef forts  to prevent the illegal entry of  drugs into the United States. We have  recommended additional funding  for  the training of drug law enforcement  officers. In addition, as  I  just men tioned, we have increased funding for  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms to provide additional person nel for the Armed Career Criminal Ap prehension Program; over 80 percent  of  the criminals apprehended under  this program have direct involvement  in illegal narcotics trafficking.  The committee's funding recommen dations for the General Services Ad ministration include second year fund ing of $75.8 million  to continue  a  major effort to repair, alter, construct,  and  renovate  border  stations  and  other facilities at ports of entry from  California to Texas. This is an impor tant initiative. Funding of $28.7 mil lion was provided in fiscal year 1988,  together with up to an additional $12  million in unexpended Federal build ings  fund  revenues,  for  the  initial  phase of this multiyear program to im prove  facilities  along  the  United  States-Mexico  border. The General  Services Administration, together with  the other Federal agencies with border  responsibilities and the trade commu nity, have been working aggressively  to establish appropriate funding prior ities. Continued funding is essential to  bring many of the substandard facili ties into acceptable working condition  and to expand others to accommodate  the increased flow of traffic and cargo.  The committee has also recommend ed an appropriation of $436 million for  the revenue forgone payment to the  Postal Service  for  fiscal year 1989.  This payment reimburses the Postal  Service  for  the  revenues  lost  as  a  result of providing mail service to cer tain categories of mail at free or re duced rates. The appropriation recom mended  is  the amount  required  to  maintain the current levels of subsidy  for authorized preferred mailers. The  President proposed that only $19 mil lion be provided for fiscal year 1989,  predicated on the passage of legisla tion which would repeal subsidies for  certain mail categories, shift subsidy  costs  to other mailers, and continue  Federal funding only to provide free  postage  for  the blind and overseas  voter mail. These proposed legislative  changes have not been enacted. The  committee has therefore recommend ed an appropriation consistent with  current law.  Aside from the funding recommend ed for the revenue forgone payment to  the Postal Service,  the other major  ",1988

I  have  an  amendment  that I am prepared to offer that would  commit the funds as I indicated to the  payment of the 4-percent pay increase  that is due to the Treasury-Post Office  people under this bill. In order to do  that, it is necessary, in my judgment,  to delete section C and to commit the  moneys to-and I would read the pro posal I have. It has been drafted for  me. ""All savings to the Department,  agency,  or  instrumentality  which  result from the application of subsec tion <a> shall be""-and that is both 1  and 2-""used  for  the 4-percent  in crease in rates of pay in such Depart ment,  agency,  or  instrumentality""  made under whatever provision  the  pay raise comes under in this bill. Will  the Senator indicate if he has a judg ment as to the impact of that amend ment?  ",1988
1043,777,11,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, may  I ask the Senator, before he answers,  to let the Senator from New Mexico  give him an observation regarding this  bill and the 2 percent that we are talk ing about?  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.  ",1988

1049,777,11,Mr. DOMENICI., I ask the Senator  from Alaska if I could share an obser vation with the Senate before the Sen ator answers the question.  ,1988
1050,777,11,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I am  delighted to withdraw my question for  the time being.  ",1988
1051,777,11,Mr. DOMENICI.,"  I would  like  to  point out what we have done in this  bill with reference to pay that I be lieve makes the Stevens amendment a  very good amendment, very realistic so  that the Senator can be assured that  the savings which accrue will be ap plied properly and in a manner that I  believe  the Senator would be quite  confident and pleased with.  What happened  in  the appropria tions process and the budgeting proc ess with reference to civilian pay is as  follows.  The  President  sent  us  a  budget that assumed 2 percent pay for  civilian employees and 4.3 for military.  The bill before us has an amendment  adopted by  the  full Appropriations  Committee which we will be adopting  tonight or tomorrow when we adopt  this bill that says everyone, civilian,  and military,  gets  a  4-percent pay  raise. We have not provided for the ad ditional 2 percent over the 2 percent  that was  in  the President's budget.  That 2 percent was  in each depart ment's budget, and they assumed that  they could cover it. We have not pro vided the additional 2 percent for the  various agencies of the Federal Gov ernment, and they are either going to  have to RIF people through attrition,  lay off people, or they are actually  going to have to restrain some activi ties that they might have discretion to  move around and postpone. Frankly, I  believe that they are going to have a  great deal of difficulty with that in  some of  the departments funded  in  this bill.  I urge that the Senator give serious  consideration, even if you want to say  ""to the extent necessary"" or whatever  qualifying language, to agreeing that  if  savings  accrue  because  of  this  amendment we be permitted to generi cally say they can be applied for the 2  percent that was not provided for in  the pay raise for the various depart ments, many in number and very im portant, from  the Secret Service  to  the Customs Service, OPM, and all  kinds of other things in this bill.  I  thank  both  the Senator  from  Alaska and the Senator from Arkansas  for yielding.  ",1988
1052,777,11,Mr. STEVENS.," Now, Mr. President,  I renew my question but I would indi cate my amendment says for the full 4  percent because I believe beyond the 4  percent the effect of this amendment  is going to require additional people  in-house and they will  require addi tional money, so I emphasize that my  amendment would direct all savings to  be used for the 4-percent pay increase  which in effect says they do not have  to totally absorb them in other areas.  ",1988
1053,777,11,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, if I may  respond to my friend's question, in the  General  Accounting  Office  report  given me yesterday, it appears to me  that the Treasury Department may be  spending as much as $37 million a year  for consultants. I am taking 15 and 5  percent out of consultant categories.  Really, in this particular amendment  we are not talking about a very large  sum of money. We are only really talk ing about a $5 million, maybe a $6 mil lion saving. That is not going to go  very far in helping to pay a salary in crease Governmentwide.  What I am concerned about is that  this amendment, even  though  it  is  small in dollars, is going to establish  the precedent by which the Senator  from Arkansas will offer on 9 or 10  other  appropriation  bills  similar  amendments.  For example,  if  the distinguished  Senator from Alaska says  that any  savings we obtain because of the Pryor  amendment are going to pay the cost  of increased pay for the civil service or  Federal  employees,  then  the  next  amendment  is going  to be perhaps  from my friend from Arizona, who has  been very active in the area of drug  interdiction. He might want an amend ment which says, ""Let's take this sev eral million dollars and beef up our  drug  enforcement  program.""  And  when we get to the education budget  next week or next month, somebody is  going to say that we have to revamp  this program or that program, we have  to do more on Pell grants, or what ever.  I would like to do this clean. I would  like  to send the money back to the  Treasury. Then in the wisdom of the  Appropriations Committee before we  adjourn October 8 or whenever  it  might be, Mr. President-and I  say  this very respectfully; I am not on the  committee, but  then  the Appropria tions Committee might  tally  it up:  ""Well, look, we have saved $700 mil lion or $800 million or $3 billion or $4  billion on  these  consultant  amend ments, and we have a  little savings  there for a supplemental appropria tion."" That would be my  respectful  suggestion.  I hope we do not start  whittling away. I do not want to be an  obstructionist, but I do not think this  is a wise course.  Mr. DeCONCINI. Will the Senator  yield?  ",1988
1054,777,11,Mr. PRYOR., I will be glad to yield.  ,1988
1055,777,11,Mr. DECONCINI.,"  It is my under standing the suggested amendment of  the  Senator  from Alaska  to  the  amendment of the Senator from Ar kansas would apply only to this bill, so  we are not talking about it applying  Governmentwide. We are only talking  about applying it to this bill.  ",1988

We  passed a bill in 1986. We added Cus toms agents. We added DEA agents,  and  border patrol  agents. We  are  likely  to pass another bill this year  adding additional  resources. This  to  me would be an exception.

1058,790,11,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, today,  Senator LEviN and I are introducing  the Emergency Agricultural Relief Act  of 1988. Companion  legislation has  been introduced in the House of Rep resentatives by our colleague, Con gressman TRAXLER.  This  legislation will  reinstate  an  emergency agricultural assistance pro gram that was enacted in 1986 to re spond to drought and flood disasters  that  affected  large  parts  of  the  Nation.  In 1986,  the emergency bill  that Senator LEviN, Senator MATTING and I sponsored, and which ulti m~tely became law, provided $400 mil lion in payments to producers of pro gram and nonprogram crops. In the  case of thousands of farmers, this as sistance, which was prorated by the  Department of Agriculture, meant lit erally the difference between survival  and bankruptcy.  The bill is limited in the amount of  assistance that it provides for produc ers. It would impose a 50-percent loss  requirement before any disaster assist ance would be available. Thus,  the  producer is bearing the full cost of the  first 50 percent of loss. There is a pay ment limitation of $100,000 per pro ducer, so total exposure of the Gov ernment is kept to an absolute mini mum, but yet there is sufficient flexi bility to respond fully to the magni tude of the emergency.  There is no limitation on the author ity  to  draw  from  the Commodity  Credit Corporation. This will avoid a  prorating situation which developed in  1986, and has forced us to enact addi tional legislation just to meet the de mands of that program.  This  legislation  provides  nothing  until disaster designations are made.  We believe strongly that the Secretary  of Agriculture needs some structure or  framework to respond to the drought  emergency. This structure should be  in place and ready. There is no such  structure today, and with the legisla tive session ending  in  less  than 50  days,  it is  imperative that Congress  put  something  in Secretary Lyng's  hands now.  We have crafted this bill to closely  approximate  the 1986 program, be cause that program worked. It is fa miliar to farmers, it is familiar to the  persons who will have to administer  the program, and it is effective. We  must,  in responding  to  the drought  emergency, help all farmers, of every  type of commodity. Currently, pro grams seem to be aimed only at the  major commodities such as com or  wheat. These are very  important in  many States as well as Michigan. We  in Michigan, however, are fortunate to  have a diverse agricultural base with  major products ranging from cherries  and  apples  to  asparagus,  potatoes,  sugar beets, beans and many others.  There  is currently no existing au thority within the Department of Ag riculture to provide direct assistance  to producers of nonprogram crops.  These are products such as dry edible  beans, sugar beets,  fresh vegetables,  and fruit crops such as cherries and  apples,  and  the producers of  these  commodities are just as important to  the national agricultural economy as  all other commodity producers.  Mr. President, this program makes  good economic sense. It is clear that if  we do nothing, if we permit thousands  of farms to fail because of this massive  natural disaster,  the effects on  this  Nation  cannot  be  calculated. The  amount that we, as a nation, would  have to expend to respond to these  failures, amounts in the form of wel fare payments, and other forms of as sistance would in all likelihood be far  greater than what might be necessary  under these provisions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of this legislation be  printed at the conclusion of my state ment. I hope that all of my colleagues  will read carefully its provisions and  join us in enacting this quickly. It is  one method of disaster relief that has  worked in the past, and which can be  handed to the Secretary immediately  so that if the emergency approaches  the proportions that have been fore cast, we can respond in a meaningful  fashion to the hundreds of thousands  of farmers who are in the midst of a  terrible crisis.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2555  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress Assembled,  SECTION 1. <A> Disaster assistance to meet  needs  resulting  from drought  and  such  other  natural  disasters  throughout  the  ",1988
1059,816,11,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Tennessee  [Mr.  QuiLLEN] for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the rule on H.R. 4800, the HUD-Inde pendent Agencies Appropriations Act  and I strongly support the effort of  the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr.  SYNAR] and the gentleman from Penn sylvania  [Mr. CLINGER]  to offer an  amendment  to  eliminate  indemnity  payments  for  the manufacturers of  banned and suspended pesticides.  I also join with the gentleman from  Tennessee  [Mr. QuiLLEN]  in  lauding  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  [Mr. BoLAND] who is serving out his  final days in the 100th Congress and  in his service in the Congress. He is an  outstanding Member and he certainly  deserves to be honored for his contri butions to the House of Representa tives and I am proud to call him a  friend. The fact that I oppose this rule  does not carry with it any indication  at all of my support for his efforts on  this particular appropriations bill.  I  think this is an important bill and I  know that he and the gentleman from  New York [Mr. GREEN] have done an  excellent  job. But, Mr. Speaker, the  Subcommittee  on  Environment,  Energy, and Natural Resources of the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations, on which I serve as the ranking  minority member, has held hearings.  The Subcommittee on Environment,  Energy,  and Natural Resources  is  chaired by the gentleman from Okla homa [Mr. SYNAR] who is one of the  cosponsors of  this amendment with  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. CLINGER] who is the ranking Re publican on that subcommittee. Their  hearings were held in 1983 and last  fall  that subcommittee held further  hearings and recommended to the full  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations, which the committee adopted,  the report entitled ""Soaring Subsidies  for Banned Pesticides Stymie Safety  Reviews.""  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Synar-Clinger  amendment would implement two crit ical  recommendations made by  the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations in that report which was ap proved last year. It is clear to me that  year after year of oversight hearings  and  investigations  are meaningless  unless actions are taken to eliminate  the  problems  identified  over  the  course of those hearings.  The  Synar-Clinger  amendment  would do just that while at the same  time saving taxpayers potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Only by  defeating this rule on this bill can the  House have an opportunity to vote on  the Synar-Clinger amendment which  will eliminate a  taxpayer subsidy en joyed  by  pesticide manufacturers,  something that has been granted to no  other segment of American business.  Mr. Speaker, taxpayers do not foot  the bill when Detroit finds  it neces sary to initiate a recall of unsafe auto mobiles. The Government does not  pay drug manufacturers millions of  dollars  to pull dangerous or  tainted  drugs  off  store  shelves.  There  is  simply no  reason  to  pay  pesticide  firms to not only remove unsafe pesti cides from the market but to then also  pay these firms vast sums of money to  store and dispose of those materials.  By defeating the rule, the House will  be afforded an opportunity to vote on  an amendment that has a broad base  of support, as broad as almost any I  have ever seen. The repeal of indemni fication payments is supported by the  administration, every major environ mental  organization,  the National  Taxpayers Union, and national news papers. It is being offered in a biparti san fashion by two Members of Con gress with primary oversight responsi bility for the pesticide program.  Mr. Speaker,  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania has just provided me a  copy of a letter dated June 22, 1988,  from the Administrator of the Envi ronmental Protection Agency, Lee M.  Thomas, in which he says:  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, .  Washington, DC, June 22, 1988.  Hon. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, Jr.,  Environment,  Energy,  and Natural Re sources Subcommittee,  Committee  on  Government Operations, Washington,  DC.  DEAR MR. CLINGER: This is in response to  your request for the Agency's position on in demnification,  storage and disposal with  regard  to suspended and cancelled pesti cides. Our position has been and continues  to be that indemnification must be abol ished. As for storage and disposal, we think  the  registrants should be  responsible  for  performing these functions under EPA reg ulation and oversight. We also  think the  Agency should be able to issue enforceable  regulations governing recall of pesticides.  Sincerely,  LEE M. THOMAS,  Administrator.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote in opposition to this rule and to  voice  their  support  for  the Synar Clinger amendment to eliminate this  unfair and unjustified special interest  subsidy.

1060,816,11,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman from New York yield?  ",1988
1061,816,11,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I am  happy to yield to the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. DE LA GARZA],  the chair man of the Committee on Agriculture  and a good friend.  ",1988
1062,816,11,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from New York  [Mr. HoRTON] for yielding, and I want  is  to correct some misinformation that is  being used and bandied about in this  situation. Granted, there is a problem  but this is not a payment to manufac turers only. The perception of  the  public  is simply  that we are giving  some big chemical companies money  as a windfall, but the indemnification  may be made to the smallest farmer  back through the chain to retail sup pliers  and  to  the manufacturer whomever  is holding  the suspended  pesticide. So it is not only indemnifica tion of the manufacturers, it is indem nification to ensure the safe recovery,  storage, and effective disposal of the  chemicals.  Also let me say, if the gentleman will  continue to yield, that much is being  made about food and drugs and why  those items, if recalled, are not eligible  for  indemnification. Mr.  Speaker,  whenever a bottle of aspirin  re called, it may simply be taken back to  the drugstore or thrown away.  Mr. Speaker,  I want  to give  the  House accurate information and some  comparisons.  If one  is  told  that a  bottle of aspirin is no good, it is taken  back to the drugstore, or it is dumped  down the toilet bowl. This is how one  disposes of it. There is no indemnifica tion because one may simply  throw  the  item away without  threatening  human health or the environment.  ",1988
1063,816,11,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, reclaim ing my time, will the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. DE LA GARZA] answer this  question? Do we do this in any other  program that we have in the Federal  Government, do we indemnify anyone  as we do with these chemical compa nies? Do we do this for the automobile  manufacturers,  for  example,  on  a  recall that is ordered?  ",1988
1064,816,11,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," If the gentleman  will continue to yield, not for the auto mobile manufacturers.  ",1988
1065,816,11,Mr. HORTON.," Or for the drug man ufacturers? They have to eat that loss,  do they not?  ",1988
1066,816,11,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Not necessarily,  because we have passed legislation to  indemnify other industries, such as for  nuclear accidents, and so on, for ex penses beyond the ability of a private  utility to pay. We have enacted that  kind of legislation.  We also have the Superfund to deal  with chemicals and spills and chemical  dumps. A small farmer could have 8 or  10 barrels of one of the chemicals that  has been banned. He cannot dump it  down the toilet bowl like one can do  with a bottle of aspirin. That would be  irresponsible.  ",1988
1067,816,11,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, reclaim ing my time,  I know  the gentleman  from Texas [Mr. DE LA GARZA]  is con cerned about the small farmer, as all  of us are. However, our Subcommittee  on Environment, Energy, and Natural  Resources held hearings over the last  ",1988
1068,829,11,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  5 minutes to the distinguished gentle man from New Jersey [Mr. RoE], the  persuasive and knowledgeable chair man of the Science, Space, and Tech nology Committee.  ",1988
1069,829,11,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Chairman, I think our  distinguished chairman of our Sub committee on the HUD and independ ent  agencies  appropriation  bill  for  yielding me the time. May I  take this  opportunity  to extend both  to  the  Members who are here and those lis tening my highest regard to the gen tleman  from Massachusetts,  EDDIE  BOLAND, our chairman, who has done  such a remarkable job over the years.  I want to do something different.  have  asked  unanimous  consent  to  extend my remarks because I am going  to put my formal statement into the  RECORD, which tracks pretty well what  the distinguished gentleman from New  Mexico, Mr. LUJAN, stated on behalf of  I  I  I  the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.  Before I  talk further about the gen tleman  from Massachusetts,  EDDIE  BOLAND,  I want to give my high re gards  to  the gentleman  from New  York, BILL GREEN. This has been a  wonderful team here in the Congress  that has gotten the job done in a very  important area, perhaps one of  the  most important areas that we are deal ing in. There was a vote on the rule  and  there were brothers and sisters  who disagreed. That is understandable  and happens  in  this House and  it  should. But when we talk about this  subcommittee and we  talk about the  Appropriations Committee and we talk  about the future of America, we are  not only  talking about housing and  the homeless, that is all part of Amer ica, and  think EDDIE BOLAND has  been a champion and a leader in that  particular  field,  as  has been BILL  GREEN, but I thought I ought to report  to the House and report to the distin guished  Appropriations  Committee  that this particular month, or at the  latest next month, the Soviets will be  launching  their Mars mission. They  will be starting their Mars mission. I  think it would be interesting for the  Members of the House to realize that  the Soviets will also be launching their  space shuttle.  We are moving the Discovery launch  vehicle out on the pad now, and we  plan on launching that particular re entry into space, if you like, on August  29, if the program works out. When we  come back and we  talk about EDDIE  BOLAND and we talk about BILL GREEN,  this is the bottom line in the process.  It is all well and good for us to do the  authorization, for us to do the shaping  of the direction that we should go in  the authorizing committees, but the  final  line comes down  to where the  money  is and where  the appropria tions are made, because that truly di rects the country, and that directs the  program and the scheduling that will  go ahead. And EDDIE, when you look  back on your career, and I believe your  career is only beginning, you are going  to be saying and we are going to be  saying that on the bottom line because  of EDDIE BOLAND and because of BILL  GREEN and the leadership of this sub committee there  is -a space program  moving ahead, and it is not just an other figment of something America is  doing, it is the future of all mankind  that is being accomplished by your ef forts and the efforts of BILL GREEN  and the Members respectively of both  the majority and the minority.  When we speak about housing, and  that debate  is yet to ensue, we are  going to come back and we are going  to say that this committee can take  peer  to  no  one,  owes  nothing  to  anyone. They have  led  the fight  in  this country for the housing program  ",1988
1070,842,11,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Chairman,  I,  too, want to  briefly comment on  the  intent of an amend ment I offered to the fiscal year 1988 HUD-in dependent agency appropriations bill which  prohibited the use of Federal funds for demoli tion  activities at  the west Dallas housing  projects in my district in Dallas, TX, and the  Allen Parkway Village project in Congressman  LELAND's district in Houston.  This amendment was adopted by the House  as part of the fiscal year 1988 HUD-independ ent agency appropriation bill and was later en acted into law as part of fiscal year 1988 con tinuing appropriation legislation.  As the author of the amendment, I want to  make very clear  that  the  intention of  the  amendment was  to prohibit  the use of any  Federal resources for demolition activities, ad ministrative or otherwise, at the west Dallas  projects or at Allen Parkway Village. Any Fed eral activity to seek or promote the demolition  process would be  in violation of the amend ment.  ",1988
1071,842,11,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support  for H.R. 4800, which appropriates  $59.7 billion for fiscal year 1989 for the De partment of Housing and Urban Development  and  16  related agencies.  Included  in  this  measure is funding for many programs of spe cial importance to my home State of West Vir ginia and I would like to take this opportunity  to highlight a few of these.  The legislation before us today appropriates  $9.9 billion for housing programs in fiscal year  1989, including $7.4 billion for housing assist ance and $1.6 billion for public housing oper ating subsidies. The funding  levels in the bill  are approximately at  the  fiscal  year 1988  levels. I am very pleased that once again the  Appropriations Committee has wisely rejected  the Reagan administration's attempt  to pro vide almost all low-income housing assistance  in  the  form of 5-year housing voucher con tracts.  Instead,  H.R.  4800  continues  the  present mix consisting of  the voucher pro gram, section 8 rental subsidies, rehabilitation  of rental housing and reconstruction or devel opment of public housing.  Under the section 202 program, the bill pro vides $1.5 billion for 9,500 rental units for the  elderly or handicapped. Additionally, $5 million  is appropriated for congregate services at el derly and handicapped housing projects, fund ing  that the administration did not include in  its proposal. To help address  the growing  homeless problem in this country, H.R. 4800  provides $65 million for grants to renovate or  convert buildings for use as emergency home less shelters and to pay for certain operating  and social services at such shelters.  In addi tion, $85 million  is provided  for housing and  support services for the homeless mentally ill  and homeless families.  Another program which has been of  im mense assistance  to West Virginia  is  the  Community Development Block Grant Pro gram for which $3 billion is contained in H.R.  4800. Unfortunately, the bill does not appropri ate any  funds  for  the Urban Development  Action Grant Program for fiscal year 1989, al though it does provide for the continuation of  the  program with  recaptured  funds.  I will  strongly support an amendment being offered  later today that would provide $150 million for  the UDAG Program.  H.R. 4800 funds the Environmental Protec tion Agency at $5.2 billion for 1989. Of great  importance to West Virginia  is the $2 billion  contained in the bill for construction grants to  municipal, State, and  interstate agencies  to  assist with the planning, design, and construc tion of waste water treatment facilities. Many  of our communities in West Virginia are strug gling  to comply with  the secondary sewage  treatment standards mandated by  the Clean  Water Act. The funding provided for the sewer  grants program is critical for these and other  communities  throughout  the  country which  simply do not have the resources to meet the  sewage treatment requirements.  Mr. Chairman,  I am also happy to support  this bill because  it appropriates a  total of  $28.2 billion in fiscal year 1989 for the Veter ans' Administration, which  is  $250 million  more  than  the  administration  request and  $443 million more  than  the fiscal year 1988  funding  level.  I am especially pleased since  $15.7 million of  the  funding  for major con struction projects will be used for clinical  im provements at the Beckley Area VA Medical  Center in my hometown of Beckley, WV. The  Beckley VAMC  is a 17 4-bed acute medical  and surgical center, with a 42-bed nursing  home care unit. There are 57,000 veterans  from 11 counties in West Virginia and 1 in Vir ginia with potential access  to  the Beckley  VAMC. Money for clinical additions and alter ations provided for by the bill would create es sential extra space  to accommodate an  in creasing staff serving an ever-growing number  of patients.  I salute my colleagues on  the  HUD-Indepedent  Agencies  Appropriations  Subcommittee  for  recognizing  the needs of  veterans in southern West Virginia and south western Virginia. Our Nation's veterans have  given so generously of themselves in protect ing the rights of free Americans that it is only  fair to reward them with adequate health care  facilities. I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port H.R. 4800.  ",1988
1072,842,11,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of certain amendments of H.R. 4800,  the  HUD-independent agencies appropriations for  fiscal year 1989. Although we are struggling  under the budget reconciliation agreement to  reduce the Federal deficit, it is very important  for us not to overlook the Government's re sponsibility to provide affordable housing  for  lowand moderate-income  families and  to  provide emergency assistance to homeless in dividuals and families.  For this reason,  I join my Democratic col leagues on the Subcommittee on Housing and  Community Development  in support of  the  amendment offered by Representative SCHU MER  and Chairman GONZALEZ  to  provide  higher appropriation  levels  for housing and  homeless assistance programs. I support this  amendment because  it will  increase  funding  for the urban development action grants which  the administration would like to terminate, sec tion 202 housing assistance  for  the elderly  and handicapped,  flexible subsidy programs  for assistance to troubled multifamily housing  projects, congregate services for the elderly,  homeless assistance for veterans, emergency  shelter grants and other McKinney homeless  assistance programs, and EPA waste water  treatment facilities grants.  I would  like  to commend  the  fine work of  the Appropriations Committee and Chairman  BOLAND  of the HUD-Independent Agencies  Subcommittee. Under  the circumstances of  this year's budget restraints, difficult decisions  have had to be made. The Schumer amend ments would raise appropriations to more ap propriate  levels  to help alleviate  the critical  housing shortage. This funding comes at the  expense of NASA research and development  appropriations. No one wants  to  take  from  one program to give to another, but the NASA  appropriations  for  fiscal year 1989 are $1.8  ",1988

1076,855,11,Mr. LEHMAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, the issue here, my friends,  is not whether or not we are commit ted to space exploration; we are. The  issue here is not whether or not we are  going to have a dramatic increases in  the NASA budget. Regardless of how  you  vote on  this  amendment,  the  NASA  budget  is  dramatically  in creased.  The real issue here is whether or not  we can afford a dramatic increase for  space while at the same time cutting  funding dramatically for housing here  at home.  The big cuts in this appropriations  scheme are given to the homeless, the  homeless, those who need the help the  most. Over the past several years our  housing programs have  absorbed  a  budget cut in excess of 30 billion real  dollars. Mr. VENTO pointed out that is  60 to 70 percent. No other segment of  the Federal budget has  taken  that  kind of hit during that period.  Now that we finally have a good bi partisan housing plan  in place, ap proved by this Congress, we come here  and argue  instead  that  the money  might be better spent by dramatically  increasing the NASA budget, perhaps  by building a space station. That is dis graceful. We  can wait  a  little bit  longer on the NASA increases; space is  still going to be there. But the prob lems that we exacerbate by not deal ing with housing today will only get  worse. The original version of  the  House budget had a !-percent cut in  housing. We were willing to take that.  Now we are asked to take a 6-percent  decrease in housing so that we can in crease  the NASA budget by 16 per cent. Is that a reasonable appropria tion of our resources? Ask the home less, ask the elderly, ask  the handi capped, ask your  local governments,  ask the poor, ask the veterans how  they would like to have that money  spent: give it all to NASA or keep a  little bit here so we can take care of  some of the problems at home.  I ask you to support the Schumer  amendment.  ",1988

He  did a fine job also on this legislation. I  just do not happen to agree with all of  his conclusions.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  also  commend  Chairman RoE  for his  impassioned  plea for the future. That is th~..  ... ~ .. ost  enthusiasm that I have seen f  the  future since I have come to Congress  this 1 year and  I  agree with him  almost completely, but not completely.  I come from a high tech area. It is  very important to the economy of our  area.  As we make our long-term plans for  high  tech, we have  to recognize we  have some very, very low tech emer gency needs that must be addressed.  We must have a balanced public policy  which will promote future goals with out ignoring the needs of our own citi zens today. Needs, for example, of the  millions of homeless on our streets  today, the homeless veterans, the el derly and the disabled in their special  needs.  Public policy should promote human  dignity of every person. I urge my col leagues  to  support  the  Schumer  amendment and in doing so  to  take  one small step for human dignity.  ",1988

1080,855,11,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Chairman, we are  faced today with another exercise in  hard choices. We are asked to choose  between our Nation's basic commit ment to research and development, be tween our commitment to providing a  decent place for people to live, care for  homeless veterans, commitment to re building our cities and also reducing  the pollution  to our Nation's rivers  and streams.  0 1450  I guess if we had our druthers, we  would rather do them all. We do not  have that luxury today, in light of our  budget deficits.  My decision to vote for this amend ment is made easier because of the fol lowing facts: Even if this amendment  is adopted, the space component of re search  and  development  within  NASA's budget will receive a $500 mil lion increase, not a cut but a $500 mil lion  increase. My  support  for  this  amendment is made easier because of  the  fact  that we have already cut  housing during the last 7 years by over  one-half. If we had cut everything else  in our Federal budget by as much as  we  have cut housing, we not only  would have a  balanced budget, we  would have a surplus of some $200 bil lion.  My support for this amendment also  is made easier by the fact that in 1994,  and beyond, we will provide no more  new Federal money  for cleanup of  sewage discharges  into our Nation's  rivers and streams.  In urging my colleagues to support  this amendment, let me conclude by  saying, ""enough is enough.""  An increase of nearly 15 percent in  NASA's  fiscal  year  1989  budget  is  enough. Seven years of deep cuts in  housing programs is enough. We can  do something about it by voting  in  favor of this amendment.  The CHAIRMAN.

1082,855,11,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. Chair man, this past year the Nobel Prize in  Economics was  awarded  to Robert  Solow of the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology. In his thesis he said  that it is high technology and its re search and development that basically  is  the creation of wealth and  that  leads a nation to productivity. That is  simply our future. The Nobel Prize  Committee recognized that, and that  is part of the price that we have today.  Now, certainly the Soviets have rec ognized  that,  for  they are  in  their  third generation of a  space station.  This is merely the space station where  a great deal of materials processing  and medical research is  taking place  and future kinds of pharmaceuticals  are now being experimented with in  this extraordinary environment called  zero gravity.  When we sent JoHN GLENN into the  heavens, we  even  thought  that  the  human eyeball might change shape,  but what we found was that we could  harness this environment to do incred ible things, including the experiment  that will go on Discovery, at the end  of this summer, an experiment called  protein crystals.

Mr. DuNCAN passed away last night in his  home State of Tennessee. As someone who  came  to know him as a colleague and a  friend,  I was saddened and shocked to hear  the news of his death.  The Committee on Public Works and Trans portation approved  this bill unanimously just  yesterday, only hours before his passing.  Congressman DuNCAN was elected  to  the  House in November, 1964. He served on the  Committee on Ways and Means, a position  that gave him power and prestige. However,  with  this powerful position, his sense of re sponsibility  to his country were placed  far  above any power or prestige that may have  come  to him. His nine  ""Watchdog of  the  Treasury"" awards and his continued efforts to  eliminate waste in Government are all proof of  this.  His fellow Members knew him for his hard  work, his  integrity, his honesty, and his fair ness. Most of all, they knew him for his honor  and decency.

1098,894,11,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, should we  change our coin design? To what? Shall we  put Plymouth Rock on  the penny, Niagara  Falls on the nickel, a dove on the dime, and  the Hoover Dam on  the half-dollar? These  ideas were suggested by a participant  in a  survey conducted by the coinage publication,  Numismatic News, May 31, 1988. Results of  this survey have shed  light on yet another  complication with the proposal to change coin  designs-finding  new  designs  which  will  please rather than disappoint or anger a ma jority of the American public.  A recurring theme prompted by the survey  is to include the space shuttle on one of the  new designs. The  tragedy of the Challenger  accident, as well as the continuing American  aspiration to remain pioneers of space, makes  this a sentimental favorite of many people. I,  too,  recognize  the  symbolism  of  such  a  design, and do not contest  its worthiness.  However, such a choice would not be made  without some controversy.  Why did we not honor those men who lost  their  lives  in  the Apollo  tragedy  in 1967?  Should we  include  them  in  another  coin  design?  If so, we will have depicted on  two  coins spacecraft which  represent past and  contemporary technology. By law, these new  designs must be kept  for 25 years, during  which  time current  technology will certainly  become outmoded.  Donna Pope, Director of the U.S. Mint, ex pressed similar concern about the problem of  selecting coin designs in her testimony before  the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs, April 22, 1988. She stated  that  proponents  of  coin  design  change,  ""largely members of the numismatic communi ty, cite the need to 'modernize' coin designs,  which  they believe  to have grown stagnant.  * * * In our  rapidly changing world, where  technological  marvels  quickly  become  museum pieces, contemporary designs may  not be desirable. For example,  if contempo rary designs had been adopted 25 years ago,  coins depicting a Mercury Space Capsule or a  revolutionary device known as the transistor,  would certainly be dated in this era of space  shuttles and microchips.""  This  is  just one example of  the kinds of  controversies which will plague the selection  of new coin designs. The Numismatic News  article mentioned other suggestions by those  surveyed. Ideas include depictions of Thomas  Edison,  Ernest  Hemingway,  and  Norman  Rockwell.  Some  people,  however, might  prefer to honor Alexander Graham Bell, Na",1988

1145,959,11,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, apart  from  the  problem of the drought, there are a number of  problems  facing midwestern dairy  farmers.  Our colleague  from Wisconsin, TOBY ROTH,  recently aired some of his views in a column  published by the ""Wisconsin State Farmer."" I  believe that solving the dairy industry's prob lems will require a lot of discussion and a lot  of fresh thinking. At this point, I would like to  insert Mr. ROTH's column into the RECORD for  the benefit of my colleagues.  MILK MARKETING ORDERS: TIME FOR A  CHANGE  <Representative TOBY RoTH)  The Federal Milk Marketing Order system  is outdated and needs to be overhauled.  The system has contributed to excess pro duction and clearly discriminates against  farmers in traditional dairy producing states  like Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota re ceive  the lowest prices  in the nation for  their milk while farmers in states like Geor gia and Texas get the highest prices. In fact,  the gap in prices paid between regions was  further widened in 1985 with the mandated  increase in the Class I differentials.  The normal economic factors of supply  and demand play a minimal role  in  this  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  price determination. The price per cwt.  is  virtually the same throughout the 44 na tionwide milk marketing orders. The price  difference is determined by an antiquated  formula based on the cost of transporting  fluid milk from Eau Claire. Thus, marketing  orders for regions located farthest from Eau  Claire tend to claim the highest prices.  For example, a farmer in Shawano may  receive  $10.33  per cwt.  for  his milk. A  farmer in Brehman, GA, would get $13.41.  At  this  rate,  a Wisconsin  dairy  farmer  almost could book a super saver flight on a  national airline, fly his milk to Georgia and  still make more than if he sold it in his  home state.  In March, the General Accounting Office,  an independent federal investigative agency,  released its findings on the status of the  milk marketing order  system. The GAO  report concluded that the system no longer  serves its original purpose of encouraging a  local supply of milk. Today, milk  is pro duced in every region of the country. Ad vances in technology have made it easier to  store and transport milk in traditionally de ficient areas.  An excellent example of how the price dif ferential is at the root of our dairy surplus  problem  lays  in  the  story of Masstock  Farms in Montezuma, GA. Masstock  is a  foreign-owned dairy that targeted Georgia  to eventually build five dairies with over  6,000 cows. The reason: Price. The price dif ferentials have caused production increases  of 25-25% in the South and Southwest.  Milk marketing orders were established in  1933  to safeguard dairy farmers and con sumers from great swings in milk supplies  and prices. An admirable goal in 1933 since  milk was an extremely perishable, bulky  commodity  and  refrigeration  and  other  preservation technologies were primitive.  In 1988, however, 44 national milk market ing orders provide for cumbersome bureauc racy and the outdated transportation allow ances cost the U.S. taxpayer an estimated  $800 million a year in waste and  income  transfer. And  technological advances that  improve the shelf life of milk have virtually  eliminated the need for vast transportation  differentials based on Eau Claire.  With production estimates up 2% from a  year ago, the dairy industry is on a collision  course  toward another 50¢  price cut.  In  order to preserve the health industry, we  must have fundamental changes  in dairy  policy, starting with milk marketing orders.   Later this month, I will propose to the  House Agriculture Dairy, Livestock  and  Poultry Subcommittee replacing the current  44 milk marketing orders with a  regional  marketing system that more accurately re flects transportation costs based on four re gional midpoints.  I believe that there should be no more  than four milk marketing orders based in  corresponding regions. The nat:lonal price  paid for milk should be determined as it is  now. The transportation differential should  accurately reflect the 1988 costs of moving  milk to and from the specific region's natu ral collection point.  I also strongly support efforts to pressure  the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service  into holding oversight hearings on the net  effect of the 1985 mandated increase in the  Class I differentials. It is high time that the  facts were on the table with respect to the  changing distribution of milk production  throughout the regions of the country.  While  it  is unlikely  that Congress will  fully  tackle  this  issue before  the session  closes  in October,  I am hopeful that the  15735  groundwork will be firmly laid for changes  in 1989.  A  fundamental  restructuring of  the 44  milk marketing areas would reduce govern ment bureaucracy, save taxpayers money by  limiting the amount paid for transportation,  and would not discriminate against farmers  in the traditional milk producing areas of  the Midwest. More important, restucturing  the orders may result in such a saving that  farmers could receive more for their prod uct while consumers pay less.  It is time that we in Congress set aside our  regional differences and do what is right for  the nation for a change. It is time for all  farmers across  the nation  to be  treated  equally and fairly. A streamlined regional  milk marketing system is long overdue.  COUNCILMAN GILBERT WILLIAM  LINDSAY  HON. MERVYN M.

1146,959,11,Mr. DYMALL Y.," Mr. Speaker, Dr. Gilbert Wil liam  lindsay, a veteran of the U.S. Army's  1Oth Cavalry and 25th  Infantry, and  the first  black member of the Los Angeles City Coun cil, recently was the recipient of the honorary  doctor of  laws degree at  the 1988 Howard  University's graduation ceremonies.  I would like to bring to your attention, and to  the attention of all my colleagues, Dr. Lind say's significant  contributions,  and  am  re questing that the attached be inserted into the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  COUNCILMAN GILBERT WILLIAM LINDSAY  Gilbert William Lindsay,  the first black  man to become a member of the Los Ange les City Council, has a background in gov ernment that extends over 50 years. Born  on a cotton plantation in Jasper County,  Mississippi on November 29, 1900, he left  the farm in his early teens and moved to  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he complet ed his secondary education.  Mr. Lindsay left Pittsburgh and went to  Arizona to serve in the United States Army  in both the lOth Cavalry and the 25th In fantry. Always seeking to progress by fur thering his education, he enrolled in a pro gram at the University of Arizona's School  of Business Administration while  in  the  Army.  Following military  service, he went  to  California where he was hired by the De partment of Water and Power for the City  of Los Angeles. Using every available hour  to pursue courses and take promotional ex aminations,  he  continually  moved  up  through the civil service ranks.  Mr. Lindsay became quite active in politics  and community affairs despite his busy  schedule. In 1952, he served as Associate  Manager in the campaign to elect Kenneth  Hahn, Supervisor of Los Angeles County;  and after the election, he was appointed the  first black Deputy Supervisor, a capacity in  which he served for 10 years.  In January of 1963, Mr. Lindsay was ap pointed to fill a vacancy on the Los Angeles  City Council for the 9th District, becoming  the first black Councilman in the City's his tory. In the general election in May, he was  overwhelmingly elected, defeating 11 oppo nents. He has been re-elected for seven con secutive terms and has served for over 24  ",1988
1147,972,11,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  call  attention  to  the death of one of  this  body's most  respected alumna. As many of  you  know, Gladys Noon Spellman passed  away over the weekend. For those of us that  knew her, this is a great loss.  During her years in Congress, Gladys Spell man was known  for her dedicated work on  behalf  of  her  constituents.

1148,1011,11,Mr. HATCH., Will the Senator yield  for just a couple of comments on this  particular issue?  ,1988
1149,1011,11,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.,  I  would  be  happy to yield to the Senator from  Utah.  ,1988
1150,1011,11,Mr. HATCH., This has been an inter esting debate but title III is working  now. Secretary Brock's task force did  not condition  their  recommendation  for the worker readjustment program  on mandatory notice. It works without  mandatory notice. It may be useful in  certain isolated circumstances but it is  not needed  across  the board. But  training programs are not going to fall  flat without notice with regard to lay offs because 70 to 88 percent of these  businesses give notice now.  ,1988
1151,1011,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Then why not  all? If 70 to 88 percent can to it, why  not all?  ",1988
1152,1011,11,Mr. HATCH.," Seventy to 88 percent  give notice now and, frankly, I think  that more will, voluntarily, without  the long arm of the Federal Govern ment injecting itself and telling plants  and companies what  they ought or  ought not to do.  With  regard  to  the Senator's an nounced amendment, look. I think we  are all getting a little tired of this bill  being represented by its proponents as  a simple plant-closing notification bill.  ",1988
1153,1011,11,Mr. METZENBAUM., It is.  ,1988
1154,1011,11,Mr. HATCH.," Well, you can see it is  not because we are in a little bit of a  tangle right now over the issue of lay offs. In all honesty, the plant closing  notification part really is not the im portant part, I submit. I think the im portant part is that certain segments  of our economy want the layoff provi sion, which then stifles business in all  kinds of ways and I think the distin guished Senator from Kansas is very  accurate and right when she says if  you want to stifle business and you  want to deter business and you want  to deter flexibility and opportunity,  then keep  the  layoff  provision  in  there. But if you want to do what the  New York Times says this little simple  bill does, and that is give notice, 60day notice of an actual plant closing,  then let us do that.  You know,  there are a  lot on this  floor, a number of people on this floor,  including myself, who find some fault  in injecting the Federal Government  even in the plant closings context. But  when you start moving it toward lay offs, sure, I guess you can come up  with isolated hypotheticals that really  are not practical  that you can say  might not be fair.  But the real world says that layoffs  have to be some option that employers  have to have in order to keep their  businesses alive. Worker readjustment  is not going to be influenced one way  or the other by that. I think the arguments of  the distinguished Senator  from Massachusetts are without any  validity.  I commend the distinguished Sena tor from Kansas. I may not fully agree  with her in her approach in the sense  I think even the plant-closing part is  extending the long arm of the Federal  Government.  ",1988
1155,1011,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  who has the floor?  ",1988
1156,1011,11,Mr. HATCH., The Senate has yielded  tome.  ,1988
1157,1011,11,Mr. METZENBAUM., The Senator  cannot yield to you.  ,1988

1160,1011,11,Mr. SIMPSON., I will yield.  ,1988
1161,1011,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I object. One Senator may not yield to  another and give the floor back and  forth. He  can  ask  a  question but  cannot do anything beyond that.  ",1988
1162,1011,11,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President,  the  person questioning the entry of debate  has not even phrased the question. I  think they deserve that courtesy.  ",1988
1163,1011,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Wyoming has the floor.  ,1988
1164,1011,11,Mr. SIMPSON., I yield for a ques tion.  ,1988
1165,1011,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Wyoming has a right to  yield for a question.  ,1988
1166,1011,11,Mr. QUAYLE.," The question I have and I am trying to figure out, do we  get these moving targets again-of ex actly what the problem of the Senator  from Ohio  is with  the Kassebaum  amendment.  The understanding that I had listen ing to this is that the Senator from  Ohio raised the question and the pos sibility that if you had a thousand em ployees working that you could layoff  980 and only keep 20 and, therefore,  that you would never have a plant  closing and these people would not get  notification.  If that is the problem of the Senator  from Ohio, if that is his problem with  the Kassebaum  amendment,  I  just  would like to ask maybe the Senator  from Wyoming if it is his understand ing of  the Senator from Ohio  that  that is his problem. I guess my ques tion would be, if we could resolve that  problem,  then maybe  the Senator  from Ohio might be willing to support  the Kassebaum amendment.  I ask the Senator from Wyoming if,  in fact, during the debate he would  want to get around to getting the Sen ator from Ohio pinned down to his objections?    I do not have the floor right now. I  asked that he yield for a question. I  throw that question out just trying to  figure out exactly what his objection  is  to the Kassebaum amendment be cause if that is the objection, I have a  good remedy for  it, and I  think the  Senator from Ohio might be interest ed.  What will probably happen, he will  say, ""Well, once you fix  that, I will  have  another  objection  somewhere  else."" We will get into the course of  debate. We will find out really what  the objection of  the Senator  from  Ohio really is to this amendment.  ",1988
1167,1011,11,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I am  certain we will find that out during  the debate, and I  think the Senator  from Indiana has posed a good ques tion. I shall leave that to be answered  by the debate. I think what we really  are seeing here or what we will soon  see is really where the rubber hits the  road on this issue. We are going to  find now that this is the crux of the  issue.  We can forget the romance and the  stuff we have been  through for all  these weeks because here we are at the  issue of plant closing. That is what  this bill is called. It is called the plant  closing bill. It is not called the mass  layoff bill. It does not have anything  to do with-at  least  the American  people were told that it did not have  anything to do with-layoffs. It had to  do with mass layoffs. That is the term  of art within  the  legislation. They  were told that this was a plant closing  bill. That is how this has been sold.  I have never heard it described as a  layoff bill or a mass layoff bill. I think  we are right at the point now on this  entire matter where we  really  are  going to find that the emperor has no  clothes. We are talking here about the  Kassebaum substitute which  is very  simply nothing more than taking the  original legislation that was presented  by Mr. METZENBAUM of Ohio and col leagues  and  simply  deleting  the  phrase, wherever  it appears,  ""mass  layoffs.""  It does not have anything to do with  the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act.  That issue was not raised by the Sena tor from Kansas. It was raised by the  Senator from Massachusetts. The Sen ator from Kansas said nothing about  the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act.  ",1988
1168,1011,11,Mr. KENNEDY., Will  the Senator  yield on that point?  ,1988
1169,1011,11,Mr. SIMPSON.," Yes, I will yield for a  question.  ",1988
1170,1011,11,Mr. KENNEDY.," The point I raised  in  response  to  the Senator  from  Kansas had pointed out was the notifi cation is key in terms of the effective ness of training programs. The earlier  the notification, whether it is layoffs  or whether it is closings, the more ef fective the dollar spent on those train ing programs would be for the benefi ciary.  So the Senator from Kansas said to  me there is nothing in her amendment  that is going to stop trade adjustment  programs, which  I understand. But  the point of this whole program and  ",1988
1171,1037,11,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, as  we all know, the Civil War shaped the  course of American history. Preserving  the battlefields of this historical wa tershed  is of great  importance not  only to historians, but also to the edu cation of our children and grandchil dren.  Antietam National Battlefield  in  Sharpsburg, MD, the site of the blood iest day of the Civil War, is one of the  few Civil War battlefields virtually un touched since the war. The preserva tion of this battlefield, however, is en dangered by increasing pressure to de velop  farmland.  Indeed, one of  the  most significant battlefield sites at An tietam-the  cornfield  where more  than half of the casualties occurred is  totally unprotected from develop ment.  I am therefore  introducing legisla tion today which will enable the Na tional Park Service  to acquire  land  from  voluntary  sellers  or  donors  within Antietam's boundaries.  I  am  very pleased that my colleague from  Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI,  is join ing me in this effort. Currently, the  Park Service  is allowed  to purchase  outright only 600  acres. There are,  however, almost 1,200 acres of battle field  land  that are unprotected. Al though the Service is permitted to ac quire scenic easements from landown ers within Antietam boundaries, this  power is not sufficient to preserve the  area.  Many landowners do not wish to sell  scenic easements because such ease ments may decrease the market value  of their land. Further the acquisition  of a scenic easement does not give the  Park Service authority to conduct nec essary preservation activities on the  land. In order to give the Park Service  maximum flexibility in acting to pre serve this national landmark, we must  allow the Service to acquire fee simple  title to lands within park boundaries  when they feel it is required to pre serve the character of the site. That is  the essence of this important bill.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation to preserve  Antietam National Battlefield.e  ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS  s. 39  At the request of Mr. MOYNIHAN, the  name of the Senator

1172,1063,11,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, today, we  express our sorrow over the death of  Congressman John J. Duncan. I was  deeply saddened by John's death. The  State of Tennessee will remember for  a long time to come his valuable serv ice and relentless devotion on behalf  of the people of his Second Congres sional District and all Tennesseans.  At the same time that we mourn his  absence, Mr. President, a reflection of  John Duncan's 24 years of service calls  to mind his distinguished career and  stirs our  appreciation  for  it.  John  Duncan was a devoted husband and  father and was a strong voice in Ten nessee politics who always displayed  strength which lies in firm dedication  and integrity of character.  John Duncan was  born  in Scott  County, TN, and after completion of  his service in the U.S. Army he attend ed  the Cumberland University Law  School.  His  career  achievements  spanned all realms of public service:  He was assistant attorney general for  the State of Tennessee and city of  Knoxville Law Director. He was elect ed mayor of Knoxville  in 1959 and  served outstandingly. He served  this  district in Congress since his election  in 1969, during which time he main tained close contact with the residents  in his district by coming home nearly  every weekend for local events, cele brations and meetings.  In Congress, he rose to a position of  power and  influence as  the ranking  minority member of the House Ways  and Means Committee, but remained  attentive to the needs of his district.  He served on the Joint Committee on  Taxation. He received much well-de served recognition for serving Tennes see on these committees and in other  legislative  areas. Such  a  career of  public service is refreshing and serves  as inspiration to those who pursue a  life in this profession.  Congressman John Duncan will be  missed greatly by the entire Tennessee  delegation and all  the Members of  Congress; however,  the work he did  and the progress he made on behalf of  Tennessee will endure. My  thoughts  and prayers are with his family and  friends.  ",1988

1175,1076,11,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman from Wisconsin.  I just want to explain to the Mem bers that we dealt in committee with  an expansion in some areas to cover  people with various forms of handi caps, mental  and physical;  for  in stance, one of the issues arose as well,  suppose  someone  in  that  category  might be a threat in terms of health.  We believe that in most of these cases  there would be no threat, but we have  provided that if the individual, wheth er the individual has the AIDS virus  or there was an emotional problem or  an alcoholism history or a physical  problem, whatever was covered, and  all of those are covered, but if the in dividual posed a direct threat to the  safety or the health of others, we are  making it explicit that in those excep tional cases, we believe there will be,  and you provide or you present a  threat in some special circumstances,  you can be excluded.  When that was offered, I used the  language of Grove City and that dealt  only with health and safety. It was  pointed out to me in the committee  that we are dealing here with rental  property, and property ought to be in cluded.  I assure the gentleman from Wiscon sin that it does  improve  the bill.  I  promised  in full committee  to offer  this amendment and I appreciate the  gentleman allowing me to offer it at  this time, and I hope it is adopted.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

1178,1076,11,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like to also thank the members of the  committee for allowing us to go back  to this section for the purpose of of fering these amendments.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1158 as written  would be the first civil rights bill to in clude familial status as a protective  class. We have not  adequately  ex plored the potential issues surround ing such a classification. Therefore,  this amendment would not only strike  that provision of the bill dealing with  familial status, but it would also man date a study by the U.S. Commission  on Civil Rights  on  discrimination  based on familial status.  Should  the Commission  find  that  there  is  substantial  discrimination,  then Congress should take appropriate  action  to protect families with chil dren. The appropriate action  is not  that action taken by  this particular  bill.  This  bill, Mr.  Chairman,  in  its  present form would outlaw senior com munities.  Now, it was not intended to do such  a sweeping act, granted, but by its very  words, the very verbiage in the act in  itself, that is exactly what it does.  There is an exception in the act that  I would like to point out to the com mittee. It says:  (2) As used in this subsection, ""housing  for older persons"" means housing communi ties consisting of dwellings<A>  intended for, and at least 90 percent  occupied by, at least one person 55 years of  age or older per unit, and providing signifi cant facilities and services specifically de signed to meet the physical or social needs  of such persons.  Now, I immediately raised a question  of great concern. What type of serv ices and facilities do people aged 55  years need that the rest of the com munity does not need?  In looking for that, I went to the  report language and found this:  Such facilities and services include congre gate dining facilities, social and recreational  programs, emergency and prevention health  care or programs, continuing education, wel fare information and counseling, recreation al homemaker, outside maintenance and re ferral service,  transportation  to  facilities,  access  to Social Services and services de signed to encourage and assist recipients to  use the services and facilities available to  them.  0 1305  After determining that, then it was  necessary to find out how much these  services would cost. In doing that, I  found that the facilities required in  the first exemption would cost any where from $400 to $1,095 per month.  The cost is $400 which is  the HUD  congregate  services,  and $1,195  per  month with is the Vantage House in  Maryland, their charges for such serv ices.  So what we have essentially done is  put senior citizen housing outside of  the ability to pay of most of our senior  citizens.  Granted, discrimination is not right  when practiced against anybody but I  do not think that the senior citizens  who wish to maintain and live  in a  senior community should be told by us  here in Washington, DC that they no  longer can do so.  There is a second exception in the  bill where it says that the facilities are  intended for and occupied solely by  persons 62 years of age or older. I do  not know what in the world we are  thinking about there. All we are doing  is saying that all the senior citizens in  the communities that would want to  maintain that eligibility would be re quired to absolutely ban people under  the age of 62 years of age. Perhaps an  older  gentleman would  decide  to  marry a wife that is 55 years of age.  Immediately they would have to leave  the senior community because  they  would  jeopardize  the exemption set  forth in this bill.  Again, Mr. Chairman,  I  do  not  attack the motives of the framers of  this bill. I think they were straightfor ward and they tried as best they could  to  exempt  senior  communities but  they missed. I  tried to work up lan guage that would perfect the language  in here but exclude senior communi ties, and I could not draft it either.  That is a problem that we have.  ",1988

On Monday,  June  27,  1988,  the  House will meet at noon and there will  be nine bills under suspension. They  are:  H.R. 4612, Federal Employees Liabil ity Reform and Tort Compensation  Act:  H.R.  4726,  to  designate  the Dan  Daniel Post Office in Danville, VA;  H.R. 4065, Federal Energy Manage ment Improvement Act;  H.R.  4604,  International  Agency extension;  H.R. 3893, to amend the Toxic Sub stances Control Act relating to asbes tos in the Nation's schools;  H.R. 4101, Telemarketing Fraud Pre vention Act;  H.R. 4503, Community and Migrant  Health Centers Amendments of 1988;  H.R. 1841, Fishing Vessel Compensa tion Safety Act Amendments; and  H.R. 4030, to strengthen certain Fish  and Wildlife laws.

I will repeat, as a result of  the two appropriations bills and the  votes  from  suspensions debated on  Monday, Tuesday night could well be  a late night.  On Wednesday, June 29, the House  will meet at 10 a.m. and we will consid er the Plant Closing Notification Act,  assuming that the Senate has complet ed it. We will then consider the Omni bus Trade and Competitiveness Act of  1988, subject to a rule.  On Thursday, June 30,  the House  will meet at 10 a.m. and we will consid er the Department of the Interior ap propriations bill, subject to a rule.  On Friday, July 1, we will not be in  session.

1211,1128,11,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the Kil gore College Lady Rangers of Kilgore, TX,  who earlier this year won the National Junior  College  Athletic  Association  championship  with a 33-1  season, were honored at  the  White House May 5, 1988,  in recognition of  their fine athletic accomplishments.  President Ronald Reagan,  in a very pleas ant Oval Office meeting, extended his warm est admiration to the group and expressed his  congratulations to the team and Coach Evelyn  Blalock.  Team members presented  the President  with numerous gifts: A Rangers warm-up suit,  baseball cap with the school emblem, college  yearbook and school history, and a gym bag  filled with similar gifts for Mrs. Reagan.  The Kilgore  Lady Rangers  captured  the  NJCAA championship with a 33-1  season  record. In the NJCAA national tournment, Kil gore College defeated Lees College, Jackson,  KY, 105-102: Moberly Area College, Moberly,  MO, 79-73; Northeastern Oklahoma A&M Col lege, Miami, OK, 72-69; and John A. Logan  College, Carterville,  IL,  in  the championship  game 78-71.  During  the season, Kilgore Lady Rangers  scored  3,071  points-an average  of 90.3  points per game-while allowing  their oppo nents only 2,381-an average of 70.0 points  per game.  Kilgore College went to the national tourna ment for the first time in 1986, finishing sev enth. The  team  returned  in 1987,  finishing  sixth, and in 1988 became the NJCAA nation al champions.  The Lady Rangers are coached by Evelyn  Blalock, who started the women's basketball  program at Kilgore  in 1979. Managers and  members of the championship team who were  received by President Reagan included Yolan da Brown, Vicki Dunbar, Rosalind Hodge, Pam  Hudson, Charlotte Jones, Barbara Latham,  Joey McReynolds, Wendy  Martin,  DeDe  Palmer,  Kim  Scott,  Hope Walker,  Terail  Walker, Charon Wells, and Pam Wells.  Also attending the reception were: Kilgore  Mayor Bob Barbee; Jim Campbell, Kilgore Col lege's dean of student services and assistant  vice  president;  Latane Speer,  cheerleader  sponsor and teacher at Kilgore College; and  James A. (Archie) Whitfield, director of public  relations at Kilgore College.  Mr.  Speaker,  as we  adjourn Congress  today, it is my hope that we do so in honor of  the NJCAA champions for 1987 -88-the Kil gore College Lady Rangers of Kilgore, TX.  Mary Ellen and  I were proud  to present  these  champions  to  the President of  the  United States-and we will be pulling  for a  repeat performance in 1989.  HON. WILLIAM (BILL) CLAY  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 23, 1988  ",1988
1212,1128,11,Mr. CLAY.," Mr.  Speaker,  this weekend,  American  families celebrated  the  importance  of fathers. Over the past several decades, the  role of fathers has changed dramatically. No  longer are fathers the sole or solely breadwin ners with  few other  family  responsibilities.  Today's  fathers are  taking an active  role  in  caring for and raising their children.  The increased family responsibilities under taken by men have placed new demands on  them. With over 95 percent of  fathers and  almost 60 percent of mothers at work,  the  need  for one parent to attend  the needs of  newborn or seriously ill children has  intensi fied. Many companies have  recognized  the  changed needs of workers and provide tem porary job leave for family needs. Unfortunate ly, the majority of companies have yet to for mally protect their workers. Only 40 percent of  companies  provide  job  protected  parental  leaves. Many of these companies provide less  generous  leave to men,  in clear violation of  title VII of  the Civil Rights Act's prohibition  against sex discrimination.  Our society has finally begun to realize that  women should not alone bear the responsibil ity for caring  for  family members. More and  more men are taking active roles in child rear ing. It is time the United States join the rest of  the civilized world and enact a national family  policy that allows working men and women to  care for their families.  DECLARING  ""VIETNAM  VETER ANS WEEK"" IN BOLINGBROOK,  IL  HON. JACK DAVIS  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 23, 1988  ",1988
1213,1128,11,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, there are  many, many good reasons  for Americans to  feel proud on the Fourth of July.  I would like  to share one particular event happening in Bo lingbrook,  IL,  that  is going  to make 1988 a  very special, and very proud Fourth of July for  a group of Americans  that have  certainly  earned the right to hold their heads up high.  Mayor Roger Claar  of Bolingbrook  has  issued a proclamation declaring the week of  June 28, 1988, through July 4, 1988, as Viet nam Veterans Week  in his community. This  proclamation, though, is only a portion of the  mountain of compassion and support that the  community of Bolingbrook is offering to Viet nam veterans.  The Vietnam veterans convoy to the wall is  a group of several hundred Vietnam veterans  that are volunteering  their own  time and ef forts in a journey from one end of this great  country of ours to the other. They will start out  from Portland, OR, and travel across America  in their own vehicles to arrive at the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial Wall  in Washington, DC,  for the Fourth of July. They want to recognize  America's  celebration  of  independence  by  paying tribute to their comrades-and in many  cases-their friends, who answered the call of  their country and left their homes and families  to defend the ideals on which this country was  founded on that first Fourth of July, 212 years  ago.  When the Vietnam veterans convoy to the  wall arrives  in Bolingbrook,  I L,  they will be  greeted by a community that has gone out of  its way to welcome the travelers and show its  support. From  the police  to  the  fire depart ment,  from  local businesses and restaurants  to families and their homes,  the entire com munity of Bolingbrook is welcoming the Viet nam veterans with open and supportive arms.  I know that the efforts of Bolingbrook will be  warmly appreciated by the veterans traveling  to Washington. I hope, however, that the rest  of America will take a moment and turn their  heads toward Bolingbrook, IL. I hope that they  will open their eyes and see a community that  is extremely proud to be American-a commu nity that has the time to take a moment and  say thank you to those who clearly deserve all  of our thanks.  I would like to insert the proclamation of the  village of Bolingbrook into the CONGRESSION AL RECORD to stand as an example to the rest  of the country of the compassion and grati tude of a fine American community.  VILLAGE OF BOLINGBROOK-PROCLAMATION  VIETNAM VETERANS WEEK JUNE 28-JULY 4,  1988  Whereas,  the Viet Nam Convoy  to  the  Wall is making their 2nd annual trek from  Portland, Oregon  to Washington, D.C.  where they will participate in our Nation's  Fourth of July celebration and while en route Bolingbrook will have the opportunity  to host this convoy on June 28th and 29th;  and  Whereas,  the  Village  of Bolingbrook  wishes to encourage the rest of our nation  to follow our lead in welcoming home Viet  Nam Veterans and provide them with a time  and place to participate in the healing and  sharing experience  required  to bring our  veterans home; and  Whereas, members of the Armed Forces  of the United States who served in South east Asia during the Viet Nam Conflict per formed such service under the most trying  conditions because of the lack of domestic  support for the conflict and the nature of  the conflict itself; and  Whereas,  the courage and sacrifice of  America's  soldiers,  sailors, marines,  and  airmen during the Viet Nam era was by all  measures equal to that of their counterparts  in other wars; and  Whereas, we have never fully expressed  our thanks to those who have given a sub stantial portion of their lives at their coun try's request and in the name of the people  of the United States, and who served honor ably during this period; and  Whereas,  the  Village  of Bolingbrook  would like to dedicate this week to giving  back some peace and joy to the 6 million  men and women who fought for years  to  insure us those same rights and privileges.  Now, Therefore, I, Roger C. Claar, Presi dent of the Board of Trustees of the Village  of Bolingbrook, Will and DuPage Counties,  Illinois, do hereby proclaim  the week of  June 28th through July 4, 1988 to be Viet  Nam Veterans Week in our community and  ",1988
1214,1141,11,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I believe  that our inability to succeed with com prehensive campaign finance  reform  should not prevent this body from ad dressing some of the serious flaws of  the Federal campaign process.  There are many of us who have not  forgotten the battle of S. 2. S. 2 cam paign reform was an effort to change  the purchase of  seats  in  the U.S.  Senate. We failed in that effort.  A majority of  the Senate  favors  reform of the campaign spending law.  Vote after vote indicated that.  The bill  that I  am going  to  talk  about today does not deal with spend ing limits; it does not deal with PAC's.  It deals with another type of reform.  That is, the ability to enforce the laws  as they now exist.  Those of us who went through the  last Senate cycle of elections know  that the  laws were not adhered  to,  that the Federal Election Commission  has not the power nor the authority  nor the manpower to enforce the laws  as they now exist.  Therefore, I would hope that this  body would not look at the legislation  which  I will  introduce  as  in  any  manner partisan. We are all aware of  the limits imposed on campaign laws  by the ineffectiveness of our current  enforcement provisions. We must pro vide for more accessible, more effec tive and a swifter process.  One of the opponents of S. 2,  the  junior Senator from Kentucky, spent  a great deal of time talking about how  the present laws are avoided, not en forced. Therefore, I would direct that  Senator's attention to the statement  that I am going to make today and the  legislation that I will later introduce  because  it will deal with accessible,  more effective, and a swifter process.  That is why I introduced Senate bill S.  780, which now has 30 cosponsors. I  will introduce another bill, the prod uct of further consultation. Why start  over?  I am starting over because S.  780, after consultation with experts in  the  area,  is  not  the best possible  means of enforcing the laws that now  exist.  As the Chair knows, the current law  provides for unnecessary delays before  action is taken by the Federal Election  Commission or by the courts in a civil  action.  In addition, the penalties, if ever im posed,  are  insufficient  to deter or  punish violations of the laws govern ing a fundamental aspect or our demo cratic process.  I believe  it  is outra geous, but no secret, that the worst  thing a violator of the law might fear  is a penalty amounting to a few dollars  several years after the election.  In my election, which took place in  November almost 2 years ago,  there  were numerous complaints  filed  re garding my election by various people  in the State of Nevada. Only one of  those  has  been  resolved. About  a  dozen  are  still yet  to be  resolved,  having been filed well over 2 years  ago.  So a fear that a penalty amounting  to a few dollars several years after the  election does not deter anything. Such  a penalty hardly matters and viola tions may have been an instrument in  an election victory.  Mr. President, the bill I will intro duce  addresses  those problems  and  makes Federal campaign law enforce ment fairer, swifter, and stiffer.  I have noticed in my consultations a  great deal of support for such an ap proach.  First, my bill would empower  the  Federal Election Commission  to  re quest an injunctive order to stop the  most  serious and obvious violations  while they are occurring rather than  having  to wait until  after  all  the  damage is done.  My legislation would also speed and  encourage  the  conciliation  process  that takes place between the respond ent and the Federal Election Commis sion prior to any action in court.  Access, another objective of the bill,  would be made easier by ending the  exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colum bia allowing suits to be brought in any  court with  jurisdiction over  the  re spondent. Mr.  President,  frivolous  suits, however, would be discouraged  by imposing the final burden of a suit  on the loser, including attorneys' fees.  Finally, and most important, penal ties would be raised substantially and  sometimes made mandatory, especially  when the violation has been knowing  and willful.  If such a violation has  been committed just before the elec tion, the penalty would even be higher  because we all know that some of the  worst  is  saved until  last. Why? Be cause nothing can be done. This legis lation would address that, and if a vio lation has been committed just before  the election, the penalty would still be  higher.  I do not intend to detail all the pro visions of a bill which  is somewhat  technical in nature. I simply ask my  colleagues in this body to support an  effort that we all have a stake in re gardless of on what side of the aisle we  sit. We all want the electoral process  to be honest, and my legislation would  take us to that goal.  THE MURDER OF MAJOR NICH OLSON:  A  TRAGEDY AND  A  DISGRACE  ",1988
1215,1141,11,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, on June  14, Dan Howard, spokesman for  the  Defense Department, announced that  the Soviet Union had apologized for  the killing of Maj. Arthur D. Nichol son Jr., on March 24, 1985.  I have  often  deplored  the  brutal  Soviet  murder of Major Nicholson,  and  I  have been amazed at the general disin terest in the subject by the American  media-and the State Department in  subsequent  discussions  of  United  States-Soviet relations.  In fact, Mr. President,  the Soviet  killing of Major Nicholson constituted  a straightforward, cold-blooded act of  premeditated murder  by  a  foreign  power in direct violation of every legal  and moral standard. I was astonished  by  the Defense Department's  an nouncement, and decided  to  take a  closer look. Having done so, I regret to  say  that basic ""truth-in-advertising""  standards have been woefully ignored  in this sordid affair, and I am thus  obliged to try to remind my colleagues  of the bizarre facts of the case.  To begin, Mr. President, let me re count the full text of the statement  which the Defense Secretary Carlucci  received from Soviet Defense Minister  Dmitri Yazov on May 31:  I express my regret over the incident and  I'm sorry that this occurred. This does not  promote improved relations. Secretary Car lucci and I have agreed we will do all we can  to prevent these kinds of incidents in the  future.  In commenting on this text, the De fense Department's spokesman said:  ",1988
1216,1154,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  I  think  the  Senator  from  Indiana  is misunder standing the Senator from Ohio's posi tion. The Senator from Ohio feels very  strongly that there should be nothing  in this bill that can be interpreted as  being a  financial obligation on  the  part of the employers. I feel certain if  the amendment of the Senator from  Indiana was adopted that that would  be the interpretation across the coun try;  that  the plant-closing bill now  provides  for  the payment,  and  al though you do not make is obligatory,  I think it would be interpreted in that  manner. I think it would be hurtful,  and  I  think  the employers of  this  country would not be at all happy  with what you have done. Because I  think  in many  instances employees  would be pressing to get that 60 days'  pay. And that is really not the objec tive of this legislation.  Our bill is about notice, not sever ance. And that is the key point. This  amendment is unfair to employees as  well as employers. I am frankly a little  bit surprised that the Senator from In diana is offering the amendment be cause, as I see it, employers are going  to be pressured to make the financial  payment.  The employees are going to be anx ious to get the money. They are not  going to be thinking about job train ing and counseling. And I think to do  that to them, I think, is to do a dis service to the employers as well as the  employees.  I almost would urge my  colleague to withdraw the amendment  because you are not serving the pur pose of the employees who need the  jobs, who need  the counseling; and  you are not serving the purpose of the  employers who may come under pres sure from the employees to pay this  kind of money rather than to get the  job training and the counseling.  There is a tendency on the part of  many people: Just get the buck. Get  the money. Gosh,  if  I  can get  2  months pay, that would be far better  for me. I am not worrying about coun seling or  training.  I  just want  the  money.  I think that is hurtful to the whole  economic picture in the country.  ",1988
1217,1154,11,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, let me  make sure that I understand. Under  the  legislation of  the Senator from  Ohio on a noncontractual employer,  he can, in fact, give-he calls it volun tary pay-severance pay.  I  am not  going to get involved in semantics. As  a matter of fact I said I would change  it to voluntary pay if you do not like  severance pay. I think they are essen tially the same.  Under a  noncontractual  situation,  under the Metzenbaum bill you could  be exactly what the Senator from In diana says ought to be allowed for all  employees.  I am not concerned that this amend ment is going to be burdensome to the  employers. As a matter of fact it is  rather  interesting,  I do  say  to my  friend from Ohio, that he is now sup posedly  trying  to protect corporate  America from financial burdens placed  upon them by Congress. I mean, that  is a bit of an ironic situation.  But, be that as it may, Mr. Presi dent, this amendment is not going to  be misinterpreted. It is just too simple.  I mean,  it  is  too  simple  and  too  straightforward.  The Senator from Ohio says, gee,  employees are just greedy. They just  want money.  Just say give me  the  money.  Well, I disagree with my friend from  Ohio. I think what employees in this  country want is a  job. They want an  opportunity. They want to produce for  themselves  and  for  their  families.  That is what the employees and the  working people of this country want.  I do not think they are greedy.  I  think they are hard working. Yet for  some reason, this amendment is going  to bring out  their greed. That is a  bunch of nonsense. Come on. How far  have we come? We know the workers  of America want a  job. What  this  amendment does, it says that, in fact,  in lieu of notice that you can give sev erance pay of we will call it voluntary  payment. Call it voluntary payment.  We will simply allow that to be an  option: flexibility. I  think that some  Senators who have State law like that  of the State of Maine might want to  think about this. I have a hunch they  are under the impression that this is  going to level the playing field. This is  not going to level the playing field, be cause the way the Metzenbaum legis lation is drafted, you have those statu tory obligations. You are going to con tinue to have those statutory obliga tions above what the Federal statuto ry obligation is going to be.  That means there will be more costs.  Believe me, talk about placing finan cial costs in the private sector, this leg islation in totality is going to do that.  You can  imagine  the  lawyers when  they get into this on both sides. Talk  about interpretation.  Let me read this. Talk about inter preting things and misrepresentation,  just on the layoff provision, talk inter pretation problems,  talk about costs,  they are going to have to go down, if  we are really serious about placing fi nancial costs on the private sector-we  ought to read a little bit of these defi nitions here.  The term ""mass layoff,"" which the  Kassebaum  amendment  goes  to,  means a  reduction in force which is  not the result of a plant closing; re sults  in an employment  loss at  the  single site of employment during any  30-day period; at least 33 percent of  the employees,  excluding any part time employees; two, at least 50 em ployees, excluding any part-time em ployees; or, three, at least 500 employees, excluding any part-time employ ees.  Then jump down to subsection <6>:  ""subject to subsection (b),  the  term  'employment loss' means <A> an em ployment  termination, other than a  discharge for cause, voluntary depar ture, or retirement, <B> a  layoff ex ceeding 6 months, or <C> a reduction  in hours of work of more than 50 per cent of each month during any 6month period.""  I can go on and on if we want to talk  about  interpretation. If we want  to   talk about costs that are going to be  placed on the employer,  I will say,  there will be a lot of costs placed on  the employer which will be passed on,  as we  know. The employer will be  paying these costs.  I am not so sure it will go to increase  the wages of the hourly workers  in  this country.  I  imagine  that  these  costs would go down to some of the  super lawyers. Probably a lot of law yers in this town will get rich. I think  they do all right now, quite frankly.  They will just get richer.  What about the worker out there?  What about that man and woman who  gets up and works by the sweat of the  brow  for a week, Monday  through  Friday, has a family to raise, kids to  educate, is he or she going to benefit  by this?  The  Senator  from  Ohio  really  stretches  this amendment by saying  that one of the things on this notice in  layoff legislation is to give employees  time to readjust, to get training, to get  education.  I  think employers ought  to  think  about this giving severance pay. It is  not mandatory, and it is not going to  be interpreted as mandatory. Sure, the  Senate is not going to be interpreted  as saying it is mandatory. It simply  allows an employer to give severance  pay of 60 days in lieu of notice. If they  do,  then  those workers,  through no  fault of their own, can go out and seek  training, seek education, seek that job  and that hope for the future.  Mr.  President,  this  is  a  simple,  straightforward amendment. There is  absolutely no reason that this amend ment should be defeated. It should be  adopted, and I hope that it is.  Mr. METZENBAUM addressed the  Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  SANFORD). The Senator from Ohio.  ",1988

1222,1167,11,Mr. BENTSEN.," I yield myself such  time as I may need.  Mr. President, I appreciate the com ments of  the distinguished Senator  from Arizona.  I say to the Senator from Montana  that it is my absolute priority to have  a technical corrections bill. It is imper ative to do it.  We are talking about the tax reform  that  took place  in 1986,  the most  major reform in 40 years. A bill of that  complexity,  that magnitude, had  to  end up with a  lot of concerns and  problems  and  ambiguities  and con flicts and problems of interpretation.  We have a lot of people out there  making out tax returns who are not  sure whether they are in compliance.  So it has to be done.  I would be happy at that time to  look at this situation and see if there  is some change we might make, and I  would consult with the Senator from  Montana. But I do not want to do that  on the floor of the Senate, without a  hearing, without hearing from these  people. I do not want to see a shift in  the burden on those other organiza tions who are also doing worthy work  and are doing  the things that have  been enumerated, many worthy things  we are all concerned about, whether it  be crippled children, the terminally ill,  or an environmental group or one  made up of senior citizens, where the  distinguished Senator from Montana  has been such a wonderful proponent  and has shown his deep concern. But I  would be happy to work with him on  the technical corrections and see if we  can arrive at something that would  satisfy his concern.  Barring that, as soon as he has com pleted his time, I would be prepared to  move to table.  ",1988
1223,1167,11,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President,  I  thank the distinguished chairman, my  friend from Texas, who is a very able  chairman and most gracious  friend  and generous friend, for his comment.  Ordinarily, with that kind of assur ance,  I would  just withdraw  the  amendment. But  it  is not ordinary  right now.  I know the distinguished  chairman is going to do everything he  can to bring up a tax bill, specifically  the technical corrections bill, and to  get it passed. I know he will do that.  He will do absolutely everything he  can possibly humanly do to bring it up  and get it passed.  I hope  I do not sound  like  I am  throwing cold water on that when I  say this: I think there is just a 50-50  chance of passing a technical correc tions bill this year.  As I recall, early in 1987 there was  an effort or hope to get a  technical  corrections bill called up, and it was  not called up. I am sure that it was the  hope of the distinguished chairman to  call it up earlier this year during this  session of Congress, and  it has not  been called up.  I feel quite certain that the House  wants to pass a  technical corrections  bill.  I was  over  in  the Longworth  Building the day before yesterday, and  I will  tell you that place was chaos,  where I used to have my office when I  was in the House of Representatives; I  never heard or saw such a hubbub as  there was going on right then when I  entered in there and I said, ""What is  going on? What is going on?"" They  almost had to shout. They had to talk  rather  loud  so  you  could hear  it.  Somebody said, ''Technical corrections  bill,"" and pointed around the corner  through a mob. ""The House Ways and  Means Committee  is busy with that  technical corrections bill.""  There will be a lot of stuff in it as  evidenced by the large crowd in the  Longworth Building  as  they were  marking up the bill. They could not  possibly get into the large Ways and  Means Committee hearing room. They  were lined up clear out around the cor ners and all through that lobby wait ing their turn hopefully to get in.  I only mention that because I know  what  faces  the Finance Committee  here in the Senate in attempting to  move a  technical corrections tax bill.  It becomes quite a large bill. It comes  under a lot of scrutiny. It comes under  a lot of debate. It comes under numer ous amendments  to be offered. And  now  it is getting toward the end of  June and we  have  two conventions  coming up, one for our party and one  for the party on the other side of the  aisle,  to nominate our Presidential  candidates, and we hope  to adjourn  sometime around the 1st of October.  So  time  is awasting, and my strong  feeling  is  that there  is  just a 50-50  chance  that a  technical corrections  tax bill will be passed in the Senate  this year.  I apologize to my good friend from  Texas, the distinguished chairman and  friend, and to all my friends on the Fi nance Committee, including the rank ing member, the Senator from Oregon,  for imposing on them this amendment  that is under  jurisdiction or the Fi nance Committee.  But, my friends,  if we want to do  something about it this year, and I  dearly want to do something about it,  I feel this is the chance to do it and  may be the only logical chance to do  it. This is the Treasury bill. This is a  direction to IRS. It is revenue neutral.  It will just remove one thorn out of  the side of those programs under the  Older Americans  Act,  specifically,  senior citizen programs.  I have nothing further  to say on  this, Mr. President. So if my distin guished friend would like to make a  Is  motion, it is perfectly agreeable with  me.  I yield back any time I have remain ing.  ",1988

1237,1180,11,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, as we  are both aware, H.R. 1860 passed the  Senate on June 13, 1988, by a voice  vote. I did not want the opportunity to  slip by, however, without commending  the  senior Senator  from Louisiana,  Mr. JOHNSTON,  the chairman of the  Committee on Energy and Natural Re sources, for bringing this bill to the  Senate. I wish to comment on a provision  in  the bill which addresses an  issue with which I have long been in terested.  The bill includes a study of the orga nization of surveying and mapping in  the  Federal Government  and  the  future of a technology known by such  names  as  multipurpose  cadastre  [MPC],  land  information  systems  [LIS] and geographic information sys tems [GIS]. This provision recognizes  this technology as one with great po tential and seeks a strategy for its de velopment.  This section of the bill was added in  the House Interior and Insular Affairs  Committee as an amendment by Rep resentative MANUEL LUJAN, JR., of New  Mexico. It was in 1981 that Mr. LUJAN  and myself introduced a bill known as  the Federal Land Survey Act, which  included a  feasibility study  for  the  multipurpose cadastre.  That bill was not enacted into law,  but since the time of its introduction,  events have rapidly moved on. Today,  the MPC is not only feasible, but prac tical and, in fact, fast becoming a reali ty.  A private market analysis has esti mated that by the year 2000 some $90  billion will be  invested  in  the geo graphic data bases by government at  all levels, utilities and private compa nies. I am pleased to note that pilot  projects, designed to demonstrate the  benefits of development of a MPC are  currently under way in Orleans, Jef ferson, and Calcasieu Parishes in Lou isiana.  So  this  provision  goes  one  step  beyond  the proposal offered by Mr.  LUJAN and myself. It builds on previ ous studies conducted by the National  Academy of Sciences and the Office of  Management and Budget and seeks  specific actions that can be taken to  make sure government at all levels and  the private sector can take full advan tage of  the benefits a MPC has  to  offer.  I would urge careful consideration of  the Louisiana  projects  during  this  study. There are a number of compel ling reasons why  they are excellent  models for the attention of this study  group.  First, the provision in H.R. 1860 calls  for the development of model stand ards for compatible multipurpose land  information systems for use by Feder al, State and local government agen cies and by  the public and private  sector. The purpose of the Louisiana  pilot projects is to determine the scope  of an MPC. From the experience  in  Louisiana, other communities across  the Nation will  learn about the cre ation of these systems and their po tential applications. When the study  authorized by H.R. 1860 looks a model  standards  and  development,  they  should look at the Louisiana projects.  Second, unlike other Federal ven tures into research and development  in this area, the Louisiana projects are  being accomplished by contract to pri vate firms.  I believe  this element  is  critical  to  the  long-term success of  land information systems. If this tech nology becomes a big Government pro gram here in Washington, it will soon  die. Budget constraints simply will not  permit  the Federal Government  to  have a major role in this area. That is  why I am pleased this study provision  requires consultation with representa tives of private sector surveying and  mapping science.  I am pleased to note once again Lou isiana's  leadership on  this  account.  The  leading private sector group  in  this field is the Management Associa tion for Private Photogrammetric Sur veyors [MAPPSJ, a  trade association  of surveying and mapping firms. The  vice president of this organization is  Rodger D.  Phelps  of  the  firm  of  Vernon F. Meyer & Associates, Inc. of  Sulphur and New Orleans, LA. It is, in  part, the result of Mr. Phelps' leader ship that Louisiana is involved in our  pilot projects. When conducting this  study, it is critical that the views of  the private firms that will be building  these data bases be known and I would  urge the study group to rely on the  views of the MAPPS organization.  Finally, Mr. President, our Louisiana  projects are worth  investigating be cause of the unique role of the Office  of Charting  and Geodetic Services  [C&GS], formerly the Coast and Geo detic Survey, an office within the Na tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad ministration [NOAAl. C&GS is provid ing Federal grant money to the Louisi ana parishes for these projects, while  the parishes  are providing  a  local  share. When looking at new and inno vative ways to provide surveying, map ping and land information services to  local  government,  the  study  group  should take a hard look at the C&GS  arrangement with Louisiana. I believe  this is an example of where the Feder al Government, local government and  the private sector work together with  a common goal.  Although the Department of the In terior is the lead agency in this study,  one of the topics to be considered is  the role of various Federal agencies. I  believe C&GS would be an appropri ate lead agency in land information ac tivities due to its longstanding history  in surveying, mapping, charting and  geodesy and its experience with our  Louisiana projects.  Again, I commend my colleague for  his leadership on this issue.e  KEITH M. MISER   ",1988

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to  bring before the House legislation to  provide additional time to the Nation's  schools for the important task of re moving asbestos materials from school  buildings  under  the  process  estab lished by the Asbestos Hazard Emer gency Response Act, or AHERA.  The health threats from exposure to  asbestos, which can cause asbestosis  and lung cancer, are clear, as are the  enormous dimensions of the problem  for  the Nation's schools. EPA esti mates that some 31,000 school build ings contain some  form of asbestos  material and that as many as 15 mil lion schoolchildren-almost one-third  of the Nation's school population-and  as many as 1.4 million school employ ees attend schools and work in build ings that contain asbestos materials.  In the subcommittee hearing on this  legislation, we  heard  from officials  from several States who run schools  and actually have to undertake the in spections,  develop  the management  plans and perform the proper abate ment actions to remove asbestos haz ards. They told us that a large number  of schools across the country will not  be able  to perform these  tasks ade quately within  deadlines. We learned that the infra structure for carrying out the AHERA  program-the  accredited  inspectors,  management planners, and abatement  contractors necessary for performing  AHERA functions-is not in place. Be cause of this, the rush to meet the Oc tober 1988  and  July 1989 AHERA  deadlines may actually  increase  the  risks  from asbestos exposure  to  the  Nation's school population.  We also heard from the U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency which  has the responsibility to see that the  comprehensive AHERA  program  is  properly carried out by promulgating  regulations spelling out school obliga tions under the law and building the  infrastructure of accredited asbestos  personnel to assist schools in meeting  their obligations. Unfortunately, we  found out that EPA has not done all  that it should to see that AHERA's  goals are met.  The House has before it today H.R.  3893, legislation introduced by my col leagues Mr. OXLEY, Mr. LENT, Mr.  WHITTAKER, and Mr. FIELDS to address  the AHERA deadline problem.

1272,1245,11,Mrs.  KASSEBAUM.," What  this  amendment does, Mr. President, is re quire advance notification  for plant  closings. It is cosponsored by Senators  DoLE,  SIMPSON,  HATCH,  KARNES,  QUAYLE,  KASTEN,  LUGAR,  MCCAIN,  RUDMAN, BOND, DOMENICI, McCONNELL,  and COCHRAN.  It was  introduced by myself, dis cussed on last Thursday in an effort to  express our concerns for plant closing  and a belief that, in all fairness to em ployees,  there should be mandatory  notification of 60 days when a plant  would be closed.  However,  the change between  this  and S. 2527 would be that layoffs, as  defined in S. 2527, would not be in cluded. And  I  have  initiated  this  amendment in the nature .of a substi tute  because  I  believe  that  there  should be some flexibility in the op tions  that are open  to a  company  when they have to make changes with out unduly hurting employees and it is  in an effort to try to be fair and yet  accommodating  that we have  intro duced this amendment.  We will be debating  this at some  length  later  in  the  course  of  the  debate and a vote is scheduled, I be lieve, at 2:30.  At this point, I yield the floor, Mr.  President.  ",1988
1273,1245,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Massachusetts.  ,1988
1274,1245,11,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, we  had a brief opportunity to talk about  this amendment last week. I want to  reiterate some of those points because  I think it is extremely relevant to the  issue  that we  are considering here  today.  There are 10 million workers who  have lost their jobs since 1980. That  figure could go as high as 13 million  depending on how you define disloca tion. But let us take the figure to be 10  million who have lost their jobs since  1980. Of those who have actually lost  their jobs, almost half were laid off  and  then became either  indefinitely  unemployed or  eventually went  to  work elsewhere.  the  Senate  is  accepting  the  premise of the Senator from Kansas,  we are  talking about half of all of  those who lost their jobs.  If we follow the logic of the Senator  from Kansas, she is prepared to give  the 60-day notice if the plant is actual ly going to close. But those people who  are going to be laid off will still be sub ject to the blue slip on Friday after noon, with no right to any notifica tion. So  the burden on that person  who loses his or her job, in terms of  fairness and equity, is just as signifiIf  cant as the burden on those who are  going to have the plant close down.  So, we say if the idea behind plant  closing is one of fairness and equity to  men and women who have worked in  plants and factories, in many instances  for a lifetime, I think the same kind of  premise should apply to those who are  going to be laid off and may not regain  their jobs at all.  If what we are interested in is fair ness and equity  to  those people,  it  seems to me that the logic of that ar gument applies equally to those who  are going to be laid off. Any review of  the relevant studies shows that a great  percentage of those workers do not go  back into the plant or factory where  they have been laid off.  Second, one of the very important  reasons  for  this  legislation  is  that  those who are going to be laid off or  lose their jobs will be able to get some  training or other assistance so  that  they can make a  transition to other  types of employment. During the con tinuing debate on this issue, I believe  we  showed  that of  those who  lose  their jobs, only a modest percentage  go on into training programs. In those  situations where workers have 60 or  more days' notice, a good many more  of those people go into training. And  those individuals are employed a good  deal more quickly after their job loss.  And  the burdens of  the community  and on the society are a great deal  less: Less  unemployment  insurance,  less eligibility for various entitlement  programs, less burden on the taxpay er.  So what we are talking about is fair ness for the individual worker. We are  talking about the training programs  for those that would lose their jobs.  And that, again, is something that can  be made available at that plant and  factory when notice is given. It is not a  requirement. It is an option, if they  want to get that training.  But we are talking about saving the  taxpayers money as well. So it seems  to me, Mr. President, the arguments  for  layoff coverage  that have been  made during the course of this debate  last week  and  earlier  during  the  debate on the trade bill are so compel ling that this amendment should fall.  Finally, Mr. President, we had a  series of studies that were done with  regard to the plant-closing provisions.  We find, according to the General Ac counting Office,  two-thirds  of  the  firms gave  their workers 14 days or  fewer  advance  notice. Maybe  they  gave  them a day, or maybe a week.  But the average blue-collar worker got  7 days' notice. And the average non union worker got 2 days' notice, na tionwide. Nationwide.  And about a third of all of the work ers got virtually no notice whatsoever.  It was  the Friday afternoon, at 6  ",1988
1275,1258,11,Mr. METZENBAUM., The Senator  raises an interesting issue. We are so  determined not to affect the rights of  employers or employees with respect  to  their respective rights under  the  National Labor Relations Act and the  interpretations of  that act by  the  courts that we have deliberately re frained from injecting ourselves into  that issue. This is a plant closing bill.  It has to do with notice of plant clos ing. We want to leave the interpreta tion to the National Labor Relations  Act and the interpretations of that act  to the courts.  ,1988
1276,1258,11,Mr. HATCH.," But the point is that  the courts have never had to deter mine that before. This bill is not law.  If this bill becomes law, then it may  very well be that an employer would  be put in the unfair situation-and it  would be unfair-of having to give 60  days' notice and pay and severance  benefits to employees who voluntarily  economically struck  the plant. Now,  that is not right. I am afraid of activist  judges giving precisely that interpreta tion of  this ambiguous and unclear  language of the bill.  Now, I do not see how you can argue  that there should even be a right or an  obligation on the part of the employer  who has been struck, for whatever eco nomic  reason  the union decides  to  strike, who did not cause the strike  and, even if he did cause the strike be cause of, say, a too tough attitude or  whatever it is that causes employees  to go out on strike, why that employer  would  have  to  give  plant  closing  notice, or layoff notice, and perhaps 60  days' severance pay and other pay or  other benefits. To me, it is a tremen dously big  addition  to  the present  status of labor law. This bill leaves it  ambiguous  and nobody knows  how  that is going to be interpreted.  I do not believe that should be the  intention of the sponsors of the bill. If  it is, then they ought to step up and  say, ""That is our intention. We hope  the courts will do that."" If you do, I  think it exposes what a rotten bill this  is even more.  I suspect that if you are going to  force a vote on this and not take this  amendment, that is precisely what you  have in mind, by saying, ""Oh, we will  leave it up to the courts."" I do not  think we  should  leave  it up  to  the  courts. I  think we should strike that  kind of  inequity now. That is what  this amendment does.  It is a  fair amendment. It makes  sense.  It stops an unreasonable ap proach,  from  this b1ll's  interpretive  standpoint, and if a court were to con clude that an employer is required to  give a 60-day notice before replacing  an economic striker because  the re placed striker could not return to work  until a job opening became available,  then I think that is wrong.  All my amendment does is make it  clear that nothing in this act would re quire an employer  to serve written  notice pursuant  to 3(a) of  this act  when permanently replacing a person  who is deemed to be an economic strik er under the National Labor Relations  Act.  It makes little sense for Congress or  the courts to require notice for strik ers who caused  the  layoff  to begin  with. An employee who goes out on  strike  is  fully  aware  that  under  present law he or she, as a striker, can  be replaced. So,  if the distinguished  Senator does not like this amendment  it must be that he does not want even  strikers-does not want the employers  to have the right to even replace strik ers.  If that is the case, my gosh, Katie  bar the door. We really will be Euro peanized fully and completely. Who  knows, if we leave it up to the courts  that  is  precisely what  is  going  to  happen. So this amendment corrects  what really is an injustice or an unjust  interpretation of this particular bill.  Let me just ask the sponsor of this  bill, under this bill do you have to give  striking workers 60 days' notice before  they can be replaced?  ",1988
1277,1258,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Since I have  already answered that question once, I  shall just answer it the second time.  This is the second time you have asked  me the same question.  The first time I said: We intend that  the right to replace economic strikers  in circumstances of replacing econom ic strikers shall be determined by the  NLRA and the court interpretations of  the NLRA. We want  to  leave  that  issue unaddressed.  As a matter of  fact,  there are a  number of unresolved issues with re spect  to  economic  strikers. One of  them has to do with whether striking  employees may be permanently  re placed. Another has to do with what  constitutes a permanent replacement.  A  third has  to do with what rates  accrue to persons hired as permanent  replacements. Fourth has  to do-we  want to keep hands off of this issue.  We do not want to involve ourselves in  the NLRA disputes. We are trying to  lean over backward to just stay with  the plant-closing issue.  Under the circumstances, Mr. Presi dent, I move to table the amendment.  ",1988
1278,1258,11,Mr. HATCH.," I just hasten to point  out to everybody in the U.S. Senate  who is going to vote on this amend ment, whether it is a motion to table  or not, that literally if they vote to  table this amendment and they do not  adopt this amendment, they are par ticipating in a major change in the Na tional Labor Relations Act law, and do  not let anybody think otherwise.

1281,1258,11,Mr. HATCH.," Oh,  the Senator al ready made  it? Well,  I will ask the  Senator to withdraw the motion for 90  seconds, and I will finish my remarks.  I am sorry.  ",1988
1282,1258,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.,  I  ask unani mous consent that the Senator from  Utah may be heard for 90 seconds and  immediately thereafter we go to a vote  on the motion to table.  ,1988
1283,1258,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1988
1284,1258,11,Mr. HATCH.," I will go back through  this again. For everybody in the U.S.  Senate who really is concerned about  what is right in our labor laws, make  no . mistake about  it. If this amend ment is not adopted, then we are going  to find, as an end result, that volun tary economic strikers are going  to  have to be given notice and/or pay and  severance pay benefits under this bill.  What an unjust imposition that would  be on any employer in this society, be cause he did not cause the strike. They  voluntarily did it and they did it for  economic  purposes,  so why  should  they be paid or even given notice for  striking?  That is what is involved. It is an im portant . amendment and I hope my  colleagues will notvo.te for the motion  to table ..  With that, I yield the floor.  ",1988
1285,1258,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  question is on agreeing to the motion  of the Senator from Ohio to table the  amendment offered by  the Senator  from Utah.  ,1988
1286,1258,11,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I ask for  the yeas and nays.  ",1988

1289,1271,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator  from Ohio, Senator METz ENBAUM.  ",1988
1290,1271,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I  rise to  join with the distinguished  chairman of the Senate Banking Com mittee in his opposition to this amend ment. It is an 11th hour amendment  to exempt an entire industry.  I have not heard from the FDIC and  the FSLIC, and frankly I  think the  last-minute approach  is unbecoming  for  two Government  agencies  that  knew  this matter had been pending  for about a year.  In addition,  the amendment seems  to reflect concern that advance notice  might interfere with ability of Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation or Fed eral Home Loan Bank Board to step in  and close banks that are in danger of  closing or failing; But the amendment  is unnecessary, because as the chair man of the Banking Committee has al ready pointed out, the bill does not  cover that situation at all.  The bill requires notice to be given  by employers. But when the appropri ate banking agency moves in to close a  bank,  the closing  is by  the Federal  Government,  not  by  the  employer  itself.  The Government action in such a  situation is analogous to police closing  down a gambling operation or public  health authorities closing down a res taurant that violates the health code.  The bill on its face simply does not  apply.  Now,  the Gramm amendment also  seeks to cover the situation where a  healthy bank takes over a failing bank  and wants  to  streamline  the oper ations by laying off hundreds of em ployees. It is a healthy bank that is  taking the action. The bill would apply  in that situation and I frankly believe  that it should be covered.  Employees are not less entitled to  notice because  their employer  is  a  bank rather than a steel mill or an  auto plant. If the purchasing bank  finds that it must suddenly and unex pectedly lay off hundreds of workers,  there  is an exception for unforesee able business circumstances. But if the  purchasing bank and the failing bank  know that those employees will  lose  their  jobs,  they should have notice.  That is the fair and that is the decent  thing to do.  The amendment is either unneces sary or unfair or both. I urge rejection  of the amendment.  Mr. President, it is my understand ing  that  the distinguished Senator  from Wisconsin will shortly offer a  motion  to  table.  I make  that state ment only so that our colleagues may  be advised of the fact that there prob ably will be a motion on the floor very  shortly to that effect.  ",1988
1291,1271,11,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I think  the distinguished Senator from Ohio  got right to the heart of the matter.  In fact, his last statement was exactly  my major point in response to the dis tinguished chairman of the Banking  Committee. What we are trying to do  is prevent banks from being closed. We  are trying to get healthier institutions  to come in and take their bad debt and  take  their  deposits  and  streamline  their operation and try to keep them  open.  Now, it is true, if you want to take  the position that if a bank acquires an other bank-and often it is with cash  assistance and, quite frankly,  in my  part of the country, there are not a lot  of banks that have a lot of cash, and  there are very few savings and loans  that have any real capital as compared  to  the situation  in my part of  the  country 10 years ago-but if you want  to take the position that if you do a  cash-assisted merger  or  you  do  a  buyout, that you want to make them  give the 60 days' notice, what you are  going to do is prevent the buyout from  occurring. You are going to keep the  capital from being invested. The result  is going to be more banks are going to  close, more banks are going to be liqui dated, more  savings  and  loans  are  going to be closed, more savings and  loans are going to be liquidated. And  that is what I am trying to avoid.  Second,  in  the First City case,  in  Houston, TX, which was a cash-assist ed  buyout where  private  investors  brought in a half-billion dollars, where  the Federal Government put up over a  billion dollars, the first thing they had  to do to try to save First City was to  layoff hundreds of people in the cor porate headquarters. Now, do I wish  First City had not had to do that? Yes;  I do. I hate it. But would I have pre ferred that First City had gone to the  auction block, would I have preferred  that they closed the bank down and  put everybody in the bank out of busi ness?  Is  it better  to  lay off a  few  people and consolidate and save the  instituion and then try to come back  and hire them back later when your  business is recovered, or is it better to  shut the institution down, put it out of  business completely? That is what we  are talking about here.  I just want to go on record, because I  suspect  that this amendment  is not  going to be adopted. But I do not want  anybody to be able to say that nobody  ever raised this issue; that when we  see the number of savings and loans  and banks in the southwestern part of  the United States become  insolvent  and become  liquidated, and we  see  their depositors paid off and  their  assets sold off, I do not want anybody  to say, ""Well, nobody ever raised this  issue. We clearly did not understand  what it was going to do.""  And when, with  this drought, we  have banks and savings and loans in  other parts of the country become in solvent, I want us to remember that  under  normal  circumstances  there  would have been a cash-assisted con soldiation. They might have hated it  that some people lost their jobs, but  the institution would have been saved.  But, under this bill, when they are not  saved, I want people to know that this  issue was debated and that they had  an opportunity to do something about  it. That  is what  this amendment  is  about.  I yield the floor.  ",1988
1292,1271,11,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, at  the suggestion of  the distinguished  manager of  the bill,  I am going  to  move to table shortly.  Before I do that I would just like to  take a couple of minutes to point out  that, in the first place, it is clear that  when the Home Loan Bank Board or  the FDIC moves in to close an institu tion, a bank or a savings and loan, the  bill does not apply. The distinguished  Senator from Texas has agreed with  that.  In the second place, the overwhelm ing majority  of  banks would  be  exempt because they employ far less  than the required number to qualify  under  the bill. The  typical, average  branch of a bank employs 30 people.  Savings  and  loans  establishments  employ 18, on the average, Mr. Presi dent. Now, there are a few branches  that employ more than that, but not  very many.  Mr.  President,  furthermore, most  layoffs under circumstances of a FDIC  or FSLIC assisted merger are slow and  gradual. The people who are laid off  are not suddenly laid off by groups 50,  most employees; are laid off over a  period of time. It would be a most un usual situation if a bank would layoff  as many as 50, or a savings and loan  would lay off as many as 50.  Mr. President, where there are more  than 50 laid off, I cannot for the life  of me understand why bank employees  are not like other human beings, why  they should not be told in advance. I  think it is very important. That is the  heart and soul of this bill, that people  are given  a  60-day notice.  It is  a  modest requirement that they be told.  ",1988
1293,1284,11,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  join  the  distinguished  Chairman of the Finance Committee  in introducing the Medicare Graduate  Nurse Training Act of 1988.  This bill is designed to addresss one  of the most serious issues our health  care system faces: a shortage of quali fied nurses. We spend a great deal of  our health dollars on research, better  technology and ensuring a high qual ity of care. Unfortunately, we seem to  forget that all of our health services  are only as good as the people who  provide them. Our services depend on  skilled, caring, and motivated people.  Nurses are perhaps the most impor tant of these people.  As a group, nurses have a depth of  experience that is unsurpassed by any  other group of health care profession als. They touch every aspect of the  field. They are the hands-on providers  of care.  However, they are undervalued as a  group by both society in general and  the health care industry specifically.  Nurses have limited opportunities for  financial and professional growth.  I  believe these are two of the most sig nificant  reasons  for  the  alarming  nurse shortage we face today.  The bill we are  introducing would  address both of these issues by offer ing expanded opportunities to nurses  in advanced clinical  training and al lowing Medicare to help pay for that  training.  Currently,  the Medicare Program  pays hospitals for their direct costs of  educating nurses as well as physicians.  These costs can include stipends, sala ries  of  supervisors,  and  classroom  space. However, under current  law,  Medicare will not pay for educational  programs operated by medical or nurs ing schools. Unfortunately,  this rule  has had the effect of limiting Medi care payment for nurse  training be cause most  nursing  education  pro grams are operated by nursing schools,  often  in universities. On  the other  hand,  graduate physician  education  generally  takes place  in hospitals residency programs.  The result is a disturbing difference  between Medicare support for gradu ate physician education which equaled  $1 billion in 1986 and its support for  graduate  nursing  education which  amounted to only $300 million in the  same year.  There are approximately 80 academ ic health centers across the country  currently providing clinical training of  graduate nurses. However, their role is  hindered because of this inequity. In  addition, hospitals are reluctant to de velop these programs because they are  not paid for the costs of providing a  clinical setting for nurse trainees.  Our legislation will change the Medi care Program by allowing graduate  nurse  training programs to be reim bursed for  the same costs currently  covered  in a  resident physician pro gram.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office estimates that the bill will cost  an additional $5 million in 1989 and  $56 million from 1989 through 1993.  The program will sunset at the end of  4 years in order for Congress to evalu ate its effectiveness. If the program is  as successful as we believe it will be,  Congress will make the program per manent.  Mr. President, promoting the profes sional growth of nurses will encourage  them to remain active in their profes sion and will equip them to practice in  an increasingly complex health care  system. Passage of this legislation will  also let the nurses of America know  that we recognize the vital role they  play in our system and that we intend  to do whatever we can to increase our  support for their work.  I urge my colleagues to join us in  sponsoring this criticallegislation.e  By Mr. SYMMS (for Mr. HELMs,  for himself, Mr. SANFORD, and  Mr. SYMMS):  S. 257 4.

1295,1297,11,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, few crimes are  so loathsome or so appalling as the persecu tion and murder  carried out by  the Nazi  regime against other human beings solely be cause of race, religion, national origin, or polit ical opinions.  The  U.S.  Congress  and  the  American  people have taken a very strong and correct  stand against individuals who were involved in  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  these Nazi  persecutions. Under U.S.  law,  which was enacted a decade ago, any individ ual who ""ordered,  incited, assisted or other wise participated  in  the persecution of any  person  because of  race,  religion,  national  origin, or political opinion"" is subject to depor tation from the United States.  Current U.S.  law now denies or withdraws  Social Security benefits from  individuals who  are deported  from  the United States  for a  large variety of reasons, including the commis sion of crimes,  lying about  their eligibility to  enter the United States, and seeking the vio lent overthrow of  the U.S. Government. Al though our laws call for the deportation of in dividuals who were involved in Nazi persecu tion, we do not now deny  those  individuals  Social Security benefits.  Mr. Speaker, it was to correct that oversight  that I have introduced H.R. 4905. My bill will  deny Social Security benefits to those individ uals who are deported or ordered to be de ported on the basis of their participation in or  assistance  for Nazi persecution during  the  period of Nazi rule in Germany.  The enormity and brutal  inhumanity of the  crimes of those who carried out the Holocaust  transcend our ability to understand, but at the  same  time  justice demands  that  those who  were  responsible must be held accountable  for their crimes. This legislation takes another  small, but important, step in  that direction.  I  urge my colleagues to support it.  16073  uals  like Karen, glorious days are coming  soon.  Karen was  born  on  the  north  side  of  Youngstown-where  she  still  resides-on  June 24, 1954, and graduated from Youngs town Ursuline High School in 1972. Karen is  eternally grateful to her mother for being very  helpful and emotionally supportive, and is ex tremely  thankful  that she has a father who  always gave her an extra push.  It should be  noted that Karen is known as one of the best  hairdressers in the Youngstown/Warren area.  She used her astounding and wizardly skills to  create  gorgeous  hairstyles  for  countless  people at Hair Fashions by Fred for 3 years,  and at Henri's for 9 years. It makes me burst  with  abounding  pride  to  announce  that  Karen's driving obsession to improve herself  is  leading her to seek a master's degree  in  business administration, and that she is look ing  forward  to becoming an amazing worker  and a great success in the business world.  I want the whole world to know that I have  greatly admired Karen's perseverance and  ambition ever since I have known her. I salute  you here on  the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives, and  I am  totally confident  you will rise rapidly wherever you work.

1296,1297,11,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise  in order to pay  tribute  to Ms. Karen Gabel Amon, a very special resident of my 17th Con gressional District. Karen has been a very  close friend of both myself and my wife for  many years. She is both physically and intel lectually a very beautiful young woman, and  has unusual tenacity and zest for life.  Karen recently became a 1988 graduate of  Youngstown State University with a bachelor's  degree in marketing and management, and it  is one of my proudest and most humbling mo ments as a Member of Congress to have the  great honor of informing my fellow Members  about her accomplishment. She worked for 12  long years  to get her degree, because she  firmly believed  that she should pay  for her  own education. Karen suffered through many  trying moments during those 12 years. But her  tireless energy and never -say-die competitive  spirit, combined with her burning desire  to  obtain an education, led to her receiving a col lege degree.  Karen's success story is an inspiring exam ple of determination and  commitment. Not  only did she pay for her entire college educa tion, but for most of her high school expenses  as well. She is typical of the people of Mahon ing and Trumbull Counties, for they never give  up no matter how great the odds.

1297,1297,11,Mr. BURTON of  Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I  have  introduced an amendment which ex presses  the  sense  of Congress  that  the  United States must maintain  its commitment  to a 600-ship Navy. We are at a perilous  crossroads in our Nation's history as we move  from reliance on nuclear weapons for our na tional  security  to  conventional  deterrence.  Now more than ever, there is a need for the  United States and its allies to have modern,  credible, and well-equipped navies capable of  force projection worldwide.  A strong, well-balanced Navy is fundamen tal  to our interests. First, we must recognize  the realities  that geography  imposes on our  maritime strategy. Three fourths of the globe  is covered by water. To maintain our freedom  and that of our allies, we must be capable of  meeting aggression wherever  it occurs. The  waters of the world cannot become an uncon tested medium  from which our adversaries  can launch hostile attacks.  Second, until recently, we had the relative  luxury of planning on moving carrier battle groups from the Pacific to support Atlantic op erations if the need arose. We can no longer  afford  that  luxury. The  increasing presence  and activity of the Soviet Navy in the Western  Pacific has required us to revise our maritime  strategy. Their acquisition of a warm water  port  in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam  typifies  the  Soviet's high regard for the value of the Pacif",1988

At the outset, I commend my col leagues from Utah and Ohio in work ing out a compromise on what was a  very complex situation as  it evolved  yesterday afternoon.  In  listening  to  the  debate  on  the  amendment,  it  seemed to this Senator that Senator  HATCH and Senator METZENBAUM were  very close  together and we struck, I  think, the appropriate legislative his tory yesterday afternoon in-may we  have order, Mr. President.

Sen ator HATCH was not on the floor at  that  time.  I  think  it  is worth very  briefly restating it.  The  confusion  had  arisen  as  to  whether this plant-closing legislation  changed the law on the question of  notice in a situation where there was a  replacement to a striking worker. It  was agreed at that time that the provi sions of the National Labor Relations  Act would continue to govern on that  complex  issue. And  it  is a complex  issue, because it is different on right to-work States and on States which do  not have right-to-work laws.  So  that the existing law on when  there may be a replacement, which in volves the issue of maintaining condi tions, maintaining protection, bargain ing in good faith, would stay the same  under  the National Labor Relations  Act  to make a determination when  there may be a  replacement  for  a  striking worker, but  this bill, plant  closing, does not speak to that issue.  So that if, under the National Labor  Relations Act,  there  is a  lawful re placement,  the worker,  the  striker  ",1988

1324,1336,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I am happy to see my colleague from  New Mexico has recognized the impor tance of mandatory advance notice of  plant  closings  and mass  layoffs.  I  share his deep concern about the neg ative effect which hostile  takeovers  often have on the employees of the  target company. As a matter of fact, as  he was proceeding along the line of  discussing his amendment, it was my  opinion that he was proposing that we  provide some additional protection for  the employees of those plants subject  to  hostile  takeovers  and  leveraged  buyouts. I thought that was a pretty  good  idea.  I  thought  that we were  moving  in  the  right direction. But  then I continued to  listen. And the  more I listened the more disappointed  I was because this is the Kassebaum  amendment  in  sheep's clothing.  does not look that good. It is a Kasse baum amendment with a new twist.  Too often employees who have been  working  at plants  that have  been  taken over end up as pawns  in the  games played by takeover tycoons.  For example,  in my own State of  Ohio  there was  the  takeover of the  Federated Department Stores by Cam peau of Canada.

The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  The Senator from Texas <Mr. GRAMM)  proposes and amendment numbered 2486.  Section 3<b> is amended by adding the fol lowing new paragraph:  ""(4) An employer may order a plant clos ing or mass layoff before the conclusion of  the 60-day period if, following the provision  of notice as required in subsection (a), 50  per cent or more of the notified employees  voluntarily terminate their employment, or  if sufficient employees voluntarily  termi nate their employment so as to disrupt the  efficient functioning of the business enter prise."".  ",1988
1328,1349,11,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I think  this amendment addresses a very seri ous problem with this bill. Let me try  to lay it our as an example and then I  want to point out that the example  has practical  implications given  the  state of the economy in many parts of  the country. Then  I would  like  to  avoid another one of these rollcalls by  having the distinguished Senator from  Ohio decide to accept the amendment.  Mr. President, let us say you have a  plant  in New Hampshire where  the  unemployment rate may be 2% percent. Let us say you decide to shut it  down because people are no  longer  wearing garters and you are manufac turing garters and you give a 60-day  notice. In the first 10 days, half of  your people quit and go  to work for  somebody else. However, you have a  60-day  requirement under  law  that  you operate the plant and that you  pay  these people, yet half of  them  have left voluntarily and you cannot  operate  the  plant with  half  your  people.  Now, what  this  amendment  says,  very simply, is that if over 50 percent  of the affected employees who were  notified leave voluntarily, or if suffi cient employees voluntarily terminate  their employment so as to disrupt the  efficient functioning of the plant, that  you can go ahead and shut it down.  Mr. President, I assume that our col leagues who see such disaster in the  economy and this great suffering in  the marketplace will say, ""Well, this is  not going to happen."" Well, I remind  my colleagues that layoff rates today  are at the lowest  level  in 20 years;  that, in fact, the layoff rate is 40 per cent below  today what it was when  Jimmy Carter was President. In fact,  we  have  the  lowest unemployment  rate since 1974.  Now, in my part of the country, in  Louisiana and in other parts of the  Southwest, our unemployment rate is  very high. So if the national average is  at the lowest level since 1974, if you  take  out  the  oil-producing  States,  what  it means  is  that the national  economy, excluding the Southwest, is  so good that a lot of people are work ing  that could be on welfare. Now,  that is a state of the economy that I  would like to replicate in Texas and  Louisiana and everywhere else all over  the world. We are not going to do that  with this bill, unfortunately.  Also, I might point out to my col leagues  that, with all  this  talk of  gloom and doom,  the statistics that  are available indicate that since 1981  15 new businesses have opened  for  every one  that has closed  its doors  and,  in  fact,  six plants are having  openings every day that one closes.  So I think having a provision in this  bill  that says  if you happen  to be  lucky enough to be in one of those  parts of the country that is booming  and you give notification complying  with  this  law  and your  employees  leave to go take another job knowing  you are closing, you cannot hire other  people to come in and work for the 50  days you have left on the notification  and, therefore, you cannot efficiently  operate the plant, I cannot understand  for the life of me why you would not  let the guy shut down the plant.  Finally, before yielding  the  floor,  Mr. President, let me note something  here that I do not know if it struck  anybody else, but it struck me, and I  think it is relevant to this issue. Has it  not occurred to anyone that nobody  has raised the issue here of possible  employer notification?  You have an employer. He has saved  up his money all of his life, invested  his life's savings  to build a building  and buy a plant and buy equipment, to  tum the electricity on, to heat and air condition the building, and nobody is  saying you have to notify this fella if  you are going to quit work. Everybody  is saying this fella has to notify work ers if he wants to close down his plant.  Now, I suspect that the reason is there  are  a  lot more people working  in  plants than there are people who own  them. I think that goes back to poli tics.  My own view is that we ought to let  people quit work if they want to quit  work and if somebody wants to close  down a plant where, in fact, they are  sacrificing, in some cases, their life's  savings and family's life savings, than  they ought to have the freedom to do  that if it  is necessary  to save their  business.  But I am not offering an amendment  that says workers have to notify the  employer. I am just saying, if the em ployer notifies  the worker and then  half of the workers leave or a suffi cient number leave, that the guy who  has built up with his life savings in  this business and now cannnot operate  it, should he not then have the right  to close the plant and try to save some  of his life savings and some of his in vestment? Or is he just an irrelevant  person whose  existence  and whose  work has no meaning in a debate in  the U.S. Senate?  So I think this is a serious issue. I  am hopeful  that  the Senator from  Ohio, knowing him to be concerned  about these kinds of things, will decide  to support this amendment.  I yield the floor.  ",1988
1329,1349,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Texas yields the floor. Is  there further debate on the amend ment? The Senator from Ohio.  ,1988
1330,1349,11,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  it is quite obvious that we have been  prepared  to  accept  a  number  of  amendments today in the interests of  trying to move this bill along, but this  one we cannot accept. This one would  do great harm to the substance of the  bill. So at an appropriate point I will  move to table this amendment.  Let me  tell you why. The amend ment allows an employer to order a  plant closing or mass layoff before the  end of a 60-day notice period if after  notice, 50 percent of employees volun tarily  terminate, or ""sufficient"" em ployees voluntarily terminate so as to  ""disrupt"" the ""efficient functioning""of  the business.

1335,1375,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, as  chairman of  the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, I have today introduced,  by request, S. 2583, a bill to convert  Veterans' Administration medical cen ters  nonphysician  directors  to  the  senior executive service. The Adminis trator of Veterans' Affairs submitted  this legislation by letter dated June  27,  1988,  to  the President of  the  Senate.  My introduction of this measure is  in keeping with  the policy which  I  have adopted of generally  introduc ing-so that there will be specific bills  to which my colleagues and others  may direct their attention and com ments-all  administration-proposed  draft legislation referred to the Veter ans' Affairs Committee. Thus,  I  re serve the right to support or oppose  the provision of, as well as any amend ment to, this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be print ed in the RECORD at this point, togeth er with the June 27, 1988, transmittal  letter and enclosed analysis of the bill.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  S.2583  Be it enacted by the Senate and the House  of Representatives of the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as ""the Act of Convert  N onphysician Directors to the Senior Exec utive Service"".

VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION,  ADMINISTRATOR OF VETERANs AFFAIRS,  Washington, DC, June 27, 1988.  Hon. GEORGE BUSH,  President of the Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: There is transmitted  herewith a draft bill ""To amend title 38,  United States Code,  to convert non-physi cian  directors  appointed  under  section  4103(a)(8) of title 38, United States Code, to  Senior Executive Service career appoint ees.""  This draft bill would place non-physician  facility directors appointed under 38 U.S.C.  §4103(a)(8) within  the Senior Executive  Service <SES>  established under  title 5,  United States Code.  Currently  such  directors  are  excluded  from the SES by 38 U.S.C. §4101<e>. Con gress excluded  the non-physician medical  facility directors from the Senior Executive  Service in 1980, barely two years after the  SES was established, while some concern re mained about the impact of the SES pro gram upon the management of executive  personnel within the Department of Medi cine and Surgery. The exclusion was consist ent with the VA tradition of special appoint ment and pay authority for health care per sonnel and was intended, in part, to make  the management of VA's large cadre of med ical  center directors more  efficient  and  flexible than was understood would be the  case under the SES.  But VA experience since the 1980 exclusion has  left unfulfilled  the expectation  that excluding the directors would enhance  the agency's ability  to manage  them. A  number of anomalies have developed or  become apparent in the eight-year period.  Under current law non-physician directors  are paid  the same as physician directors  except that they are deemed by law to be  SES career appointees for the purpose of re ceiving certain performance awards. Pay dis parities exist between some directors ap pointed under 38 U.S.C.  §4103<a><8>  and  other comparable VA executives <such as  Department of Veterans Benefits Regional  Office Directors> under theSES. The career  path for non-physician directors from Asso ciate Director, to Director, to Regional Di rector is not coherent due to the fact that  both Regional Directors and Associate Di rectors are appointed under title 5 while the  Directors are appointed under title 38.  There is also a lack of flexibility in reas signing Directors appointed under 38 U.S.C.  § 4103<a><8>  to key executive positions  in  Central Office and vice versa because of dif ferences in appointment authority.  The draft bill would eliminate the anoma lies discussed above by placing directors ap pointed under 38 U.S.C. § 4103(a)(8) into the  SES. There would no longer be pay dispari ties with other comparable SES directors in  VA. The converted directors would become  SES career appointees for all purposes-not  just  performance  awards.  Reassignment  would be facilitated because it is expressly  provided for  in the SES  law. The career  path for  these directors would be unified  under title 5. Finally, the conversion of non physician directors to SES would contribute  to one of the original goals of the SES  which was the establishment of a unified  personnel system covering most government  executives.  The draft bill would automatically convert  to the SES all nonphysician directors ap pointed under 38 U.S.C. § 4103(a)(8),  thus  minimizing any possible disruption to the  operation of VA  functions. The equitable  treatment of those converted is assured by  expressly precluding any employee's pay  from being reduced by virtue of the conver sion.  We estimate the cost of this proposal to  be approximately $100,000 per year as a  result of pay increases that would be inci dental to the shift between the pay scale  which currently covers  them, codified at  section 4107 of title 38, United States Code,  to the government-wide SES pay scale.  The Office of Management and Budget  advises that there is no objection from the  standpoint of the Administration's program  to the submission of this draft bill to the  Congress.  Sincerely,  THOMAS K. TuRNAGE,  Administrator.  ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED BILL  Section 1. of the draft bill states the bills  title: ""The Act  to Convert Non-Physician  Directors to the Senior Executive Service.""  Sections 2.<a>  through 2.(c) of the draft  bill would make changes  in existing  law  needed to place non-physician directors ap pointed under 38 U.S.C. §4103<a><8>, under  whose authority non-physician directors of  hospitals, domiciliary facilities, medical cen ters and outpatient facilities are made part  of the office of the Chief Medical Director,  within the Senior Executive Service.

1338,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman, will  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania yield to me?  ",1988
1339,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN.,  I  am happy  to  yield to the gentleman from Califor nia.  ,1988
1340,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I tried to listen carefully to the gen tleman's comments with  respect  to  residency, and the gentleman pointed  out the right of people to be safe.  Is the gentleman asserting that resi dency  requirements would  in  some  way deter any police force from trying  to render safe the city of Washington,  DC, for its residents or its visitors?  ",1988
1341,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  am saying that the residency require ments have restricted the universe of  people available to try to increase the  number of people on the police force.  The District of Columbia is trying to  hire 200 additional officers right at  the present time, and they can expect  retirements. That  is  one  reason,  I  I  limiting the residency re think, for  quirement.  Mr. Chairman,  I do not want the  gentleman to get me wrong. I approve  of having a preference. We  should  have a preference. I approve of that,  but not an absolute limitation.  Second, I believe it is important to  allow the police officers and their fam ilies to be able to have residence where  they can be free of harassment and  where they can be free of abuse.  ",1988
1342,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Then, Mr. Chair man, if I understand the gentleman's  response to my question, he is really  not asserting the issue of safety; he is  asserting  the question of economic  hardship on those people who have to  move, is that correct?  ",1988
1343,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN., No; I am asserting  the question of safety.  ,1988
1344,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS., Will the gentleman  explain that then?  ,1988
1345,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Safety relates to  the number of officers we have here in  the District of Columbia. The goal of  the city, for many years, was to have a  force of 5,100 officers; now we are  down to only 3,880 and are having a  hard time maintaining that.  ",1988
1346,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS., Will the gentleman  yield briefly again?  ,1988
1347,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN.,  I  am happy  to  yield to the gentleman from Califor nia.  ,1988
1348,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Then is the gentle man suggesting that in a city of well  over 600,000 people there are not 200  qualified human beings to take up the  job of being police officers in the Dis trict of Columbia? Is that the gentle man's assertion?  ",1988
1349,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN.," I am saying that  we both have a problem with a force  that is now at 3,880 and is not going  up, but, in fact, is going down. A larger  universe would assist the District of  Columbia to be able to hire qualified  officers. District  of Columbia  has  dropped  their  requirements  for  the  hiring of police, contrary to the direc tion of  the subcommittee, and that  gives  them  a  larger universe  from  which  they may be able  to obtain  qualified officers.  ",1988
1350,1414,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for his response.  Mr. Chairman, I have one last com ment. If the gentleman and I are both  supporters of  the concept of home  rule and the principle of self-determi nation, I might ask my colleague this:  Upon what basis does he see as a legit imacy the insertion of the amendment  of the gentleman from Virginia into  this debate? Why should the U.S. Con gress, which ought to be dealing with  grandiose  issues:  find  itself being a  super city council  to the District of  Columbia? On what basis are we  in serting ourselves into their lives?  ",1988
1351,1414,11,Mr. COUGHLIN., The U.S. Constitu tion provides that it is the Congress  ,1988
1352,1427,11,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman, reserv ing my point of order,  the ranking  member of the committee who has of fered this legislation is absolutely cor rect and I feel very strongly that he  offers it in good faith. Nevertheless,  he offers it as legislation on an appro priations bill. He is trying to, now, per fect  the amendment offered by  the  gentleman from Virginia [Mr. PARRIS].  It seems to me that our report lan guage is very clear. It says that if by  February 1, 1989 the District govern ment has not adopted its own prefer ence system,  that does not preclude  the hiring of noncity residents,  the  committee intends to include language  in its 1990 appropriations bill prohibit ing the continued enforcement of the  residency requirement.  It is clear to me that we should allow  the District to promulgate their own  legislation. They may have other ideas  about a preference system. And the re spect  that  I  have  for  the  ranking  member, and the good faith that it is  offered, Mr. Chairman,  I move  to  make a point of order against  the  amendment on  the grounds  that  it  proposes to change existing law and is  legislation on a general appropriation  bill and therefore violates clause 2 of  rule XXI of the House.  The gentleman's amendment places  additional duties and determinations  on the District officials not now re quired by law.  Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I ask that  the point of order be sustained.  ",1988
1353,1427,11,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield to me before asserting  the point of order?  ",1988
1354,1427,11,Mr. DIXON., I am glad to yield to  the gentleman from Virginia.  ,1988
1355,1427,11,Mr. PARRIS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Let me  take  just one second,  if I  might,  to extend  to  the gentleman  from California [Mr. DIXON] my ap preciation for his gentlemanly conduct  in the consideration of these matters.  We are on different sides of this issue.  I respect and admire the tenacity with  which the gentleman defends his point  of view and the fairness with which he  has treated those of us who have a dif ferent point of view.  I appreciate that very much.  Let me on that point, Mr. Chairman,  just suggest to my friend from Califor nia [Mr. DIXON] that I did not include  this amendment in my amendment, if  you will, because obviously it is subject  to a point of order which I hope would  not be sustained by  the Chair, but  nonetheless, it would have, if you will,  jeopardized the entire amendment.  So that by having an amendment to  the amendment, if the amendment is  subject to this rule of order, then in  fact my original amendment without  the  residency  preference  system,  which is good for this city and which  has support, I hope I can vote for this  amendment, I wish it would be adopt ed by  the House unanimously. But  without that, we are forced to press  on, if you will, with the elimination of  the  residency  requirement  at  all,  which is less desirable in my view for  the District of Columbia.  So  those who are supporting  the  preservation of the residency require ment are in fact in a kind of a back handed way  jeopardizing the prefer ence system which would improve on  no-residency at all.  I would for that  reason  respectfully submit  that  the  point of order should not be sustained  by the House and I would hope that  those who have sincere interest in ad dressing this problem would withdraw  the point of order.  ",1988
1356,1427,11,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman, I insist  on my point of order.  The CHAIRMAN (Mr. COOPER). The  gentleman from California insists on  his point of order.  Does any other Member wish to be  heard on the point of order made by  the gentleman from California?  If not, then, for the reasons stated  by the gentleman from California, the  point of order  is sustained and the  amendment to the amendment is ruled  out of order as legislation on an appro priation bill though in the form of an  exception from a limitation.  Does any other Member seek recog nition on the Parris amendment?  ",1988
1357,1427,11,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin  with  just  a  few  extraneous  issues.  First,  to the most recent comments  made by the distinguished colleague  from Virginia I find quite fascinating,  when he suggested that the gentleman  from California [Mr. DIXON] withdraw  his objection to the amendment call ing  for preferential  treatment,  sug gesting that he would then have  to  press  forward with his own amend ment which would preclude all resi dency requirements which, is his own  terms, would be less desirable than to  allow  the amendment to go forward  with the preferential provision.  D 1330  I would suggest that the gentleman  is asserting that we are talking about  being partially pregnant here. If it is  less desirable to eradicate the entire  residency requirement, why would it  not be less desirable under any circum stances to involve ourselves with the  residency  requirement  in  the  first  place?  Second, the Parris amendment, Mr.  Chairman,  in my  humble  opinion  would prevent enforcement of congres sional laws and seriously hamper the  ability to respond to serious emergen cies such as riots or multi-alarm fires.  For example, Mr. Chairman, prior to  home rule, for the information of the  Members, Congress has long had its  own residency requirement placed on  D.C. police and fire personnel. It is in  section 4-129 of the District of Colum bia that requires that all police and  fire personnel live within 25 miles of  the Capitol. It is asserted by some in  this body, including the Parliamentari an, that the acceptance of the amend ment from  the distinguished gentle man from Virginia would preclude en forcement of this law. So Congress is  already in the business of residency re quirements and the gentleman from  Virginia would retard that.  I would now make another comment,  Mr. Chairman. If we read the amend ment offered by  the gentleman, he  prohibits the use of all funds raised by  residents of the District of Columbia,  not simply Federal funds. If we were  simply talking about Federal dollars,  maybe one could talk about offering  some amendment that is appropriately  within  the  justification of  the Con gress of the United States, but what  this amendment does  is  to go  far  beyond Federal dollars. It says that  residents of the District of Columbia,  even with  respect  to  taxes  locally  raised and having nothing to do with  the Congress of  the United States,  shall be prohibited, not allowing the  residents of the District of Columbia  and their duly elected representatives  to do whatever they think is appropri ate.  That is what this government is all  about, Mr. Chairman. But the gentle man is not talking about Federal dol lars. So I would assert that the gentle man's amendment,  expanded  across  the panorama of dollars raised by the  residents of the District of Columbia,  is  heavy-handed, Mr. Chairman.  goes beyond the pale, and it places the  Congress of the United States in the  role of dictator  in  the  lives of our  fellow American citizens.  We fought hard on the floor of Con gress, Mr. Chairman, in the mid-1970's  to bring some dignity and respect and  some rights and privileges to the resi dents of  the District of Columbia.  Many people saw the District of Co lumbia as our  last colony,  and we  fought hard to overcome that. It was a  blight on the democratic picture that  is  painted  to  represent what  the  United States ought to be about. Six  hundred and some odd thousand resi dents of the District of Columbia must  always stand in fear of some amend ment offered by some Member on the  floor  of  this Congress,  interjecting  themselves into the lives of the resi dents of the District of Columbia who  at this time have the right to elect  and,  if  they choose,  to unelect,  to  recall, to elect someone else to be the  Mayor of the city, members of the City  Council, or members of  the school  It  ",1988

1364,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  ask  that I be given an additional 2 min utes.  ",1988
1365,1440,11,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, that first minute was so ex citing that I gladly yield 2 additional  minutes to the gentleman for purposes  of continuing this debate.  ",1988
1366,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," I thank the gentleman  from California [Mr. DoRNAN], and I  continue to yield to the gentlewoman  from San Francisco, where one of the  greatest parades of all time was held  yesterday, and I was  there and en joyed it immensely from my television  set.  ",1988
1367,1440,11,Mrs.  BOXER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman  from  Illinois  [Mr. HYDE] and say to him that I was  here in the District, as a matter of fact  responding  to  the President on an  issue called the Pentagon scandal, but  that is irrelevant.  ",1988
1368,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Oh,  the gentlewoman  from California was not in the parade?  ",1988
1369,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I was  here working on a  response  to  the  President on the Pentagon scandal. I  hope that the gentleman from Illinois  heard it.  ",1988
1370,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," No, Mr. Chairman,  missed it. I was watching the parade.  ",1988
1371,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," Well, if the gentleman  from Illinois chooses to spend his time  watching parades, that is fine with me.  But I think what we ought to do is get  back to the issue of our deeply held  convictions and beliefs.  Mr. Chairman, we have a Supreme  Court in this country.  ",1988
1372,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," The same Court, Mr.  Chairman,  that  decided  the Dred  Scott case, by the way.  ",1988
1373,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," If the gentleman is  going  to continue  to  interrupt, Mr.  Chairman",1988
1374,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," I just thought we were  going  to have a  little dialog.  I  am  sorry. The gentlewoman from Califor nia [Mrs. BoXER] may go ahead. I am  I  is  fine, Mr.  yielding to her, and I will not say an other word until she is through.  ",1988
1375,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," No, no;  I want the  gentleman to, but I would just like to  finish one thought, if I might.  ",1988
1376,1440,11,Mr. HYDE., Finish up.  ,1988
1377,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman,  the  point that I am making is that people  can get very passionate on both sides  of the issue, and I think that the gen tleman has agreed today in a very gra cious way that he understands there  are differences. And I  think he also  understands that is what makes this  country a great country.  Mr. Chairman, we have a Supreme  Court that has determined that life  begins at a certain point, but not at  the point the gentleman feels it begins  at.  ",1988
1378,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Now, wait a second.  Mr. Chairman, I must recapture my  time.  The Supreme Court says that it does  not know. The Supreme Court says it  does not know when life begins, so I  just thought that I would correct the  record on that.  ",1988
1379,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER., That  Chairman.  . The Supreme Court says it does not  know something the gentleman says  he knows.  ,1988
1380,1440,11,Mr. HYDE., Yes.  ,1988
1381,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," And that is my point,  Mr. Chairman.  ",1988
1382,1440,11,Mr. HYDE., And so does every ,1988
1383,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," Just a minute.  Mr. Chairman, I think my point is  that we have  to respect  the  intelli gence, the intellectual capability of all  our people,  if we  respect  life,  and,  therefore, I think we cannot say to the  people of  the District of Columbia  that we know what is best for them.  This is a subject open to debate, and  good people would feel differently.  ",1988
1384,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, may Ire capture my time?  May I suggest that the ignorance of  the Supreme Court on  this  issue,  which was manifest in the opinion in  Roe  versus Wade  and Doe  versus  Bolton, January 22, 1973, is not shared  by any medical textbook in print.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman has expired.  ",1988
1385,1440,11,Mr. HYDE., May I have 30 more sec onds?  ,1988
1386,1440,11,Mr. DORNAN of California., Does  the gentleman promise to make it as  exciting as the prior 3?  ,1988
1387,1440,11,Mr. HYDE., Yes.  ,1988
1388,1440,11,Mr. DORNAN of California., One  more minute.  ,1988
1389,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman from California  [Mr.  DORNAN].  Mr. Chairman, there is not a medical  book in print that does not say that  human life begins at the moment of  conception. That is a value question.  What value can be assigned to that?  The scientific question is answered in  any book on the subject.  So the question is: ""What value do  you assign  that tiny, premicroscopic  member of the human family?"" If that  is a diseased appendix, throw it away,  but if it is a member of the human  family,  for God's sake protect it at  every chance.  [Mr.  the gentle D 1530  ",1988
1390,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1988
1391,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.,  I yield  to  woman from California.  ,1988
1392,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, what I  think we are seeing in arguing against  the gentleman's amendment here  is  that this is an issue where there are  people of good will on both sides. We  say to the people of the District of Co lumbia, you have got a brain",1988
1393,1440,11,Mr. HYDE., That is what we are here  to vote on.  ,1988
1394,1440,11,Mrs. BOXER.," You have got a brain,  you grapple with this issue and we will  respect you.  I think if we talk about respect for  human life and respect for people and  their intelligence, we will vote down  this amendment.  ",1988
1395,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Well, I am sorry, I do re spect human life and every chance we  get we ought to reach out and protect  it.  ",1988
1396,1440,11,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield 1 additional minute  to the gentleman from Illinois  HYDE]  to see if he is aware of some thing.  ",1988
1397,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Yes, Mr. Chairman.  ",1988
1398,1440,11,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman,  is  the gentleman  aware  that in the beautiful area of San Fran cisco, maybe in the gentlewoman's dis trict, there was an automobile accident  about 3 years ago and a pregnant  mother was killed  in  the accident.  They took her to a hospital. She was  brain dead. They put her on a  lung  machine and a heart machine and for  68 days the child within her lived.  She  had  become  legally  a  dead  person, merely an extension through  modern medical science of the heart  and lung machine, an extension of the  placenta in her body. That child was  born, a boy, different gender, different  blood type, different hair color, differ ent eyes, and is a 3-year-old healthy  young child in the San Francisco area  today. That tells me something about  when life begins.  Was the gentleman aware of that?  Think seriously.  ",1988
1399,1440,11,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman,  if  the  gentleman will yield, yes, I was. And I  will tell the gentleman what I think. I  think birth is a change of address. I  think that little preborn child deserves  protection when people bigger  than  itself decide that it is inconvenient to  continue its innocent life.  ",1988
1400,1440,11,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the dis tinguished chairman of the Pro-Life  ",1988

1404,1466,11,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for that explanation. I  might also make the observation that  again, getting off early this evening,  relatively so, at 7 p.m. or thereabouts,  for  those Members who  have  to  depart,  I  think it is  just incumbent  upon us  to remind Members that it  will  require a  later night  tomorrow  night because we have not on_ly  this  bill to complete, we have fair housing  that ought to be completed, we have a  rule on Interior, and the Interior ap propriation bill, so we have got a long  evening  in  store  for  us  tomorrow  night.  I  think  in deference  to  certainly  those who have obligated themselves  to be here longer tonight and then de ferring to our side that we have no al ternative here but to let our Members  know that we will be here late tomor row night.  0 1900  ",1988

The Members should be advised that  tomorrow will be a  very  long day  indeed, probably, and we hope that as  much of the work as we can accom plish tonight can be accomplished to  limit the schedule tomorrow.

1411,1466,11,Mr. MICHEL.," We understand that  th~ gentleman  from Arkansas  [Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT]  has  a  reservation  about the Durbin amendment. It is my  understanding that if he wished he  could make a point of order on that.  . HAMMERSCHMIDT.  Mr.  Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",1988
1412,1466,11,Mr. MICHEL., I am happy to yield to  the gentleman from Arkansas.  ,1988
1413,1466,11,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I do not object at all to the  gentleman from Illinois [Mr. DURBIN]  offering his amendments. I just object  to  considering  his  amendments  en  bloc. I would want them to be consid ered as they come up, so I do not think  there should be any problem.  ",1988
1414,1466,11,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1988
1415,1466,11,Mr. MICHEL., I am happy to yield to  the gentleman from Illinois if he has a  comment to make that would clarify  the issue.  ,1988
1416,1466,11,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague from Illinois for yielding.  I do not know if this will help to clari fy the situation, but the three amend ments that I will be offering are in  fact one amendment to eliminate the  essential air service subsidies and to  transfer the money to the airport im provement program.  It takes  three  amendments to do that. We can con sider them individually with perhaps  three different rollcalls, or we could  save the time of the House and vote  on  the basic  issue, which  I  think  frankly is what the House will prefer  doing. But I of course will defer to my  colleague from Arkansas.  ",1988

1418,1466,11,Mr. DURBIN.," If the gentleman from  Illinois will yield, will the gentleman  from Arkansas consider a unanimous consent request that the three amend ments, not en bloc, but  the  three  amendments separately be considered  at the end of the bill? The reason I ask  that is that it would give the Members  an opportunity this evening and the  gentleman on the minority side of the  aisle to go  to the meeting that they  have to go to. I am trying to save some  time.  ",1988
1419,1466,11,Mr. MICHEL.,"  I might say  to  the  gentleman  from Arkansas  that  of  course the very thing we were talking  about puts  the amendments of  the  gentleman from Illinois [Mr. DuRBIN]  if it were to be one amendment, out of  its normal order in sequence. I think it  is a reasonable request that the gentle man  from  Illinois  [Mr.  DuRBIN]  makes,  and  if  the objection  is  to  having them considered en bloc, frank ly the gentleman's rights would be cer tainly preserved on all  three  if he  If  wished or intended to exercise those  rights. But simply that would be the  first order of business tomorrow, as I  understand it; is that not correct?  ",1988

Mr. Speaker, I might also make the  observation that if we are to consider  those  suspensions  that were  rolled  over with respect  to requested  roll calls,  it  is my understanding  that  there are no real reasons this evening  to  insist on  rollcall votes on  those  which were requested yesterday.

1427,1466,11,Mr. MICHEL.," The gentleman from  Illinois is certainly free to do that on  my time, if that will clarify.  ",1988
1428,1466,11,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, it is my  understanding that the able majority  leader may have the unanimous-con sent request prepared to offer.  ",1988

Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point  of order against the amendment, as I  stated, because it provides unauthor ized legislation on appropriations and,  therefore, violates clause 2 of  rule  XXI.  The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentle man  from Georgia  [Mr. GINGRICH]  wish to respond to the point of order?  ",1988
1437,1479,11,Mr. GINGRICH.," In all candor, Mr.  Chairman, I would say that my hunch  is that my good friend, the gentleman  from Miami, FL, has an exact under standing of the rule, and it is not in  order.  The CHAIRMAN  (Mr.  PANETTA).  The gentleman from Georgia concedes  the point of order. The Chair sustains  the point of order under clauses 2 and  6 of rule XXI.  ",1988
1438,1479,11,Mr. GINGRICH.," If I might say just  for one moment, with the indulgence  of  the Chair, Mr. Chairman,  I  do  simply want the REcoRD to show that  the committee which I believe will be  bringing the supplemental forward is  moving in the correct direction, that  in fact there was an opportunity to night  to accept  the money  tonight,  and that the gentleman did move a  point of order against it.  ",1988
1439,1479,11,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, this should not be a  partisan issue.  I want to say to the gentleman that  it has been the administration, OMB,  and the Congress that have cut the  Coast Guard.  Speaking  to  the point of order,  I  would like to respond to the comments  made, and  this  is something that I  think we all need to bear the burden  of, and that is that we are not funding  the Coast Guard properly and there is  plenty of blame to go around for ev erybody, including the OMB and the  Congress of the United States, because  while we have spoken to the defense  needs of  the Nation over  the  last  number of years and for several years  had significant increases, there were  no increases in the Coast Guard.  Mr. Chairman, just to say briefly, we  all ought to get together and fund the  Coast Guard. There is going to be an  amendment later on to try to restore  some funding to open rescue stations,  and I am all for that, but we are going  to have a real problem if we do not  work  together, and I sincerely hope  that we do.

1440,1479,11,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield to me just for a  moment?  ",1988
1441,1479,11,Mr. HUTTO., I yield to the gentle man from Georgia.  ,1988
1442,1479,11,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Chairman,  I  agree with the gentleman. I guess the  only reason we raised this point on our  side, after consulting with the Secre tary of Transportation, is that there  seems to be a consistent difficulty on  the part of Mr. Jackson and Governor  Dukakis in understanding that it was  not the Reagan administration which  cut the Coast Guard last year.  I just say that because if you look at  the record, despite phone calls,  tele grams, and letters, there does seem to  be this learning gap on the part of the  Democratic nominee for President in  understanding exactly how the system  works in Washington, and where the  spending was cut, so  that the only  reason we are raising it is that it has  been  rather consistently a partisan  issue on the part of Jackson and Du kakis, but I share the sentiments of  my  colleague,  the gentleman  from  Florida, of this being a partisan con cern.

1444,1505,11,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker,  even  the  Washington Post called  it a triumphant fare well.  There is no doubt that the President's last  economic summit with our allies reflected the  deep respect foreign leaders have for Ronald  Reagan. As well  they should, after seeing  America enjoy 8 years of peace and prosperi ty. More  recently, William Randolph Hearst,  Jr., editor in chief, has given us what I think  should be the definitive word on Ronald Rea gan's 8 years.  It is my pleasure to enter this  editorial in today's RECORD.  16281  The editorial reminds us that President Rea gan's ""advocacy of freer trade, tax cuts, and  deregulation was recognized as having helped  sustain global economic growth."" His firmness  in standing up  to  the Nuclear Freezniks  in  1983 is the reason, and the only reason, for  the  recent historic arms reduction  talks with  the Soviets.  Mr. Speaker, the election-year drums must  subside eventually, and when  they do,  the  American people will have  the peace and  quiet needed  to  reflect on  the accomplish ments of a great American President. And  when  they do,  this editorial will have proved  itself as prophetic indeed.  The editorial follows:  [From the Albany <N.Y.) Times Union, June  26, 1988]  A WELL-DESERVED TRIBUTE TO REAGAN'S  ACHIEVEMENTS  <By William Randolph Hearst, Jr.)  Last week was a wonderful week for Presi dent Reagan and a particularly encouraging  one for the peace and prosperity our coun try as a whole has enjoyed under his much  maligned policies.  At  the Toronto economic  summit,  the  leaders of the six other major free world na tions paid a glowing tribute to the Presi dent's economic and foreign policy achieve ments.  The praise of his foreign partners proved  how wrong were those partisan politicians  and liberal media pundits who claimed his  presidency was a disaster, who predicted his  economic recovery program would fail and  that he would never succeed in getting a nu clear arins reduction agreement with the  Soviets.  In what the Washington Post described as  a  ""triumphant  farewell,""  the President's  economic policies were credited with ena bling the seven major industrialized coun tries to pilot the global economy to a safe  landing  after  the October,  1987,  stock  market crash. His advocacy of freer trade,  tax cuts and deregulation was recognized as  having  helped  sustain  global  economic  growth.  A joint statement congratulated the Presi dent on what he has already accomplished  in his relations with Soviet leader Gorba chev, including the treaty to eliminate mid range nuclear weapons, pursue negotiations  for a 50 percent reduction in strategic mis siles, carry his crusade for human rights to  the heart of the Soviet empire, and general ly bring about the greatest improvement in  Soviet-Allied  relations  since  the  end of  World War II.  British Prime Minister Margaret Thatch er praised the President for playing ""such  an important part"" in the economic success  of the world economy in the 1980s.  Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Take shita said what the President had achieved  in the summit meetings during his presiden cy was ""historic.""  Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,  who hosted the Toronto summit, lauded the  President for his ""warmth and wisdom,""  and said ""his leadership has been strong, his  accomplishments most substantial and his  place in history secure.""  Few presidents in our peacetime history  have received such praise from other world  leaders.  It is ironic that recognition of our Presi dent's successful  leadership is  far greater  among foreigners than among many of our  own  people who  have  apparently  been  ",1988
1445,1518,11,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Speaker, on May 20 a  tragic shooting of children and staff took place  at the Hubbard Woods School in the suburban  Chicago community of Winnetka. The Evans ton Hospital, which  is  in my district,  treated  four of  the shooting victims and  I am very  pleased to  insert in  the RECORD a very fine  letter  that Mr. George Fisher,  the  father of  one of the children, sent to Evanston Hospital.  ",1988
1446,1518,11,Mr. BERNARD LA.,"cHNER,  President, Evanston Hospital Corp., Evans ton, nz.  DEAR MR. LA.CHNER: This letter is to com mend your hospital for the excellent work  which enabled my daughter, Lindsay Fisher,  to  live after being shot at  the Hubbard  Woods School on May 20.  Upon  learning of  the shooting at  the  school, the Evanston Hospital notified their  crisis team of the pending arrival of the in jured. Dr. John C. Alexander was relieved  during the course of another operation to  attend to these children. Early assessment  of Lindsay's condition resulted in the selec tion of Dr. Alexander as the cardiovascular  specialist and of Dr. Stephen Sener as the  abdomen specialist.  The extent of Lindsay's bullet wound cre ated massive bleeding from multiple areas.  The blood veins in an eight year old are  very small and for Lindsay, were providing  inadequate blood transfusions. An unusual  procedure of transfusing the much needed  blood directly to Lindsay's heart, while a  major artery was being repaired, saved my  daughter's life. Lindsay proceeded to under go two more operations within 18 hours of  the first operation. These were to perform  additional closing of the wound to stop in ternal bleeding.  Dr. Joseph R. Hageman capably directed  the post-operative care. During the first five  days the Intensive Care Unit watched over  my child day and night. It was not uncom mon to see a desk pulled up to Lindsay's  door where nurses could do daily paperwork  and still maintain their vigil. The nurses on  the Pediatric floor eased her pain and made  Lindsay's hospital recovery quicker.  As a bystander thrust into a tragic situa tion, my emotional stress was severe. How ever, the medical staff's support of Lindsay  and the knowledge of their dedication to my  daughter gave me peace of mind. On many  occasions I had very emotional discussions  with doctors who provided us with colnfort  during difficult times.  It is  impossible  to overlook any of the  staff at Evanston Hospital: they all contrib uted  to Lindsay's recovery, especially  the  three doctors mentioned. Lindsay  is alive  today because of the grace of God, the pray ers of  thousands of  supporters and  the  expert staff at the Evanston Hospital. Their  actions to help my daughter will forever be  my example of excellence.  Sincerely,  GEORGE C. FISHER.  UNITED STATES AID TO  GUATEMALA  HON. DON EDWARDS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 1988  ",1988
1447,1518,11,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  policymakers  in  the United States have  for  years been trying to determine the proper role  our Government should play  in  promoting  peace and democracy throughout the world.  Should we give foreign aid? If so, what type of  aid and how can it be most effectively chan neled? Clearly,  there  is no simple  formula;  every  troubled nation has unique domestic  and  foreign characteristics  that define how  they can best be guided down  the  road  to  popular democracy.  A case in point is Guatemala, which recent ly asked our Government for renewed military  aid. This deserves careful consideration: The  Guatemalan military  is guilty of a variety of  human rights abuses, having all but silenced  voices of opposition throughout their country.  The military, on the other hand, maintains that  the United States assistance  is needed  to  strengthen the weak civilian government that  it defends. The United States must  now  devise a plan that will direct aid to the most  democratic purposes.  I would like to share with my colleagues a  provocative article on  this  topic written by  Caleb Rossiter and Bonnie T enneriello,  two  Washington experts on Latin America, that ap peared  in  the Christian Science Monitor on  June 9, 1988.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, June  9, 1988]  CAN U.S. MILITARY AID REALLY HELP A  CIVILIAN PRESIDENT?  <By Caleb Rossiter and Bonnie Tenneriello)  Guatemala's minister of defense, Gen.  Hector Gramajo, came to Capitol Hill re cently to lobby for renewed military aid. His  paradoxical argument was that such aid will  bolster  the country's fragile new civilian  government. The implicit message was that  Army hard-liners must be given the aid as  an  incentive  to continue  letting civilians  hold office. The same argument brought  the Army $7 million last year. Yet that aid  failed to placate undemocratic elements in  the military who recently launched an un successful uprising.  In looking at this year's request, Congress  must decide whether the aid really benefits  the civilian side of Guatemala's delicate po litical balance. This decision will have im portant  implications  for United  States  policy  toward Latin America as a whole.  Guatemala is a prime example of a regional  trend that is confounding policymakers: the  emergence of countries in which the mili tary has turned over office, but little real  power, to elected civilians.  Members eager  to support Guatemala's  transition to democracy listened carefully to  General Gramajo's request. Even  liberals  are considering supporting it, despite ongo ing abuses of human rights by the Army.  Not long ago, such a reception for the gen eral would have been unthinkable. Guate mala was perhaps the most brutal of Latin  America's military dictatorships.  Faced with a rural revolt in the mid-1970s,  the Guatemalan Army responded to Mao  Tse-tung's dictum  that  guerrillas move  through the civilian population like fish in  the sea by essentially draining the sea. The  Army killed tens of thousands of Guatema lans, erasing 440  Indian villages from the  map. Gramajo  held  important military  posts during the period. US arms aid was  banned.  What, then, has changed, Certainly not  the Army's respect for human rights. The  Army's rural massacres of the early 1980s  no longer occur, largely because the guerril la threat has been reduced to an ""annoy ance"" of fewer than 700  rebel troops, ac cording to Gramajo. Yet Amnesty Interna tional and others report numerous recent  ",1988
1448,14,17,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  delighted with the Senate's approval  yesterday of the conference agreement  on military  construction  appropria tions for fiscal year 1989.  I am especially pleased that the con ferees  have  seen  fit  to  include  $2,060,000 for new construction on the  Navy Justice School Legal Training  Building in Newport, RI.  The Naval  Justice School  is  the  Navy's only legal training institution.  Since  it was  founded  in 1946,  the  school has trained thousands of De partment of Defense personnel in mili tary, civil, and administrative law and  procedure, in 14 different courses of  study.  In 1987  alone,  1,672  students  re ceived  training at the Naval Justice  School.  Despite this essential role, its com manding officer states that its physi cal plant is ""inadequate to meet cur rent mission requirements."" The exist ing facility cannot accommodate nec essary curriculum expansion and spe cialized  training programs, many of  which are congressionally mandated.  Because of  the  lack of classroom  space, a number of important courses  and seminars this year have been held  away from the Naval Justice School  facility  in  inconvenient  and  inad equate spaces.  The need for improvements became  even more acute in late July when the  Navy announced that the Naval Inves tigative Service CNISJ Northeast Re gional Office was slated to relocate to  Newport to a building adjacent to the  Naval Justice School. Although  the  two commands are separate entities,  the counterintelligence mission of NIS  clearly complements  the educational  role of the Naval Justice School. Now  that the two will be neighbors, I an ticipate  the Navy will  exploit  this  partnership and that programs at the  Naval Justice School will be enhanced  and expanded as a result.  I commend my colleagues  for  the  foresight and understanding of  the  Naval Justice School's role they have  demonstrated in retaining this impor tant funding.  PATRICK KENNEDY'S ELECTION  TO STATE HOUSE OF REPRE SENTATIVES IN RHODE ISLAND  ",1988
1449,14,17,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, in the  fall of 1982, John Fitzgerald was elect ed to  the State Senate in the Com monwealth  of Massachusetts  and  became one of the youngest senators  on Beacon Hill. He was 29 years old.  When he took his oath of office in  the  beautiful  capitol  building  in  Boston, he also planted in America the  political seedling that would produce  mighty oaks and whose name would  become known and respected in every  corner of  the globe-in palaces and  mansions and  in huts and  tents  in  lands some think God has forgotten.  We know, of course, Mr. President,  that three of John Fitzgerald's grand children  followed  his  later  trek  to  Washington and became Members of  the Congress. One grandson went to  the House of Representatives like Mr.  Fitzgerald  himself  did  and  then  became  a Member  of  this  august  Chamber and, of course,  rose  to re ceive the greatest gift in the people's  treasury, the Presidency of the United  States. Two other grandsons of John  Fitzgerald came  to  the U.S. Senate  and one today serves with unexcelled  distinction as the senior senator of the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  One  of  John  Fitzgerald's  great grandchildren now serves in the U.S.  Congress  from  the Eighth Congres sional District of Massachusetts.  So, Mr. President, we well know that  the Fitzgerald legacy to public service  in and for the Commonwealth of Mas sachusetts has been and is ably guard ed and carried on by his progeny in  that great State.  But, Mr. President,  I wish  to call  special attention that something his toric occurred yesterday that even fur ther extends that legacy  to another  one of the colonial states of the Amer ican union.  Yesterday, Mr. President, Mr. Pat rick Kennedy, age 21, was elected to  the State House of Representatives of  Rhode Island for the Ninth District.  Patrick, 8 years younger  than his  great grandfather was when he was  elected  to his first office,  the State  legislature,  goes  to  his  new  home  State's legislature as a junior at Provi dence College.  While  the complete  record  is not  available  to me, Mr. President, con cerning the political lives of the Fitz geralds and the Kennedys during their  years  in the Emerald Isle,  I believe  that I can say with complete accuracy  that he  is  the  first of  that distin guished family to be elected from a ju risdiction other  than  the Common wealth of Massachusetts or the State  of New York.  While I cannot predict the future,  Mr. President, I believe that I can say  with absolute certainty that Mr. Pat rick Kennedy will have a great and rewarding political career in the Ocean  State where I trust he will serve long  years and acquit himself in the tradi tion of  that most  esteemed  family  from whence he springs.  Mr. President, I send warmest con gratulations and best wishes  to Mr.  Patrick Kennedy on his election yes terday  as  Rhode  Island's  newest  member of the legislature and I also  congratulate his father, our colleague,  Senator TED KENNEDY.  AT  LAST,  SOME  ACCURACY  ABOUT  THE  ECONOMY  AND  JOBS  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  a  column by Robert J. Samuelson in yes terday's Washington Post  addresses  ""the fictitious issue of the 'jobf; gap.' ""  I commend  this article to my col leagues because, frankly, it says what I  have been saying for a long time: That  our economy is in good shape, and the  millions and millions of new jobs cre ated by the American economy in the  decade of the 1980's are good jobs.  ""Most <of these jobs) are said to be  low paying. Middle-class living stand ards are said to be stagnating. All this  is largely untrue, despite the political  rhetoric,"" Mr. Samuelson writes.  He goes on  to note that ""average  hourly pay has risen 8 percent since  1980,"" and that ""living standards for  most Americans haven't stagnated.'' In  fact, they are improving and continue  to improve.  A key point in the article is a chart  showing the ""increasing incomes"" of  this decade. For example,  the chart  shows  that median  family  income after  inflation-rose  a  mere  $116  during the entire decade of the 1970's,  while it has increased a dramatic $857  during the first 7 years of the 1980's.  The  article  also  notes  a  decline  among those in the $20,000 to $50,000  income, a decline that some contend is  a  sign we are slipping  into poverty.  Nonsense. Just the opposite  is  true.  The reason that fewer families have  incomes in the $20,000-to-$50,000 cate gory is that more and more American  families are earning more than $50,000  a  year, again after  inflation  is dis counted.  In fact,  the number of families  in  this high-income category has risen 31  percent since 1980. How is that possi ble if all we are producing are pizza-de livery jobs?  The article goes on to discuss  the  annual  productivity  gains  of  the  1980's. While  these gains are below  those in the period immediately after  World War II, productivity is up 1.2  percent a  year  in  the 1980's. ""The  good news is that this is about double  the rate of the late 1970's,"" Mr. Sam uelson writes. How does  that fit  in  with the myth we're hearing from cer tain experts?  ",1988

1457,53,17,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Under  the previous order, the time between  now and 4:30 is evenly divided.  Who yields time?  ",1988
1458,53,17,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, once  again I am obliged to counter my dis tinguished  colleague  from Oregon's  lectures on free enterprise. That old  doctrine  of  comparative  advantage,  which used to mean climate and loca tion  and  natural  resources,  today  means Government. The name of the  game  is Government-supported  and  Government-orchestrated  trade.  It  would be nice to ignore this new reali ty but we cannot.  We indulge in reveries about free en terprise and free markets, and keeping  Government out of the market, and  then we turn around and take up bills  with  respect  to minimum wage and  with  respect  to parental  leave. Add  those on top of unemployment insurance, Social Security, clean air, clean  water, safe workplace, plant closings  notification, and on down the list. We  are proud  in  this country-Republi cans  and Democrats-of  our  high  standard of living. But, please, my gra cious, do not holler ""protectionism;  protectionism"" when we try to protect  the standard of living that Congress  has legislated.  And, of course, the issue boils down  here to the continuation of a vital in dustry.  I never heard of a Senator  coming and guaranteeing  to  foreign  importers the majority of our market.  Yet we guarantee under  this meas ure-there are no rollbacks-we guar antee to importers the majority of the  U.S. textile business and furthermore  say, ""Look, as domestic consumption  increases,  your  share will  increase  automatically."" You cannot be more  generous than that.  But I have to say in the same breath  that it is not generosity. It is necessity.  It is a last resort. If we do not do this,  we go the way of a long list of other  U.S. industries that have been totally  destroyed by imports.  I  told the story of how I brought  Elgin Watch to South Carolina. We  brought them from Elgin, IL, and re named  the  town  in South Carolina  from Blainey to Elgin, SC. But today  they are gone; gone overseas. They do  not make Elgin watches  in America  anymore.  And I could cite  instance after in stance of industry migrating from New  England  to  the South  to Asia. And  there is not any miracle up in Massa chusetts, I hate to report. Those Mas sachusetts industries are now leapfrog ging  the  South  and  going  right  straight into Mexico under the maqui ladora  system. Why? Because  the  Mexican Government is on their side.  Now,  there  is  a  big political  cry  around here today of ""Let's get Gov ernment off our backs."" I agree with  that. Let us get Government on our  side. Let us talk about that with re spect to  trade, because our competi tors have government on their side.  Government provides the capital. Gov ernment gives the incentives to save.  It is not a matter of morality.  In  Japan, it costs you if you do not save.  In this country, it costs you if you do  save. This is the credit-card economy  that seeped its way from Government  into  the private sector. And we are  going to wake up someday. I am trying  to wake people up with respect to the  textile industry.  In Asia,  the Government allocates  the capital. It protects. It protect the  domestic market. It insists on buying  at home, whether it be  the govern ment in Korea or the government in  Taiwan or the government in Thailand  or the government in Indonesia. It is  governmental policy. Japan would not  let Mazda go broke when it overpro duced.  The  Japanese  Government  came in and bailed Mazda out. They  would be embarrassed to do otherwise.  I can tell you right now it is strictly  a business matter, and we better sober  up. And since it is a business matter, I  will have  to give  that formula one  more  time, because most of my col leagues  just cannot  read a balance  sheet:  If you  double  your market  share, you reduce the cost of produc tion 20 to 30 percent. So the name of  the game  to conquer market share,  whateven the cost. If you have  the  Government  behind  you  financing,  protecting, licensing, subsidizing, and  bailing you out  if you overextend,  then there is no risk. The Government  removes that risk.  And what happens is, for instance, if  corporation A has 50 percent of the  market and its share is increasing 10  percent each year, that sounds good.  If you are going to invest in that stock  on Wall Street, they say, ""Man, it's  got half the market and their share is  10 percent more each year.""  However,  if  corporation B, which  has only 20 percent of that market, is  doubling,  if  it  is getting 40 percent  growth, then I can tell you that if the  market is growing at,  let us say, 30  percent, corporation A is headed for  bankruptcy. Corporation B will soon  dominate because  it will  reduce  its  cost, it will reduce its overhead, it will  put its rivals out business.  Incidentally, I was told in the debate  earlier that the Japanese have gotten  out of textiles. Wrong. They are into  textiles with their capital. They take  that money and invest it in Indonesia  and  right  across Asia. The United  States is the market for 50 percent of  Pacific Rim production. They dump it  right into the United States. In Indo nesia, the Japanese do all the financ ing and own the mills, but they take  less than 2 percent of Indonesian tex tiles  into Japan. Japan still protects  that domestic market. They use their  financial leverage and move on to take  over  another  country. They  know  where they are headed. They are cal culating. They are moving ahead and  this is a competition.  And so  this is not a case of some  southern Senators coming bellyaching  on account of  the  textile  industry.  Look at the national nature of this  great  issue.  All  segments,  North,  South, East, West, the cotton farmer,  the woolen  farmer, now  the wheat  farmer in Nebraska, the corn farmer,  industries in the urban areas, industry  and labor, everyone is now joined to gether to back this bill.  We  saw what happened with  the  footwear industry. They went from 50  percent imports in 1982 to 84 percent  today. They won  two  injury  cases  before  the  ITC, but politically with  that free market nonsense, they were  overruled at the White House and as a  result, 84 percent of the shoes on this  ",1988
1459,66,17,Mr. KENNEDY., Does  the Senator  want to yield on that point?  ,1988
1460,66,17,Mr. HATCH.," I would rather finish  my speech, but I would be happy if  the Senator wants me to.  ",1988
1461,66,17,Mr. KENNEDY.," The Senator  just  brought up a couple of books that are  7 inches of editorials against the mini mum wage. But I think you can take a  one-page piece of paper and make the  case  for  it, and 80 percent of  the  American people favor that increase as  well.  I know that the working poor do not  have all the access to the chamber of  commerce mimeograph machines. But  I hope no one would be dissuaded by  the point of 7 inches of editorials that  are basically put out by the chamber  of commerce.  ",1988
1462,66,17,Mr. HATCH.," Let me just say this in  response. I think it is quite cynical to  think that the newspapers of America  are going to be writing editorials be cause the chamber of commerce wants  them to. In fact, they are probably the  least  persuasive with  the  editorial  writers in this country of any group, in  many respects.  I have not seen many editorial writ ers in this country write many free en terprise editorials  that would please  the chamber of commerce.  These are editorials by the free press  of this country. My point is this has  never happened before.  The only reason that a good percent age of Americans  favor  increases  in  the minimum wage  is because  they  really have not focused, they are start ing to focus, and that is one reason it  has taken over 2 years to get this mini mum wage bill to the floor. And, it is  only during a political year, at the  height of a political season, at the end  of a political Congress, doing pure pol itics on the floor that they have the  audacity  to bring it up now, hoping  they can slip it through.  ",1988
1463,66,17,Mr. KENNEDY., Does  the Senator  want to yield on that point?  ,1988
1464,66,17,Mr. HATCH., Sure.  ,1988
1465,66,17,Mr. KENNEDY.,"  I notice  that the  Vice President or the Presidential can didate for the Republicans has just an nounced that he is for some increase  in the minimum wage, and I am sure  that the Senator is not suggesting that  that  had  any  political motivation  when we have the repeated record of  this administration over the period of  the last 7 years-I will take the time to  put it in the RECORD-unalterably op posed to it.  I am wondering if the Senator would  object to my including in the RECORD,  after the inclusion of the 7 inches of  editorials, 2 pages of the most recent  Gallup poll that indicate what the po sition of the American people is.  ",1988
1466,66,17,Mr. HATCH.," I am not including the  editorials in the RECORD, but I would  be happy to have that go in at the end  of my remarks, or at the end of the re marks of the Senator from Massachu setts would be better.  ",1988

1468,66,17,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  <See Kennedy exhibit 1.)  EXHIBIT 1  PROPOSAL TO BOOST MINIMUM WAGE HAS  OVERWHELMING PuBLIC SUPPORT  <By George Gallup, Jr. and Alec Gallup}  PRINCETON, NJ.-A proposal to raise the  national minimum wage by 50% over the  next four years has overwhelming public  support.  In the latest Gallup Poll, 76% favor and  20% oppose provisions of a bill approved by  the House Labor Committee in March that  would  gradually  increase  the minimum  wage  from  the present $3.35 an hour  to  $5.05 in 1992.  Large majorities in all population groups  favor the proposal with approval outweigh ing disapproval by better than 4-to-1 among  Democrats, blacks, women, young adults,  those who did not attend college, and East erners.  The proposed legislation would boost the  hourly minimum in four annual increments,  to $3.85 next year, $4.25  in 1990, $4.65  in  1991 and $5.05 in 1992. Thereafter, the mini mum wage would be adjusted yearly in line  with the average national wage.  EARLY SUPPORT FOR MINIMUM WAGE  A 1937 Gallup Poll found 3-to-2 support  for a national minimum wage  law, which  was enacted the following year. Polls con ducted periodically since  then also  found  heavy public backing for increasing the min imum.  The 1938 statute set the minimum wage  for most adult non-farm workers at 25 cents  an hour. The minimum rose to 40 cents in  1945, 75 cents in 1950, and $1.00  in 1956.  Subsequent increases brought it to $2.00 in  1974 and to its present level of $3.35 in 1981.  ",1988
1469,144,17,Mr. REID.," Mr. President,  I would  like to pose a question to the chairman  of  the  committee  concerning  the  effect of S. 555 on the Johnson Act, a  Federal statute codified at 15 U.S.C.  1171 which, among other things, pro hibits the use of gambling devices on  Federal lands and Indian lands. As the  chairman  is well aware,  this statute  was enacted by Congress in 1950 and  amended in 1962 as part of an effort to  control  organized  crime  and  other  criminal activity associated with gam bling  devices.  The  circmustances  which led Congress to adopt the John son Act are no less compelling today  than they were in 1950 or in 1962.  One of the significant provisions of  the bill we are considering  today  is  that it would waive the application of  the Johnson Act for tribes who have  negotiated compacts with a State for  the operation of gaming devices as  part of class  III gaming operations.  Would  the chairman please confirm  this Senator's understanding that the  limited waiver is the only respect in  which S. 555 would modify the scope  and effect of the Johnson Act?  ",1988
1470,144,17,Mr.  INOUYE.," Yes,  the Senator  is  correct. The bill as reported by the  committee would not alter the effect  of the Johnson Act except to provide  for a waiver of its application in the  case of gambling devices operated pur suant to a compact with the State in  which the tribe is located. The bill is  not intended to amend or otherwise  alter the Johnson Act in any way.  ",1988
1471,144,17,Mr. REID.," Mr. President,  I would  like to engage the chairman in a collo quy  regarding  the meaning of  the  ""grandfather clause"" provided in the  bill which permits the continued oper ation of certain ""banking"" card games  in operation as of May l, 1988. Specifi cally, this provision would permit the  continued  operation,  as  class  II  gaming  activities,  of  certain games  played in the States of Washington,  North Dakota, South Dakota,  and  Michigan which ordinarily would fall  within  the  definition  of  class  III  gaming.  It has been  this Senator's under standing that this provision was adopt ed to protect tribes with existing in vestments in such games from hard ships associated with changes in the  law brought about by this legislation.  This Senator also understands  that  the  committee  intended  that  the  grandfather clause should not serve as  the basis  for expansion of existing  gaming operations  to new  locations  not in operation as of May 1, 1988.  Would the chairman confirm that this  provision does not provide authority  for the establishment of new banking  card game operations or the institu tion of new games  in existing oper ations?  ",1988
1472,144,17,Mr.  INOUYE.," The Senator is cor rect. The grandfather clause is intend ed merely to protect tribes with exist ing operations from hardship due to  this change in the law. While the bill  may permit the expansion of particu lar operations which were in existence  as of May 1, 1988, for example, by the  addition of gaming tables or seats in  an existing establishment, it does not  authorize the expansion of such oper ations to new locations, the establish ment of new operations, or the institu tion of new games at existing oper ations. In other words, both the gam bling operation  and  the  particular  games played in that operation must  have been in place on or before May 1,  1988, in order to have the benefit of  this provision.  ",1988
1473,144,17,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. President, there are  several points concerning the Indian  Gaming Regulatory Act  that should  be highlighted.  As we are all aware, many Indian  tribes are opposing S. 555 at least in  part because of the potential of ex tending State jurisdiction over Indian  lands for certain gaming activities. I  wish to make it very clear that the  committee has only provided  for  a  mechanism to permit the transfer of  limited State jurisdiction over Indian  lands where an Indian tribe requests  such a  transfer as part of a  tribal State gaming compact  for class  III  gaming. We intend that the two sover eigns-the tribes and the States-will  sit down together in negotiations on  equal terms and come up with a rec ommended methodology  for  regulat ing class III gaming on Indian lands.  Permitting the States even this limit ed say in matters that are usually in  the exclusive domain of tribal govern ment has been permitted only with ex treme reluctance. As discussed in the  committee  report,  gambling  is  a  unique situation and our limited intru sion on the right of tribal self-govern ance in this area has no implications  for any other area of tribal self-gov ernance or State-tribal relations.  I wish to also make clear that when  a  tribe and a State negotiate a com pact, there need be no imposition of  State  jurisdiction whatsoever.  Lan guage in the report, such as ""the ex tension of State jurisdiction and the  application of State laws"" and ""relin quishment of rights"" must be read in  their full context of a compact where  a tribe requests and consents to such  extension or relinquishment. We are  aware that the Fort Mohave Tribe and  the State of Nevada have negotiated a  potential compact where the tribe has  chosen to be subject to Nevada's ex tensive  regulatory  system  in  the  Nevada portion of its reservation for  its proposed  casino operation. This  compact is probably unique to its own  set of facts and should not be viewed  as a prototype. As the report makes  clear compacts should not be used as  subterfuge for the imposition of State  jurisdiction on tribes.  As noted earlier a compact should be  a negotiation between two sovereigns.  It is entirely conceivable that a par ticular State will have no interest in  operating any part of the regulatory  system needed for a class III Indian  gaming activity, and there will be no  jurisdictional  transfer  recommended  by the particular tribe and State. Each  compact will need to consider, among  other items, the experience and exper tise of the particular tribe and State  with gaming, and the existence of reg ulatory mechanisms within each gov ernment. Congress  should expect  a  reasoned  and  rational  approach  to  these  compacts,  and not  simply  a  demand  that  tribes  come  under  a  State system.  ",1988
1474,144,17,Mr. INOUYE.," The compacts are not  intended to impose de facto State reg ulation. Rather, the idea is to create a  consensual  agreement  between  the  two sovereign governments and it is up  to  those entities  to determine what  provisions will be  in  the compacts.  Page 65  of  the bill  references  the  types of provisions that may go into  compacts. These provisions are not re quirements. Some  tribes can assume  more responsibility than others and it  is entirely conceivable  that a State  may want to defer to a tribal regula tory authority and maintain only an  oversight role.  I do want to publicly state that I  hope the States will be fair and re spectful of the authority of the tribes  in negotiating these compacts and not  take unnecessary advantage of the re quirement for a compact.

1475,144,17,Mr. EV ANS.," On  the question of  precedent, am I correct that the use of  compacting methods  in this bill are  meant  to be  limited  to  tribal-State  gaming compacts and that the use of  compacts for this purpose is not to be  construed to signal any new congres sional policy encouraging the subjuga tion of tribal governments to State au thority.  ",1988
1476,144,17,Mr. INOUYE.," The vice chairman is  correct. No  subjugation  is  intended.  The bill contemplates  that the  two  sovereigns  address  their  respective  concerns in the most equitable fash ion. There is no intent on the part of  Congress that the compacting method ology be used in such areas such as  taxation, water rights, environmental  regulation, and land use.

The text of the amendment is as fol lows:  Amendment offered by Mr. OXLEY: Page  205, after the matter following line 4, insert  the following:  Subtitle M-Drug Czar  SEC. 6801. Amendment to the National Narcotics Act of  1984.  Section 1303 of the National Narcotics Act  of 1984 <21 U.S.C. 1202> is amended by strik ing out the second sentence and inserting in  lieu thereof the following: ""There shall be  at the head of the Board a chairman who  shall be selected by the President and who  after being selected by the President shall  occupy a cabinet level position within the  executive branch.""  The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the  rule,  the gentleman from Ohio CMr.  OXLEY] will be recognized for 15 min utes and a Member in opposition will  be recognized for 15 minutes.  ",1988
1484,170,17,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition  to  the Oxley amend ment.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from New Jersey [Mr. HUGHES] will be  recognized for 15 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. OXLEY].  ",1988
1485,170,17,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this committee has  done a superb job in making a good  bill even better by adopting amend ments to the bill, including the death  penalty,  including  the user account ability section, that was put forth by  the  gentleman  from  Florida  CMr.  McCoLLUM] and the gentleman from  New Jersey CMr. HUGHES],  the exclu sionary rule exemption sponsored by  the gentleman from California CMr.  LUNGREN] and the civil funds section  propounded by our friend, the gentle man from Florida [Mr. SHAW].  This amendment that I seek to off er  is the so-called drug czar amendment:  that is the creation of a Cabinet-level  individual appointed by the President,  responsible and reporting to the Presi dent on the entire area of drugs, both  on the supply side and the demand  side.  This amendment would remove the  existing requirement that the Attor ney General be the chairman of the  National Drug Enforcement  Policy  Board. That would be eliminated and  the President would be given the flexito  bility  to choose  the best person  direct the war on drugs.  This would allow  the President  to  appoint a full-time drug czar, someone  who has nothing else on his plate but  enforcing the drug laws and making  certain  that  the other  side of  the  equation, the demand side, is also ad dressed.  The drug czar would be a Cabinet level official.  The National Drug Policy Board as sumed the responsibilities of the Na tional Drug Enforcement Policy Board  in March 1987, and while they admit tedly had a slow start, they have now  produced, I think, an effective strate gy to combat the drug problem. This  Board needs time to work.  Another drug czar  amendment  is  going to be offered later that would  tear down a structure that is now al ready existing.  I think my amendment speaks more  directly  to the opportunity to have,  first, a Cabinet-level drug czar; second,  reporting directly  to  the President;  and third, one who has nothing else in  his responsibilities except fighting the  war on drugs.  Indeed, Mr. Chairman, if we are in a  war on drugs, if we really are serious  about fighting a war on drugs, the real  question is do we want to have a gen eral directing that war on drugs or do  we want to have a corporal?  I suggest that my amendment is the  only amendment available that would  indeed create that general and create  the kind of person to deal with the  entire drug problem.  Our committee, the Select Commit tee on Narcotics, has talked long and  hard about creating a drug czar, and  while the Attorney General is an ap propriate  individual,  it seems  to me  that he has other responsibilities  in  his  job. He has  to enforce the civil  rights laws. He has to enforce the anti trust laws and many, many others.  We want someone who is directly re sponsible so that when our committee  goes  to whatever administration suc ceeds the Reagan administration, we  can say to that individual, ""here are  our concerns,"" and know  that he  is  speaking for and about the drug issue  and the drug issue alone.  I do not think it is time, Mr. Chair man, for this House, and indeed this  Congress,  to micromanage  the way  that the executive branch deals with  enforcing the law. After all, the execu tive branch  enforces  the  laws. We  write the laws, and I think we have to  give him every opportunity to enforce  them. The President certainly needs  the kind of flexibility  to choose the  best  person  to  coordinate  strategy  against drug abuse.  I  think  this amendment offers us  that chance.  Mr. Chairman, as I indicated before,  we have made much progress on this  bill. We have adopted some amendments that make this a much more ef fective drug fighting tool. This amend ment would be another piece of that  puzzle to get at the war on drugs, and  for that I ask your support.  ",1988
1486,170,17,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1988
1487,170,17,Mr. OXLEY.," I am glad to yield to  my friend,  the gentleman from New  York.  ",1988
1488,170,17,Mr.  GILMAN.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentlemen from Ohio CMr.  OXLEY] for yielding to me, and I want  to commend him  for his efforts  in  doing battle in our war against narcot ics.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise  in support of the Oxley amendment to  the omnibus drug bill which would  amend the National Narcotics Act of  1984 to permit the President to select  the Chairman of the National Narcot ics Enforcement Policy Board, which  under current law, must be the Attor ney General. The President's selectee  would occupy a Cabinet-level position  within the executive branch.  This amendment would create a real  drug czar who would be in charge of  our antidrug effort on both the supply  and demand sides. It is essential that  there be one person with the mission  of leading our war on drugs. The nar cotics  issue  is an extremely complex  one, with  jurisdiction  spread  over  many agencies and departments. The  only way to ensure effective coordina tion  and  a  comprehensive national  antidrug strategy is to have one highly  visible, well  respected, Cabinet-level  person, who would report directly to  the President and who would be re sponsible for all aspects of  the war  against drugs.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Oxley  amendment.  It provides  the  best mechanism to guarantee that our  struggle against drugs is appropriately  led by an individual of the President's  choosing.  D 1245  ",1988

1491,183,17,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong support of the Brady amend ment and in opposition to the Mccol lum amendment.  Mr. Chairman, in this election year, we hear  a lot of talk about ""getting tough on crime.""  Today, we have a chance to vote for one of  the most effective, clear-cut boosts to law en forcement offered this year in Congress: The  7-day waiting period for handgun purchases. It  is an  incredible irony that some of the most  vociferous proponents of crime control are ac tually asking us to vote against this straightfor ward measure.  The 7-day waiting period simply gives our  Nation's law officers time to carry out existing  laws.  It allows them  time  to make sure  that  those people aready prohibited  from owning  firearms are not obtaining  firearms. With  the  increasing gun-running and violent crime  in volved  in  the drug war,  the waiting period  is  especially vital for protecting innocent citizens  from the threat of criminal or deranged firearm  use. With this law, criminals and mentally de ranged individuals would no longer be able to  walk into a gun shop or up to the pawnshop  counter and spontaneously purchase a gun.  Unlike some of  the drug bill amendments  adopted in the last few days which make un constitutional changes  to  the  law,  the 7-day  waiting  period,  offers  an  intelligent,  legal  means of cracking down on crime. Mr. Chair man,  I urge  the  retention of  this essential  component of the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act  and the defeat of the McCollum amendment.  [Mr. FEIGHAN],  ",1988
1492,183,17,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  4 minutes to the distinguished gentle man  from Ohio  the  author of the amendment and a very  valued member of the Subcommittee  on Crime.   ",1988
1493,183,17,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the Mccollum amend ment.  Right now, we all know that the gun  trade  is  absolutely booming  in  this  country. According to testimony that  we  have  received  in  the  Judiciary  Committee,  drug  gangs  are  buying  weapons in one State and transporting  them to other States, and using them  in drug-related crimes.  For example, FBI agents in Texas  have told us that that State supplied  much of the gun power for a massive  heroin ring in New York; agents have  found Virginia-bought  guns  in  the  hands of Washington, DC, drug deal ers, where gun sales have been banned  since 1977; in my own State of Ohio,  we have uncovered an organized crime  conspiracy involving crack distribution  and gun running.  Congress can confront this drug-gun  control head on, or it can avoid the  issue. A vote for the McCollum amend ment is going to unquestionably take  away  a  police weapon  for catching  criminals before they commit crimes  with handguns.  The waiting period amendment that  is already in the bill, in the antidrug  bill, represents a reasonable, effective  and straightforward plan of attack. It  would simply require that any person  who wants  to purchase a  handgun  over the counter wait 7 days so that  local authorities have the opportunity  to check that applicant's background.  The wait would also provide a cooling off period for those who are consumed  by some violent passion or a drug-in duced  rage. Waiting periods  impor tantly have a proven track record at  the State and municipal level. Califor nia screened out more than 1,500 ineli gible gun applicants in 1986, and New  Jersey stops an average of more than  500 felons each year from purchasing  guns under  its  review  system. But  State waiting periods alone are not  going to be enough. Unless we have a  national waiting period,  determined  drug pushers will still be able to buy  handguns as easily as they can cross  State lines.  The McCollum amendment addition ally failed to address at all the grow ing drug-gun connection. It would only  apply to felons, so it would not help  gun  dealers  identify other persons  barred from gun ownership by Federal  law,  including  drug  addicts,  illegal  aliens, and those adjudicated mentally  incompetent. It would require finger printing which would make the cost  absolutely  prohibitive,  estimated  in  the morning's Washington Post, and  responsibly,  I  think,  somewhere be tween $250 and $500 million. It would  not be binding and would have to in troduce whatever recommendation the  Attorney General comes forward with.  The  biggest  problem  with  the  Mccollum amendment, we do not need  more studies on this issue, which  is  what  the Mccollum  amendment  is  trying  to  substitute. According  to  members of the law enforcement com munity,  the  implementation of  the  McCollum amendment is not only just  years  away,  but  light  years  away,  which is why I believe it lost on a vote  of 22 to 12 in the Committee on the  Judiciary.  The widespread support for the lan guage  in  the  bill  underscores  its  modest nature. The provision has been  championed by every major police or ganization in the country. The Presi dent has endorsed a waiting period.  The Attorney General has gone fur ther, supporting the concept of a wait ing period and a background check at  the national level. Even the NRA has  supported this, the National Rifle As sociation,  has  supported  a waiting  period. This is the NRA's own docu ment of a few years ago where they  say ""A waiting period could help in re ducing crimes of passion and in pre venting people with criminal records  or dangerous mental illnesses from ac quiring guns."" That is the position of  the NRA and was the position of the  NRA until a few years ago.  Mr. Chairman, the provision is based  on a single premise that we cannot win  the war on crime and drugs unless we  begin to disarm drug  traffickers. By  keeping the waiting period in the anti drug  legislation we will act  to end  senseless drug violence. We will also  help to save lives.  I would urge def eat of the McColl um  amendment.  ",1988

Mr. Chairman, I think that we agree  we want to get tough on criminals, and I  believe that the Mccollum amendment  actually is an improvement, unless there  is a mistake in what the language does  say, and that is the Attorney General  shall-and that does mandate that he  will-develop a system for immediate  and accurate  identification of felons  who attempt to purchase firearms. So as  the bill stands now, we are trying to sell  to the American people that this will  keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  I do not think that is true.  I  ",1988

1497,196,17,Mr.  FEIGHAN.,"  These letters are part of the legislative  history of the Brady amendment and  indicate  that  the amendment would  not apply to Tennessee.  My colleague, BOB CLEMENT had a  colloquy with Mr. FEIGHAN earlier in  the debate, and these letters support  the substance of that colloquy.  The letters follow:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, September 8, 1988.  Hon. JIM COOPER,  Cannon House Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR JIM:  I understand you have raised  concerns that the Brady Amendment in its  current form could require that the citizens  of Tennessee comply with the paperwork re quirements of both the Brady Amendments  and  the Tennessee 15-day waiting period  law.  It has always been my  intent that the  Brady Amendment not apply to any state  which has a waiting period of 7 days or  longer, or which requires a legitimate back ground  check. When  the  provision was  drafted, House Legislative Council  recom mended that we accomplish  this  through  the pre-emption provisions currently in the  Brady Amendment.  We now believe this can be more clearly  established by changing  the pre-emption  provision in the Brady Amendment to read  as follows:  ""This subsection does not apply with re spect to any transfer of a handgun which  occurs in a state that""(A) imposes a waiting period of at least 7  days before the transfer of a handgun; or  ""(B)  requires  that,  before  a  handgun  transfer is completed, a law enforcement of ficer shall determine that the transferee is  qualified under law to receive a handgun.""  Accordingly, I will work-either through a  technical correction or in Conference-to in clude  this  pre-emption  language  in  the  Brady Amendment. I also understand that  Senator Metzenbaum,  the sponsor of  the  companion measure  in  the Senate,  has  promised to include this language when he  offers the Brady Amendment to the Sen ate's anti-drug initiative.  Let me assure you that I do not want to  require Tennesseans to encounter any additional delay or paperwork as a result of the  Brady Amendment. Since Tennessee already  has a maximum 15-day waiting period and a  law enforcement officer must make a deter mination of eligibility prior to the sale, we  intend to ensure that Tennessee is exempt ed from the provisions of the Brady Amend ment.  Please let me know if I can be of any addi tional help.  Sincerely,  EDWARD F. FEIGHAN,  Member of Congress.  U.S. SENATE,  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,  Washington, DC, September 8, 1988.  Hon. JIM CooPER,  Cannon House Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR  JIM:  I understand  that you have  raised concerns that the Brady Amendment  in its current form could require that the  citizens of Tennessee comply with both the  Brady Amendment and with  the existing  Tennessee 15 day waiting period law, Sec tion 39-6-1704.  It has always been my  intent that  the  Brady Amendment not apply to any state  which has a waiting period of 7 days or  longer. When the  legislation was drafted,  Senate  legislative  counsel  recommended  that we accomplish this by amending the  pre-emption provisions of Section 927 of  Title 18.  We now believe this can be more clearly  established by instead inserting a provision  that will read as follows:  ""This subsection does not apply with re spect to any transfer of a handgun which  occurs in a state that"" <A> imposes a waiting period of at least 7  days before the transfer of a handgun; or  <B> requires that, before a handgun trans fer is completed, a law enforcement officer  shall determine that the transferee is quali fied under law to receive a handgun.""  Accordingly, when  I  offer  the Brady  Amendment  in  the Senate,  this  language  will be included.  I can assure you that neither I nor the  other supporters of this legislation want to  require any Tennessean to encounter any  additional delay or paper work as a result of  the Brady Amendment. Since Tennessee al ready has a maximum 15 day waiting period  and a law enforcement officer must make a  determination prior to the sale, we intend to  exempt Tennessee from the Brady Amend ment.  Please let me know if I can be of any addi tional assistance on this matter.  Sincerely,  HOWARD M. METZENBAUM,  U.S. Senator.  ",1988

1502,196,17,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Chairman, 6 years  ago  this winter a woman  from my  home  town, Pittsfield, MA, walked  into a  local gunshop and bought a  handgun.  She left the shop, bundled up her 9year-old son and her 5-year-old daugh ter in the car, drove to the Pittsfield  Cemetery, and shot both her children  and herself. The police  found  their  frozen bodies a few days later.  Melinda Daniels never should have  been able to leave that shop with a  handgun. A few weeks before she had  been in the psychiatric ward at the  Berkshire Medical Center. Her hus-  band and friends knew she was suici dal.  If the Brady amendment had been  in effect then, she never would have  walked out of  the gunshop with a  handgun.  Mr. Chairman,  the  7-day waiting  period does not deny a  citizen  the  right to own a handgun.  It is a modest restraint against the  injudicious sale of a handgun to some one, maybe a drug-dealing criminal or  an emotionally disturbed person, who  is either not fit to handle a handgun,  or is going to use it for criminal acts.  No one who uses handguns responsi bly wants  to see  those people with  handguns. I certainly don't. My sports men friends don't. One friend of mine  just wrote to me and said, ""Sil, I've  been a member of the NRA for almost  40 years, but NRA or no NRA, we need  a nationwide waiting period for hand gun purchases. The frontier days have  been over for a long time.""  Seven days is not a long time to wait,  but it may be  time enough  to keep  someone from impulsively buying and  using a handgun. Seven days might  have saved the lives of Melinda Dan iels and her children. Seven days can  help to avoid a future tragedy.  I'm going to vote to keep the Brady  amendment part of the drug bill, and I  ask my friends to support it as well.  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman,  may I  inquire as to the time remain ing?

1514,222,17,Mr. MILLER  of  California.," Mr.  Speaker, I want to thank the gentle man for taking this time to raise this  issue, because I think this use is very  fundamental  to  the  questions  that  voters are going to be asked to decide  about GEORGE BusH, his claims to ex perience, his claims of ability to dis charge the Office of the Vice Presi dent of the United States, and that  should allow him to be vaulted for ward into the office of the Presidency  of the United States.  As the gentleman has said now sev eral times and as has been reported  time and again throughout the Iran Contra crises and, on people reflecting  upon the Reagan term in office, this  was the most serious crisis that this  President of the United States faced. I  think  it  is a valid question  for  the  American public  to ask: ""What was  the advice you gave to the President?""  It is not enough for GEORGE BUSH to  say, ""If I erred, I erred on the side of  the hostages."" That is not the issue.  The issue is: ""What did you say in the  council to the President of the United  States? Did you advise the President  of the United States to make a deal  with the Ayatollah Khomeini to sell  arms  to  terrorists,  to  sell  arms  to  people who declared open war on the  United States of America, who have  moved aggressively against American  citizens, who have undermined our ef forts around the world? Did you advise  the President to do  that or did you  not?"" To say that somehow that that  is a privileged conversation when one  is seeking the confidence of the Ameri can people to be the President of the  United States for the next 4 years is to  avoid the issue, and I think it is also  terribly important that this question  be answered at a  time when I under stand that today, in response to a high  school student's question, Vice Presi dent BUSH, when asked whether or not  he was going to pardon Ollie North,  said that he would not rule it out.  Perhaps we have just had Vice Presi dent BUSH install the first beneficiary  of his own  furlough program. God  knows  there are enough people who  are under indictment and investigation  and conviction from  the administ:ra tion that he could run it at full blast  and not furlough all of them, but it  raises the fundamental issue of was he  involved to such an extent with the  Iran-Contra thing that he is now cnv ering up his trail, dangling the pardon  out there for a person who will some day have to go into court and tell what  he knew or he did not know. I think it  undermines the system of justice, but  it also fails  to meet the test during  ",1988
1515,235,17,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to  share with my colleagues some convincing  facts about the administration's deep commit ment to the war on drugs. The White House  recently  released a detailed  report entitled  ""The Reagan Record on  the Crusade  for a  Drug-Free America"" which presents an array  of  impressive  facts concerning  the accom plishments of  the administration during  the  past 7 years in  its battle against illegal sub stances, both domestically and internationally.  While more must be done if America is to  emerge victorious in  the war on drugs,  I be lieve  that  the administration has done  far  more than past administrations in committing  significant resources to antidrug programs as  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  well as calling the attention of the American  people  to  the drug menace  in our society.  While critics of  the administration have de bunked our President's drug programs,  the  basic statistics reveal  that  the White House  has fought a valiant war on drugs in America.  While  the  rhetorical guns of  the Democrats  are blazing, our Chief Executive is interested  in a sound drug policy, not drug politics. We  owe President Reagan our sincere thanks for  his brave efforts in this important crusade.  He has truly ""run up the battle flag"" in this  war which America cannot afford to lose.  I have extracted some of the highlights and  the more important segments of this report for  my colleagues in the Congress.  THE REAGAN RECORD ON THE NATIONAL  CRUSADE FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA  SUMMARY STATEMENT  Illegal drug use  is beginning to decline;  no-nonsense  judges are enforcing stricter  penalties  for  drug  dealers;  and  record  amounts of  illegal drugs are being seized.  Most importantly, the American people are  changing the way they think about illegal  drugs and drug use. Today, public opposi tion  to  illegal drugs  is growing stronger.  America is increasingly less tolerant of ille gal drugs and drug users. These are the keys  to a drug-free America.  HIGHLIGHTS  Drug Use Declines.-As knowledge about  drugs has increased, popular attitudes about  illegal drug use are beginning to change and  drug use has started to decline during the  1980s. For example, current use of cocaine  among high school seniors dropped by one third in 1987 to the lowest level since 1978.  Daily use of marijuana among  these stu dents dropped from one in nine high school  seniors in 1979 to one in 30 in 1987.  Enforcement Increases.-The number of  Federal drug investigators more than dou bled and the number of Federal drug pros ecutors  increased  four-fold between 1980  and 1988. By FY 1987, arrests by the Drug  Enforcement Agency of  the most serious  drug offenders had  increased 175 percent  over 1983.  Sentences Get Tougher.-The  average  sentence for those convicted of drug law vio lations increased from 51 months in 1979 to  73 months in 1987.  The Budget Triples.-Total outlays  for  Federal drug programs have  tripled since  President Reagan took office. In FY 1988,  the total Federal anti-drug budget was $3.3  billion, up from $1.1 billion in FY 1981. The  President's FY 1989 budget called for a 15  percent increase in Federal outlays to sup port the overall drug effort.  More Drugs Interdicted and Seized.-As a  result  of  Federal  enforcement  efforts,  140,000 pounds of cocaine were seized in FY  1987. Some 2.2 million pounds of marijuana  and 1,400 pounds of heroin were also taken  into Federal custody.  The Military Enlists.-This Administra tion was the first to declare illegal drugs a  threat to national security and the first to  implement a change in the law allowing the  Department of Defense <DOD>  to support  other Federal drug-law enforcement efforts.  By  1987, DOD  forces  spent more  than  16,000 hours in the air and provided 2,512  ship days searching for drug smugglers.  Federal  Coordination  Enhanced.-This  Administration has greatly enhanced  the  coordination among Federal, state, and local  campaigns against illicit drugs; has stepped  up  the use of our  intelligence  agencies  24115  the first  to use  the  Investigation  <FBI>  against drugs; and  is  Federal Bureau  of  against drug dealers.  More Funds for Drug Abuse Prevention. Federal outlays for drug abuse prevention  increased four-fold between FY 1981 and  FY 1988, from $117 million to $454 million.  The President has requested $574 million  for drug abuse prevention in FY 1989, an  additional 15 percent increase.  Prevention Education.-To help parents,  teachers and others in the community, the  Federal Government  collects  information  on drug and alcohol use and promotes pro grams  that effectively combat  illicit drug  use. One example: The Education Depart ment has distributed 1.9 million copies of a  handbook  offering  a  12-point  plan  to  achieve schools free of illegal drugs.  Treatment.-In FY 1988, the Federal Gov ernment provided the states $283 million in  grants for drug abuse treatment and spent  $370 million overall in this important area.  The Federal Government  is also working  closely with state and local governments to  develop effective treatment approaches to  reduce the demand for illicit drugs as well  as  the  transmission of AIDS by IV drug  users.  Drug-Free Military.-The Armed Forces  have been testing for drugs since 1971. Re ported drug use in the military has declined  67 percent since 1980.  THE RECORD  The President's Leadership in Stopping  fllegal Drugs  For seven years, the Reagan Administra tion has pursued a comprehensive anti-drug  strategy  that  is more  extensive,  better  funded,  and more effectively coordinated  than any Federal anti-drug or anti-crime  initiative in our nation's history.  The Administration's strategy emphasizes  international  cooperation,  interdiction,  criminal  investigations and other enforce ment programs,  treatment and prevention  efforts and  research. Today, virtually all  Americans acknowledge that such a compre hensive strategy is the best approach.  In 1986, the President selected these addi tional goals as the steps toward a drug-free  America:  1. Drug-free workplaces for all Americans.  2. Drug-free schools, from elementary to  university.  3. Expanded treatment for drug users.  4.  Improved international cooperation to  cut off the production and transportation of  illegal drugs.  5. Strengthened drug  law enforcement,  using all of our available resources to stop  drug traffickers.  6. Increased public awareness and preven tion.  The Reagan Administration has vigorous ly  pursued  these  goals, marking many  ""firsts"" in the history of the national cru sade against drug use. For example,  the  Reagan Administration was the first in his tory to:  Acknowledge and declare  threat to national security;  Implement a change in Federal law that  allows  the DOD  to support Federal drug  laws;  Send troops and equipment abroad to de stroy drug production facilities in another  country;  Mandate U.S. intelligence agencies to sup port the anti-drug battle;  Call upon the FBI to investigate drug law  violations;  illegal drugs a  ",1988
1516,248,17,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church in  Queens County as it celebrates the SOth anni versay of the construction of its magnificent  building.  For over 75 years,  the Parish of Our Lady  Queen of Martyrs has been a significant part  of the Forest Hills community. As an instutition  with  thousands  of  faithful members,  the  church has contributed  immeasurably  to  the  development of its community over the years  and has given stability, permanence and a  sense of tradition to this entire vicinity.  This church is more than just an edifice of  stone and granite.  It represents the genera tions of devoted people who have played an  invaluable role in the life of the neighborhood.  To celebrate  the anniversary of  this  fine  church many activities, including concerts and  special masses, have taken place. The parish  is also planning a dinner dance to be held on  October 28.  This outstanding parish has contributed  to  improving the Forest Hills community through  many educational and social programs such  as: Adult Education, Caregivers, Community  Police  Program,  high  school  equivalency  classes, Leisure Programs for the elderly, and  Nar-anon Drug Programs and other support  groups. The Parish also participates in Catho lic charities organization, and has a  thriving  choir.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Many people deserve credit for the magnifi cant work  that  takes place at  the Parish of  Our Lady Queen of Martyrs. I commend some  of the important people who play vital roles in  keeping  the parish at  the  forefront of  the  Forest Hills area. These include pastor emeri tus Rev.  Joseph P. Denning; Rev. Msgr.  Thomas J. Gradilone; associate pastors Rev.  Eugene Milmoe  and  Rev.  James Massa.  Other  important  leaders  include: Resident  Rev. Barnabus Wang,  resident Rev.  Louis  Resch, and resident Msgr. Michael J. Dempsy;  and  the deacons, Rev. John Z. Rogan and  Rev.  Thomas R. McCarthy. The  excellent  choir is led by a fine organist, Richard Pretzer.  I am sure my colleagues  join me  in con gratulating the members of Our Lady Queen  of Martyrs Parish on  this historic occasion,  thanking them for their essential contributions  to  the community, and wishing  them all  the  best in the future.  BOW GROUP TRANSATLANTIC  CONFERENCE  HON. THOMAS E. PETRI  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 15, 1988  ",1988
1517,248,17,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, during  the July  recess, I attended a Transatlantic Conference  in London. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Sec retary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth  Affairs, addressed  the conference.  I thought  that his cogent remarks about the state of the  Western alliance would be of interest to my  colleagues in the House. I include them at this  point in the RECORD.  Bow GROUP TRANSATLANTIC CONFERENCE:  JULY 21, 1988  First, a promise. No readings from Paul  Kennedy's ""The Rise and Fall of the Great  Powers""!  Instead, another book suggested a theme  for me tonight. ""The Audit of War"" by Cor relli Barnett.  That book contains a lucid analysis of the  long-term  causes of  economic decline  in  Britain. It constitutes a powerful stimulus  to those of us who have believed that a radi cal restructuring of the British economy has  been long overdue.  In particular,  it  shows how-literally Britain was indebted to the United States in  the last war. The audit of that war was dev astating. By March 1941, with Britain fight ing alone in Europe, our financial reserves  ""were utterly at an end"". But that very  month Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act,  thus releasing assistance to Britain in food,  raw materials and equipment worth $27 bil lion by 1945. We were given the tools: we  finished the job.  Since then, in peacetime, American assist ance to Britain and Europe has been un stinting. With the Marshall plan and the  creation of NATO, American and European  destinies have been inseparable.  If we were to draw up the audit of peace,  we could chalk up as a massive credit the  success of US policy  in helping keep  the  peace in Europe. In countering the expan sionism of Stalin, in rebuilding the wrecked  European economy, in letting Europe have  the chance to prove the superiority of the  Western free market system, its wisdom has  been amply vindicated.  September 15, 1988  The proof today is that, around the world,  the flame of democracy is burning brighter  than ever. Totalitarianism has a rapidly re ceding  future. Socialist  ideology  is  in  re treat. Instead, we in Europe have seen that  freedom is the future-and that it works.  And we draw strength from the example  of America's own proud tradition of individ ualism, responsibility and enterprise.  That is a tradition which goes back to the  foundation of the United States. It has its  roots in Europe.  Those  qualities  are  alive  and well  in  Europe today-epitomised by the economic  policies of the European Community coun tries which place a premium on enterprise  and incentive, not regulation and central lized control, which are directed  towards  achieving a single market by 1992, where  the watchword will be competition, not pro tection.  They are epitomised by the united Alli ance strategy which has created the most  promising  environment  for  arms  control  since the second world war.  These are major achievements. But none  of us can rest on our laurels. New challenges  face us, some of them springing from the  West's own success.  Most notable are the changes now occur ring  in  the Soviet Union. As President  Reagan  rightly  said when  he  came  to  London after his historic visit to Moscow,  there are momentous events afoot. Not con clusive. But momentous.  Mr. Gorbachev-and the Soviet people have come to face the failure of the central ly-planned socialist system. They have rea lised that their economic system needs fun damental reform. And that economic reform  requires  greater  openness. The Moscow  Party Conference has now shown that the  reform process is to bite into the Soviet po litical system itself. But reforming the econ omy is  the most urgent-and perhaps the  most intractable-task. Mr. Gorbachev told  the Moscow Conference:  ""We do not need simply millions of tonnes  of steel, millions of tonnes of cement, mil lions of tonnes of coal, but also specific end  results. Till when shall we go round in a vi cious circle of hopelessly obsolete ideas and  formulas? Production for the sake of pro duction, and the plan for the sake of the  plan.""  And, he might well have added, arma ments for the sake of armaments. Because and this is my point-we in the West are  still on the receiving end of a Warsaw Pact  machine busily outproducing us  in battle  tanks, submarines, artillery and tactical air craft-finding plenty of uses for all those  millions of tonnes of steel.  One of the greatest problems facing Mr.  Gorbachev is to turn the juggernaut of the  Soviet economy around from destructive to  constructive ends. The God of Mammon  may yet prove mightier than the God of  War. Eventually, even the Soviet audit of  war will have to be computed, the reckoning  made and the logical consequences drawn.  And although it is posed in a particularly  acute form in the Soviet Union, the problem  of the relationship between defense and the  rest of the economy is one that we can all  find  familiar. The budgetary costs of de fence pose different questions for democra cies  in  the West: democracies who must  argue for their own defence policies regular ly at the polls, and convince the electorate not just the military-of their worth.  So far so good. The nerve of the democrat ic West has held. And indeed, under Peter  Carrington, NATO has gone from strength  ",1988

1521,274,17,Mr.  BYRD.," Mr.  President,  last  Friday,  the President criticized  the  Senate for holding up the nominations  of 40 women for various positions in  the Federal Government.  Up to this date in time, the Senate  has confirmed 228 women for full-time  positions  in  the  administration. A  review of the number of women await ing Senate confirmation for full-time  positions shows that, as of last Friday,  only 18 of these nominations had not  completed  the confirmation process.  That is the same day that the Presi dent criticized the Senate for holding  up the nominations of 40 women. The  old math and the new math come out  the same. No matter which way you  look at it, the President was wrong.  Let me say again: A review of the  number of women  awaiting Senate  confirmation for full-time positions-I  am not talking about part-time posi tions on boards where they may meet  once a year or once every 2 years, or  whatever; I am talking about full-time  positions-shows  that  as  of  last  Friday,  the same day  the President  made his statement, only 18 of these  nominations had not completed  the  confirmation process. This week,  two  more nominations were  received  for  full-time positions. Out of the 20 posi tions pending  in  the Senate, 15  of  these nominations have been sumitted  to the Senate since June 20 of  this  year.  Any reading of these numbers does  not justify any charge or implication  that the Senate is failing to act on the  nominations of women for high-level  Federal positions.  While the President deserves credit  for the nomination of the first woman  to sit on the Supreme Court, Sandra  Day O'Connor, his record of nomina tions of women for the Federal Bench  over the past 7 Y2 years is not a stellar  one.  This  administration has had  two  terms in which to nominate women for  Federal courts. However, out of 409  total nominations, only 35 have been  women. During a 4-year administra tion, President Carter nominated a  total of 258 persons  for article  III  courts, and out of  that number 40  were women. That was in 4 years, as  against more than 7 V2 years under this  administration.  Thus, as compared to the Carter ad ministration,  the present administra tion has not only nominated  fewer  women  to positions on  the Federal  bench during  twice  the number of  years, but also,  their percentage of  women nominated out of  the  total  number of nominations is only 8.6 per cent as opposed  to the 15.5 percent  achieved by the Carter administration.  During my service in the Senate, I  have promoted women to many posi tions of responsibility, and I will con tinue to be willing to carefully consid er the merits of all nominations,  in cluding the 20 women nominees pres ently pending before  the Senate.  I  repeat: Confirming  228  out of  248  nominations of women for high-level,  full-time Federal positions  is hardly  one of going slow on nominations of  women.  SOUTH  CAROLINA  PROCLAMA TION  TO  SUPPORT  SEPTEM BER  16,  1988,  AS  ""POW /MIA  RECOGNITION DAY""  ",1988
1522,274,17,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise to commend the State of South  Carolina and Gov. Carroll Campbell  for issuing a proclamation to support  the Congress of the United States and  the President in proclaiming Friday,  September  16,  1988,  as  ""National  POW /MIA Recognition Day."" The  sacrifices of American prisoners of war  and missing in action and their fami lies are deserving of national recogni tion.  Our Nation must continue to be re lentless in seeking a full accounting of  the 2,400 Americans still missing  in  Southeast Asia. President Reagan has  continuously proclaimed his total com mitment to a full accounting. Recogni tion day  is  to remind all Americans  that we must maintain our vigilance  until this tragedy is resolved. It is en couraging  that  progress  has  been  made with Hanoi in seeking a full ac counting, as a  result of negotiations  between Gen. John W. Vessey, Jr., and  Hanoi officials last year.  Mr. President, our great and patriot ic State of South Carolina  stands  firmly behind the President and the  Congress in joining all Americans on  this special recognition day to focus  our efforts on a  full accounting of  POW's and MIA's. I ask unanimous  consent for the South Carolina procla mation to be printed in the CONGRES SIONAL  RECORD  following  these  re marks.  There being no objection, the procla mation was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  PROCLAMATION BY Gov. CARROLL A. CAMP BELL, JR., ON NATIONAL POW /MIA RECOG NITION DAY  Whereas, the United States has fought in  many wars; and  Whereas,  thousands of Americans who  served in such wars were captured by the  enemy or are missing in action; and  Whereas, many American prisoners of war  were subjected to brutal and inhuman treat ment by their enemy captors in violation of  international codes and customs  for  the  treatment of prisoners of war and many  prisoners of war died from such treatment;  and  Whereas, the sacrifices of American pris oners of war and Americans missing  in  action and their families are deserving of  national recognition.  Now, Therefore,  I, Carroll A. Campbell,  Jr., Governor of the State of South Caroli na, do hereby proclaim Friday, September  16, 1988, as: ""National POW /MIA Recogni tion Day"" in South Carolina and urge all  South Carolinians to observe such day with  appropriate ceremonies and activities.  THE SUPREME COURT'S ROLE IN  PROMOTING WOMEN'S RIGHTS  ",1988
1523,274,17,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  rise  today on the matter of the Su preme Court and the role it has played  in the fight for women's rights. Gains  in the battle for women's rights have  been slow and incremental. In fact, all  of us committed to women's rights are  still fighting  for such basics as  the  equal rights amendment. And as late  as 1961, the Supreme Court found it  constitutional to exclude women from  serving on jury duty unless they vol unteered because  it would  interfere  with  their homemaking  responsibil ities.  In 1971, for the first time, the Su preme Court held  that government  policies and laws that discriminated on  the basis of sex must be subjected to a  stricter standard of scrutiny under the  equal protection clause of  the 14th  amendment. Under this new standard,  the Court struck down statutes that  gave preference to men over women.  The Supreme Court's 1973 decision  in Roe versus Wade to legalize abor tion was a necessary step in the politi cal process to enfranchise women. The  Court recognized that women cannot  take their equal place in society unless  they are able to control their fertility.  Justice Blackmun, in writing for the  majority  in  that  case,  stated  that  there is a  fundamental right to per sonal privacy that is broad enough to  encompass a woman's decision wheth er or not to terminate her pregnancy.  At the time of the Roe decision, only  four States permitted a women to con sult with her physician to make her  own decision  to terminate her preg nancy. Many States sought to discour age abortions by establishing severe  criminal penalties. While  these  laws  were in place, enforcement was diffi cult, if not impossible, because there  was little incentive to report the abor tion  to  law enforcement authorities.  Family members who may have known  of  an  abortion were naturally not  eager to have the woman condemned  as a criminal. Indeed, I think there are  few among us today, even those who  oppose the Supreme Court's decision,  ",1988
1524,287,17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Does  the Senator from Massachusetts wish  to have some items in the RECORD?  ,1988
1525,287,17,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  think we can reference those matters.  I will not bother putting them in the  RECORD. Thank you.  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.  ",1988
1526,287,17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Utah.  ,1988
1527,287,17,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I call  the Senator's attention to the editorial  on the front of this, just one of the  volumes of editorials against the mini mum wage. It is an interesting editori al not written by the chamber at all.  As a matter of fact, it is written by the  New York Times. It is astounding. Ten  years ago I do not think the New York  Times would have been against  the  minimum wage increases. But be that  as it may, they may not be now. I have  seen the New York Times change its  position before, which  they have a  right to do.  But if you look at these editorials  you will find that for the first time in  history newspapers and print media all  over this country are alarmed and con cerned about the actual facts brought  up by an overwhelming number of  economist, in fact virtually every main  line  economist,  that  the minimum  wage is detrimental to the very people  that  they claim  they are  trying  to  help. And frankly, it is very detrimen tal to the country.  It does not take much in the way of  intelligence to understand if you push  up the minimum wage everything else  goes up as well. If somebody is at $3.35  an hour and you put it up to $3.75,  which .this bill will do next year, all of  a sudden those who are making $3.75  have to go up. It just makes sense. Of  course, maybe that is what the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts  wants. Those at $4 or $5.50 have to go  up, all the way up the tree. Who pays  for all of that? Why, every consumer  in America. I might add they pay for it  because all of the costs of goods and  services go up. Not only that, but the  people who are hurt  the most are  really  the elderly on fixed  incomes,  and Social Security because they have  to pay even though they are limited in  their income. They do not have any  real way of going out and making  more income.  Of course, nobody is going to give  any consideration to this bill to the  low-wage workers because  they pay  more and the very people who get this  so-called wonderful benefit of an in crease  in  the minimum wage  are  paying more. So the 40 cents you give  them is basically taken away. But it  costs everybody. It does not take any  brains to figure that out. It was not  even difficult for a lot of these news papers.  It is no secret that the chamber of  commerce is against increases in the  minimum wage, as  is virtually every  the Senator  business organization in the country.  Is it just because they are a bunch of  greedy  people who want  to make  higher profits? I think we have to say  there is nothing wrong with making  profits. But I think it is also a little bit  callous to accuse all business people of  being greedy or even to say that all  workers are poor since we know that  about 14 percent really are working  poor under the minimum wage today.  But why increase the minimum wage  for everybody when we could take care  of the working poor with something  like an unearned  income  refundable  tax credit which would  really work,  and which would not cause an infla tionary spiral.  ",1988
1528,287,17,Mr. KENNEDY., Will  yield?  ,1988
1529,287,17,Mr. HATCH.," If I could finish, but I  will be happy to debate as time goes  on.  Let me  just say  this: The distin guished Senator, I understand in my  absence, was  talking about when  I  worked as a  janitor at BYU  to put  myself through college, that probably  it did not take very  long for me to  learn  that.  It did not  take me  3  months of a  training wage  to  learn  that job. I think he denigrates all cus todians in this country.  Let me tell you something: There is  a little bit of skill, if not a great deal  of skill, in being a really good custodi an.  I  happened  to have worked  to  become a good one. I know that the  distinguished Senator  thinks  that  is  where I should still be. [Laughter.]  On the other hand, I have had the  experience of working for  the mini mum wage, which he has never had  nor ever will. I know what it is like to  do it, and I know what it is like to get  an entrance job. I wondered whether I  could get that 60-cents-an-hour job, or  whatever it was at the time. I do not  believe it was more than 60 cents an  hour. I worried sick about it, because I  was not sure there would be one for  me. If I had not had that job, I could  not have made it through undergradu ate school.  If I had not worked pretty close to  the minimum wage-I cannot remem ber  the exact wage-as an all-night  desk attendant in the girls' dormitory  at the University of Pittsburgh, Elaine  and our three children and I would  not have made it through law school.  I understand this problem, and I un derstand the desire-and I think it an  altruistic desire-on  the part of my  distinguished colleague to have every body make a better wage. I like that  myself. But the laws of economics say  that if you price some of these poor  people out of the marketplace, those  jobs go, too, and that is unfortunate.  I saw a  letter yesterday from one  group touting the minimum wage and  saying that we should all vote for it,  saying youth employment has gone  down. It sure has, under this administration, because the economic policies  of this administration have been bene ficial, even though they have not been  perfect, and we have had 69 months of  continued economic expansion  since  the last minimum wage was raised in  the early 1980's. I think it is time for  people to stop and think maybe that is  why.  If we have 14 percent working poor or, let us give the benefit of the doubt,  a little bit more than 14 percent-let  us attack that problem directly. I will  join the Senator for an earned income  tax credit refundable to those people,  to bring them to a point where they  can get by. I believe in that. But why  do we have to push up the cost for ev erybody in society?  One of the fastest growing areas in  small business is single proprietorships  by women, and you will find that it is  very difficult for them to keep up if  this minimum wage goes up, or they  will have less employment. They will  have less service and even less quality  commodities in our society.  This  is  a  pretty  important  issue  here. For the first time-and my point  should not be lost by the distinguished  Senator from Massachusetts nor by  anybody else-for the first time in the  history of my discussions of the mini mum wage, and it has always been an  uphill battle for those of us trying to  point out these economic facts, news papers all over  this  land have been  writing editorials backing up our posi tion. That has not happened before.  True, prodded by business people in  part, prodded by economists, prodded  by  academicians, prodded by politi cians who are concerned about  this  issue;  true, prodded by anybody who  thinks about the losses that occur as  we do these things.  I am sure there are editorials that  the Senator can criticize in the thou sands of editorials we have shown, and  probably some I can criticize. The fact  is that for the first time that I know,  the country is starting to awaken to  the fact that the minimum wage may  not be the greatest panacea it has con tinually been painted to be over these  last several years.  We have been talking about edito rials and about the earned income tax  credit.  I understand that the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts  has criticized the cost of that. I wish  he would look at the cost of increasing  the minimum wage across the board.  Let me take a few minutes to discuss  the training wage amendment of the  distinguished Senator from Massachu setts. We knew they were going to file  a  training wage which would be so  miniscule  that  it would not benefit  anybody, of any consequence, that it  would be  so  limited  that  it  really  would not be much good.  A substantive training wage amend ment, in my opinion, is absolutely nee",1988
1530,313,17,Mr. HATCH., I am delighted to yield.  Mr. D'AMATO. I have been some what reluctant to take a position on  the minimum wage legislation because  there are so many nuances.  ,1988
1531,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," That is very well said.  Mr. D'AMATO. I would hope that  we could attempt to focus on the facts  as opposed to a lot of the rhetoric that  goes on-you know, the chest beating  about fairness and taking care of those  who are most in need. I think we are  all concerned with employment and  employment opportunity. But maybe  for this Senator's edification the Sena tor might address himself to specifical ly how long this training would be-it  is a training wage-if I were to run a  business.  I  have a  constituent who  called me today. His name is Mr. Tum minillo. He said he hires mostly stu dents and housewives on a part-time  basis. He  said generally after  they  work out, after 3 or 4 weeks, he moves  them up and gives  them a  higher  wage.  Now, in your legislation, how would  this affect Mr. Tumminillo  if  there  were  a  $3. 75  an hour minimum?  I  would imagine in the first year, in the  bill as proposed now that you seek to  amend,  it would  require  raising  the  minimum from $3.35  to $3. 75. VVhat  would be the situation with Mr. Tum minillo?  ",1988
1532,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," VVell, if somebody was  first hired  in his business, he could  hire them at 80 percent of the then  prevailing minimum wage.  If it was  $3.75, it would be 80 percent of that,  so long as the base wage he pays is not  below $3.35 an hour, the present mini mum wage. He would be able to pay  them that for 3 months, during which  time he would train them.  Mr. D'AMATO. So, in other words,  the present minimum would be  the  minimum?  ",1988
1533,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," Not necessarily. You  cannot go below the present minimum.  Normally,  it would be 80 percent of  the prevailing minimum wage, as long  as it does not go below the present  minimum wage.  Mr. D'AMATO. But in no case below  the present minimum wage?  ",1988
1534,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," That is right. So he  would be paying at least the present  minimum wage or 80 percent, whichev er is higher.  Mr. D'AMATO. And for how long?  VVould they have to take this as long  as he wanted to pay them that?  ",1988
1535,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," No, only for 3 months.  Then I doubt seriously that many em ployers would keep them on it for 3  months. Some would, some would not.  But they would have a 3-month train ing wage, and thereafter, they would  have to pay the minimum wage.  Mr. D'AMATO. So your amendment  would  say  that  at  the  end  of  3  months-",1988
1536,313,17,Mr. HATCH., They would have to be  paid  the  then  prevailing minimum  wage.  Mr. D'AMATO. They would then go  up to $3.75.  ,1988
1537,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," Sure, whatever it is.  Mr. D'AMATO. Now, I have received  many letters and telegrams. I hope to  begin placing these in the RECORD this  Monday, because  I  think we should  hear from the small business entrepre neurs of America; people who love this  country every bit as much as those of  us on this floor; and people who are  out there in the real work force who  understand  the  realities of what  is  taking  place. They  have  indicated  that,  in many cases,  they  feel  that  simply to put them in a situation that  would  require  this kind of  increase  without providing  a  training wage,  would not allow them to hire nearly as  many people.  Has  the Senator had any experi ences or has he received any communi cations from people  in the business  community and others who are con cerned about giving employment op portunities to young people?  ",1988
1538,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," Thousands of them. In  fact, I have met with groups all over  the country that said if we could just  have a training wage, we could do an  awful lot of good.  Mr. D'AMATO. But, again,  in 90  days-I  just want  to  go  over  this  again-in 90 days, Mr. Tumminillo, or  anybody else, would be required then  to pay the minimum wage, whatever it  is?  ",1988
1539,313,17,Mr. HATCH.," No question; whatever  it is. VVhatever it is, that is right.  In other words, it is not a prolonged  thing. It would be required. Once that  young person, or older person under  our  amendment-anybody who  has  not worked before for that business once  that person has been  there 3  months, I think that person will merit  the minimum wage and probably be  paid more. Certainly they will go up to  the minimum wage and I think will go  on from there because they will have  had the experience of working. They  will  have  had  the  opportunity  to  work.  Mr. D'AMATO. I  refer to another  businessman who called us. He said  that without  the  training wage  for  new workers, he would have  to find  ways to hire fewer people, given the  increased costs. Now, we are talking  about a  fast-food place. He said he  would find ways to install french fry  machines to replace kitchen help. He  would install self-service machines for  sodas instead of hiring counter help ers. Overall, he makes an estimate  that he would reduce his kitchen staff  from 25 people to 15 people.  ",1988
1540,352,17,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr.  President,  this  is  ""National Hispanic Heritage  Week,"" a week during which we cele brate  the many  important contribu tions of Hispanics to our country.  President Lyndon B. Johnson first  proclaimed ""National Hispanic Herit age Week"" in 1968. His proclamation  drew attention to the important role  Hispanics have played in building our  Nation, from  the great Hispanic ex plorers who ventured  into  the un known frontiers of the New World to  their descendants who settled and de veloped  many  cities  and  towns  throughout  the  South  and West.  These cities and towns, proudly bear ing Spanish names, are a continuing  testament  to  the  influence of  these  Hispanic pioneers. The capitol of my  home State of New Mexico, Santa Fe,  is just one example.  This week we pause to look back on  the discoveries of Christopher Colum bus and his Spanish fleet,  the great  expeditions of Francisco Vasquez de  Coronado, and the many other land mark contributions of celebrated His panic pioneers. Yet, we also turn our  attention to the increasing impact of  their modern-day descendants on our  society today. The U.S. Census Bureau  estimated that there were more than  18 million Hispanics in our country in  1986, a  jump of one-third since 1980.  In my own State of New Mexico, His panics constitute 38 percent of  the  total population, the largest percent age of any State in the country. Every where-in the arts, in entertainment,  in our schools, in businesses, in Gov ernment, and in all other sectors of  our society-we are witnessing an ex plosion of Hispanic leadership and in fluence.  The growing presence of Hispanics  demands that we not only appreciate  their  contributions  but  also  their  needs. Unfortunately, statistics show  that  illiteracy  and  dropout  rates  among Hispanics are disproportionate  to  their population. We must  find  ways  to  solve  these  problems. We  simply cannot afford to ignore the toll  that illiteracy and lack of education  take both on individual well-being and  on  the  economic well-being of our  country.  We must first make a commitment  to helping  those Hispanics who are  not proficient in English. They simply  cannot achieve their full potential in  this country without English language  skills. Expanding English literacy pro grams, programs such as those estab lished by legislation I authored and  which became  law  this year,  is one  step toward that goal. But the success  of  those programs depends on  the  commitment  of many  individuals educators, parents, Government of fi cials, and communities.  Improving educational opportunities  among Hispanics  also  demands  a  strong commitment from all of us, and  most  importantly, from educators.  I  was awed and inspired by the dedication of one teacher in California, Mr.  Jaime Escalante, whose story is told in  the recently released film, ""Stand and  Deliver."" This film told the true story  of one highly committed high school  math teacher who instilled in a group  of disenchanted East Los Angeles His panic  high  school  students  the  ""ganas,"" or desire,  to  learn and  to  achieve. Thanks  to his untiring ef forts,  all 18  students  in  this group  passed the advanced placement calcu lus test, a feat so remarkable that it  was  immediately challenged by  the  Educational Testing Service. The stu dents were retested months after their  final calculus class-they still passed,  many with top marks.  We need more Jaime Escalantes in  this country. We cannot regard stu dents who may suffer from disadvan tageous circumstances as unworthy of  our utmost efforts. We must give them  the attention they deserve, and when  we do, they will give back as much and  more. Likewise, when we recognize and  respect the needs of the Hispanic com munity, we open the door  to many  more positive contributions to our so ciety, contributions  that will enrich  each of us individually and all of us as  a nation.e  DE PAUL HOSPITAL,  MILWAUKEE, WI  ",1988
1541,352,17,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor the 30th anniversary  of the De Paul Hospital in Milwaukee.  Since 1958, De Paul has provided qual ity care for countless men and women  suffering from alcoholism and other  afflictions.  The De Paul Hospital-under  the  leadership of Mr. A. Bela Marotti-has  been a source of pride to the Milwau kee  community. Wisconsinites  take  care of each other, and De Paul  is  leading the way by example.  I ask that a brief history of the De  Paul  facility  be  included  in  the  RECORD.  The information follows:  DE PAUL REHABILITATION HOSPITAL  Founded by A. Bela Maroti in 1958, De  Paul Health Corporation originated as a  halfway house for homeless men. Within a  year the home was legally incorporated as  St. Vincent de Paul Men's Home, Inc.  By 1961, De Paul expanded to meet the  medical, psychological, spiritual, social and  vocational needs of the men at the ""home"",  many of whom were alcoholics.  In August 1963, De Paul received approval  from the Wisconsin State Board of Health  for operation of a hospital unit to provide  the specialized medical care needed by the  acute alcoholic. The following year De Paul  was approved for membership by the Ameri can Hospital Association as a specialty hos pital.

1545,365,17,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1988
1546,365,17,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  was very pleased to submit this con current resolution and was honored to  have  the distinguished chairman of  the  Foreign  Relations  Committee,  Senator PELL, and 33 other colleagues  join as cosponsors. It is fitting and ap propriate for the Senate to note the  10th anniversary of a landmark event  by any standard,  the signing of the  Camp David accords. Signed on Sep tember 17, 1978, the accords marked a  triumph of will and courage by three  leaders of vision: Menachem Begin of  Israel, Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt, and  Jimmy Carter of the United States.  The  Camp  David  accords  have  served as the foundation of peace be tween  Israel  and Egypt. A  decade  later,  the peace between Israel and  Egypt still persists, ending a genera tion of war between them. The accords  stand as a beacon and as clear evi dence of what can be accomplished  through the diligence and persistence  of national leaders committed to the  peaceful  resolution  of  conflict. To  achieve the peace took acts of great  courage. President Sadat journeyed to  Jerusalem, breaking a  psychological  and physical barrier that changed the  way people for decades had viewed the  Arab-Israeli conflict. Prime Minister  Begin reciprocated this act by propos ing the return of the entire Sanai Pe ninsula, an oil-rich area twice the size  of  Israel. Together,  they paved  the  path to peace.  These two men were then called to  Camp David, where for 12 days, Presi dent Carter brought them together to  negotiate the Camp David accords-a  comprehensive plan to bring peace to  the  region. The accords  laid out a  blueprint to provide for Israel's securi ty, and to resolve the Palestinian prob lem ""in all its aspects."" It called for  negotiations by the parties to the con flict,  including the Palestinians, that  would decide final borders, make secu rity arrangements, and over a 5-year  transition  period,  settle  the  final  status of the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip. Through these negotiations, the  ""legitimate rights of  the Palestinian  people"" would be recognized.  Unfortunately, the other parties to  the  conflict  have  yet  to  see  the  wisdom that was charted in the Camp  David accords. The region remains in  turmoil and negotiations remain un tested. Had others joined in the peace  process, years of violence could have  been avoided and the current Palestin ian uprising might never have  oc curred. Even  today, Palestinian and  other Arab leaders continue to reject  the clearest and straightest way to re solve the conflict: recognition of Isra el's right to exist, followed by direct  negotiations with Israel.  Nevertheless,  I am convinced  that  some day, hopefully soon, such negoti ations will occur. And the Camp David  accords with provide the example and  the direction for the inevitable turn to  peace that is essential to all the inhab itants of the region.  The  concurrent  agreed to.  The preamble was agreed to.  The concurrent resolution, and the  preamble, are as follows:  resolution  was  S. CON.

1547,378,17,Mr. PORTER.," Madam Speaker,  if  Iraq's use of chemical weapons against  its Kurdish minority was not troubling  enough, today's Washington Post re ports that Japan is helping Libya con struct a metallurgical plant  in  the  same complex that Libya is using to  produce its stock of chemical weapons.  Japan should know better.  Sadly, this type of Western complici ty in the prolif era ti on of toxic weap ons is not a new phenomenon. Syria is  producing these weapons with chemi cals originally from our own country.  When we placed an export ban on  these chemicals, West Germany quick ly stepped in to fill the gap.  At a  time when the United States  and the Soviet Union are making sig nificant progress in Geneva toward a  treaty  banning  chemical  weapons,  Western participation in the spread of  these weapons is unconscionable. The  United States and the West must lead  by  example, not by aiding volatile  Third World countries to obtain and  deploy ""the poor man's atomic bomb.""  H.R.  2880,  a  bill  introduced  by  myself and IKE SKELTON. would estab lish a new U.S. chemical and biological  weapons nonproliferation regime, and  I urge Members to cosponsor it. In the  meantime, Japan should know that we  view  its Libyan complicity with  the  deepest concern.  A SALUTE TO JOHN C.

Throughout his  service in Europe during World War  II, Mr. Rosano exhibited true bravery  in the face of constant danger and was  willing  to  sacrifice his  life  to help  others.  Mr. Rosano  enlisted  in  the U.S.  Army in April 1943. After basic train ing, he volunteered for the 82d Air borne and completed jump training at  Fort Benning, GA. Soon after, he was  sent overseas, where he participated in  the Sicily campaign and the D-Day in vasion of Normandy. When  jumping  behind enemy lines, as Mr. Rosano did  in Normandy, he was completely on  his own. There were many days and  nights of the traumatic experience of  hand-to-hand combat,  in which Mr.  Rosano had to look ~to the eyes of  the men he was forced to kill.  Mr. Rosano was captured in France  by German soldiers on August 9, 1944.  They marched him toward Germany,  picking up about 1,000 other POW's  along the way. He watched his friends  being shot before a German  firing  squad.  Subsequently,  his  life was  spared due to a timely allied bombing  raid. He was locked in a boxcar with 60  men for 30 days, where there was no  ventilation, no room to lay down, and  rats which ate the remains of those  who died of starvation.  In October 1944, Mr. Rosano and his  fellow POW's began a ""death march""  to Germany. Those who survived the  march were forced to work 16 hours a  day building barracks and air  raid  shelters. Stationed 1 mile from a rail road troop station, Mr. Rosano's camp  was bombed for at least 6 hours every  night. That winter, they were forced  to sleep on a cold cement floor with no  winter clothing, and were fed only a  slice of bread and a small portion of  potato soup daily. In 9 months, Mr.  Rosano lost 70 pounds. One night, the  POW's were  so  hungry  that Mr.  Rosano, knowing he would be severely  punished if caught, crawled under a  barbed wire fence to take Red Cross  packages  to his men. While  this al lowed his  fell ow PO W's to eat, Mr.  Rosano was caught and placed for 2  weeks in a hole 5 feet long, 3 feet wide,  and 4 feet high.  On January 15, 1945, there was an  air raid by allied bombers on Mr. Ro sano's POW camp. The air raid shelter  was  shared  by  both  POW's  and  German civilians. During the raid, a  German mother dropped her two chil dren while running to the shelter. Ex hibiting great courage and compas sion, Mr. Rosano ran back  into  the  bombing and rescued the two children.  Just as he  returned  to  the shelter,  however, it received a direct hit. Mr.  Rosano and four other PO W's were  buried alive for 5 days. During this in cident, Mr. Rosano sustained physical  injury  that has  plagued him  ever  since.  In May 1945, the POW's were liber ated by the 10th Army Division. Mr.  Rosano was sent to Lake Placid, NY,  and then Fort Lee, VA, to recuperate.  Doctors recognized that he had sus tained serious and debilitating injury,  but were unable to diagnose it. It was  only in 1972 that he was diagnosed as  having an organic brain  syndrome.  While Mr. Rosano frequently received  medical treatment at the VA North port Hospital on Long Island, his wife  Lucy and his children Linda, Lori, and  John have all helped to care for him  over the years.  Mr. Rosano  received  the following  honors for his distinguished military  service: The European-African-Middle  Eastern Campaign Medal,  the Good  Conduct Medal, the World War II Vic tory Medal,  the Combat  Infantry  Badge, the Sharp Shooting Medal, the  Bronze Star, with six smaller bronze  stars for his six jumps behind enemy  lines,  and  the Conspicuous Service  Cross. Recently, I had the honor of  presenting Mr. Rosano with the POW  Medal.  Madam Speaker, let us devote this  day to honoring John Rosano and all  the POW's and MIA's who have sacri ficed so much in the defense of our  great Nation.  0 1100  POW-MIA RECOGNITION DAY  <Mr. YOUNG of Florida asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)

1551,404,17,Mr.  RANGEL.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  wanted to add to that dialog, as most  of my colleagues have gone  interna tionally  and  talked with  foreigners  about their attempts  to control and  for  the eradication and pushing for  the eradication of drugs, constantly we  are reminded about what we are not  doing in the United States in terms of  reducing demand and in terms of law  enforcement or getting people  sen tences. I think it is clear, as relates to  money  laundering, while we  have  talked about the abusers and the sell ers, and we should, and we should jail  them, that there are so many people  involved  in  the white-collar  crimes  that do not touch the drugs, that do  not touch the actual chemicals, and  yet without their banking and financ ing and money  laundering, certainly  the bums on the streets would not be  able to survive. So I think that that  provision is going to be important, and  I am glad that we are going to take  that up next week, because that is just  one of the tools that we hope that we  can have in the bill.  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I  think that is an excellent provision,  and I believe I was the first to intro duce a money-laundering bill  in the  last Congress, and the gentleman from  New Jersey introduced one, and we fi nally got a product out in the great big  omnibus bill. It did not get the debate  attention because  it was part of a  package  that nobody offered major  amendments to, but the whole idea of  capturing the proceeds, not just the  forfeited assets but the actual dollars  that go through our financial institu tions  is an extremely important ele ment in the war on drugs.  I under stand from those involved in that that  they have been able to take advantage  rather well of the money-laundering  law we passed in 1986, but it does need  improvement, and  this effort would  improve it and enhance it a little bit  more. And maybe,  just maybe  if we  can get at  those proceeds, we will  squeeze those kingpins the gentleman  is talking about.  So I am very pleased that the gentle man is engaging in this discussion and  is able to bring up some points that  are really often overlooked on the im portance of fighting this war on drugs.

1556,430,17,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, reserv ing the right to object, I do not intend  to object, but I yield  to the gentle woman from Ohio [Ms. OAKAR] for an  explanation of the legislation.  ",1988
1557,430,17,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from New York CMr.  GILMAN],  the distinguished minority  leader, for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  chairman and the major sponsor, and  I am one of the cosponsors of this bill.  My colleagues know  that a  lot of  people say, ""Why do you do these res olutions  in which you commemorate  various associations or groups  for a  special week in the year?""  I think it is important in most cases  that we do this. I think that we ought  to commend organizations  for  their  public service.  Mr. Speaker, visiting nurse associa tions are very, very special in my opin ion. They are nonprofit providers of  home health care. They are very often  supported by community residents and  organizations such as United Way, and  they are usually governed by a  local  board of volunteer directors, and these  volunteers try to assist them in giving  the care for those who are especially  in need.  Mr. Speaker, the professionals who  are employed by the visiting nurses as sociations are very highly skilled indi viduals  committed  to providing  the  best care possible. We have a shortage  of nurses  these  days,  as  everyone  knows, primarily, I think, because it is  such an undervalued profession, and  hopefully we will pay them fairly in  the near future. But the fact is that  very often these visiting nurses go into  areas in trying to serve the most vul nerable  in their homes. That causes  some personal risk at times because  they go into perhaps high crime areas  where  sometimes  the poor unf ortu nately have to live, but they are ex traordinarily dedicated. They are espe cially dedicated to the elderly, to the  sick, to the poor, and the kinds of serv ices  that they perform  in my  judg ment by giving home health care we  ought to, in commemorating the visit ing nurses,  rededicate ourselves  to a  policy of long-term care that would in clude comprehensive home health care  so  that  those people who  are dis charged from hospitals very often too  soon, those people who need the kind  of quality care that these nurses give  in  their own homes,  can get  reim bursed properly.  Mr. Speaker, we have not been pro gressive in this country in recognizing  in my  judgment  the value of  these  types of health providers, so I  think  this is why we call attention to the vis iting nurses associations, and, frankly,  nurses  in  particular,  and we  say,  ""Thank you. Thank you for being the  profession  that  spends more hours  with patients than any other health  provider, and thank you for the kind  of service that these nurses do in serv ing people  in  their own homes and  serving the most vulnerable people in  their own homes.""  So, Mr. Speaker, I want to compli ment all who are responsible and pay  special tribute to the visiting nurses  associations and nurses in particular.  ",1988

1559,430,17,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, further  reserving the right to object, I yield to  the gentleman  from Colorado  [Mr.  HEFLEY].  ",1988
1560,430,17,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I appre ciate the gentleman from New York  [Mr. GILMAN] yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I  join my colleague,  Mrs. OAKAR,  today  in  thanking  the  many Members of this body who are  supporting House  Joint Resolution  576, establishing February 19-25, 1989,  as ""National Visiting Nurse Associa tion Week.""  This legislation honors the pioneers  in  home  health  care,  the  visiting  nurses. For more than 100 years, visit ing nurses have provided home health  care to everyone, regardless of their  ability  to pay. Traditionally, VNA's  have been the public health delivery  system in America.  Although VNA's role in home care  has been  longstanding,  the Federal  Government's involvement is relative ly recent. When the medicare system  was established in 1965, Congress stip ulated that only nonprofit, communi ty-based and supported visiting nurse  associations could be  reimbursement  for home care services. Congress modi fied the law in 1981 to allow any type  of organization to provide reimbursa ble home care, yet today most of the  Nation's medicare patient's and the in digent are still cared for by visiting  nurse associations.  VNA's  remain  the primary home  health service providers in virtually all  major urban and rural areas. There  mission-to care for anyone who needs  assistance-has remain unchanged for  more than a century. For their faith ful commitment and service, VNA's de serve our thanks. That is what we do  by passing this resolution.  With more  and more Americans  living longer, well pa.st their seventies  even into their nineties, the need for  long-term care is rising. A number of  our elderly have physical or mental  disabilities  that  require  assistance  with everyday  life,  such as  eating,  bathing, and moving about. Visiting  nurses are enabling many of the dis abled elderly-as well as their younger  counterparts-to  remain  at  home,  where care costs are much lower than  in a hospital or nursing home, and  where they feel more comfortable and  can maintain their dignity.  As a nation, we are faced with the  question of how to meet our growing  health care needs, especially for those  who can least afford, and often most  require, medical attention. Earlier in  this Congress we debated that issue,  first as part of the catastrophic health  insurance legislation and, later, in con nection with the long-term care bill.  We found no easy answers to the prob lem of providing care, but I am sure  that  the visiting nurses associations  will always be a major part of the solu tion.  Visiting nurse associations annually  provide home care and support serv ices  to nearly 1 million Americans,  from newborns to the very old.  In addition  to health care, VNA's  off er  hospice  care  to  comfort  the  dying;  occupational,  physical  and  speech therapy to restore the injured;  and help to the disabled searching for  new ways of coping.

1565,443,17,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Have a safe trip.  MY ADVICE TO THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS  As  Mr. Speaker, I rise again in continu ation of what I call ""Advice  to  the  Special Orders,  Privileged Orders.""  Significantly I borrowed that phrase  from the great American patriot, Joel  Barlow, who was one the Chaplains, if  not the chaplain for George Washing ton's army during the Revolutionary  War, but also a great pamphleteer and  a great poet and wrote equally great  epic  poems.  I  have mentioned  before on prior occasions such as the  ""Columbiad,""  in which he  foresaw  what turned out to be our Civil War.  But  in his advice  to  the privileged  orders of Europe, which is the way he  entitled his essays, he was in many re spects and in my judgment, not only  the equal in many respects perhaps of  a more  sensitive  and  imaginative  nature than even Tom Paine himself.  These were great voices at a  time  when it was not easy. Both were im prisoned.  Paine was  imprisoned  in  England and France as well for their  advice  to  the privileged orders. The  times are not dissimilar. There is a lot  of similarity to our times.  We are on the threshold of great  revolutionary events. We now are wit nessing the contraction of the globe,  contracted and strongly bound by elec tronic bonds of instant communication  and interdealings in commerce and fi nance of huge volume and magnitude,  all in a matter of split seconds that  have  and will  continue  to portend  great, great, and if we let it be, omi nous indications for the future. Cer tainly the handwriting is on the wall  and has been as I said then, since 1966,  clearer on the wall than the handwrit ing  at Belshazzar's palace  f es ti val  when that handwriting, that invisible  hand wrote on the wall and it was,  ""Mena, mena, tekel,"" and simply put,  what it meant was  the deal was up,  the game was up, and this is handwrit ing that has been on the wall, and we  are complacent, with enjoyment of the  highest tide of prosperity recorded in  many-not only the 20th century, and  as pervasive in nature a state of well being.  In that period of time that we call  the post-war times, although I do not  like to refer to it that way because we  have had no  termination of World  War  II, because  there  is no peace  treaty. We have over 320,000 of our  military in West Germany alone, and  throughout the world we have a total  of  about  550,000  of  our military  throughout  the world. That  is over  half a million. When we have our dis cussions or debates on the defense ap propriations or the defense budget or  authorizations, which are now a little  over, or about $315 billion that we tax  the American people for in the name  of defense, very little if any attention  is paid-in fact, I don't say this out of  braggadocio but almost say it kind of  sadly, and almost apologetically, that  other than my voice and for the last 2  years, mine was a  sole voice.  I was  asking since 1974, about what is  the  proportion of this budget that we are  allocating for the so-called defense of  Europe. At first I was quite ridiculed,  and in fact, angered a couple of the  chair and subcommittee chairmen of  appropriations. Their answer was the  same over the course of years-they  did not know exactly. It was scattered  throughout the budget from every de partment, from resource and develop ment to every other byline  in a de fense budget. When I would answer by  saying that I had analyzed the budget  and I had figured that it was no less  than 55 to 60 percent for what we call  ""the defense of Europe,"" and the reply  was, after I asked if I was in a ballpark  range,  they would say I was  in the  ballpark.  To this day, you still have no posi tive answer as to the proportion, even  though as of this year's discussion on  the budget and on an amendment  which calls for a gradual assumption  of responsibility on the part of our  ""allies,"" this had not been mentioned,  but in the course of such a discussion  this year I did hear somebody mention  that it was in the range of 55 percent.  Mr. Speaker, my own analysis  re veals that it is closer to 65 percent.  Why would I ask that question as far  back as 1974? Well, the reason is that  in listening to all the discussions,  in  reading what the committee members  said in the committee reports to ac company the bills, and in reading the  budget recommendations of the Presi dent, it was obvious that their mind set, their perception of the world inso far as Europe was concerned, was a  perception of a 1947 Europe, certainly  not one later than 1950.  I am old enough that I can recall the  issues of that day-the environment  and the atmosphere. I remember the  smells and the sounds of that day, and  yet some cannot quite evoke that day.  But I remember that the big issue in  1949 and 1950 was this: Are we going  to allow  the German finger on the  trigger, meaning the bomb? The ques tion was the rearming of Germany.  D 1600  But that was a question that suc ceeded the diplomatic impasse and the  breakdown  among  the  victorious  powers as to what would be done with  the conquered countries  and  lands.  And,  if we read the history then as  written by the diplomats who were in volved, we  learn of the exclusion by  the European and the American diplo mats of the Russian in any discussion  having to do with a division and re sponsibility for that division of the oc cupying countries. As a result Berlin  was divided up and had a quadpartite  government. The United States ended  up with the bulk of the land mass in  what has been considered the avenue  that an invading army from the East  would  follow. But England <Great  Britain),  ended up. with  the Ruhr.  Well, this was a steel-producing and is  a steel-producing area, and the British  were very practical, as  they always  have been and continue  to be, and  they felt that it was absolutely neces sary to have control of that so that  the British steel production would not  be in jeopardy.  The  French  occupied  their  old  haunts, Alsace-Lorraine and the like,  but we ended up with about 320,000  troops that we now call defense, but  which in reality is a designation we  change from occupation and which in  real words is what we are. The French  have somewhere around 10,000. The  British have about 7,700.  But also  in the meanwhile we had  the  emergence  of  the  resurrected  Europe which finally by the Treaty of  Rome, 30 years ago this year, and I did  not see anybody marking that observa tion of that date, but we should be cause that is what gave rise to the so called European Community and a tar geted goal  for a United Europe or  U.S.E.

1566,469,17,Mr. TORRICELLI.," Mr. Speaker, although Dr.  Frederick Chien has already returned  to  the  Republic of China and assumed his new posi tion as Minister of State and Chairman of the  Council for Economic Planning and Develop ment, I rise today in tribute to him for his able  and successful representation of his country  over the last 5 years. I will remember him with  warmth and hope to see him again in the near  future.  Since 1983 when Dr. Chien came to Wash ington as Taiwan's chief representative to the  United States and I began my service in Con gress, Dr. Chien worked hard  to make sure  that his Government's views were heard in the  Halls of Congress and  the views of my col leagues and I were heard in Taipei. During his  tenure here,  the already close  ties between  the citizens of our  two  respective countries  were strengthened by Taiwan's  tremendous  economic growth and progress on political lib eralization and human rights.  I have been to the Republic of China twice.  Although the second time I arrived in Taiwan  was less than a year after my first visit, I was  surprised  to see  the visible changes  in  the  landscape of Taipei and its suburbs. The eco nomic growth and prosperity of Taiwan has  brought previously unimagined opportunities  for its citizens. At the same time, growth has  brought greater responsibility for all  levels of  Government in Taiwan. The National Govern ment and local governments are being called  upon to provide better urban planning, control  the sources of pollution, extend  consumer  protection, and provide other services.  Another responsibility of Government made  even more important by growing prosperity is  expanding the right of the citizens of the Re public of China to fully participate in political  institutions that fully reflect  the new political  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  era that Taiwan has entered. Like other Asian  countries, basic political institutions may need  to be revised.  Independent judicial authorities  should be solidified. Political assembly without  violence should be encouraged. Finally, politi cal stability is best ensured through the selec tion of elected national representatives rather  than appointed representatives.  Based on my experience of working with  able and  thoughtful  individuals such as Dr.  Chien, I believe the Republic of China is up to  the task ahead. In his new position, Dr. Chien  will be helping to lead the continuing political  and economic development of Taiwan.  It has  been a privilege  to work with him here  in  Washington. I wish him and his family the best  of good health, happiness and success as  they meet new challenges.  LARRY  W.

1567,469,17,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, as you  well know, Members of Congress meet and  speak with dozens of people each day-we  see hundreds of new faces each week.  It is  the  rare occasion when one meeting, when  one person has an overwhelming effect on a  member. It happened to me Mr. Speaker this  week when  I met a constituent of mine who  has been named the Department of Interior's  most outstanding handicapped Federal em ployee for 1988. Thirty years ago, Larry Marsh  was struck by a drunk driver. He lost both of  his  legs. He has overcome his disability by  succeeding  in a world set up  for  the able  bodied. Mr. Marsh teaches at an elementary  school in Bloomfield, NM. He is an outstand ing educator and a tremendous inspiration for  those of us fortunate enough to meet him.  I  would  like to  insert into the RECORD a letter  written by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel ex plaining Mr. Marsh's background and accom plishments.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,  OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY,  Washington, DC.  INTERIOR'S OUTSTANDING HANDICAPPED FED ERAL  EMPLOYEE  FOR  1988-LARRY W.  MARSH, BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS  Larry Marsh, a teacher with the Bureau  of Indian Affairs since 1966, is the Depart ment's selection as its Outstanding Handi capped Federal Employee of the Year. In  1958, shortly after graduating from high  school, Mr. Marsh was involved in an acci dent which subsequently resulted in a high  thigh double amputation. Determined  to  overcome his handicap, he learned to walk  on artificial legs with the aid of a cane and  to drive a car with hand controls. Through out the years, Mr. Marsh has voluntarily  provided support and assistance to numer ous accident victims who have lost limbs. He  has spent many hours encouraging  these  people and served as proof that their future  was not as bleak as it might appear. Mr.  Marsh has never allowed his handicap to  interfere with his commitment to teaching  and is considered one of the most talented  24349  and outstanding educators in the Bureau.  He has the rare gift of installing in students  the desire and motivation to learn. Many  honors and commendations have been be stowed upon him for his superior teaching  ability and willingness  to assist whenever  necessary. In 1981, teachers from 18 schools  in the area selected him as ""Teacher of the  Year,"" and in 1986, he received the Navajo  Nation Handicapped Employee of the Year  Award. More recently, he represented the  Dzith-na-o-dith-hle  School  at  a White  House awards ceremony when the school  was chosen as one of 271 schools nationwide  as an exemplary school for excellence  in  education.

1571,482,17,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, with the  final days of the historic lOOth Con gress dwindling down. I want to take a  few minutes to express my profound  respect for our colleague, the Senior  Senator from Florida, Senator CHILES.  I begin by expressing my deep regret  that he is leaving us. In this decade of  recordbreaking  budget  deficits  and  mounting Federal debt, we will sorely  miss his wisdom and experience in at tempting  to straighten out  this Na tion's fiscal mess and his effort to re store budgetary  sanity  to  the U.S.  Government.  He is a kind and good man as well as  an outstanding Senator. It has been a  privilege to work with him as a col league, and a pleasure to have him as  a friend. He came to the U.S. Senate  after having served as an officer in the  Army Artillery Corps in Korea, a col lege  instructor. an attorney, and a  Florida State legislator.  His election to the U.S. Senate in  1970 was considered a surprising upset.  After all, with little money and only a  small political base. LAWTON CHILES  defeated a former Governor of Florida  and an eight-term Congressman.  That election victory may have been  an upset, but for those who knew him,  it was no surprise. He won that elec tion with the same hard-nosed, aggres sive, and effective work habits  that  have characterized his years  in  the  Senate.  He did it by putting on his leather  hiking boots and walking. He wore out  that pair of boots as he walked 1,003  miles,  from Century,  FL,  to Key  Largo. In so doing, he learned of the  hopes and dreams, as well as the con cerns and frustrations of  the 40,000  people of his beloved State with whom  he talked during his protracted hike.  He also won their respect and approv al as they made him a U.S. Senator.  This  adventure  earned  Senator  CHILES  the  nickname  of  ""Walkin'  Lawton"" -the first of many nicknames  he has earned while running for and  serving in the U.S. Senate.  He has been labeled ""Mr. Sunshine""  for his role in securing approval of a  Federal sunshine law requiring regula tory commissions and other Govern ment agencies, and eventually, Senate  committees, to conduct more of their  business in the open.  He has been called ""Mr. Clean"" for  his emphasis on clean elections and  clean government.  In his  reelection  campaigns, Senator CHILES refused to  accept large campaign contributions or  contributions  from out-of-State con tributors. As chairman of the Senate  Governmental Subcommittee, he  led  investigations into scandals involving  the General Services Administration  and Small Business Administration  scandals.  The National Journal-November 15,  1986-called Senator CHILES a ""deficit  'hawk' "" because he is a ""budget leader  who believes fervently in the need to  straighten out the Nation's finances""  and for his attempts to grapple ""with  the Reagan-era budget deficits.""  I think the appellation ""Mr. Budget""  might be a good nickname, if one were  looking for such. It is a fitting name  for the man who has been the Senate  Democratic budget leader since 1982,  the man who has undertaken  long,  hard struggles and considerable politi cal and personal risks in trying to get  a grip on Reagan-era deficits. Senator  CHILES is a Senator who has exercised  considerable  influence  on  Federal  spending, not only in his position on  the Budget Committee but also in his  position on the Senate Appropriations  Committee, where he chairs the Sub committee  on  Labor, Health,  and  Human Services, and on the Govern mental Affairs Committee, where he  chairs the Subcommittee on Federal  Spending, Budget, and Accounting.  I am pleased and proud to point out  that when my party was in the minori ty, Senator CHILES readily cooperated  in a bipartisan effort to straighten out  this Nation's financial mess.  Only rarely, during his ordeals and  tribulations, did anyone hear a com plaint or an unkind word from  the  senior Senator from Florida. He is a  Senator who has relied on persuasion  more  than confrontation  to accom plish so many great  things for  this  Nation. And he is a Senator whose pa tience and low-key style have won him  admirers and friends.  The one blemish on his otherwise  glorious senatorial career was his bid  for the Senate Democratic leadership  in December 1984. He lost that elec tion, but he was certainly a worthy  and honorable candidate.  In fact,  I  would have voted for him had I not  been supporting the other fell ow  in  that contest. Nevertheless, I want to  take this opportunity to point out that  his challenge was a good, clean, and  decent  one, which  is  like  CHILES, hjmself. He is a good, clean,  and decent person.  It was the type of election that helps  to keep Senate Democrats alert and  LAWTON  LAWTON  aware of issues. I had always had a  high regard for Senator CHILES, but I  came from that challenge holding him  in even higher esteem.  Now he leaves us.  The Senate loses a lot of knowledge,  experience, and legislative and budget ary skills. But he leaves knowing that  he has served  the U.S. Senate,  the  people of Florida, and the people of  the United States with honor and dis tinction. And  he  leaves  behind  a  legacy of improved public policy.  Mr.  President,  Senator  CHILES has been a leader. He has been  an outstanding Senator. Most impor tant, he is a good man.  My wife, Erma, and I wish LAWTON  and his nice wife, Rhea, happiness and  success  in whatever  they undertake  after he leaves. There is life after the  U.S. Senate, and I know that Senator  LAWTON CHILES will make the most of  it-and enjoy it.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore. The clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  ",1988
1572,482,17,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore. Without objection,  it is so or dered.  to  SCHEDULE  ",1988
1573,482,17,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  in  the  brief moments that remain, prior to  going  to  the United States-Canada  Trade Agreement,  let me state suc cinctly  that Saturday sessions  from  here on out are a possibility.  I am  sorry to have to raise that possibility.  Perhaps I should call it a specter, but  it is a very real possibility. And there  may be some late sessions.  There still remains a great deal of  work to be done, including seven ap propriations conference reports, one of  which  is  the defense appropriations  authorization bill, and it is not known  what  the President will do on that  one.  There are also potential filibusters  that can occur in the Senate. There is  no way of knowing what bills  the  President may veto. There are some  very important bills to be done yet.  Minimum wage, of course, is before  the Senate.  I will  off er  a  cloture  motion before the end of the day on  that bill. This is not to say it is being  filibustered. But the Senate will not be  in  on Wednesday  because  of  the  Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur. Conse quently, I cannot wait until tomorrow  to off er a cloture motion because that  would make a cloture vote then occur  on Friday and a cloture vote, if it were  successful, would certainly  rule out  nongermane amendments. I hope that    ,  I   ""7"" .. ~  ",1988
1574,508,17,Mr. CONRAD.," Returning to agricul ture, Mr. President, I note that the oc cupant of the Chair represents a great  agricultural State,  the State of Ne braska, and that he has a keen under standing of the effect of this agree ment. It is critical to understand how  very different the United States and  Canadian farm programs are.  The U.S. program, whether we like  it on not, is primarily a supply man agement program. That means our  farm program is designed to store sur plus grain in years of bounty and to  sell it to the world in years of short age. The objective is to mitigate the  weather related boom-bust cycle in ag riculture.  For example, during the first half of  the 1980's, beneficial weather led to  the accumulation of the largest grain  stockpiles  in world history. At  the  same time, the growth rate of world  food demand dropped sharply, due to  a world wide  recession. U.S.  grain  stocks rose to historic highs. By late  1985, we had a year's domestic and  export supply of wheat and nearly a  year's supply of feed grains in storage.  In the last 3 years, changing weather  patterns and an aggressive export sub sidy  program  allowed  the United  States to reduce stocks substantially.  World grain stocks by the end of 1988  will be at the lowest levels since 1973.  The U.S. farm program also calls for  the set-aside of productive land until  the surplus stocks are worked off. In  1988 alone, 80 million acres of farm land were  set-aside-including  27 .5  percent of wheat acres.  In contrast  to  the United States  farm program, the Canadian farm pro gram  is designed  to move Canadian  grain  to  export  terminals  and  to  obtain the best possible price for their  farmers  in the world market. To do  this, Canada heavily  subsidizes  rail  transport  from  the grain producing  areas of Canada to port cities. In addi tion, the Canadian Wheat Board acts  as an agent for export sales of all Ca nadian wheat as well as other prod ucts.  Mr. President, at this point in the  RECORD  I would like to have printed  two tables that I think highlight the  differences between our program and  the Canadian program.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  Chart I is an index of U.S. and our com petitors' exports. I chose the 1980/81 mar keting year as  the base year-setting  it  equal to 100-in order to create the export  index. As you can see, while the U.S. suffered a major market loss in the 1980's which we are now regaining due to export  subsidies and a falling dollar, our competi tors have increased their exports by about  30 percent.

The  the 1980-81 marketing year was set equal  volume .of exports  for  to 100  to  set the base year for the  index.  Chart II is an index of U.S. and our com petitors' levels of production. Again, I have  chosen the 1980-81 crop year as the base  year. While the U.S. program is designed to  cut back production  in years of surplus  stocks, the Canadian program and those of  our other competitors are not. While U.S.  production in the past few years  is down  more than 10 percent from 1980, Canadian  production  is up, as  is that of our other  competitors.

1575,508,17,Mr. CONRAD.," Like  it or not,  the  effect of our current program during  periods of world surplus is to reduce  U.S. production while our competitors  increase theirs.  In the last 2 years, the United States  has experienced an influx of Canadian  wheat, particularly durum or pasta  wheat which is a high quality wheat  grown in North Dakota, Montana, and  Canada. The United States produces  more than twice the durum demanded  by American consumers, but in spite of  domestic surpluses, Canadian imports  took 15 percent or more of the United  States market.  It is most disturbing that this trend  occurred at a  time  that the United  States had ample supplies of wheat in cluding durum; at a  time when the  CCC was conducting massive sales of  wheat to reduce their stocks; at a time  when U.S. wheat prices, adjusted for  inflation, where at an 18-year low; and  at a time when nearly three-fourths of  U.S. wheat needed EEP-subsidies-to  be exported at all.  ",1988
1576,521,17,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, later today we will be voting on  the United States-Canada Free-Trade  Agreement.  Based on what I have heard so far  during Senate debate,  I expect that  the Senate will probably follow  the  House of Representatives  in voting,  perhaps overwhelmingly  in  favor of  the agreement.  Although it will not be a source of  great joy to anyone, it has been a diffi cult task coming up with this improve ment. Those of us on  the Finance  Committee who  have been dealing  with this issue now for several years  know how difficult it has been to con struct an agreement that satisfies the  needs of all constituencies and at the  same time passes political muster in  two different countries. We have had  in our committee a history of close  votes leading up to this issue but when  it finally passed, it was by a large vote,  indicating that a great deal of effort  has been put in on the part of the  members of the Finance Committee in  making sure that this is a bill which  while it may not meet everyone's ex pectations does as good a  job as a  nation like ours can do to try to start  to set  the pace of more  reasonable  trade relations with our best neighbor  and hopefully eventually with all of  our neighbors and all of our trading  partners.  But I do not think that the margin  of these votes should be construed as  signifying that any of us on the com mittee are  totally satisfied with all  four corners of this agreement. I do  not know any member of the commit tee is.  If this agreement is ultimately im plemented, and I emphasize the word  ""if"" because  there are some doubts  that the Canadian opposition liberal  party will allow the agreement to go  into effect before a national election, I  think it will represent an important  first  step  toward building  a North  American free trade zone.  Elimination of all  tariffs between  the United States and Canada over 10  years could very well serve as a model  for the rest of the world to show that  the United States and its largest trad ing partner, Canada, have taken a first  step  in  creating  an  open  trading  border.  On average, Canadian tariffs gener ally are twice as high as American tar iffs, and elimination of  those  tariffs  over the next 10 years should enhance  trade between the two countries.  This could be especially beneficial to  the citizens of Minnesota. Our State's  bilateral trade with Canada last year  totaled $3 billion, of which almost $1  billion represented Minnesota exports.  More than 40,000 Minnesota jobs are  tied directly or indirectly to this trade  relationship.  Ending tariffs as high as 17 percent  on high-technology products,  includ ing computers and medical equipment,  will be a tremendous benefit to Minne sota's high-technology companies, like  3M, Control Data, and Cray.  Although we are a major agriculture  State, I think it is important to note  that  high-technology  products  are  Minnesota's No. 1 export to Canada.  Nearly half of Minnesota's imports  from Canada consist of petroleum and  natural gas products.  This  agreement will  enhance  all  Minnesotans' energy security because  it provides for free and open energy  trade between the two countries and  assures our citizens that they will con tinue to have access to Canadian oil  and natural gas during times of energy  shortage such as we experienced  in  the early and latter part of the last  decade.  Minnesota  currently  imports  $90  million per year of hydro power from  Manitoba. The agreement assures. a  continuation of this electrical power  from  non-polluting  hydro power  sources in Canada.  Not only will this assure an inexpen sive source of electricity for the State,  but it lessens our dependence on fossil  fueled powerplants which are a major  source of acid rain and contribute to  the alarming trend of global warming.  I would also note that this agree ment takes a first step in establishing  rules allowing American service com panies  to  compete  for  business  in  Canada and takes a small step toward  opening up investment for American  companies in that nation.  These are first steps that should be  built upon in future negotiations with  the Canadians.  Mr.  President,  there  are  several  areas where  I  think  this agreement  could have been improved upon.  I would have hoped that the nego tiators would have made real progress  in reducing the heavily subsidized and  regulated Canadian agricultural pro gram which, in effect, prevents many  ",1988
1577,534,17,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to express my restrained sup port for  the pending United States Canada Free-Trade Agreement [FI'Al  now before the Senate. The FI' A's pas sage today by this body is another step  in a long road to improving trade rela tions with  our northern  neighbor.  Those involved with this process, on  both sides of the border, deserve credit  for their efforts. While I have serious  reservations regarding the agreement,  I support its passage.  As a strong supporter of free trade,  the FI' A's passage provides an  in crease  in trade activity between the  world's  largest  trading  partnership,  the United States and Canada, with  approximately $166 billion  in goods  and services crossing the border each  year. Canada currently purchased 22  percent of America's exports, and for  the last 5 years has been our fastest  growing export market, with United  States export sales  increasing by 39  percent compared to a growth rate of  less  than 7 percent for all overseas  sales. Like most of my colleagues, I  have every expectation that these fig ures will dramatically  increase as a  result of the FI' A's implementation.  On the national level, the FI' A con tains  several  key  elements which  should be noted and which will simul taneously be positive  forces on  the  States. These include:  The elimination of all  tariffs and  many  other  restrictions  on  traded  goods within 10 years. This is especial ly  beneficial when Canadian  tariff  rates now average twice the rate of av erage United States tariffs.  The opportunity of  free  trade  in  over 150 service sectors, thus guaran teeing national and equitable  treat ment to service providers.  The possibility of a better  invest ment climate in Canada. This is ac complished by eliminating the Canadi an screening of  indirect  investment  over  the next 5 years,  raising  the  threshold for review of direct invest ment  from  $5 million Canadian  to  $150 million Canadian and bans the  imposition of most  investment per formance requirements.  The preservation of each country's  right  to apply existing antidumping  and  countervailing duty  [AD/CVDl  laws. The FTA alters existing trade  remedy laws by establishing a bina tional panel to make a final decision in  trade remedy cases.  I am also encouraged by other fig ures the administration has provided  to demonstrate the FT A's benefits for  the United States. The FT A should  result in a 1-percent increase, or about  $45  billion,  in  the U.S. GNP,  and  create nearly 750,000 jobs. This should  lead to an increase in United States  exports to Canada of about $2.4 billion  per year, and decrease consumer prices  thus saving United States households  between $1 and $3.5 billion a year.  On the State level, the FT A should  provide greater economic opportuni ties for Utah than it is currently en joying. Whereas the United States cur rently  runs  a  trade  deficit with  ",1988
1578,547,17,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  in support of  the United  States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement.  This historic agreement will eliminate  trade and investment barriers between  the largest trading partnership in the  world. Last year, over $130 billion in  goods and services crossed the United  States-Canadian  border. The  Free Trade Agreement will contribute  to  the growth of the American economy  by expanding opportunities for trade  and investment and by creating more  job opportunities and a larger market  for U.S. products and services.  Mr. President, today an estimated 2  million American jobs depend on ex ports  to Canada. Canada purchased  more than a fifth of all American ex ports and for the last 5 years has been  our  fastest growing  export market.  American  exports  to Canada  alone  equal our exports to all 12 members of  the European Economic Community  and more than twice the value of our  exports to Japan.  South Carolina alone exported 418  million dollars' worth of commodities  to Canada in 1986 according  to the  United States Department of Com merce. Major South Carolina export-;  included fabrics, textile fabricated ma terials,  yam  and  thread,  chemical  products,  transportation  equipment,  motor vehicle engines, engine parts,  rubber products, hand  tools,  textile  machinery, and electric lighting.  On the other hand, South Carolina  imported 451 million dollars' worth of  commodities from Canada in 1986.  Tourism is a vital industry to South  Carolina and is heavily supported by  Canada.  In 1986,  321,300 Canadian  tourists spent $48 million  in South  Carolina.  Under this agreement, South Caroli na consumers and manufacturers will  benefit  from  reduced prices  and  a  greater diversity of available products  brought about by greater competition  and more  efficient  business  oper ations. South Carolina manufacturers  will experience great gains in the Ca nadian market.  Many of my colleagues may question  whether supporting the trade bill, the  textile bill,  and  the United States Canada Free-Trade Agreement is  in consistent. Mr. President, there is no  inconsistency. In fact, this agreement  represents  the position  that  I have  been advocating all along.  I have always supported fair trade as  opposed  to  free  trade. Free  trade  works only when all countries engage  in this practice, but as we know, most  do not. I feel that we must take meas ures,  such  as  the United  States Canada  Free-Trade Agreement,  to  insure our domestic industries are not  victim  of  unfair  trade  practices  abroad.  The United  States-Canada  Free Trade Agreement  ensures not only  free trade, but. also fair trade. As long  as there is fair trade, I am confident  American industries can compete with  any other nation.  On  January  2,  Reagan said thatPresident  1988,  In the truest sense, this is a historic agree ment for both sides. We will strengthen  what is already a deep friendship between  our people by enhanCinl( economic opportu nities and creating jobs in both countries.  Moreover, the agreement firmly establishes  that the trade environment between the two  countries will in the future be founded on  the principle of free and open trade.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to support  this measure which will  ensure not only free trade, but more  importantly fair trade.  ",1988
1579,547,17,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of the United States Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Free  trade is a worthwhile goal. If we can  reach  that  goal,  both  the United  States and Canada will benefit.  Nearly a year ago, when the outlines  of  the United States-Canada Free Trade  Agreement  were  first  an nounced, I had several serious reserva tions. There was a great concern in the  Midwest and West that Canadian sup pliers would have an unfair advantage  in agricultural and natural  resource  products. It was felt that this advan tage would result from subsidies the  Canadian national or provincial gov ernments provide producers. For ex ample, Canadian wheat producers cur rently are allowed to ship their grain  on Canadian railroads at a ver.y  low  rate. Canadian hog producers benefit  from provincial subsidies. This could  give Canadian farmers an unfair ad vantage in the international market.  In an effort to address these agricul tural and natural resources concerns, I  joined a number of other Western U.S.  Senators in urging the administration  to consider changes  in the enabling  legislation. The administration did a  very good job of working with Canada  and Congress to address our concerns.  I am pleased to say that most of them  were resolved. Most agricultural orga nizations now support the agreement,  or do not oppose its adoption.  South Dakota businesses in general  support  the Free-Trade Agreement.  They  expect  the  agreement  will  expand  their markets. Some  small  businesses  that have never exported  their products see the agreement as an  opportunity  to begin exporting, and  thus expanding their businesses. For  example, a small auto parts dealer in  Aberdeen, SD, contacted me recently  to ask when the agreement would be  adopted. He already had made a deal  to sell parts in Canada. However, the  current Canadian customs would make  the sale unprofitable. If the duty is  eliminated,  the  sale would  become  profitable.  The  Free-Trade Agree ment, if approved, should help many  small businesses expand their markets.  The agreement should benefit both  the United States and Canada. Some  businesses may be adversely affected  by  the agreement, but, overall,  the  benefits far outweigh any losses. The  agreement  would  increase  United  States exports to Canada by an esti mated $2.4 billion annually. U.S. con sumers would save an estimated $1 to  $3.5 billion annually  from  increased  competition  created by  the  treaty.  Clearly, the United States would bene fit from the agreement.  Mr. President,  the United States Canada Free-Trade Agreement creates  great economic opportunities. It is a  landmark accomplished, and I support  its adoption.  ",1988
1580,547,17,Mr. WEICK.,"ER. Mr. President, I rise  in  support  of  the United  States Canada Free-Trade Agreement. I be lieve this agreement will benefit New  England and the Nation in expanding  our trading relationship with our larg est trading partner, Canada. Connecti cut has approximately $2 billion of  trade with Canada which will be en hanced by the elimination of tariffs  between our two countries. Removing  the large number of trade barriers and  discriminatory  practices  that  have  been erected can only enhance  the  flow of trade and allow our nations to  grow.  The scope of the Free-Trade Agree ment  is  impressive.  Canada  will  expand its Government procurement  markets to United States businesses.  American financial services and invest ments  in Canada will be given  far  greater opportunities under the agree ment. Future trade disputes will be re solved by a new Binational Commis sion which will hopefully reduce the  frictions  we  have  experienced  in  recent years.  This agreement is testimony to the  alliance of our two countries. There  are no guarantees and the agreement  ",1988

1600,586,17,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, Novem ber 9, 1988 marks the 50th anniversary  of the ""Kristallnacht,"" the Night of  the Broken Glass, in which partisans  of the Third Reich pillaged Jewish owned  synagogues,  businesses  and  homes. Many Jews were killed and  thousands were arrested. This act ef fectively  revealed  the  anti-Semitic  Nazi plan openly not only before Ger many and Austria, but before  the  entire world. Franklin Delano Roose velt ""      could scarcely believe that  such things could occur in a 20th cen tury civilization.""  The Kristallnacht  served  as  the  manifestation of Hitler's anti-Semitic  program which  had  been  initiated  shortly after he gained power in 1933.  Subsequently,  Jewish  citizens  there  were  stripped of  their  civil  rights,  their  right  to  gainful  employment,  their property and  indeed, all  that  they have ever worked for. Jews were  subjected to exorbitant ""flight"" taxes  and were forced  to pay for damages  wrought by Nazi agents. Ownership of  Jewish businesses was forcibly turned  over to ""Aryan"" hands.  Several months after the Kristall nacht, Hitler publicly promised the de struction of the Jewish people.  Fifty years later, we commemorate  this event to show resolve and intoler ance for government-sponsored pers ecution anywhere in the world. As the  Jews suffered unspeakable ills, remem brance also asks for  rededication  to  the freedoms and concerns for civil  rights which are the foundations of  our  democratic  society.  For,  ""the  secret of redemption  lies  in remem brance.""  COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF  KRISTALLNACHT  ",1988
1601,586,17,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to bear witness to two sig nificant events: the 50th anniversary  of Kristallnacht and the 13th anniver sary of the decision by the U.N. Gen eral Assembly  to declare Zionism a  form of racism and racial discrimina tion.  There are  some who would  take  strong  exception  to  the  linkage of  these two dates. After all, they might  ask, is it right to compare the destruc tion of synagogues and stores with a  mere vote in the General Assembly?  Do we not trivialize the Holocaust if  we declare that such a vote, no matter  how offensive  to our political  and  moral sensibilities, is in any way simi lar to the first sustained, nationwide  attack in a war of genocide?  And yet this linkage was made by a  wise man, who weighs his words with  the care of the Talmud scholar he was  trained to be. Thirteen years ago No vember 10, Chaim Herzog, Israel's Per manent Representative to the United  Nations, stood before the General As sembly and spoke to the world about  Kristallnacht and about the vote the  Assembly was to take.  ""It was the night which led to the  most  terrifying Holocaust  in human  history,"" he declared, ""the night  in  which the world, by its collective si lence, assured the leaders of the Third  Reich that they could do what they  pleased  to  the Jewish people."" And  now, Chaim Herzog  suggested,  the  General Assembly was being asked to  legitimatize the efforts of those who  could ""complete the work of the final  solution  by  destroying  the  Jewish  people and the Jewish State.""  It  Senators speak  today because  the  world ignored the lessons of Kristall nacht. How well have we understood  the lessons of the 1975 vote equating  Zionism with racism?  The sad truth is that after an initial  flurry of indignation, most of Israel's  friends  around  the world  chose  to  ignore or even  forget  this vote.  wasn't until 4 years ago, when newly  elected  President  of  Israel Chaim  Herzog convened a conference at his  Jerusalem residence, that any system atic effort was made by Israel's sup porters  to  refute and examine  this  monstrous lie.  There has been scattered writings on  the  subject previously,  and  as  the  years passed we seemed bit by bit to  learn more of the genesis of that 1975  event. First Bernard Lewis published  an article in Foreign Affairs in 1976, in  which he traced the roots of the Zion sim-racism charge to the Soviet prac tice of seeking to discredit ethnic as sertiveness in the vast Russian Empire  that is the U.S.S.R.  ""In  the  technical  vocabulary  of  Soviet  vituperation,""  Lewis  wrote,  ""The term racist is applied to nation alist movements linking the non-Slavic  peoples of the Union with their kin  elsewhere.       And its extension of  Zionism     a  kind of pan-Judaism,  with a focus  in Israel-is a develop ment of its use against pan-Turkism  and pan-Iranism.""  Charles Fairbanks and others have  recorded that during the early 1950's,  the term ""Zionist"" was introduced as a  euphemism for Jew in official Soviet  anti-Semitism.  I have given any number of speeches  on the subject, and have devoted por tions of three books to it: ""A Danger ous Place"" 0978), of which an Israeli  edition in Hebrew has been published,  ""Counting Our Blessings"" 0980), and  ""Loyalties"" 0984).  In the course of all  this we have  gotten a pretty good grip on the Soviet  origins of the event.  The disastrous showing of the Soviet  Union's clients  in the 1967 Six Day  War apparently prompted the Soviets  to launch the ambitious propaganda  campaign that led ultimately to No vember 10, 1975.  As I wrote in ""Loyalties"":  Three  events  occurred.  Israel  over whelmed its combined Arab neighbors, most  of whom were armed by and clients of the  Soviet Union. Second, the United States for  the first time came to the aid of Israel in a  military crisis. Henceforth, the Middle East  was setting in which Soviet arms would face  American arms. Finally, the Israeli victory        ""generated  enormous  enthusiasm  among Soviet Jews."" Zionism had proven  itself in battle.  Having failed  to destroy Israel be cause-and  this  is  important-Israel  could now  rely on  the aid of  the  United States, the Soviet Union took  another course, and set out to under",1988
1602,599,17,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  yield such time to the Senator from Il linois, Senator SIMON, who was chair man of the House Education Commit tee and has been one of  the most  active, if not the most active, members  of our committee in the areas of edu cation. I am delighted to hear from  the Senator.  ",1988
1603,599,17,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I thank  my colleague. I was in my office and I  heard his  remarks about  this great  background that Dr. Cavazos has in  both Massachusetts  and Texas and  that that  is a great combination.  I  assume that Senator THuRMOND, Sena tor DoLE, and other colleagues on the  floor today also think that Massachu setts-Texas  combination  is  a  great  combination.  Let me simply add that I am very  pleased that Dr. Cavazos is the nomi nee here. When I chaired the Higher  Education  Subcommittee  in  the  House, I held hearings on the whole  question of Hispanics in higher educa tion, because,  frankly,  the Hispanic  population in our country is, in some  ways, an untapped resource.  One of the witnesses before my sub committee was Dr. Cavazos. He made  an excellent impression then. He has  made an excellent impression I think  on all of us since that time. I think his  appointment is a sound appointment.  I believe he will be a Secretary of  Education who, candidly,  is probably  not going to bring as much visibility to  the Department of Education as the  current Secretary of Education, but I  think will  accomplish  a  great deal  more in terms of being willing to work  with the Members of the Senate and  the House. And getting the job done  is, after all, what  the ball game  is  really all about.  I certainly am going to vote for his  confirmation and I welcome  this ap pointment by the President.  ",1988

It is  a good appointment. I think it recog nizes the fact, too, that education is a  matter that crosses party lines. Educa tion is not a partisan matter.  I hope, with the appointment of Dr.  Cavazos,  that some of  the divisions  that have occurred  in  the past be tween  the Department of Education  and the educational community can be  healed and that we can see a fresh  start made in this regard. This is an  appointment that I am happy to sup port, and trust he will be approved  unanimously.  I am very glad to see my colleague  and  ranking minority member,  the  Senator from Vermont, on the floor.  is so often the case,  this  is one  more instance where we have similar  views.  I yield the floor.  ",1988
1611,599,17,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, we vote  today on the nomination of Larry Ca vazos  to be Secretary of Education.  For those of us from Texas, this is a  time of great pride, and I  think  it  should be a  time of great pride for  every American.  Larry Cavazos is a remarkable man.  He is a  remarkable man in part be cause of his humble beginnings. He  was born on the King Ranch. His dad  was a cowboy. When we got out of  high school, he joined the Army. He  came out of the Army and worked his  way  through  college  and  graduate  school,  went  into  academics,  and  became dean of the medical school at  Tufts University in Massachusetts.  He went on to become president of a  great university, Texas Tech Universi ty in Lubbock, TX. And today he be comes the first educator of America.  As  It is a great testament to Larry Ca vazos and his family that he has risen  from the son of a cowboy to become  the first educator of America.  But, Mr. President, it is more than a  testament to this remarkable man and  his remarkable family. It is a  testa ment  to America.  I  think  it proves  once again that the American system  is alive and well;  that it still works;  that hard work and God-given talent,  when  combined  in  a  free  society,  produce extraordinary results.  So  I  believe  that Larry Cavazos  should be approved by a unanimous  vote in the Senate.  I look forward to working with him  during his service as Secretary of Edu cation. He is committed to quality edu cation for all of our citizens; commit ted to seeing that every child has an  opportunity  to develop  that child's  abilities, to allow that child to com pete on the playing field and to use his  talents  to benefit himself  and  his  family and America.  So, Mr. President,  I urge my col leagues to join me in voting for a re markable man whose life is an Ameri can success story and whose service as  Secretary of Education, which quite  frankly I hope will extend into  the  next administration, will be something  that all Americans can be proud of;  will be a service that will contribute  greatly  to upgrading  the quality of  education which represents the high est aspiration of the American people.  I yield the floor, Mr. President.  ",1988

I  think  there  maybe a way of resolving this, but it is  going to take some effort by both the  distinguished Senator from Massachu setts and myself to do so. I think we  might be able to do so, but I surely  think my off er to take his amendment  on the full-time student training wage,  or really subminimum is what that is,  ought to be combined with my sugges tion to take my idea on the training  wage for all others who never held a  job. It just makes sense.  ",1988

1622,625,17,Mr. HATCH., I yield.  ,1988
1623,625,17,Mr. DECONCINI., Had the Senator  considered  less  than 90 days  for  a  training wage?  ,1988
1624,625,17,Mr. HATCH.," I would consider any  reasonable offer, because I would like  to get the concept implemented and  see if it works. If it does not work, I  will stand reproved.  ",1988
1625,625,17,Mr. DECONCINI.," If the Senator will  yield, it is my observation that 90 days  is probably more than what is neces sary in many entry-level Jobs. But the  concept, I think, has a lot of merit to  it and we ought to try it.  Nobody has  the perfect  legislation  out here ever, and  this  is so much  preferable,  I  think,  than a  student  subminimum wage  just for students.  This  is  for  any  entry-level  person  while they get trained on the Job.  The only suggestion I have, and it is  only that-to my friend from Utah maybe 90 days  is a bit  too  long a  period of  time  for  someone  to be  trained for a job.  ",1988
1626,625,17,Mr. HATCH.," If my friend will yield  a few seconds more, I would be inter ested in my friend from Arizona help ing to bring us together on this be cause I am open to any reasonable sug gestion, as long as it is enough period  of  time  to  really give  incentive  to  small business to hire people and give  them a chance. If it is enough period  of time and it will give them a chance  and help save a lot of these people and  get them in the work force and give  them the experience and self-esteem  that comes from working, I think that  would be a worthwhile thing to do.  It is not Just a matter of standing  here  trying  to  stifle  the minimum  wage bill. It is  trying to fight for a  principle  that  literally  I  think we  made a pretty good case for and not  just accepting old cliches. We should  try something new.  If we can do that, then let us talk  about where the three-tier minimum  wage should go  this year, and I am  willing to do that. Then I think we can  resolve this and dispose of this matter  in a reasonable way, and I think most  Republicans and most all Democrats  would probably breathe a sigh of relief  and say that is a reasonable way to do  it. We do not have to have this in the  middle of politics all the time. Maybe  there is a way of resolving this prob lem.  So  I will  leave  that offer on  the  table. If we can do it, it will be great.  If we cannot, then I guess we have to  fight it out here, because I  think we  are fighting for principle with regard  to the training wage.

1634,625,17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is recognized.  ,1988
1635,625,17,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  before I begin, I will ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  a letter dated August 4 from Califor nia energy and environmental agen cies, in which it is stated that the bill  that we are about to discuss is critical  to air quality, public health, energy ef ficiency, and energy security strategies  of California.  Mr. President, I am pleased that the  Senate is today considering the confer ence report on S. 1518, my bill, cospon sored by over 60 of our colleagues, to  faster the manufacture of alternative  fuel motor vehicles. We have brought  back  from our conference with  the  other body a strong bill that preserves  the principles embodied in the Senate  bill.  The strong support for this legisla tion in both Houses of Congress is a  reflection of the many benefits the bill  will provide. The bill encourages pro duction of automobiles that can run  on methanol, ethanol, and natural gas.  These clean burning fuels can help im prove air quality in cities struggling  with smog. Alternative fuels can also  help reduce our dangerous dependence  on  imported oil. Finally,  they can  bring jobs home to domestic producers  of the f eedstocks for alternative fuels.  This could mean new markets for the  grain from our farm States and new  jobs from Alaska to Texas to West Vir ginia and other States where natural  gas is found. As technology develops,  it could mean new  jobs  in the coal  fields of States like West Virginia, as  coal is used to produce methanol.  The bill encourages production of al ternative  fuel vehicles by providing  manufacturers of such vehicles with  limited incentive increases toward the  average fuel economy standards which  must be met by each manufacturer.  The conference agreement also adopts,  in modified form, House provisions au thorizing a moderate, but useful, pro gram  to demonstrate and  to  learn  more about alternative fuel vehicles.  A noteworthy feature of this bill is  its careful balancing of several impor tant  economic,  environmental,  and  energy policy goals. For example, an  essential aspect of the Senate bill was  our effort to ensure that, in encourag ing alternative fuels, we also maintain  the strength of the existing fuel econ omy program. This was accomplished  by placing a cap on the fuel economy  incentives that could be earned under  the bill for production of dual fuel ve hicles.  ",1988
1636,703,17,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today in support of H.R. 517, legisla tion to rename the Soldier Creek Di version Unit in Topeka, KS on behalf  of Lewis M. Paramore, who was instru mental in coordinating the flood con trol program for the Topeka, KS area.  Lewis Paramore,  in his  long  life,  worked tirelessly to create the Corps  of Engineers developed Soldier Creek  Diversion Unit after the devestating  1951 flood in Topeka.  This bill to change the name was ini tially introduced in the 99th Congress,  but because of the rush to complete  the conference  report of  the Water  Resources Development Act, its inclu sion was omitted.  H.R.  517 was  subsequently  intro duced in the lOOth Congress with the  understanding  that this met all the  criteria of the House and Senate Com mittees of  jurisdiction. The Environ ment and Public Works Committee  was prepared to consider H.R. 517 late  last year, but it was discovered that  the Federal Government does not ac tually hold title to the property, al though the corps  twice annually  in spects the unit. Federal ownership is  the only criteria of this name-change  legislation that H.R. 517 fails to meet.  I want to thank the committee for  being so responsive to the enormous  constituent support for H.R. 517, by  considering and approving the name  change. The people of Topeka are well  served by  this project and the man  who is synonymous with its develop ment should be remembered accord ingly.  The bill <H.R. 517) was ordered to be  read a third time, was read the third  time, and passed.  ",1988

1640,716,17,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, the Com puter Matching and Privacy Protec tion Act, S. 496, was  introduced by  Senator COHEN and myself in Febru ary 1987 and passed by the Senate,  unanimously, last December. The bill  was then ref erred to the House Sub committee on Government  Inf orma tion, Justice, and Agriculture of the  Committee  on Governmental Oper ations. Under the leadership of my col league, Congressman GLENN ENGLISH,  that subcommittee held hearings on  the bill and suggested improvements  in its text. In July, the House passed  S. 496 with an amendment and  re turned the legislation to the Senate.  Staffs from both bodies and both sides  of the aisle  then met, discussed  the  issues, and resolved their differences.  The bill before you  today incorpo rates the best of the two earlier ver sions  approved  by  our  respective  bodies. It is one that both Houses can  and should support. Over the past few  years, the Subcommittee on Oversight  of Government Management, under  Senator COHEN'S leadership, conduct ed lengthy investigations and hearings  reviewing the issues related to comp puter matching. As members of  the  subcommittee, we heard repeated de scriptions of the problems with Feder al practices, including inaccurate data,  poor control over the records, lack of  oversight and lack of statutory guid ance. This bill provides a reasonable  statutory  scheme  to  resolve  those  problems.  Federal benefit programs  rely on  computers, not only to store inf orma tion about assistance provided to par ticular beneficiaries but also to uncov er irregularities and fraud that may be  hidden within  the Federal  system.  Computer matching programs are an  increasingly popular means  to check  applicants' eligibility for Federal bene fits and to discover possible fraud. By  directing their computers to compare  two or more sets of agency records,  Federal workers  can quickly  cross check various facts. Such procedures  improve  the  efficient  and  effective  review of beneficiary programs.  At the same time, however, comput ers and computer matching programs  are not infallible. Mistakes can be and  are made. One obvious problem is that  computers often have outdated or in correct data. Other problems  arise  from computer operators who mistak enly  enter wrong  information  or  design faulty programs.  Consider,  for  example,  a  State  agency which conducted a 1983 com puter match of welfare records and  local  bank  records.  The matching  project identified a large number of individuals with bank assets seemingly  in excess of  the program's require ments. The agency did not, however,  immediately cut off these individuals'  benefits; it first gave each beneficiary  a chance to explain. The agency later  determined that the computer match  had an error rate of 94 percent. That  means that 94 percent of the people  identified  in the match as  ineligible  were, in fact, eligible to receive their  benefits. Experiences  like  this  one  demonstrates that computer matching  programs are only useful when care fully administered.  In addition to the specter of inaccu rate data, computer matching prac tices threaten the privacy rights of in dividuals.  Unrestrained  matching  projects could lead to the compilation  of detailed computer files on every in dividual or to the Government's im proper release or use of personal inf or mation.  To  prevent  such  abuses,  agency  records used  in matches, as  well as the resulting data, should be  safeguarded  during  their  use  and  either destroyed  or  returned upon  completion of the project.  The bill before you today provides  needed statutory controls over Federal  use of computer matching. It creates a  statutory scheme in which each Feder al agency  is  required  to process  its  computer matching projects in an or derly fashion under the watchful eye  of an agency data  integrity board.  Each matching project must proceed  under a document setting forth  its  terms and procedures,  including  the  records to be matched, the treatment  of the records after the match, the use  of the resulting data, and the means  by which  the data will be verified.  Most  importantly,  the bill prohibits  the  termination of  any  individual's  benefits on the basis of matching data  until the relevant agency first verifies  that data and gives  the individual a  chance to respond.  These are commonsense safeguards.  The controls are comprehensive but  flexible, permitting agencies to tailor  their matches to their needs but re quiring them to think through protec tions for the individuals involved. The  rules represent the collective wisdom  of many groups and individuals who  have been  tracking  this  issue  since  computer matching first appeared in  the Federal arena.  I com.mend Senator COHEN  for his  continuing efforts  in  this  important  area and for his ability to produce leg islation that enjoys the consensus sup port of the groups interested in and  affected by  its provisions. The bill  before us now is the culmination of lit erally years of work wrestling with  issues of efficiency, privacy, effective ness, and fairness. Its provisions are  workable, sensible, and sorely needed.  This bill merits  the Senate's unani mous support, and I urge all my col",1988
1641,729,17,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me first commend  the chairman of the full committee,  the gentleman from Mississippi CMr.  MONTGOMERY],  for  his  outstanding  leadership in bringing this and other  legislation to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of  the Veterans' Health Care Pro grams Amendments of 1988.  While I support H.R. 5114 in its en tirety, I want to focus on the nurse re cruitment and retention provisions be cause of my particular concerns about  the nationwide shortage of nurses.  In the past several weeks, I have vis ited VA medical centers around the  country, and I have seen confirmation  that  the  shortage  of  nurses  has  reached crisis proportions.  At the Denver Medical Center, for  example, there was a shortage of 10  nurses reported in a recent survey by  the committee. In the short time since  the survey was made, Denver has lost  20 more nurses.  Our bill, H.R. 5114 would provide  $1,500 of special pay per year for full  time nurses over and above their regu lar pay, and it further would provide  for incentive pay, with combined spe cial and incentive pay of up to $7,000  per year.  Practical or vocational nurses and  nursing assistants would also be made  eligible for Saturday premium pay.  A major attraction for retired mili tary nurses would be a provision ex empting them from any offset of their  retirement pay,  if they work as VA  nurses.  These enhancements will help great ly, but we must continue to work on  the nurse shortage.  Additional study and initiatives will  be necessary in the next Congress, and  I look forward to working with my col leagues on them.  In matters of veterans health care,  nobody can beat the team of MONT GOMERY and HAMMERSCHMIDT, as chair man and ranking member of our Sub committee on Hospitals and Health  Care, their dedication and experience  has been of enormous benefit to mil lions of veterans, and today's legisla tion is only the latest example.  Mr.  Speaker,  this  bill  has  been  unanimously  reported by  the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and  I urge  this body to likewise give H.R. 5114  unanimous support.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume  to the former ranking  member of the Committee on Veter ans' Affairs, the distinguished gentle man  from Arkansas CMr.  HAMMER SCHMIDT].  ",1988
1642,729,17,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for  yielding me this time, and I thank him  for those complimentary words.  Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Hospitals and  Health Care, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 5114, which will be the Veter ans' Affairs Committee's final health  care bill of the lOOth Congress. I am  proud of the progress our committee  under  the bipartisan  leadership  of  Chairman SONNY MONTGOMERY  and  ranking member JERRY SOLOMON has  accomplished in health care legislation  for veterans.  The bill before us provides for sever al badly needed recruitment and reten tion  incentives  for nurses;  it allows  Civil Service health-care personnel to  be hired without competitive exams if  they have recognized degrees or certif icates and have completed VA clinical  education programs.  It extends au thority for grants of $1 million for 3  years to the Veterans Memorial Medi cal Center in the Philippines.  A very important provision would re quire a 2-year pilot program for im proved collections from third parties,  and would also give a split of receipts  between the Treasury, the local medi cal center, and  the Department of  Medicine and Surgery.  In this way,  there would be greater incentives for  effective collection.  And,  finally, while I have not ad dressed nearly all of H.R. 5114's sec tions in the interest of brevity, I do  want  to  note  that  this  legislation  would extend for another 3 years the  V A's authority for the terribly impor tant contracts with halfway houses  and community facilities to give treat ment to veterans with alcohol or drug  abuse facilities.  We all know too well how serious the  drug and alcohol problems are which  face our country, and it is important  to recognize  the significant role  the  VA plays both in its own facilities and  in contract programs.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is  an excellent  finale  for veterans health care  this  session, and  I commend  the efforts  and support of all of the members of  the committee.  ",1988

1647,742,17,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of H.R. 5263,  reauthorizing  the activities of the Overseas Private  Investment Corporation and making  supplemental authorizations of appro priations for the Board for Interna tional Broadcasting. This legislation is  brought before the House today as a  purely procedural matter, as a way to  provide the Senate with a second vehi cle to renew the basic authorities of  the Overseas Private Investment Cor poration.  As Members will recall, in May the  House passed H.R. 4471, reauthorizing  OPIC. In passing that bill, the House  attached as title III the text of H.R.  3100,  the foreign aid bill which had  passed the House in 1987 but had yet  to be considered in the Senate.  This bill, H.R. 5263, includes titles I  and II of H.R. 4471 as it passed the  House, but not title III.  Just to refresh Members of the con tents  of  this  bill,  title  I  extends  OPIC's authorities for 3 years, creates  a 4-year pilot program for equity in vestment in projects in the Caribbean  and Africa, raises the contingent liabil ity ceiling to $1.5 billion, and permits  up to 25 percent of loan proceeds to be  used for technology adaptation in the  United States.  Title II authorizes $24 million in no year  funding  for  radio construction  and modernization by the Board for  International Broadcasting,  and  au thorizes such sums as may be neces sary for the construction of a broad casting relay station in Israel.  As H.R. 5263  simply provides  the  Senate with an alternative vehicle for  enacting this legislation which has al ready passed the House, I urge Mem bers to support adoption of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1988
1648,742,17,Mr. LEACH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  <Mr. LEACH of Iowa asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1988
1649,742,17,Mr. LEACH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker,  the Overseas Private Investment Cor poration, which was created  in  the  1960's, primarily provides political risk  insurance for U.S. business ventures in  the Third World.  Through this role, it has also served  as an economic development agency  that has promoted growth in the need iest parts of the world. By removing  the political uncertainty of projects in  these developing nations, OPIC has  harnessed the power of the U.S. pri vate sector  to help  them grow eco nomically. By working with U.S. busi nesses, it has also enhanced business  opportunities and promoted U.S. ex ports. OPIC has therefore implement ed some of the United States' most im portant global development goals, and  in many ways should be considered as  a model  for  foreign assistance pro grams.  OPIC has performed well under its  mandate, and-unusual for a Federal  agency-operates under a surplus. It  started off with $106 million in tax payers' money and has long since re turned it. OPIC is not only self-sustaining in its operations, but has also,  from time to time, returned money to  the Treasury.  By any standard, the Overseas Pri vate Investment Corporation deserves  to be reauthorized.  In addition this bill authorizes emer gency funding support for Radio Free  Europe and Radio Liberty, and au thorizes the continuation of construc tion of  a  relay  transmitter  in  the  Arova Valley in Israel.  I urge my colleagues to vote for pas sage of this bill.  ",1988
1650,742,17,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 5263, reauthorizing the activities of the  Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and  making supplemental authorizations of appro priations for the Board for International Broad casting. I would like to commend the chairmen  of the Subcommittees on  International Oper ations and on  International Economic Policy  and Trade, Mr. MICA and Mr. BONKER, for their  efforts in putting together this legislation.  As Members will  remember,  when  the  House considered this legislation earlier in the  year,  the  foreign aid bill, which had passed  the House earlier, was attached as an amend ment in an effort to get the foreign aid bill to  conference. The legislation before the House  today is identical to the measure that passed  the House, but does not contain  the foreign  aid bill. We are hopeful  that by sending a  clean OPIC bill to the other body, they will be  able to act on  it before the end of the ses sion.

1667,768,17,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R 5155  is the reau thorization of an important program  of protection and advocacy services for  the mentally ill. I ask for your support  of  the bill,  a  bipartisan  effort  to  extend this successful and needed pro gram for 3 more years.  The system of protection and advo cacy set up  is charged with  safeguarding the rights of mentally ill  individuals and investigating incidents  of abuse and neglect of these persons  when they are residents or inpatients  at treatment facilities. Under the act,  the system is guided by an advisory  council, half of which is made up of  the  consumers  themselves-people  who  have or  are  receiving mental  health services, or their family mem bers.  The piece of legislation before you  today  contains  amendments  that  would clarify definitions and activities  contained in the current law.  Incidents that result in the death of  a client would be added to the defini tion of abuse and neglect. The defini tion of individuals entitled to protec tion and advocacy services would be  expanded to include those being trans ported or admitted to treatment facili ties, and also to include persons being  involuntary detained but not serving a  sentence in a municipal detention fa cility.  In hearings on  this program,  the  committee became  concerned  about  the frequent lack of access to the re ports describing incidents of abuse and  neglect.  This  legislation  expands  access to the kinds of records the protection and advocacy system needs to  do its job.  HR. 5155 also establishes a govern ing authority that will jointly develop  priorities for the program with the ad visory council. The advisory council is  directed to prepare a report and as sessment of its activities, and to give  the general public an opportunity to  express its views on the activities and  priorities of the system.  The protection and advocacy system  is strongly supported by the parents  and families of mentally ill patients as  well as the public and private institu tions with which the system works. In  the short  time of  its existence,  the  protection and advocacy system has  begun to prove its worth.  The bill is cosponsored by Congress man MADIGAN, the distinguished rank ing member of  the subcommittee.  I  know of no opposition to its passage. I  urge your support.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  1986  99-319,  D 1400  ",1988
1668,768,17,Mr. TAUKE.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support  H.R. 5155, the Protection and Advoca cy for the Mentally Ill Individuals Act  of 1988. This legislation will reauthor ize, with several needed improvements,  the existing protection and advocacy  program for the mentally ill. This pro gram was  initiated  in  under  Public Law 99-319 to ensure that the  rights of the mentally ill are protected  while they are inpatients or residents  in treatment facilities. This program  distributes funds through the already  established protection and advocacy  systems set up under the Developmen tal Disabilities Act.  Under  Public Law  these  agencies were given the authority to  investigate incidents of abuse and ne glect to the mentally ill when they are  residents of  treatment facilities and  for 90 days after discharge. These sys tems are responsible for pursuing the  appropriate legal, administrative, and  other remedies for  these individuals.  H.R. 5155 strengthens the current pro gram with some new provisions. One  of  these provides protection  to  the  mentally ill while being transported to  a treatment facility and when tempo rarily detained in a municipal deten tion facility. Another requires that the  governing boards shall have  the re sponsibility for developing the annual  priorities together with the advisory  council.  This  improved  legislation  should  better serve our mentally ill citizens.  This bill represents a modest effort to  try  to assist  the States  in helping  those individuals in society least able  to help  themselves.  I  know  in my  home State of Iowa, the program has  proven to be very effective and benefi cial.  Iowa's  Protection  and  Advocacy  System opened a total of 16 investiga tions in fiscal year 1987, the first full  year of the program. Already this year  Iowa's program has opened 22 cases,  and my State protection and advocacy  officers  indicate  that the 1988  total  may be double that of 1987. This is but  one indication of the need for this pro gram.  I also wish to stress the importance  of the provisions allowing protection  and advocacy services to follow the in dividual when he or she is deinstitu tionalized. These provisions help  to  ensure that the individual receives ap propriate  community-based  services.  As we are very much aware in our ef forts to address the serious problem of  homelessness, many of our Nation's  homeless are mentally ill  individuals  who  have  been  deinstitutionalized  without assurances that they will  in  fact receive the community-based serv ices they need.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  ",1988
1669,768,17,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of H.R. 5155, the Protection and Ad vocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act. I would  like  to commend  the distinguished chairman  of the subcommittee, Mr. WAXMAN, and  the  ranking member, Mr. MADIGAN, for introducing  this worthy bill, and for their continued com mitment to enriching the lives of our mentally  ill citizens.  Last Congress, we acted the protection and  advocacy for mentally ill individuals to ensure  that the rights of the mentally ill are protected  while patients or residents in facilities render ing care or treatment. H.R. 5155 reauthorizes  the program for 3 years, providing $13 million  in fiscal year 1989 and ""such sums"" in each  of fiscal years 1990-91, to protection and ad vocacy systems (P&As), or any other State approved mental health protection and advo cacy system,  to administer programs to pro tect and advocate  for mentally  ill  individuals  and  investigate  incidents of abuse and ne glect.  Furthermore, H.R. 5155 establishes a griev ance procedure  for clients, mandates  that  P&A's have access to facility staff reports of  incidents of abuse and neglect, and expands  the eligibility  for P&A service  to  include  the  time the mentally ill are being transported to a  treatment facility for admission. The legislation  also authorizes  family support groups and a  national network for victims of Alzheimer's dis ease and related memory disorders.  Mr. Speaker, H.R.  5155  is a bipartisan  measure, endorsed by the administration. Ac cordingly,  I ask my colleagues to join me  in  support of this bill.  ",1988

1674,781,17,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  commend the House Agriculture Com mittee-in particular  the  chairman,  Mr. DE LA GARZA and the ranking mi nority member, Mr. MADIGAN, as well  as Mr. BROWN and Mr. ROBERTS-for  bringing to the floor today a bill that  will  revitalze  the Federal Pesticide  Regulatory Program. This legislation,  S. 659, will provide needed reform of  our pesticide law and enable the Envi ronmental Protection Agency  to get  on with the essential task of reviewing  the safety of thousands of pesticides  on the market today.  The health and environmental ef fects of extensive pesticide use in this  country is an issue of growing public  concern. Farmers and consumers alike  want and need to be assured that the  pesticides they use and the agricultur al products  they consume are safe.  Such assurances can only be provided  if EPA has the resources and commit ment  to complete  timely safety  re views  of  all  pesticides-particularly  the older chemicals which came on the  market prior  to  the  imposition  of  stricter safety data requirements.  In 1972, Congress gave EPA the am bitious task of reviewing the safety of  the reregistering all pesticides then on  the market within a 3-year period.  Today, some 16 years later, EPA has  barely scratched the surface. Of the  600 chemical  ingredients of primary  concern, EPA has completed reregis tration for only 2. Since 1983, my Gov ernment Operations Subcommittee on  Environment, Energy and Natural Re sources has conducted numerous  in vestigations  of EPA's Reregistraton  Program. We identified a multitude of  shortcomings and unacceptable delays  in the safety review process-many of  which will be corrected by the acceler ated reregistration requirements of S.  659.  More recently, in 1986 and 1987, our  subcommittee held hearings to review  the current pesticide indemnification  and disposal policies. Under present  law when EPA finds that a pesticide  presents an  imminent public health  hazard and bans its further use,  the  Agency  is. obligated to indemnify all  holders of  the product and pay all  costs of its disposal. Our subcommittee  found that these indemnification and  disposal  obligations  have  paralyzed  the reregistration program. We found  that  just  the  four emergency bans  issued to date will cost taxpayers an  estimated $260 million. We found that  EPA had diverted funds from pesticide  safety reviews to pay mounting dispos al costs. In fiscal year 1989 alone, the  Agency will spend more on pesticide  disposal than it will on pesticide regu lation. Clearly, this situation is unac ceptable.  As you will recall, Mr. Speaker, the  current  indemnification and disposal  policies were the subject of consider able floor debate this summer when  the House considered the fiscal year  1989 HUD-independent  agencies  ap propriation. My  subcommittee  col league and counterpart,  the ranking  minority member, Mr. CLINGER, and I  urged the House to repeal the indem nification and disposal requirements.  They are, in my view, the biggest im pediment  to  the revitilizaton of our  pesticide  regulatory program. While  Mr. CLINGER  and  I were ultimately  unable  to off er our amendment last  June, S. 659 changes radically the cur rent indemnification and disposal re quirements and I applaud the Agricul ture Committee for addressing these  issues.  Quite frankly, the provisions adopt ed by the committee do not go as far  as I would  like.  I continue  to have  some concerns. S. 659 preserves indem nification  payments  for  farmers.  I  agree that farmers should not have to  suffer economic loss if a pesticide they  hold is banned. However, our subcom mittee found that this has not been a  problem in the past. We found that  pesticide manufacturers and retailers,  as with most other commercial prod ucts, have recalled their banned pesti cides and reimbursed their customers.  Is  is  an accepted business practice  common to many industries. I am con cerned, therefore, that preservation of  farmer indemnification will have the  unintended result of freezing decided ly dangerous chemicals in the hands of  those we most want  to protect-the  American farmer.  I am also concerned about the dis posal provisions in S. 659. While the  bill transfer the obligation and costs  of pesticide disposal from the taxpayer  to the manufacturer, as  I believe  it  should, the EPA will continue to share  a  portion  of  the pesticide  storage  costs. While  these costs may prove  small in relation to EPA's current obli gation, I do not believe they are legiti mate or warranted taxpayer expendi tures.  I am also concerned that the  cost-sharing provisions provide an un intended disincentive for proper and  adequate disposal planning. Under S.  659,  the manufacturer will pay 100  percent of storage costs while they de velop a disposal plan. Once the plan is  submitted to EPA, the Agency will pay  100 percent of the storage costs until  the plan is approved. I am concerned  that such fiscal pressures may encour age  quick  and  perhaps  incomplete  preparation of a plan on the part of  the manufacturer, and equally superfi cial review and approval of the part of  EPA. I believe EPA's thoroughness in  reviewing disposal plans will  require  close oversight.  Nonetheless, these concerns do not  diminish my support for S. 659. It re peals the most onerous and costly in demnification payments  to pesticide  producers  and  transfers  the  funda mental responsibility of disposal from  EPA  to  the manufacturer. In short,  these changes, along with other provi sions in the bill, will enable EPA to  proceed with the essential task of pes ticide  reregistration. In the end our  farmers, consumers, and the pesticide  industry  itself will  benefit  greatly  from restored public confidence in our  Federal Pesticide Regulatory Program.  I urge my colleagues to support S. 659.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter  into a colloquy with  the gentleman  from Texas  [Mr. DE  LA GARZA],  the  chairman of the Agriculture Commit tee.

1687,807,17,Mr.  RICHARDSON.,"  and  the  distinguished  chairman of the Interior Committee,  ",1988
1688,807,17,Mr. UDALL.," It would provide for the es tablishment of a new unit of the Na tional Park System to be located on  lands within the Zuni Reservation in  western New Mexico.  The Zuni Reservation is an area of  great  historic  and  cultural  signifi cance, with a wealth of archeological  and other resources that rivals many  other parts of the Nation. It is also the  homeland of the Zuni people, whose  occupation of this area can be traced  back at least to 1540, and whose ances tors were  in  the area even earlier.  Thus, the Zuni area offers a remarka ble concentration of past and present  cultural values.  As reported by the Interior Commit tee, H.R. 4182 would lay the foundation for a mutually beneficial coopera tive relationship between the National  Park Service and the Zuni people that  would further the sound management  of  the values and resources of  this  area and assist the efforts of the Zuni  people to protect their heritage while  sharing better understanding  of  it  with other people everywhere.  The bill was worked out  through  consultations  among  the  committee  staff, the Park Service, and the Zuni  Tribe, and  it  includes a number of  common elements in the version of the  legislation that has been favorably re ported by the Senate's Select Commit tee on Indian Affairs.  Under the bill, the Zuni Tribe would  have 1 year after enactment to offer  to the Secretary of the Interior a lease  of Zuni trust lands for the purposes of  establishment of the park. The Secre tary would have to accept the lease if  it met the requirements of the bill that is, that it was for a term of at  least 99 years, would not require pay ment of rent, included lands the Direc tor of  the Park Service determined  necessary and adequate for the pur poses of the park, and was not incon sistent with the bill. Upon acceptance  the Secretary would publish a notice  in the Federal Register which would  trigger the other provisions of the bill  and which would constitute the formal  establishment of the park.  Under the bill, once the park was es tablished, additional Zuni lands could  be added to it if the tribe offered to  lease  those  additional  lands  under  similar terms and the Secretary agreed  to accept such a lease-in other words,  once the park is established, additions  to it could be made but only by the  mutual consent of the tribe and the  Secretary.  The bill also includes a number of  other provisions relating to the man agement of the park after its estab lishment, which have been carefully  shaped to address the particular cir cumstances of this area and the new  relationship which we anticipate be tween the Zuni Tribe and the National  Park Service.  Finally,  the bill would amend the  legislation passed last year which pro vided  for designation of a vehicular  tour route linking a number of Nation al Park System units in New Mexico  and Arizona. The  substitute would  rename  that  link  as  the  ""Masau  Route""  rather  than  the  ""Masau  Trail."" This would be consistent with  the nomenclature the Interior Com mittee has  subsequently  used with  other, similar designations. It would  also lessen the chance of any confu sion between such designations and  the designation of units of the Nation al Trails System, which for the most  part includes unroaded trails.

1694,820,17,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Chairman, there can be no argu ment that AIDS has devastated this  Nation. As of June 6, 1988, 64,506 cases  of HIV positive individuals had been  reported  to  the Centers for Disease  Control. It is estimated that 1.5 mil lion Americans are infected with the  HIV virus, but are not yet symptomat ic. These numbers attest to the sever rity of this epidemic. We must unite to  provide a strong voice in guiding the  development  of  an  effective AIDS  policy. We must demonstrate strong  support in the development of testing  and counseling policies  that protect  the rights of all individuals. H.R. 5142,  the AIDS Federal Policy Act, estab lishes critically needed AIDS research  programs, and guidelines for  testing  and for counselng. I rise in strong sup port of H.R. 5142 and urge my col leagues to join me in supporting this  bill.  The AIDS Federal Policy Act estab lishes new research initiatives, includ ing grants for much needed communi ty-based programs and an evaluation  of  the  effectiveness of unapproved  therapies used in treating HIV positive  individuals. This bill also authorizes  additional staff at the National Insti tutes of Health and other health agen cies to lead the fight against this dis ease. The global effect of AIDS cannot  be  ignored and must be addressed.  H.R.  authorizes grants  to en hance  international cooperation and  the sharing of information.  The battle against AIDS must be  fought on the local and State levels, as  well as the Federal level. This bill au thorizes  $400 million  for  Federal  grants to State and local agencies for  confidential counseling and testing of  high-risk, low-income populations, tar geting  those  individuals who  need  those services. Education and counsel ing must become our first line of de fense in prevention.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is endorsed  by most health care providers, includ ing the American Hospital Association,  the American Medical Association, and  the  American  Nurses  Association,  5142  ",1988

The president of the borough of Brooklyn,  NY, has proclaimed October 6 as German American Day in Brooklyn. I would llike to en close his proclamation into the RECORD.  BOROUGH OF BROOKLYN-PROCLAMATION  Whereas, Brooklyn is comprised of ninety  different ethnic groups and distinguished  men and women of every nationality have  played a major role in shaping the past and  future of our borough and through their di versity and individuality have created a bor ough that is an exciting and stimulating  place to live and work; and  Whereas, it is a time-honored tradition in  the borough of Brooklyn to recognize the  outstanding  contributions  of  our many  ethnic groups, and it is only fitting that we  honor the German residents of Brooklyn  and New York City, as they celebrate the  anniversary of the arrival of German immi grants who first came to these shores on Oc tober 6, 1683; and  Whereas, citizens of German descent have  played a significant role in the educational,  political, economic and cultural sectors of  the State of New York and  the United  States of America, and their proud heritage  is further enhanced by their many achieve ments; and  Whereas, I urge all Brooklynites to join  the German community as they gather to  celebrate  German-American  Day,  their  proud heritage and their important role in  the borough of Brooklyn, and I wish them  great happiness during this festive time;  Now, therefore, I, Howard Golden, presi dent of the borough of Brooklyn, do hereby  proclaim October 6,  1988,  as  ""German American Day in Brooklyn.''

1711,846,17,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to the H.E.L.P. Group, an organiza tion that has served people with special needs  in my community for over a decade. This or ganization has  instilled  into  the hearts and  minds of its patients strength, hope, dignity,  and a strong desire to achieve their dreams.  On September 24, 1988, the H.E.L.P. Group  will open its 10th home. This home is special  for several reasons. First, it is another facility  that will aid in the growth and development of  people who need special assistance. Second,  it exemplifies  the degree of sharing  that  is  prevalent in the hearts of Americans. And fi nally, it is named in honor of one of the most  outstanding and giving people  I know, Mr.  Bruce Corwin.  The H.E.L.P. Groups' decision to name the  new home in honor of Bruce on behalf of Vari ety Club Children's Charities of Southern Cali fornia,  a  philanthropic  organization which  raises money for handicapped and underprivi leged children, is a clear indication of this or ganization's dedication  to community service  and  the  proliferation of goodwill and  love  throughout our country.  Mr. Speaker,  it gives me great pleasure to  invite my colleagues to join with me in honor ing Bruce Corwin and  the members of  the  H.E.L.P. Group  for their contributions toward  making the lives of special needs friends more  comfortable and rewarding.  CONGRESSMAN BILL CHAPPELL  HONORED  HON. JOSEPH M. McDADE  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 20, 1988  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  take this opportunity to salute my colleague,  Congressman BILL CHAPPELL of Florida,  the  chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Defense, who has been chosen by  the  Non Commissioned Officers Association of  the USA to receive the Association's 1988 ""L.  Mendel Rivers Award for Legislative Action.""  As the ranking Republican of the subcom mittee, I have seen firsthand BILL CHAPPELL'S  commitment to the well-being of the members  of our military service. Congressman CHAP PELL  is a most appropriate choice to receive  this prestigious award, which was named after  the late distinguished Congressman L. Mendel  Rivers of South Carolina.  Mendel Rivers, as chairman of the House  Armed Services Committee,  is  remembered  for his concern with the plight of our service  members, particularly those serving in the en listed ranks. His efforts and success in bring ing  greater  congressional  attention  to  the  issues affecting military personnel has earned  him the respect of the men and women who  are serving or have served in the U.S. Armed  Forces.  The award was first presented  in 1971 by  the NCOA to honor the legislator who, in their  opinion,  is most worthy of recognition for his  or her efforts  in  furthering  the  ideals of de mocracy, freedom and patriotism on behalf of  our beloved Nation.  BILL CHAPPELL  is most deserving of  this  recognition because he has worked tirelessly  as chairman of  the subcommittee  for  those  ideals. He is a patriot, and a firm believer in  democracy and  freedom. His  record proves  him  to be a true  friend of the military and  those who serve  in  the National Guard and  Reserve.  The NCOA will present  its award  to BILL  CHAPPELL tonight during its 16th annual con gressional reception.  I want to add my con gratulations to BILL CHAPPELL and commend  the NCOA for making an excellent selection to  receive this year's ""L. Mendel Rivers Award.""  OCTOBER 10, 1988-TAIWAN'S  77TH BIRTHDAY  HON. RONALD D. COLEMAN  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 20, 1988  ",1988
1712,846,17,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as  our Taiwanese  friends celebrate  their 77th  birthday on October 10 of this year, we in the  U.S. Congress wish  to assure  them  that we  applaud their political reforms and appreciate  their efforts to try to reduce their trade surplus  with us. We hope to work out our differences  with  them satisfactorily, and  I am confident  that our long history of friendship and coop eration will allow us to accomplish that goal.  As a recent publication pointed out, Taiwan  has achieved the greatest economic success  of all  the newly industrialized countries. The  economy has won  remarkable  real growth  rates, hitting 11 percent last year. Equally im portant is the fact that this economic success  is being shared throughout its society. Observ ers expect Taiwan  to soon make  the  leap  from a newly industrialized country to a fully  developed economy.  Equally encouraging  is the  liberalization of  the nation's political system that has provided  for a broader participation in the political proc ess. The dedication to constitutional democra cy is clear, and  I believe it is important that  Taiwan's allies in this country understand and  applaud this progress.  Although  there has been criticism of Tai wan's economic policies,  it  is  important  for  Americans to note that Taiwan  is rapidly be coming an  important economy.  In  this  first  quarter of 1987, United States imports soared  136 percent, and Taiwan is now the fifth larg est market  for United States  farm products,  and the largest on a per capita basis.  Helping this import boom, of course, is the  more equitable distribution of  income-not  through government  intervention, but by  the  flourishing  free enterprise  system-and  the  decision by the government to allow the New  Taiwan dollar to float on  the world currency  market.  Mr. Speaker, I think I can speak on behalf  of all my colleagues when I say that I would  like our Taiwanese friends and allies to know  ",1988
1713,859,17,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  have listened with interest to the mi nority leader. The statement he has  made now  is  in complete agreement  with the statement he made earlier,  prior  to  the vote on  the minimum  wage. Apparently we are going to hold  hostage the 16 million Americans who  will be affected by an increase in the  minimum wage, the 16 million Ameri cans who have not had a cost-of-living  increase, until we act on some number  of appointments to which the minori ty leader has made reference.  I think all of us believe that there  ought to be fairness to those who are  considered by various committees; that  is certainly true. But one fact I think  we can say is that none of those nomi nees are at the minimum wage. Those  who are waiting in the Judiciary Committee are not living on the minimum  wage.  I will let the chairman of the Judici ary Committee  address other ques tions about the procedures which have  been followed by the Judiciary Com mittee. In the last meeting, there were  five  judges that were reported out. I  know of no one on this side who has  made the statement that was made by  the former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, Mr. THURMOND,  in 1980.  On July 16, 1980-he said no more  Federal  judges should be acted on when there was a Democratic adminis tration. Or  the statement made by  Senator Robert Griffin in June 1968  that-no more Supreme Court nomi nations  should  be  confirmed  until  after the Presidential election.  We can use  little debaters' points,  but the Judiciary Committee has re ported and, as I understand, will con tinue to report Judges out. But let us  not get away from the facts, a number  of interesting facts.  While  the Republican nominee  is  preparing for a debate next Sunday,  the Republican Party, with the nota ble exceptions of Senator ROTH, Sena tor CHAFEE, and Senator WEICKER, vir tually to a man, said no to those indi viduals who are on the lowest rung of  the working ladder. They said no to  those individuals.  At  the same  time,  the Republican  leadership was committing  the Vice  President of the United States to a $6  billion tax  increase with  the earned  income tax credit. I hope that message  is going to get to the Vice President,  GEORGE BUSH. Many of us, when we  travel  around,  hear  the  statement,  ""No  new  taxes.""  The Republican  Party went on record today, through  the floor leader for the Republicans,  and the Senator from Minnesota [Mr.  BoscHWITZ], who was the chairman of  the Republican campaign committee,  they went on record for a $6. 7 billion  tax increase. They evidently want the  new taxes.  So let us recognize that right away.  There  are  some  realities  that  are  coming out. Speeches are cheap. Press  releases go quickly. But we have a  chance to act when you can make a  difference  in people's lives. The Re publican Party today, as reflected in  the U.S. Senate, has gone on record  for increasing taxes, they are as clear  as can be on that issue. They are on  record now  as holding hostage  all  those millions of Americans  in ex change for some of their carefully se lected appointees for various Federal  jobs.  We have heard on other issues as  well. I am glad we have the Republi can leader on record. He has said no to  parental  leave. ""No""  to any mother  who has a sick child or has adopted a  child. They have a job but no protec tions for that mother or father. The  Republicans are against  that. They  want the Senate to get out quickly evi dently.  We can debate that and get action  on that but, no; the Republican leader  said ""no."" ""No on day care. ""No,"" no  way. We only want to do the appro priations bills.  With  respect  to my  friend  from  Utah, he has worked with the Senator  from Connecticut who has been the  principal sponsor of the day care pro grams and the parental leave, the Sen ator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, and  he has worked with us on that. He has  indicated he would be willing to start a  debate. But, no, the Republican leader  said no way on that.  So when we hear these speeches all  across the country, as we have heard  from the Vice President, ""we are for  minimum wage, we are for parental  leave, we are for day care,"" that mes sage is not getting over to this party or  to this leader because he says no, no,  no, we do not want to debate it. We  just want to get out. We want to talk  about it but not take action on it.  And that is the message, Mr. Presi dent. Whether that message gets out  across  this country now will be the  real test for the American people.  Evidently, Mr.  President,  on  the  earned income tax credit they are for  higher  taxes, because that is  in the  Boschwitz amendment. The Republi can  leader even  referred  to  it. The  floor manager  for  the Republican  Party here has indicated his support  for it. They are for higher taxes. They  are for higher taxes because that is  the way it is going to be paid but not  for higher wages.  That is the only conclusion that you  can reach with this record. There can  be a  lot of explanations, but by and  large that is what we are facing.  I wish that the Vice President could  take  a  little  time  away  from  that  debate and just call over to the Repub licans and to urge their support.  But we  have  now  a  protracted  debate on this particular issue.  Just finally, with regard to the pro cedures, we should not be shedding  crocodile  tears because  the Republi cans offered the first amendment. If  you listen to the Senator, the minority  leader, and I wish he were here since I  am responding to him as I indicated I  would. But  it was  the Republicans  that offered the first amendment, Mr.  President; it was the Republicans, and  we followed with a perfecting amend ment. They were the first amendment,  and we are prepared to deal with that.  As  the majority  leader has pointed  out, the procedures of the Senate were  followed. As the majority leader has  indicated, he was not opposed to con sidering some form of various amend ments, if there was going to be some  total agreement. In the past that has  been the procedure.

1715,872,17,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," I thank the Sena tor for his remarks and for speaking  about my amendment and the mini mum wage.  I  thought his  remarks  were  indeed quite correct and quite  well-founded, and I  join him in those  remarks.  Madam President, during the 1960's  and 1970's, Congress sought to elimi nate any Federal income tax liability  of families whose  income was below  the poverty level. Several approaches  were used in tax legislation enacted in  1969 and again in 1975, 1976, and 1978.  Included  in  those efforts were  in creases  in  the personal exemptions,  the standard deduction, also  termed  the  zero  bracket  amount,  and  the  earned income tax credit. These provi sions were  intended  to  increase  the  level of  income at which  a  family  begins  to pay Federal  income  tax,  termed  the  tax  threshold or entry  point.  That, Madam President,  is one of  the reasons why we have such a high  income standard associated with the  earned income tax credit. The stand ard deduction is now $5,000; the per sonal exemption is almost at $2,000,  and soon will be at $2,000. A single  parent with one child would have two  $2,000 exemptions plus a $5,000 stand ard deduction, for a total of $9,000 of  tax-exempt income.  In the event that person is working,  to give them a tax credit would not be  very useful, because a  tax credit can  only be used  to  reduce  tax  that  is  owed; and a  single person with one  child has $9,000 of tax-free income. In  the case of two children, it would be  $11,000; in the case of four children, it  would be $13,000 of tax-free  income.  But the refundable tax credit in the  current EITC ensures that the taxpay er gets an actual wage subsidy if the  credit exceeds taxes owed. It is for this  reason I encourage my colleagues to  support my amendment.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  ",1988

1723,872,17,Mr. SIMPSON.," Thank you, Madam  President.  I do have a comment or two in the  debate on minimum wage. My col league from Minnesota, I  think, who  has not quite concluded his remarks  was asked  to appear before a group  here in room S-211. He will return.  I do have a thought about this issue  as we find ourselves unable to obtain  cloture or cutoff the debate on this  issue.  I  have not entered  the  fray  before. It does indeed seem to me that  we are at a point  in our legislating  where we need to be doing some nego tiation, and we are doing  that. The  public  should be  aware  that,  even  though it would appear to be a bit of a  stalemate here, I feel quite certainly,  maybe naively so, but I have been ac cused of that before, that if we are to  restrain the cutting off of debate to morrow,  and we will vote  again,  I  really  feel very sanguine about  the  fact that we will get a good compro mise minimum wage  package  that  most of us, a great majority of us, can  agree to, that would deal with the con tentious issues that have been part of  this debate.  I really believe we can do that, and  we have nothing to lose,  if we have  one more vote on that tomorrow to see  if we cannot do that.  I think we can reach an accord and  then go on to the next item of busi ness. Meanwhile,  back  at  the  old  homestead, we are seriously address ing  this  issue of  judgeships, Federal  district a.nd circuit judges.  Chairman JOE BID EN is back and we  are very pleased and thrilled that he is  and he is undiminished. He has not  ""lost a step"" either physically or men tally, and that should please us all. He  is a splendid chairman, and I mean  that sincerely, and my colleague from  Ohio, on the floor, knows as a fellow  member of the Judiciary Committee  that it  is heartening to see Senator  BIDEN and to see him doing so well and  functioning just as before.  So he is back and he and Senator  THURMOND,  the ranking member, are  discussing  these  things  about  the  judges, and how many more hearings  we will have. That has to go forward.  It is a very important point for us in  the minority. We are well aware of  what occurred with regard to Presi dent Carter, and I remember we were  in the minority then and there were  some 17  judges apparently  that did  not get processed, but the footnote to  that is  that in the next administra tion, a Republican administration, we  even processed a request or two of our  Democratic minority and those judges  went on the bench, one I  recall dis tinctly  a  personal  friend,  Stephen  Breyer.  ",1988
1724,924,17,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, when  the major liberal news media of the  country  began  using  Senator DAN  QUAYLE  for  target practice,  I  recall  feeling  confident  that  fair-minded  Americans would  immediately detect  the bias and poor taste so common place among the liberal media.  Obviously, my faith in the judgment  of fair-minded Americans was not mis placed. There  is widespread  indigna tion at the way Senator QUAYLE has  been abused by the news media.  These are  the same media people  who  so  enthusiastically  supported  George McGovern in 1972, and who  have so constantly attacked and mis represented Ronald Reagan  through  the Reagan Presidency. An  indepth  study sometime back found that the  vast majority of  the major media  voted  for McGovern,  and  consider  themselves  liberal  in  their political  and philosophical persuasions.  But  in attacking DAN QUAYLE  as  they have,  it appears  evident  that  they have shot themselves in their col lective foot. The people are resentful,  adding  to  the public distrust of the  media.  There  is  a mindset among many  major newspapers of this country, as  well as the television networks and the  news magazines. They  are  almost  unanimously  liberal,  and  they  use  their  inordinate power, more often  than not, to make and shape the news  instead of reporting it.  As for the unfair attacks upon our  distinguished Senate colleague, DANNY  QUAYLE really needs no defense among  people  who  know  him.  Senator  QUAYLE is bright, he is honest, and he  is a straightforward legislator. He is  also conservative-which  is why  the  major media have engaged in unprece dented attacks upon him.  So, Mr. President, it is gratifying to  note  the  reaction of  the American  people. They resent the mistreatment  of Senator QUAYLE. It is particularly  gratifying to note that these attacks  have been  so gratuitous,  so heavy handed, so patently transparent that  they have been an embarrassment to a  good many journalists who believe in  objectivity and fair play.  Mr. President,  I  shall shortly ask  unanimous consent  that two signifi cant items be printed in the RECORD;  both are highly enlightening as to the  degree and the ferocity of the media  attacks upon Senator QUAYLE.  The first,  interesting enough,  is a  memorandum written by the ombuds man for the Washington Post. Rich ard Harwood was a deputy managing  editor of the Post before he became  the paper's ombudsman. Equally inter esting is the fact that Mr. Harwood's  memorandum has not been acknowl edged by the Post. Instead, the memo randum found its way into the hands  of the Washington Times, which dis closed it to the public on September 15  in an article headline, ""Post Memo As sails Its Quayle Overkill."" The memo randum was directed to Ben Bradlee,  Meg Greenfield, and the rest of the  staff of the Washington Post.  The second item is an article that  appeared  in Human Events on Sep tember 3. The article was written by  Timothy Hunter, a former officer of  the Indiana National Guard, who em phasizes  that  the  Indiana National  Guard had a unit in Vietnam at the  time DAN QUAYLE signed up in 1969.  Mr. Hunter's comments are well worth  reading and provide an interesting as sessment of the lack of objectivity of  the major news media.  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous  consent that the two aforementioned  items be printed in the RECORD at the  conclusion of my remarks.  There being no objection, the arti cles were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  POST MEMO ASSAILS ITS QUAYLE OVERKILL  A memorandum from its own ombudsman  to senior editors of The Washington Post  accuses  the newspaper of succumbing  to  ""mob psychology"" in its sensational cover age of the selection of Dan Quayle as the  Republican nominee for vice president.  The harshly detailed  criticisms  closely  mirror  those made by both partisan and  trade critics in the days following the con clusion of the Republican National Conven tion in New Orleans, when coverage of Mr.  Quayle] characterized by one media critic as  ""a piranha-like feeding frenzy""-dominated  the front pages and television screens for  fully a fornight.  Richard Harwood, who was a deputy man aging editor of The Post until he became its  ombudsman, or  ""reader's advocate,""  told  senior editors that in its pursuit of the sen sational, The Post had ""succumbed to the  soiled embrace of Paula Parkinson and the  promotion department of Playboy Maga zine.""  Playboy is publishing a ""memoir"" by Miss  Parkinson in which she reveals that she and  Mr. Quayle once danced ""very close togeth er"" at a beach party in Florida. The story  was picked up by The Post and other news  organizations after Mr. Quayle was chosen  as the running mate of George Bush, sug gesting that the two had forged a sexual li aison.  Mr. Harwood told The Times last night  that he had  received no  reaction  to his  sharp critique. ""I don't expect any  reac tion,"" he said. ""This is a routine function of  mine Cto  send internal memos examining  Post coverage].  The memorandum, which was addressed  to Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, and  Meg Greenfield, the editor of the editorial  page, and finally to ""Staff, etc."" character ized the later, more restrained coverage of  the  aftermath  of  the  selection  of Mr.  Quayle, when many media voices reflected  sober second  thoughts about  the general  press hysteria immediately after the con vention,  as  ""a modest  outcome  for  an  August hurricane.""  The  memorandum  notes  that  Mr.  Quayle's service  in  the  Indiana National  Guard was well known in both Indiana and  in Washillgton, that it had been published  in  the Congressional Directory, and  that  The Post published a 40-paragraph profile  of Mr. Quayle on Aug. 16, noting in the 32d  paragraph that he had been a Guardsman  during the war. That still did not make the  story.""  The story was not ""made,"" he said, until  Mr. Quayle was  asked  in New Orleans  whether he  thought questions about his  Guard service in the context of his being  ""tough on  defense""  constituted  ""a  low  blow.""  The subsequent coverage provoked  the  loudest outcries of protests of the year, he  said and he noted that the negatives were so  excessive-which he  called ""accidental"" that one story about Cajun cuisine in The  Post's food section became ""a political para ble"" on the demise of the Republican Party.  ""Sometimes every department wants into  the act,"" he wrote.  Continued Mr. Harwood"" ... we still find  it difficult to resist the mob psychology that  seizes the press corps on occasion . . . If 'the  networks' do it, it must be right and true  . . . in our eagerness not to be left behind,  CThe Post] succumbed to the soiled embrace  of Paula Parkinson and the promotion de partment of Playboy magazine.""  Mr. Harwood's memo follows:  ""The storm over Quayle the Minuteman  seems to be ending with something approxi mating a whimper: maybe  influence was  peddled, maybe  it wasn't but  questions  remain.' That's a modest outcome for an  August hurricane.  ""I have neither the talent nor the time to  undertake a proper study of this event but  it would be an interesting project for a grad uate student. What goes into the 'making'  of a story that totally obsesses our business  for a few days and then drops off the screen  of consciousness?  ""Apparently, as Richard Cohen has re minded us, it was common knowledge during  the Vietnam War that the National Guard  was a refuge for those of the non-combatant  persuasion.  ""It must have been common knowledge in  Indiana that Quayle had done his time in  the Guard. And it might have been common  ",1988

The economic future of our Nation  is closely linked to the future of our  transportation  systems.  Achieving  America's air transportation goals and  objectives for the 21st century will re quire a national resolve that can only  be guaranteed through a national call  to action.  Our efforts must begin now. By in troducing  this  joint  resolution we  hope to call attention to the need for a  national effort  to formulate a blue print for the future of national avia tion policy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the joint resolution be print ed in the RECORD in full.  There being no objection, the joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.J. RES. 382  Whereas the national objectives of gener al welfare, economic growth and stability,  and security of the United States require  the development of transportation policies  and programs that contribute to providing  fast, safe, efficient, and convenient trans portation at the lowest cost consistent with  other national objectives, including the effi cient use and conservation of the resources  of the United States, and it is in the nation al interest to encourage and promote the de velopment of  transportation systems em bracing various modes  of  transportation  that serve the Nation, States and local com munities efficiently and effectively;  Whereas the Constitution of the United  States provides to its citizens the right to  travel throughout the length and breadth  of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or  regulations which unreasonably burden or  restrict this movement;  Whereas  a  recent  national  survey  of  public attitudes toward aviation found that  86 percent of the American public supports  the development  of  a  national  aviation  policy, and one which addresses the needs of  all people who use or rely on air transporta tion in the United States;  Whereas the public interest is best served  by an air transportation system that pro vides fast, safe, efficient, convenient, and  cost-effective movement of passengers and  goods throughout the Nation with its con comitant economic, social and cultural bene fits;  Whereas the United States air transporta tion system is an essential element in the  competitive foundation of the economies of  the Nation and the world and has estab lished and maintained world standards of  safety, efficiency and utility, and the pubHe's  requirements  for  air  transportation  services will double by the year 2000 from  400 million annual passengers to nearly 800  million;  Whereas the public has lost confidence in  the Nation's air transportation system due  to the decline in service associated with the  air  traffic  controller  strike,  airport and  airway modernization delays airline merg ers, and the lack of a clear national policy;  Whereas the Nation's airport and airway  system are inadequate to meet the current  and projected growth in aviation, and sub stantial expansion and improvement of the  airway system and the development of an  integrated, nationwide infrastructure of air ports is required;  Whereas the Federal Aviation Administra tion's management and structure  is  con strained by regressive personnel and pro curement rules, and a lack of authority to  accomplish its tasks;  Whereas  it  is  recognized  that national  policies were central to the successful devel opment of our  railroads  and  Interstate  Highway System, and an integrated nation al aviation policy must precede successful  deployment of an adequate supply of facili ties,  equipment  and  personnel  to meet  safety, access, and capacity demands of the  future; and  Whereas a national aviation policy must  ensure that adequate air transportation op portunities and services are available to all  citizens  regardless of geographic  location  and that citizens who choose  to  live and  work in small or rural communities shall be  provided the same air transportation bene fits as all other citizens  throughout  the  United States: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled,  NATIONAL AVIATION POLICY  SECTION 1.

It has been 10 years since the Airline  Deregulation Act was enacted. Deregu lation, along with the technical inno vation, has changed the industry pro foundly.  Since  1978:  Passenger  enplanements have  increased by 55  percent; fares have decreased in most  markets; and safety has improved de spite a 26.5-percent increase in aircraft  departures-fatal accidents down 51  percent and passenger fatalities down  45 percent.  In fact, according to a recent analy sis of the Council of Economic Advis ers, the benefits to travelers of airline  deregulation exceed $11 billion.  After 10 years, aviation is at an im portant juncture. The success of de regulation  is manifested  in some of  the problems  facing aviation  today;  namely, airport and airways conges tion and delay. The search must begin  for  innovative  approaches  to  solve  today's problems while maintaining  the benefits of deregulation.  The purpose of this conference will  be to bring together all parties with an  interest  in  the  future of American  aviation. It will be bipartisan and with out a predetermined agenda.  Obviously,  there are some critical  issues which must be addressed. For  instance,  I  expect  that  aviation's  strained infrastructure will receive in",1988

We have had 3 or 4 years  in a  row, now, of the House voting  with a very overwhelming strong ma jority on the last Government entity  that has funds that are comingled for  the purposes of paying for abortions  with Federal money. I notice one of  the Presidential candidates last night  was in a hospital talking about every thing that he was going to do for pre natal care to protect infants in their  mothers' wombs, and in that spirit of  what Mr. Dukakis said last night,  I  would like the conferees to insist on  the House position.  My amendment  that passed over whelmingly is A005. I want to put an  amendment at  the desk now, but  I  need 30 seconds to get up there and  put in an amendment offered by me to  the motion offered by the gentleman  from New York [Mr. GREEN] at the  end of the motion to strike the period  and insert a semicolon and insert the  following  new  language:  ""That  the  House conferees insist on the House  language in their conference with the  Senate conferees on the House posi tion on Federal funds going to the Dis trict of Columbia  that will end up  being used for abortions.""

The en bloc amendments in particu lar contain a package of  legislation  that I authored with our colleague,  the gentleman from California  [Mr.  DORNAN],  to establish $5 million  in  demonstration  cleanup  projects  so  that State and local governments will  be able  to gain firsthand knowledge  and assistance on how  to dispose of  the very dangerous toxic wastes.  I  think it is particularly important  not just for my home State of Oregon,  which has the dubious distinction of  being at the top of the list in produc tion of these methamphetamines, but  I think it is important for our whole  country. What we know, for example,  is that when we clean up other danger ous wastes in this country, such as the  wastes  of  the Superfund Program,  there are very detailed guidelines and  specific requirements for the cleanup  of  these dangerous wastes. At  the  same time when there are drug houses  in a community in this country, law  enforcement and health officials are  really at a loss as to how to proceed on  the cleanup. With this legislation we  would establish guidelines  for State  and local governments to pursue when  they are going to conduct these clean ups.  I think it is something that will be a  real  lifeline  to  law enforcement and  health authorities around this country  as they try to clean up the deadly resi due of these labs.  The only other point that I would  want  to mention, Mr. Chairman,  is  that I want to tell the gentleman from  New Jersey, the chairman of the Sub committee on Crime, how pleased I am  that  this  legislation  includes strong  controls against the precursor chemi cals that are used in these drug labs.  D 1445  My colleague,  the gentleman from  Oregon  [Mr. DEFAZIO],  and  I,  from  Oregon,  introduced  legislation.  I ap preciated very much  the chance  to  come to the chairman's subcommittee.  I  think this legislation, for the first  time, will allow us to control these pre cursor  chemicals  so  that  criminals  cannot move from one State  to an other just to beat law enforcement au thorities.  Mr. Chairman, with that, I urge my  colleagues to support the legislation.  ",1988
1739,1028,17,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California [Mr. DORNAN].  ",1988
1740,1028,17,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank my colleague, one  of  the outstanding Members of  this  Chamber, who will someday be prob ably the Governor of California. Re member, you heard it here first, on  the day the British hung Nathan Hale,  September  22. You  have  but  one  career  to give  to your State, and  I  know that you, DANIEL LUNGREN, Notre  Dame graduate, will someday be the  Governor of California. And when he  is the Governor of the State of Cali fornia, I would not be a bit surprised if  one of my colleagues from the other  side of the aisle is the Governor of the  beautiful State of Oregon, and that is  the  gentleman  from Oregon  [Mr.  WYDEN].  There is not anything we cannot ac complish around here when two of us  get inside the cockpit, share the title  copilot, and fly straight and try to get  something done for justice.  I  know  the way  the gentleman's  State of Oregon suffers  from meth  labs and these PC labs. It is the same  in California. This drug problem is not  only an issue for our youth, it is an  issue  that  threatens  the survival of  our civilization. And I know what good  work the gentleman from New Jersey  [Mr. HUGHES] has been trying to ac complish with  the gentleman  from  California [Mr. LUNGREN] and the gen tleman from Florida [Mr. McCoLLUM],  the Dornan-Wyden amendment deals  with a pollution issue. When State au thorities bust one of  these meth or  PCP  labs,  as  the  gentleman  from  Oregon [Mr. WYDEN] said with force ful articulation, what do we do with all  of this garbage left over from  these  selfish people who are trying to pol lute this God-given computer which is  called a brain? What do we do with all  of this residual garbage that can hurt  children and continue  to hurt our  fell ow citizens?  Mr. Chairman, we have to have some  help, and the Dornan-Wyden amend ment, or  I will  call  it  the Wyden Dornan amendment, if the gentleman  wants to use it as such, provides that  help. I only wish we had such coopera tion between one another on all issues  concerning  this  nightmare  narcotic  problem, so that each succeeding Con gress can take forceful steps to try to  rid our country of this curse on the  land.  Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentle man, and I also  thank his staff for  working with my excellent staff in get ting  the  job done, and I  thank the  chairman of this bill for accepting this  en bloc.  ",1988
1741,1028,17,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan [Mr. DAVIS].  ",1988
1742,1041,17,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to  acknowledge the contribution of Congressmen  DUNCAN  HUNTER,  JIM  BATES,  and  BILL  LOWERY  to the Chemical Diversion and Traf ficking Act of 1988. The gentlemen from Cali fornia took an early interest in this subject and  worked with  the Subcommittee on Crime  to  produce  the  legislation before us  today. My  colleagues highlighted  important aspects of  the chemical diversion  issue by sharing San  Diego's experience in combating the produc tion of methamphetamine.  Last year,  for example, Mr. LOWERY  intro duced  legislation  focusing  on  the growing  criminal use of variations of precursor chemi cals  to produce designer versions of drugs  like  methamphetamine.  In  his  testimony  before  the Subcommittee on Crime, he em phasized the necessity of regulating the ana logues of chemicals like ephedrine and pseu doephedrine. The subcommittee utilized  the  information  provided  by  Congressman  LOWERY and the law enforcement community  in San Diego. The bill before us  today pro vides  for  the  regulation  of  the  precursor  analog used  to produce methamphetamine.  This will help prevent the spread of designer  meth across our Nation.  I want  to  thank Mr. LOWERY, Mr. BATES,  and Mr. HUNTER  for their contribution to and  support for the Chemical Diversion and Traf ficking Act.  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. Chair man, I intend to vote in favor of final passage  of the Omnibus Drug  Initiative Act.  It was a  good bill to begin with and is even a better bill  with  the amendments  that were adopted by  the House.  It contains increases for Federal, State, and  local drug enforcement. It provides money for  education and  treatment. And  it  includes  im portant drug-free workplace  language  that  I  have  long  supported.  I am most pleased,  though,  by  the  adoption  of a  number  of  amendments.  Perhaps the most important amendment to  be adopted was the Gekas amendment to es tablish the death penalty for drug dealers who  commit murder during the course of a drug-re lated crime. The death penalty might be op posed by Michael Dukakis and the American  Civil Liberties Union, but it is strongly support ed by  the American public, and rightfully so.  Those who poison America with illegal drugs  and commit murder in the process should be  forced to pay the ultimate price.  Another important victory was the adoption  of amendments emphasizing  the concept of  user accountability.  If we are ever to win  the  war on drugs, we can no longer tolerate even  the smallest amount of illegal drug use. The  casual or recreational users of  illegal drugs  might think they are engaged  in a victimless  crime, but they are not. They are  just as re sponsible for the criminal activity and all  the  other problems associated with  illegal drugs  as  the hard-core drug addict. They not only  destroy their own lives, but compromise public  safety and cost us millions  in  increased  law  enforcement and  lost productivity. The user  accountable amendments, particularly the Ed wards amendment, will  for the first time hold  these  yuppie  users  accountable  for  their  action. Their adoption is long overdue, and will  provide a major new tool  in  the fight against  illegal drugs.  I also was pleased with the adoption of the  amendment by Representative  LUNGREN  to  allow evidence obtained  in good  faith  to be  used in court. This is a commonsense amend ment that will make  it easier to put drug of fenders where they belong-behind bars. For  too long, our laws have coddled criminals at  the expense of the safety of law-abiding citi zens. The Lungren amendment will  reverse  this trend and swing the pendulum of justice  back to where it belongs, on the side of the  innocent public.  Finally, the defeat and removal of the Brady  amendment, which would have established a  7-day waiting period before the purchase of a  handgun, was another important victory. The  Brady amendment was a gun control measure  that had no place  in an antidrug bill.  Its re moval was warranted and a positive develop ment for all  those who respect the rights of  our Nation's gunowners.  ",1988
1743,1041,17,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Chairman, it is with a great  sense of disappointment  that  I must vote  against final passage of H.R. 5210, the Omni bus Drug Initiative Act as amended.  As  I stated early on  in  this debate,  I sup ported this legislation in its original form. Our  Nation  faces  a  frightening,  complex  drug  crisis,  from the streets of my district in Manhattan and the Bronx to the countryside along  our borders. The Omnibus Drug  Initiative Act  of  1988  incorporated many  important ele ments of a long-term fight against drug abuse.  The hard work and careful  thought of my  friend  and  colleague,  Chairman  CHARLES  RANGEL,  and other distinguished committee  chairmen and Members of  the House who  shaped the omnibus drug initiative produced a  comprehensive  bill with  valuable and  very  necessary  initiatives  in drug education, drug  treatment, and law enforcement programs.  Unfortunately,  a  number  of  ill-conceived  amendments have been attached  to  the bill  which not only would be ineffective in the fight  against drugs, but which would pose grave  constitutional questions.  In our haste to pro tect citizens from the devastation of the drug  crisis, we have seriously threatened their indi vidual  rights.  I deeply regret to say  that be cause  the House has adopted amendments  such as the modification of the exclusionary  rule, establishment of a Federal death penalty,  and  postconviction  denial  of Government  services to drug abusers,  I will be unable to  vote for this measure.  The exclusionary rule is one of the most im portant protections Americans have against  unreasonable search and seizure. Under the  exclusionary rule amendment, however, police  will no longer have to obtain a warrant before  embarking on seizures of admissible evidence.  This amendment undermines the clearly enun ciated constitutional right of the people to be  ""secure in their persons, houses, papers and  effects.""  Requiring the death penalty for drug-related  deaths has no place in our 13ffort to combat  the drug problem. The death penalty is an in appropriate punishment in a system which de pends upon human beings  to decide who  shall live and who shall die.  The so-called user accountability amend ment mandates a punishment  that  is outra geously inhumane. By denying Federal bene fits to drug offenders, this amendment works  directly against reintegration of individuals who  have already served  their sentence. On a  practical  level,  this amendment makes  little  sense, since  its penalties are not related  to  the underlying offenses.  Mr. Chairman, we can do better than  this.  We can achieve solutions  to  the drug crisis  while  safeguarding  the  rights  of  individual  Americans. But we have corrupted the Omni bus Drug  Initiative of 1988 with a series of  pernicious provisions. The  lives of individuals  across the Nation are threatened by the fright ening drug crisis. We must not add  to  the  crisis by taking away the protections guaran teed by the Nation's Constitution.  ",1988
1744,1041,17,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Chairman, I hate to rain on  everyone's parade, but, this antidrug bill, H.R.  5210, the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act of 1988,  is now destined to fail. Let us face it-we are  losing the so-called war on drugs and it is our  current drug policies which exacerbate  the  crisis.  To vote for this legislation is to say it is OK  to deny drug treatment to 90 percent of t:1ose  in need of assistance. A vote for this legisla tion is to say it is OK for addicts turned away  from needed  treatment  to commit crimes  to  maintain their expensive drug habits. I cannot  ",1988

1750,1093,17,Mr. BRUCE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to the amendment offered by the gentle man from Florida.  The McCollum amendment would  require  States to test applicants for marriage licenses.  The AIDS test, and the appropriate attendant  counseling, does help slow the spread of the  virus when it is made available to members of  high-risk groups. However, we should not be  testing everyone. We cannot afford  it and  it  does not make sense.  In  seeking marriage  li censes in most parts of the country are at low  risk for infection with the AIDS virus. This is  true even in those States where the infection  rate exceeds  the 0.1 percent threshold  that  triggers  the McCollum amendment's require ments. The statewide  infection rate  tends to  reflect the extent of infection in urban areas  among people unlikely  to marry-homosex uals and drug users-and to have little or no  bearing on the  likelihood of infection among  marriage license applicants in the State as a  whole.  My home State of Illinois requires the AIDS  test for marriage license applicants. We have  tried  it and we do not think we  like  it. The  Governor of Illinois has already written the Illi nois delegation asking  that we oppose any  Federal mandate  for marriage  license AIDS  testing. And  Illinois has already moved  to  repeal this law.  People  in my district in rural  Illinois are at  low risk for AIDS.  In fact,  in  Illinois we have  found that the most critical population is made  up of  illegal  intravenous drug abusers and  their sexual contacts. Why should people  in  my district have to pay for an AIDS test? The  test now costs between $30 and $200 in Illi nois. The cost of compulsory AIDS testing na tionwide could  run between $218 and $315  million per year. And no matter who pays the  cost massive premarital AIDS  testing would  divert urgently needed resources such as lab oratory  facilities and counselors away  from  more productive AIDS control efforts.  People  in my area  seeking marriage  li censes are not at risk of AIDS. The only thing  they are at risk of is the disruption of waiting  up to 4 weeks for test results and the trauma  that comes with a false positive  test result.  The Office of Technology Assessment has es timated that when a very low-prevalence pop ulation is tested the false positive rate can be  between 9 and 33 percent. In Illinois we have  tested 75,000 marriage license applicants and  found by midsummer nine AIDS virus  infec tions-at a cost of $400,000 per  identified  case of AIDS.  Let your State public health officers follow  the AIDS Control Program  that makes  the  most sense  for  their area. Don't  tie  their  hands by forcing  them to misallocate testing  resources where  they are not needed. Vote  ""no"" on mandatory marriage  license AIDS  tests.  I  ",1988

1752,1106,17,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker,  if  the  gentleman will permit me, I would like  to comment on that, because I think  the case the gentleman is document ing is a very damning one.  I would say, I would have only one  slight semantic difference. The gentle man referred several times to the Vice  President helping trade arms for hos tages. I think we ought to be more pre cise. They traded arms for a hostage.  They thought they were trading arms  for hostages, but they got outtraded  by the Iranians, so they did not even  get the hostages,  in the plural, they  thought they were going to get.  As I recall, they traded these arms  to this incredibly terrible regime and  they got one hostage back, so they did  not even make a good deal.  But I think the gentleman's point is  an example of exactly what I was talk ing about. The GEORGE BUSH that we  have  seen  from  his  resume earlier  would not, I think, have countenanced  these kinds of activities. The GEORGE  BusH who ran in 1980 and was reject ed by the rightwing, and who learned  his lesson from that rejection, would  probably not have allowed these kinds  of illegal activities to have taken place  among his staff; but he has learned his  lesson. Aid to the contras is one of the  causes dearest  to  the heart of  the  right. It does not have and has not  had majority public support in Amer ica, but it was very important to the  rightwing,  and  GEORGE  BUSH  was  afraid because he  is  afraid of  the  effect on his political career of that  rightwing  hostility  to  do  anything  that the rightwing did not like.  This  is  another  example of how  GEORGE  BUSH'S  paralysis when  he  thinks  about  rightwing  opposition  changes the man. He therefore presid ed over, as I  think the gentleman is  well-documenting, a series of activities  he might otherwise not have been in  favor of.  ",1988

1754,1106,17,Mr. FRANK.," I am glad to yield, Mr.  Speaker, although I would hope the  gentleman would be aware that under  the  rules of  the House we  are, of  course,  to address  the Chair. While  the gentleman might have some con cern with people outside, that is not  under the rules and I would not want  to yield to facilitate a violation of the  rules, but I am glad to yield to the  gentleman within the rules.  ",1988
1755,1106,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Well,  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  I was within  the  rules  thinking  about our audience, the distinguished  gentleman who is in the chair.

1757,1106,17,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," He  seems a little more alert right now at  the thought of a little give and take  here.

1759,1106,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Well,  that is true.  I wonder if the gentleman, as a gen tleman of the left, as I am a gentle man of  the  right and as we both  accept those descriptions, all three of  us, when we appear, for example, on  the CNN ""Crossfire Show"" and they  say,  ""On  the  left,  Congressman  BARNEY  FRANK  from Massachusetts.  On  the  right,  Congressman  Bos  DORNAN from California. On the left  Mr. THEODORE WEISS of New York.""  They use those terms, left and right.  So I admit that I am a man of the  right.  Now, would the gentleman say, as I  am willing  to  concede,  that most  people on the gentleman's side of the  aisle are liberals and most of them are  very proud to be liberals and use that  term. Would the gentleman not say  that a majority on this side of the  aisle on the right are conservative?  ",1988

1761,1119,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.," I want  to ask the gentleman a question on  the rules of  the House, because al though we  came  together as  class mates in 1976, along with Congress man DAN QUAYLE who went on to the  Senate 4 years later, I had a break in  service, so at a minimum the gentle man has 2 more years parliamentary  experience than I do, so let me ask the  gentleman a question.  Before  they  jump up emotionally  and scream, ""McCarthyism,"" as Mr.  Dukakis did himself down in Texas on  the college campus where the distin guished 40-year Member from Texas,  Sam Rayburn, matriculated,  before  they  scream,  ""McCarthyism""  they  have got a new little cutie. They say,  ""Don't question my patriotism.""  Every time I get up now, I want to  start off with a little prolog and say,  ""I'm not questioning anybody's patri otism. I just think you are stupid and  naive.""  Now, are we allowed  to say under  the rules of the House that a public  servant, like the Governor of Massa chusetts, is a stealth candidate, that  he runs a campaign of deception be cause he no longer will admit that he  is a dues paying member and carries a  card that says ACLU on it, ""Mr. Duka kis, member in good standing."" Is that  fair ball?  ",1988
1762,1119,17,Mr. WALKER.," I would say to the  gentleman that to discuss Mr. Duka kis' policies, you cannot take Mr. Du kakis and hold him up to ridicule, nor  can you question his personal charac ter or integrity under the rules of the  House. As a Presidential candidate, he  may not be subjected to that kind of  discussion, but you certainly can ques tion his policies on the House floor.  ",1988
1763,1119,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.,"  Just  one comment. I am glad we discussed  that, because I have before me the pic ture of Governor Dukakis in that tank  up at the Chrysler plant, in that M-1  tank, and I am going  to weigh my  words very carefully as I discuss this  picture and why this happened.  ",1988
1764,1119,17,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman will yield,  the gentleman  cannot show that picture of him in the  helmet and so on and hold him up to  ridicule as a result of that. That would  be against the rules of the House for  the gentleman to do that.  ",1988
1765,1119,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.,"  I am  glad the gentleman pointed that out,  because I will weigh my words careful ly when I discuss this picture and dis cuss it factually, trying to avoid at all  costs any hint of ridicule.  ",1988

1768,1119,17,Mr. KONNYU.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding to me.  The clear purpose this evening, aside  from discussing obviously what tran spired before us, was  to discuss  the  Speaker's statement with respect  to  the CIA and Central America. So for  the purpose of debate I have prepared  some  information I  think which ap plies to that point, so that the gentle man and I and the rest of the Mem bers in this Chamber can understand  and recall precisely what this issue is  all about, because what the Speaker  really is talking about in effect is the  effect his words had and has and will  have on the Arias Peace Treaty of Es quipulas-my Hungarian  sometimes  gets in the way.  ",1988
1769,1119,17,Mr. DORNAN of California., Please  do not speak Hungarian.  I did not  yield for that purpose.  ,1988
1770,1119,17,Mr. KONNYU.," That  is  right; but  nevertheless the Peace Treaty of Cen tral America. There are about six key  elements  in  there  that  the  peace  treaty required, a declaration of am nesty for  the guerrilla forces,  it re quired  the  establishment  of  dialog  with all unarmed groups of internal  opposition, and those groups that have  accepted the amnesty; the restoration  of human rights, the repeal of mar shal law or states of emergency. It re quired complete freedom of the press.  That is what he signed. That is what  Ortega signed, and it required freedom  for partisan political activities.  Now that we have recalled what the  peace treaty is all about and we look  at the words of the Speaker, he says,  ""We have  received  clear  testimony  from CIA people that they have delib erately"" -they  meaning  the  CIA  people-""have  deliberately  done  things to provoke an overreaction on  the part of the Government of Nicara gua.""  And what  is  that overreaction all  about? It is about, and again I quote  the Speaker,  this  is  an Associated  Press dispatch, September 20,  1988,  128PET:  It has been foolish of the Sandinistas to  respond to those provocations, Wright said,  referring to the shutting down of opposition  media outlets like the newspaper La Prensa  and Radio Catolica, a church run radio sta tion.  So here we have  the Communist  Government of Nicaragua sign a peace  treaty agreeing to the elements that I  just recited, among them freedom of  the press. Of course, now we have the  Speaker  saying  that we, meaning  through  the CIA, we provoked  the  Government of Nicaragua to such an  extent that they chose to violate the  peace treaty by among other things  shutting down La Prensa,  shutting  down  the radio station, stopping or  disallowing many of the political meet ings that the peace treaty is supposed  to allow.  ",1988
1771,1119,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Will the  gentleman pause there 1 minute, be cause this is such an important point  that it bears reflection.  I wanted  the gentleman  that was  just on the floor, the one who has a  district along the beautiful Canadian  border, he is about as far away from  any  refugee problem, people  fleeing  communism  in Central America or  eventually Mexico as any Member can  get. We, on the other hand, are from  California and like Mr. WRIGHT'S State  of Texas and the State of Florida and  the States  inbetween,  the Southern  States, Arizona and New Mexico, we  are going  to  take the financial and  human  tragedy burden of  refugees  fleeing from this area, if several of the  Democrat liberals in this House persist  in making Central America safe for  communism, which  is my  judgment  call, not questioning their patriotism. I  believe sincerely they are making Cen tral America safe for communism.  But let us take this aspect of what  the Communist  regime  in Managua  does to brutalize its people, close down  those newspapers, deny them printer's  ink and paper, and what it does to con stantly shut down, open up temporari ly and shut down for years at a time  all the Catholic and all the commer cial radio stations.  I  just did a  ""Crossfire""  television  show, Mr. Speaker, with the gentle man from Michigan [Mr. BONIOR].  I  said to him and to Tom Braden, one of  the  liberal  left hosts of  that show,  that their arguments were so idiotic,  and JIM WRIGHT'S argument was so  factually  flawed,  although  sincerely  held I am sure, to say that the actions  of the CIA, not proved, however, pro voked this fascist Hitler storm trooper  series of  tactics by  the Communist  government,  that somehow or other  that is our fault.  ",1988
1772,1119,17,Mr. KONNYU.," Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman will yield, that is precisely  the tragedy in the whole thing, and  the gentleman once again has hit the  nail right on the head.  ",1988
1773,1119,17,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Let me  give the gentleman the analogy that I  used on the air, and again that is a  rush format and this is not, so I will  say it in a more fulsome way.  I said, ""This is a idiotic""-! was ad dressing Braden and  the gentleman  from Michigan [Mr. BONIOR]-""this is  as idiotic as saying Jewish newspapers  caused a sick criminal attitude on Hit ler's part to abuse,  torture, and kill  them.""  Now,  bit.  ",1988
1774,1119,17,Mr. KONNYU.," I will not, of course,  share that analogy with  the gentle man.  let me flesh that out a  little  ",1988
1775,1132,17,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1988
1776,1132,17,Mr. WALKER., I am glad to yield to  the gentleman from Georgia.  ,1988
1777,1132,17,Mr. GINGRICH.," I just want to com ment that I am not sure that most of  our Members and most of the public  can appreciate how serious a violation  we think Speaker WRIGHT has engaged  in and how deeply we take this issue.  There are I think two different areas  we have to look at to understand why  we would charge this as a total betray al of trust. Whether it is a total be trayal of trust because of his lack of  judgment or whether it is a total be trayal of trust because of deliberate  actions, I do not think we know yet.  Let me talk about two areas. First of  all,  if my colleague will continue to  yield, first of all to talk about the con sequences, and second, to talk about  the process.  Even if Speaker WRIGHT had known  something and had been in a position  to  talk about  it,  the human conse quences of what he did this week are  so horrible, the human beings who will  be in prison, the human beings who  lose  their freedom,  the human  beings who will be condemned as trai tors by the Nicaraguan Communists,  the consequences of Speaker WRIGHT'S  behavior in human terms in Nicaragua  in the betrayal of America's friends  and allies, in the granting of cover to  the communist regime,  is absolutely  extraordinary. I do not frankly have  the language for it, because we are not  at war with Nicaragua and the words  one would normally use for this kind  of betrayal of trust are not the correct  words. I am not sure that we have any  language.  In World War II I guess  ""collaborator""  or  ""quisling"" would  have been the closest terms; but let me  walk  through what the Communists  have  done  in Nicaragua with  JIM  WRIGHT'S statement.  This is from Barricada, which is one  of the two Communist newspapers I  want to quote from  this evening. It  says:  will  The only thing that WRIGHT adds to the  evidence, as a footnote, is an official confir mation from Melton's own men.  The Democratic leader said: ""We have ob tained clear testimony from people working  for the CIA, who claim their actions were  purposefully aimed at making the Sandi nista government react strongly.""  Could it be that those U.S. officials are  disguised Sandinista agents who wish to dis credit  the  ""peaceful  opposition?""  This  might serve as the right wing's sole defense.  But extremist rhetoric cannot hide the fact  that  the  provocations  at  El  Calvario,  Masaya, Nandaime-even the very prisoners  that the right wing now wishes to portray as  victims-all fit perfectly into the CIA's plot.  If the right wing now feels devoid of au thority because it has been disqualified as  an alleged national opposition force by the  Americans  themselves,  that  is a problem  they should solve directly with the U.S. Em bassy.  In  other words,  the Communist  newspaper in Managua, is saying it is  JIM WRIGHT who discredits  the pro freedom opposition, that it is Speaker  WRIGHT who has now described  the  CIA plot and that he has disqualified  the pro-freedom forces.  Let me give you a second even more  stunning editorial, which was printed  in Nicaragua by the Communist gov ernment and which appeared yester day. This is from another publication.  I am looking for the title of the publi cation which printed it.  D 2345  ",1988
1778,1132,17,Mr. WALKER.," The gentleman from  Texas [Mr. DELAY] is on the floor. He  was at Nandaime at the time of the  protest that we have been referring to  here and  to which  those editorials  refer, and supposedly the leak of in formation was  that  the CIA was  behind those protests, and I just think  this might be an appropriate time to  ask the gentleman from Texas wheth er or not, being a direct witness to the  situation  there, whether what was  done by the Sandinistas at that time  was something which was provoked by  our CIA.  I yield to the gentleman from Texas  [Mr. DELAY].  ",1988
1779,1132,17,Mr. DELAY.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I  think it is important at this par ticular time to describe what went on  in Nandaime,  and  it  is not  just a  Member from Texas talking, because I  was there with two Democrats and an other Republican, the gentleman from  South Carolina CMr. TALLON], the gen tlewoman  from  Maryland  CMrs.  BYRON], and  the gentlewoman from  Nevada [Mrs. VUCANOVICH] and I went  to  Nicaragua  actually  under  the  premise of  looking at human rights  violations that were being committed  in Nicaragua. We did not even know  that the protest was being planned in  Nandaime when we got there.  When we landed, the embassy was so  upset about what had been going on  for days before our arrival that they  came and wanted to brief us immedi ately about what was going on before  we had a press conference about our  reason for being there. They wanted  to make sure that the propaganda put  out by the Sandinistas that the four of  us were coming there to instigate riots,  the unsettled situation in Nicaragua  and help the opposition.  ",1988
1780,1132,17,Mr. WALKER.," Reclaiming my time,  the Sandinistas were  claiming  that  you, as American Congressmen, were  coming down there to stir up the riots?  ",1988
1781,1132,17,Mr. DELAY.," Absolutely. For a whole  week,  the  Communist  newspapers  were setting up our trip. We did not  even know the Sandinistas even knew  we were coming other than the fact  that we had contacted them 2 or 3  days before we were to arrive, about,  and requested audiences with Daniel  Ortega, Sergio Ramirez, Tomas Borge,  to talk about the violations of human  rights in the prisons, but they set us  up as we were part of Plan Melton,  that we were there to undermine the  Sandinistas and their authorities and  undermine the government and their  paradise in Nicaragua. We were being  set up the whole time before we got  there not knowing there was a march  planned for Nandaime that weekend.  We spent the whole weekend trying to  make sure the world press as well as  the Sandinista press could not tie us to  the demonstration in Nandaime. The  whole weekend we spent, and in fact  we  debated  amongst  ourselves  the  whole weekend about whether to go to  Nandaime even though we were con fronted time and time again by people  in Nicaragua begging us  to come  to  Nandaime because  they knew  if we  showed up  in Nandaime their heads  would not be bashed in. They knew  they would not attack Members of  Congress that were participating in a  march, because  I  participated  in a  march in Leon in December with the  gentleman from Ohio and other Mem bers of Congress. We marched in the  streets of Leon, and they backed off  and had nothing to do with us during  that time.  We consciously knew that we were  being used by the Sandinistas for their  own propaganda, so we worked very  hard to stay away from and not allow  pictures to be taken of us as we were  there.  We were solely there to investigate  the human rights abuses by the Sandi nistas perpetrated on those over 6,000  people who are held in prisons today  in Nicaragua, almost 10 times as many  people as were held by Somoza, but re gardless of that, what we were looking  at was to stay out of Sandinista propa ganda while we  tried  to document  human rights abuses.  As the weekend progressed and as  members of the march were begging  us to appear, we felt like it was not  proper  for us,  and  the embassy,  I  might say, the embassy time and time  again urged us to even forget about  going to Nandaime. They did not want  anyone there in Nandaime, because we  did not want to give any fodder  to  what was going  to happen  in Nan daime.  We got to Sunday morning, and still  as usual the Sandinistas had not given  permission  for  the march at Nan daime. They always wait until the very  last minute to give permission for a  march  trying  to disrupt  the march,  and  they also  finally said we could  meet with a member of the govern ment at the same time of the march  which is rather interesting. We chose  not to meet with the member of the  government.  ",1988
1782,1158,17,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  In  light of the  great support H.R. 3314, a bill to change the  designs of U.S. circulating coins of which one  reverse will have a theme of the ""Bicentennial  of  the Constitution,""  has garnered  in  the  House with more than 45 percent of its Mem bers  as  cosponsors  and  passage  in  the  Senate for the second time unanimously, it is  my pleasure to submit for the RECORD, an edi torial being published tomorrow in Coin World,  the largest trade publication in the Americas.  Certainly, this article will allay the fears of any  of my esteemed colleagues who have not yet  cosponsored  this historically  important and  timely legislation.  [From Coin World, Sept. 21, 19881  ANNuNZIO WAGES ""DISINFORMATION""  CAMPAIGN  Rarely have we seen a more blatant waste  of taxpayer money and such an obvious dis information campaign as  is  contained  in  Rep. Frank Annunzio's August  ""Report  From Washington.""  EDITORIAL  Annunzio, who chairs the House Banking  Committee's Subcommittee on Consumer  Affairs and Coinage, under the guise of re porting to his more than half a million con stitutents in his suburban Chicago district,  is conducting an opinion poll on redesign of  U.S. circulating Coins.  He has certainly made no secret of his op position to the proposals in Congress which  call for coinage redesign. In fact, during the  last six months Annunzio and Subcommit tee Staff Director Curtis Prins have waged a  relentless campaign of distortion and innu endo through press releases, floor speeches  and tirades published in the Congressional  Record.  So it is not all that surprising that they  would attempt to create a public opinion  survey designed to elicit opposition to the  idea of coinage redesign. What is surprising  is the level of deception and the use of tax payer money to create, print and distribute  the disinformation.  For example,  intentionally  laced  in the  comments (presented in news story format>  accompanying the questions on the survey  is  the  statement,  ""Other proponents of  design changes would remove the national  motto, ""In God We Trust""  from United  States coins.""  First, let us set the record straight. Nei ther S. 1776 nor H.B. 3314-the legislative  proposals calling for redesign of the circu lating coins-has a single word about chang ing or removing any of the legends on U.S.  coins. Nor has a single sponsor or co-sponsor  in the House or the Senate advocated such.  Not a  single witness before  the Senate  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Banking Committee, when  it  conducted  public hearings on S.  1776,  advocated a  change in the legends or removal of any.  Annunzio himself interjected the topic of  removing  the national motto  from coins  when he maliciously  took out of context  statements made by Diane Wolf, a member  of  the Commission of Fine Arts, as  she  made suggestions for simplifying medal de signs for  the Young Astronauts program.  Even though his error has been pointed out  to him, Annunzio has not had the decency  to set the record straight. He seized upon  the misquote concocted by the subcommit tee staff and waged an intense campaign to  discredit Wolf,  the  leading proponent of  coinage redesign. And he continues to use  the threat of removing the national motto  as an emotional whipping boy to arouse op position to redesign.  There are numerous other half truths and  unsubstantiated  statements  presented  as  ""truth"" in Annunzio's comments accompa nying his ""poll."" Among the most glaring is  his observation  that coin design changes  occur most often ""in countries with unset tled political, economic or social conditions.  In stable countries, designs tend to change  infrequently."" Is Annunzio trying to tell us  that all previous coinage design changes in  the United States were a result of unstable  conditions? His assertion is neither support ed by the numismatic history of the United  States nor in the documentation of coinage  design changes in the world at large.  It's a shame  that the chairman of  the  Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs  and  Coinage has chosen to deceive his constitu ents and the public at large. His ""opinion  poll"" should be recognized for what it is and  its results should be summarily disregarded,  regardless of the tally.  Coinage redesign deserves to be discussed  in an intellectually honest atmosphere on  the merits of the issue. The United States of  America deserves nothing less.  TRIBUTE  TO  THE  HIPPLE  CANCER RESEARCH CENTER ""THAT OTHERS MAY LIVE""  HON. BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 1988  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker, throughout our  history, the people of America have asked our  Government and the private sector to join to gether  for a common  purpose when  that  common cause  is that of providing essential  services to the citizens of our country.  I rise  today to share with my colleagues in the Con gress  the unique and collaborative  research  efforts of the Hipple Cancer Research Center  in Dayton, OH.  The Hipple Cancer Research  is  fighting a  vigorous  and  enlightened  battle  against  cancer on several  fronts, supported by  the  communities of the Greater Miami Valley and  by the Federal Government.  While four out of five of us will have person al experience of cancer, it is doubtful that any  of us will escape being touched by this dis ease through our families and friends. Fighting  cancer,  then,  is of primary importance to us  all, and  the outcome of  this war  is one  in  which we all have a vital stake.  The Cancer Center's Founding Director, Dr.  Martin  J. Murphy,  Jr., brought  the original  September 22, 1988  cancer  research  laboratory  to Dayton  from  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center  in  1979 when it became a part of Wright State  University.  It  remained associated with  the  University's School of Medicine until 1985  when it became a free-standing, nonprofit in dependent cancer center, 1 of only 22 in the  United States.  The Center's association with Wright State  was of vital importance as it put down roots in  the community. It still maintains academic ties  and a productive collaboration with the Univer sity.  Since its establishment, the Cancer Center  has grown, and its cancer research programs  have multiplied and  flourished,  thanks to the  Center's partnership with  local communities  and the Federal Government. The mission of  the Cancer Center is stated simply but power fully by the phrase ""that others may live.""  Mr. Speaker, the ultimate goal of cancer re search  is  to bring knowledge gained at  the  laboratory bench to the patient's bedside, and  center scientists are doing just that.  They pioneered the technology of cell clon ing  that made possible  the Human Tumor  Cloning Assay Program  through which area  physicians may call upon the Cancer Center  to aid  them  in  identifying the most effective  anti-cancer drugs  to prescribe  for  their pa tients. Later, other Center scientists broad ened  the scope of the assay by developing  the technology of using glass micro-capillary  tubes in which to clone patient tissue, thereby  serving even more cancer patients.  There is today being used in clinical trials a  hormone  that  regulates  the  production  of  white blood cells.  It is a genespliced version  of a natural substance that was identified and  purified  in a laboratory at the Hipple Cancer  Research Center. It is especially fitting that it  is being prescribed for patients in  the Miami  Valley  for  it was  from  the Miami Valley  that  the funds were contributed to support the re search  that  led  to  its discovery and clinical  use.  In this sense, the good people of Miami  Valley are reaping the fruits of their labor and  generosity.  The Cancer Center pioneered the develop ment of the nonfrozen preservation of human  marrow for transplantation, a technology now  used around  the world, and one which was  used  in  the  treatment of radiation victims of  the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident.  Another project currently in process at the  Cancer Center is that of a study of interferon  and its action on cancer cells. A Center scien tist has discovered the cancer cell's receptor  that acts as a sort of sentry that can permit or  bar entry of interferon into the cell. By way of  the correct docking site or receptor, interferon  enters a cell and can complete its mission destruction of  the cancer cell. The generic  regulation  of  cancer  cell  receptors  is  the  object of these investigations with the goal of  making  interferon more clinically useful as a  powereful anti-cancer agent. This  research  program  is  funded primarily by  the National  Cancer  Institute assisted  by  support  from  Miami Valley partners of the Cancer Center,  yet another example of a productive partner ship.  The National Cancer Institute is also funding  the work of the Cancer Center's Drug Toxicol",1988
1783,1171,17,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to pay tribute to a great lady who  resides in the Eighth Congressional District oi  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Tennessee, but whose influence is felt all over  our great State.  Mrs. Carrie Pentecost is the 93-year-old ma triarch of one of Tennessee's most interesting  political families.  I would  like to have the at tached article, which appeared recently in the  Dresden Enterprise,  included  in  so that others can share the many interesting  tales Mrs. Pentecost relates about her child hood and  into her adult years. Needless  to  say, she has experienced many  things and  seen many changes  in her world during  the  last 93 years and  I think my colleagues will  enjoy the article as much as I did.  the RECORD  MRS. CARRIE: MATRIARCH OF TENNESSEE  POLITICAL CLAN  <By Jim Dumas)  Carrie Pentecost  is a non-assuming and  charming  93-year-old  lady whom  some  people believe to be the matriarch of one of  Tennessee's most interesting political fami lies.  But as a non-yielding Democrat, her role  in shaping the political structure of modem  local and state politics has been timely and  behind the scenes. While her father was a  former high sheriff of Weakley County, and  late husband Rev. Cayce Pentecost a  re spected County Clerk and judge in Weakley  County, her only  son Cayce moved  the  family political niche a step further by win ning first the office of state representative  and then several state-wide runs for public  service commissioner.  Even Gov. Ned Ray McWherter would  become a viable part of Mrs. Carrie's world  as ruler of the state House of Representa tives. But she will be the first to say that  cousin Ned's election as governor of  the  state would have been thought next to im possible when the governor was growing up  in Palmersville and Dresden.  Albert Gore Sr., related to the Pentecosts  through marriage to Pauline LaFon, carried  the dynasty outside of Tennessee borders by  winning first a seat in Congress-then U.S.  Senate-and once considering the vice presi dency of the United States.  Then for several months last year and this  year, Mrs. Carr~'s political kin flirted seri ously with the thought of the White House  as Albert Gore  Jr. <now U.S.  Senator)  became a major candidate for  the Demo cratic nomination for president. He failed,  but carried Super Tuesday and his close  hand campaigning left its mark for future  years.  Confidence has certainly not been lacking  in the life of the Pentecost family, at least  of all, not in Mrs. Carrie. ""I think back to a  long time ago when I was a young student  in  school  and wore  a  cape one day.  I  thought I was so pretty and the center of  attention-capes were so stylish then.""  She is  the daughter of Simpson LaFon,  and enjoyed her first years on a farm near  Palmersville. The good years and closeness  of family are among the lasting qualities,  and even during the uncertain times of the  Great Depression,  the LaFon family was  better off than most of their city brethren  because  there was food  to provide steady  diets. Also  standing out-but  on  lesser  tone-was long hours in the tobacco fields,  and to this day Mrs. Carrie frowns when re membering that her job was to worm and  sucker the plants.  ""Palmersville was a busy, bustling place in  those days and we never had to go  into  Dresden because the town had two or three  dry goods, a drug store, post office, bank  and grocery store . . . Still when we wanted  25051  to buy good clothes and shoes, we took the  horse and buggy or team and wagon over to  Cottage Grove. Rainey Brothers Store had  anything you needed in fashions.""  Mrs. Carrie walked at  least 2 miles  to  school at Palmersville and recalls that her  first teachers included Monte and Chesley  Golston. Even when she passed a  special  test to gain a teaching certificate after com pleting  high  school,  one  thing  hadn't  changed. She  still walked  two miles  to  school. She  taught  in old Webb School  when the principal was Theron Kemp, earn ing $30 a month.  ""There were some good one room or two  room schools in the county then, recalled  Mrs. Pentecost. Palmersville even had a col lege in those days called Mina Normal Col lege, and many of the students boarded at  homes in the community.""  She and Cayce Pentecost Sr. were married  in 1915. ""I'll never forget it, and we took the  vows from Brother J.J. Kirkland, a Primi tive Baptist preacher, while seated  in a  buggy the whole time.""  ""Our honeymoon was  in going back  to  Cayce's home where we had a party and lots  of friends came over.""  In 1927, the couple moved to Dresden and  the Pentecost-LaFon political union grew  more steadfast as Mr. Pentecost was elected  County Court Clerk. Mrs. Carrie worked as  deputy clerk during the years that her hus band served as clerk. Judge Pentecost went  on to be a public servant for 24 years. Other  members of the family-in addition to the  junior Pentecost and Simpson LaFon-who  were  elected  to  political office  included  Whit LaFon, ex-sheriff and currently circuit  judge in Madison County.  ""It was good  little political  fun, but  I  never had any urge to run for any office  myself-we just let our men folks-the ones  most interested, take care of all that. Its  still going on, and we are so proud of Al  Gore Jr. too.''  Mrs. Carrie was born in 1895 while Presi dent  Grover  Cleveland  was  half-way  through his second  term, nevertheless,  it  was two people named Roosevelt-one a Re publican-who would make the first impres sion on her. ""Teddy Roosevelt is the first  president I can really remember. But FDR  <F.D. Roosevelt) was I think the greatest of  them all."" Ironically,  the Stephensons on  Mrs. Carrie's mothers side were Republi cans. ""My mother was a Democrat, and I  still don't know whether she was pressured  into becoming one after she met my father,  or just switched on her own.""  ""While there are some things I wouldn't  want  to go  through again. Walking  two  miles to school is one of them. I wouldn't  take anything for the life we had then.""  ""We were as poor as Jobe's turkey, and I  took many a nap under those large tobacco  plants while working through another day.''  But  for an occasional square dance at  Cane Creek, work was the leading recrea tion for the young folks in the mid 1900's  and 1920's. One person who Mrs. Carrie  looked forward to seeing each morning was  the rural mail carrier, Luther Brann. An  avid reader, she looked forward to reading  the Nashville Tennessean  from  front  to  back. Cayce Pentecost Jr. recalls that his  mother was a determined reader of ""just  anything she could get her hands on, includ ing the World Almanac.""  ""She used to tell us about the intense ex citement when the Titanic sunk, and how  everybody around waited anxiously to hear  more details,"" continued Pentecost, and she  ",1988
1784,1184,17,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, the need for vol untary family planning in Africa is greater than  ever. Total population in Africa now stands at  over 600 million people and is doubling every  24 years. The pressure  this growth puts on  the governments, economies and the environ ment of Africa is staggering.  There  is an answer. African governments  who were hostile to voluntary family planning  only 1 O years ago are now overwhelmingly  supportive. The demand  for  family planning  services  is  exploding.  Unfortunately,  the  supply is not keeping up with demand.  When women cannot get access to modern  family planning methods  they  turn  to other  means. Many women in Africa take ""Apiol and  Steel Pills"" or ""Dr. Bonjeans Pills"" to end their  pregnancies. These pills work simply enough.  They contain enough  lead poison  to end a  mother's pregnancy and possibly her life.  Later on today the Foreign Operations Sub committees of  the House and Senate will  have a chance to help stop these practices by  targeting more  family planning assistance  to  Africa. Let's hope  they do. The women of  Africa depend on it.  TRIBUTE TO MRS. YVONNE  GREENLEAF  HON. WILLIAM M.

1785,1184,17,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  rise  today  to extend my congratulations  to  Mrs. Yvonne Greenleaf, of Bakersfield, who  has been named ""Nurse of the Year"" by the  Kern County Registered Nurses' Society.  This is fine and fitting tribute for Mrs. Green leaf from her colleagues inasmuch as she was  selected from a large field of candidates and  nominated by  local organizations and private  citizens. With  Mrs.  Greenleaf's  extensive  background  in nursing, her  long  record of  achievements, and most of all, her kindness  and compassion  in  tending  to suffering pa tients on her rounds,  I know that this honor  will be a source of pride for her, and an inspi ration to her colleagues.  The ""Nurse of the Year"" award is a testa ment to the dedicated work of nurses in Kern  County and throughout the State of California  and  I am proud  to  recognize Mrs. Yvonne  Greenleaf today.  SUMMIT HOTEL-120TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON. MATTHEW J. RINALDO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 1988  ",1988
1786,1184,17,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Speaker, on October 14,  Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey will be  awarded the Summit Hotel's Community Serv ice Award for his leadership in promoting pride  in New Jersey and the economic revitilization  of our State. One of the things that Governor  Kean's administration has enthusiastically sup ported is historic site preservation and restora tion.  The Summit Hotel  is part of  that colonial  history of New Jersey, and which Governor  Kean will celebrate. Famous as a gracious  country  resort  area,  New  Yorkers  once  flocked to Summit for its beautiful rural charm  and atmosphere. At  the heart of this setting  was the Blackburn House, an elegant country  resort. Horses and buggies carried hotel pa trons and  their servants from nearby Lacka wanna Railroad Station  to  the Blackburn  House. It helped Summit to achieve a reputa tion early in this century as a Newport of New  Jersey.  In 1929, as a result of the growing number  of visitors  to Summit,  the present Summit  Hotel was erected on the site of the original  Blackburn House. Expert European craftsmen  were employed to fashion the intricate exterior  Tudor mansion  brickwork  and  the  interior  vaulted beamed ceilings and elaborate and  exquisite Tudor details. It is now listed in the  New Jersey Historic Preservation Sites Inven tory and Union County  Inventory of Historic  Sites.  The  new  Summit Suburban Hotel was  opened  just months before  the 1929 stock  market crash. Many wealthy  residents who  lost their homes and estates moved  in with  their servants and called the hotel their home.  The Summit Suburban Hotel continued as  the home of a celebrated life style, frequented  by prominent public officials and celebrities,  drawn by the hotel's park-like setting and con venient proximity to cultural and  recreational  attractions,  historic downtown Summit  and  easy access to Manhattan.  The Summit Suburban  thrived unchanged  until  1984 when  it was  acquired  by new  owners and  renamed  the Summit Hotel.  In  1986, a comprehensive renovation took place.  Over $10 million was  spent  to  thoroughly  modernize and upgrade  the hotel  to world  class status and capture the look and feel of  timeless European elegance.  Today,  the Summit Hotel  stands  as  a  symbol of the distinguished and colorful histo ry of Summit as well as the home of gracious  hospitality,  fine continental cuisine and Euro pean ambience.  SUPPORT OF H.R. 2461, FOR THE  RELIEF  OF  MILENA  AND  BOZENA MESIN  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 1988  ",1988
1787,1184,17,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of H.R. 2461, a private bill I in troduced last year to save 20-year-old Milena  and 18-year-old Bozena Mesin from being de ported  to Yugoslavia. The girls are currently  living  in Farrell, PA, with  their adopted par ents.  Milena and Bozena Mesin have  resided  continuously in the United States since 1973.  On February 6, 1986, they were legally adopt ed by  their aunt and uncle, Marko and Ann  Mesin. Mr. and Mrs. Mesin are both U.S. citi zens. At the time of the adoption Milena was  17 years old and Bozena was 16 years old.  Due to the difficulty of obtaining parental con sent under Yugoslavian  law, adoption could  not be obtained prior to the age of 16, as re quired by U.S. immigration law. At the time of  the adoption, the girls were living in the United  States on student visas. Unless H.R. 2461  is  adopted,  the girls will be deported back  to  Yugoslavia once their visas expire.  My bill would allow the sisters to stay in this  country  legally and eventually become U.S.  citizens.  I want to take this time to commend  Congressman ROMANO MAzzou, chairman of  the Subcommittee on  Immigration, and  the  rest of the members of the subcommittee for  their patience and understanding  in getting  this bill to the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, Milena and Bozena love their  new country and  their adopted parents very  much. They wish  to  stay  in America and  become productive citizens. Without the timely  intervention of Congress,  these two girls will  eventually face deportation back to the Com munist State of Yugoslavia against their will.  This is not right and it's not the American way.  I urge the House to approve H.R. 2461.  ",1988
1788,1197,17,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Illinois  CMr. MICHEL], our distinguished rank ing Republican leader.  ",1988
1789,1197,17,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker,  going  to make my  argument  briefly on procedural grounds.  This is the 23d time in this Congress  we have been hit with a self-executing  rule. That is nearly 16 percent of all  rules, which has got to be an alltime  record.  Self-executing  rules  are  a  sham.  They represent a continuing abuse of  procedures which, if allowed to contin ue, means that we will have fewer and  fewer opportunities  to consider and  amend legislation on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, most polls out there  are showing that respect for the Con gress as an institution has been drop ping rapidly  in the past 2 years.  Is  there any wonder?  What would the framers of our Con stitution say about the way this House  is being run?  Here we are celebrating the bicen tennial of our Constitution,  the em bodiment of democratic principles, and  we have a Congress running more in  the direction of the old English mon archy. The first seven specific com plaints made against George III in the  Declaration of Independence concern  his disregard or abuse or neglect of  legislative procedure. Boy, he would  feel right at home in this House.  Mr. Speaker, the textile bill which  this rule seeks  to ram through  is a  considerably  different  version  from  that which  originally  passed  the  House. When the House and Senate  bills differ, the normal procedure is to  send them to conference and iron out  those differences, and that is the only  proper way  to go on a controversial  bill such as this.  Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, this  is  just another step. The Congress,  coming  to  an  early  conclusion,  a  number of things pending over in the  other body; what is going to happen  on minimum wage? What is going to  happen on parental  leave? Are we  going  to have  the  same  treatment  when we have an opportunity in this  body to work our will as we did on the  drug bill and made a real substantial  contribution to helping shape that leg islation?  Mr. Speaker, that is what our role  ought to be in this House. Those of  my colleagues, even those who on sub stantive grounds supported textile legislation  in  the past, ought  to vote  against  it for no other reason,  than  what is being done to us with respect  to the rules. This applies particularly  to those on my side of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote against this self-executing rule.  ",1988
1790,1197,17,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from North  Carolina CMr. HEFNER],  for  the pur poses of debate only.  ",1988
1791,1197,17,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  once again in support of a bill which  has been fought long and hard in this  body. This Congress and the adminis tration has acknowledged that a level  playing field is absolutely necessary if  we  are  to  compete  successfully  in  international markets by enacting the  general trade bill. It is now time  to  make sure that the same level field is  afforded to the textile industry. H.R.  1154 must be passed and signed by the  President.  There are those that say this is a  protectionist measure. Nothing could  be further from  the truth. This bill  does not roll back imports of textile  and apparel: It does establish global  quotas and provides for annual growth  rates.  This is what this administration had  said it would consider as a method for  dealing with the flood of imports into  this country.  In a  letter  to  former  Congressman Carroll Campbell in Jan uary of 1980, then candidate Reagan  stated that import growth might be  tied  to domestic market growth and  that global quotas might also be used.  Since 1980, the trend in imports has  grown many times faster than the do mestic market. And I say to our friend  who  talks  about  declining  imports  from July of 1987 that new domestic  orders for textiles has declined by 9  percent in real terms. The decline in  imports is clearly market related and  not to any quota restrictions.  With  the growth  rate allowed by  this bill 1989  imports would be  in creased  by  700-million-square-yard  equivalents over this year's pace of im ports. This  is compared with a U.S.  market that grows  less than 400,000  square yard equivalents a year.  One further point, Mr. Speaker. We  ought to pass and the President ought  to sign this textile trade bill on nation al security grounds alone. The textile  industry ranks second only to the steel  industry in importance to our national  security. A strong viable textile indus try is exceedingly important to the in dustrial base of our country and to our  national security.  ",1988
1792,1197,17,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine [Ms. SN OWE].  ",1988
1793,1197,17,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of this rule which is  vital  trade  relief  legislation  for our  textile, apparel, and footwear  indus tries.  For years, foreign footwear and tex tile products have been the Hurricane  Gilbert of  imports,  laying waste  to  hundreds of companies and destroying  thousands of jobs. Unfortunately, this  import storm has yet to be downgrad ed. The textile, apparel, and footwear  industries have been  the consistent  victims  of  uncontrolled  and unfair  import surges.  This legislation, by allowing 1-per cent annual growth  for  textile  im ports, and maintaining footwear  im ports at the 1987 volume level, is virtu ally their last hope for survival.  This initiative signifies a new, clear eyed approach  to  trade, and a new  awakening to the realities of the inter national economy. The U.S. Govern ment can and should take substantive  actions  to counter  the  targeted  im ports from countries running their in dustries full-tilt and paying submini mum wages to cut into the American  market.  Just look at what the cold neglect of  the Federal Government has meant to  the footwear industry.  In  1981, when orderly marketing  agreements expired,  footwear  import  levels  hit  50  percent  of  the U.S.  market. By 1985, when the administra tion denied relief after a formal sec tion 201 injury determination, imports  had climbed  to over 75 percent. By  1987, imports went over 81 percent.  Our  trade  laws should be able  to  confront problems like this, but that  apparently is the case only in theory.  In reality,  this  import surge cost us  over 7,000  jobs  in Maine alone, and  forced 19 plants to close their doors.  Textile and apparel imports contin ue to soar as well, and are gleefully  dropped by the ton on the everentic ing American market through lack of  enforcement and big loopholes in the  Multi-Fiber Arrangement.  In recent years, while the Govern ment has sat idle, the job loss toll has  mounted. Only recently in Maine, over  100 employees at the Carlton mill in  Winthrop were  laid off. The Emple  Knitting Mill in Brewer closed down  this spring and 150 more workers lost  their jobs. Dozens of other examples  a.bound.  Mr. Speaker, this bill cannot change  the past but it will help this Nation  face  the  future. We  simply cannot  afford to wait, though. A recent Office  of  Technology  Assessment  report  reaches a chilling conclusion: In the  absence of a response to these surges  in imports, the United States stands to  lose all of its apparel market and two thirds of its textile market by the year  2000. That's no way to celebrate the  dawn of a new millennium.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I strongly  support enactment of this legislation.  Let us start today to respond to trade  conditions as they actually affect in  practice our companies in the United  ",1988
1794,1210,17,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today in opposition to H.R. 1154, the Tex tile and Apparel Trade Act.  When this measure was considered by the  House,  I voted against  it. And  I will  vote  against the amended version sent back to us  by the Senate.  I believe H.R. 1154 would put at risk recent  gains and  further expected growth  in export  earnings for the American farmer. We cannot  hope to regain export markets by expanding  our trade barriers-as this bill would.  Some have said  the Senate amendments  have made  this  legislation more  reasonable  than the bill the House passed in September  1987. I disagree.  The so-called Daschle amendment which is  being marketed as a weapon that would pro tect American agriculture exports from being  used as a retaliatory weapon by our trading  partners,  is a  feeble attempt  to gain Farm  State members' support for the bill.  H.R. 1154 would limit imports of textiles and  apparel from all countries at their 1987 levels  plus 1 percent growth overall each year.  The Daschle amendment would give prefer ence  in  the allotment of  that 1 percent  in crease to  those countries that have demon strated a good record of importing U.S. agri cultural products during the previous 2 years.  In other words,  the amendment would sup posedly ""reward"" countries  that continue  to  import U.S. agriculture products in large quan tities.  While  that may sound good,  it would not  work. An  increase  in  the quota of a country  that  increased  farm  imports would come at  the expense of other countries.  If a  large  number  of  textile-producing  countries  in creased  their purchases of U.S. agriculture  products, there will be  little room for a large  increase  in  any  individual  country's  textile  quota allocation.  In addition, countries  that do not  increase  imports of U.S.  agricultural products would  suffer reduced quota levels regardless of our  commitment under  the Multi-Fiber Arrange ment  [MFA],  the multinational  agreement  which regulates  international  trade  in  textiles  and  apparel. Under  the MFA,  the United  States  has  bilateral  agreements  governing  specific quotas with more than 30 countries.  Our disregard  for  the MFA could cause  countries  to  retaliate  against  the  United  States. Retaliation would most likely be in the  agriculture sector.  Countries  that would suffer a cutback  in  quotas  in  a given  year would  be Korea,  Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  In  fiscal year 1987,  these countries imported $1.7 billion, $1.4 bil lion, and $436 million of U.S. agricultural prod ucts, respectively.  In  total,  the 40 or so countries that would  most likely have their exports affected by the  textile bill buy 70 percent of U.S. farm exports.  Obviously, with  this kind of exposure, Ameri can agriculture will make a very attractive and  likely  target  from  these countries  for retalia tion.  In my home State of Nebraska, overseas  trade  is crucial  to adequate  farm and  ranch  income. One out of every three farm acres is  dedicated to production for export. Moreover,  economists estimate each $1  billion  in  farm  exports creates agricultural jobs for as many  as 35,000 workers. An additional 60,000 non farm jobs are created with each $1 billion  in  farm export sales.  America's farmers are being placed on  the  line to protect a textile industry that currently  has 1,400 quotas already in place and whose  imports have declined by 15.6 percent since  July 1987.  Our farmers have gone through the adjust ments necessary  to make  themselves com petitive again  in world markets.  It makes no  sense for us now to throw up a trade barrier  inviting retaliation against the U.S. agricultural  exports, expecially when it is one sector of our  economy that is contributing positively to the  Nation's trade balance.  I also fear the consequences of this bill on  the American  retailer  and  consumer.  The  International  Business  and  Economic Re search Corp. estimates  that  the  legislation  would cost $10.4 billion annually. Families will  be forced  to pay  from $285 to $600 a year  more for clothing than they do now.  Mr. Speaker,  I have not been  totally as sured that agriculture will be protected by the  Daschle amendment and I urge my colleagues  to vote against H.R. 1154 by voting no on the  motion to agree to the bill as amended by the  Senate.  ",1988
1795,1210,17,Mr. FAWELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  opposition  to  the self-executing  rule on  the  Senate amendments to H.R. 1154, the Textile  and Apparel Trade Act.  I urge my colleagues  to reject this protectionist trade legislation.  Once again,  the textile and apparel  indus tries are before Congress clamoring  for pro tection. These industries are already the most  heavily protected in the country by an elabo rate network of quotas and tariffs. The Multi Fiber Arrangement  [MFA], originally enacted  as a temporary system, extends quota protec tion  to some 1,500 textile and apparel prod ucts. The MFA renewed in 1986 now covers  80 percent of all low-priced textile and apparel  products.  In addition to the MFA, 42 bilateral agree ments have been negotiated by the Adminis tration, including agreements with Hong Kong,  Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to limit their  import growth to one percent annually.  The  textile and apparel  industries  receive  further protection from steep tariffs. Tariffs on  textile and apparel imports average an incred ibly high 18.6 percent, which  is much higher  than the average 3.6 percent tariff on all other  imports.  How much more do the textile and apparel  industries want? In my view, too much. In fact,  the protection currently extended to these in dustries is costing American consumers up to  $27 billion annually according to the Institute  for  International Economics. The quota bill  adds an additional $10.4 billion  to  that price  tag. Of course, increased consumer costs will  hit low-income families the hardest.  There are other losers under this quota bill.  In order to ""save"" 46,000 jobs in  the textile  and  apparel  industries,  the  retail  industry  would  lose an  estimated 52,000  jobs  that  depend  on  imports.  It would  cost  over  $220,000 to ""save"" each textile and apparel  job.  Although proponents of this quota bill would  have us believe that the textile and apparel in dustries are on  their  last  legs and  that  this  protection will  restore  them  to  greatness,  don't believe  it. These  industries are doing  quite well already.  Capacity utilization in  the textile  industry is  92 percent compared to an 83 percent aver age for other manufacturing industries. Textile  and apparel exports were up by 14.4 and 25.1  percent in 1987, respectively.  In the first five  months of this year, textile imports fell by 8.2  percent and apparel exports dropped by 10.5  percent. Textile producers  registered  record  profits of $1.9 billion last year. The textile in dustry created 21,000 new jobs last year-a 3  percent increase.  While there is little argument that these in dustries have experienced job losses in earlier  years, that employment drop is not due solely  to  import penetration. A study conducted by  Clemson  University  economics  professor  Richard McKenzie concludes that 83 percent  of the job loss between 1973-84 in the textile  industry was  the  result  of productivity  in creases.  Enactment of  this quota  legislation would  turn our trade  laws on  their head. Our trade  laws are designed  to  remedy unfair  trade  practices and prevent serious injury to domes tic industries as a result of imports. The textile  and apparel  industries do not meet either of  these standards. It would be insidious to pass  a quota bill that empties the pockets of con sumers and costs jobs in  the retail sector in  order to further protect industries that are eco nomically robust.  ",1988
1796,1210,17,Mr. SPRATI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my  colleagues  to vote  in  favor of  the Senate  amendments  to H.R.  1154,  the Textile and  Apparel Act of 1987. This bill is critical if we  are  to preserve  the  largest employer  in  the  manufacturing sector,  the textile and apparel  industry.  In 1981, when the Reagan-Bush administra tion took office, the U.S. imported $9.5 billion  in textiles and apparel. Last year,  textile and  apparel  imports reached $29 billion;  in other  words, in 7 years, they tripled. The textile/ap parel trade deficit now represents 16 percent  of our total trade deficit. This year, imports are  projected once again  to  reach near  record  levels. While  imports have been  increasing  steadily and by  large  rates, domestic con sumption has been rising each year by only 1  percent. As a result of high volume foreign im ports, new orders for textiles and apparel pro duced by U.S. manufacturers are plunging,  with apparel volume orders down 3 percent  and textile orders down 9 percent in the first 4  months of 1988.  Mr. Reagan, when he was running for Presi dent, promised  that  textile and apparel  im ports would be related to growth in  the U.S.  domestic market. He promised a policy of  managed  trade.  Import  increases  of  over  200% do not represent managed trade. In ne gotiating bilateral agreements with product-by product quotas, this administration has broken  its promise to industry, and left it to Congress  to provide a system of managed trade for tex tiles and apparel.  The Administration already has the legal au thority to implement a global quota.  It would  ",1988
1797,1223,17,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman, at the appropri ate time, I will off er an amendment, authorized  by the rule, which would establish demonstra tion projects for counseling and mental health  services  to  individuals with positive HIV  test  results. I will then seek unanimous consent to  modify the amendment in accordance with an  agreement with  the distinguished gentleman  from  Illinois, ",1988
1798,1223,17,Mr. MADIGAN.," This amendment  would add a section under title  I, counseling  and testing with respect to AIDS. The section  would establish demonstration project grants  to public and private nonprofit entities to de velop, establish, and expand programs to pro vide  AIDS-related  counseling  and mental  health services.  Research  studies  have  documented  the  possibility of significant social and psychologi cal reactions to a positive AIDS antibody test.  Depression, social  isolation, suicide, and dis abling anxiety have all  been  reported. Al though severe  reactions appear  to occur  in  less than 1 O percent of these cases, special ized counseling and mental health services  are clearly needed in such cases.  H.R. 5142 provides for post-test counseling  at  the  time an  individual receives his or her  AIDS antibody test result. For some people,  this one counseling session will not be suffi cient to facilitate the kind of behavior change  necessary to stop further transmission of the  AIDS virus. This amendment would provide for  followup counseling and mental health serv ices which would  include facilitating behavior  change in order to prevent the transmission of  the AIDS virus. The amendment is therefore in  keeping with public health goals.  Recent reports suggest that it may only be  a matter of time before 50 to 100 percent of  infected  individuals develop AIDS. Thus, any  program which attempts to encourage people  to be tested must be prepared to respond to  the possible social and psychological conse quences of a positive test result.  Fortunately, AIDS-related service agencies  have been developed  in most areas with a  significant  concentration  of  AIDS  cases.  These agencies have  identified the need for  AIDS-related mental health  treatment  in  the  area being served by the agency. Counselors  and mental health specialists at such agen cies have often received advanced training on  AIDS and the particular mental health issues  likely  to  result  from  infection with  the AIDS  virus as well as techniques for facilitating be havior change  likely to prevent further trans mission of the virus. Such agencies would be  ideally  suited  to  provide  counseling  and  mental health services described in  this sec tion.  Since programs  funded under this section  are  intended  to  serve  as  demonstration  projects,  it  is  important  that grant recipients  collect meaningful data on outcomes of thera peutic interventions and that agencies be able  to advance knowledge of how best to be of  assistance to people under this section. Model  protocols  for specialized AIDS-related coun seling and mental health services could be of  great assistance in improving the quality of all  AIDS-related  counseling  and mental health  services.  Development of adequate measures of out come and the ability to compare the data gen erated by individual grantees across the vari ous demonstration sites is important. This will  require some degree of research expertise in  the administration of the program. In its origi nal version, responsibility for this program was  assigned  to  the National  Institute of Mental  Health  [NIMH] which has close  ties  to  the  mental health community and which has long  standing expertise  in  clinical  research. Al though it was determined that decisions about  program administration should be left with the  HHS Secretary, the amendment allows critical  technical assistance and administrative sup port from HIMH. Regardless of where lead re sponsibility for this program  is assigned,  this  provision will insure that the institute will play  a role, both in terms of substantive expertise  as well as the detailing of staff, in program im plementation.  Mr. Chairman, the modified amendment has  been  stated as an authorization  ""for such  funds as may be necessary"" rather than  for  $25 million so that the amendment would be  parallel to the other provisions of H.R. 5142.  Although  the  funding  level  for  the program  would be determined by  the Appropriations  Committee, the figure specified in the amend ment as found in the report on the rule is con sidered a reasonable level of funding for this  program.  ",1988
1799,1223,17,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Chairman, as  we all know, H.R. 5142 is the largest piece of  legislation concerning  the  issue of AIDS  to  come before the full House. This a landmark  bill  in  the health care  industry, however,  I  simply could not vote for a bill that appropri ates so much money yet doesn't do anything  to directly combat  the problem. Due  to  the  rule on this bill and the limited amount of time  left  on  the  Legislative Calendar,  several  amendments vital  to gaining control over the  AIDS epidemic were defeated, or denied con sideration altogether. This should not have  been the case! This bill should have been left  as  three separate bills as was originally  in tended. A bill of this magnitude should not be  ""hustled"" through to the floor for a vote.  As of September 12, 1988, 72,766 cases of  AIDS have been reported to CDC. All projec",1988

1802,1249,17,Mr.  SHARP.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased to  take up again H.R. 2858,  the Regulatory Fairness Act, which  the House passed  last October and  which the Senate took up, in amended  form, just 2 weeks ago.  This bill corrects a 50-year-old gap in  the Federal Power Act. As we know,  when an interstate utility applies for a  rate  increase  before  the  Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, that  increase goes into effect almost imme diately, subject to refund only if the  utility does not prevail in the rate pro ceeding.  By contrast, if a wholesale customer  of that utility applies for a rate de crease, he can recover the overcharge  only from the date of the decision by  FERC, which may  take 2 years.  In  other words,  that entire 2 years of  overcharges would never be recovered.  The Regulatory Fairness Act cor rects this disparity by ensuring that a  customer who wins his rate decrease  case at FERC will get refunds dating  back to the date he filed his applica tion. This simple fix means lower rates  for wholesale and ultimately for retail  customers. It also ushers  in, as  the  name implies, a measure of regulatory  fairness  in the procedures governing  the way our Nation's wholesale elec tric rates are set.  The Senate has amended the House passed bill in several ways, the most  important one being that retroactive  refunds are limited to 15 months from  the ""refund effective date"" unless the  utility has been dilatory. I hope that  FERC will monitor closely the average  duration of rate  refund proceedings  and report back to Congress on this  issue in the study called for in section  5 of the amended bill.  I commend the gentleman from Illi nois [Mr. BRUCE] for his leadership in  sponsoring and championing this bill;  Mr. MOORHEAD  for his vigorous sup port; and Mr. GEDJENSON for his initia tive and input.  I also commend the  American Public Power Association  for its massive efforts to cure a statu tory defect that has been on the books  for half a century.  ",1988

1808,1249,17,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Reserving  the  right to object, Mr. Speaker, I have no  objection to passage of this legislation  by unanimous consent.  This  bill  is  simply  intended  to  reform an anomaly in the jurisdiction  over certain local gas distribution com panies. These companies happen  to  sell gas, at retail, to customers in more  than one State. This fact makes them  technically subject to the authority of  the Federal Energy Regulatory Com mission.  Local gas service has always been  subject to State public utility regula tion. All  local gas companies-except  the few companies covered by H.R.  2884-are therefore regulated by one,  local body. There is no reason why the  companies who  serve  customers  in  more than one State-so long as this  service is a local, retail service-should  be treated differently.  I  thank Congressman  SHARP  for  working with me on making enact ment of this regulatory reform possi ble.  I urge passage of H.R. 2884.  ",1988
1809,1249,17,Mr. SHARP.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1988
1810,1249,17,Mr. MOORHEAD., I yield to the gen tleman from Indiana.  ,1988
1811,1249,17,Mr. SHARP.," Mr. Speaker, as my col league may know, this is a noncontro versial natural gas bill which has been  cleared on both sides.  It affects only 8 of the 1,000  local  gas utilities in our Nation. These utili ties have for decades been subject only  to State rate regulation, like all other  local utilities. FERC has never before  regulated their rates.  But these few gas companies operate  on the borders of two or more States:  Washington Gas Light, with intercon nected operations in Virginia, DC, and  Maryland, is an example.  This  accident  of  geography  and  recent changes in gas industry trans portation rules, has turned local gas  flows through the small pipes of these  eight companies into ""interstate trans portation,"" which FERC controls.  This bill merely restores local con trol over the rates, terms, and condi tions of local transportation service.  The House approved it unanimously  earlier this year.  The Senate made a modest amend ment to our bill, to limit its reach to  only  two of the  three Iowa utilities  covered by the House bill.  I believe  this  is acceptable  to  the gentleman  from Iowa [Mr. TAUKE]. Besides, the  uncovered  third Iowa utility will be  covered by the Senate amendment if it  gets a  local service area ruling from  FERC.  This is fair. After all, the bill applies  the same prerequisite  to  the other  eight companies.  ",1988

The Clerk read as follows:  Committee amendment in the nature of a  substitute: Strike out all after the enacting  clause and insert in lieu thereof the follow ing:  SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF MEMORIAL.  Ca)  IN GENERAL.-The Vietnam Women's  Memorial Project, Inc.  is authorized to es tablish a memorial on Federal land in the  District  of Columbia or  its  environs  to  honor women who  served  in  the Armed  Forces of the United States in the Republic  of Vietnam during the Vietnam era.  (b) COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS FOR COM MEMORATIVE WORKS.-The establishment of  the memorial shall be in accordance with  the Act entitled ""An Act to provide stand ards for placement of commemorative works  on certain Federal lands in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other  purposes"", approved November 14, 1986 (40  U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).  SEC. 2. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES.  The United States shall not pay any ex pense of the establishment of the memorial.  SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.  It is the sense of the Congress, with re spect to location of the memorial in accord ance with the Act referred to in section l(b),  that it would be most fitting and appropri ate  to place  the memorial within  the 2.2  acre site of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial  in the District of Columbia.

1817,1262,17,Ms.  OAKAR.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  amendment in the nature of a substi tute to S. 2042 makes it clear that this  memorial will be established  in  full  compliance with the Commemorative  Works Act. It is the sense of Congress  that it would be most fitting and ap propriate for  this commemorative to  be  located within the 2.2 acres sur rounding the Vietnam Veterans' Me morial, and this sense is expressed in  the legislation. However, in its site and  design selection, the project must pro ceed with the full approval of the Na tional Capital Memorial Commission.  The United States will not pay any ex pense  for  the establishment of  this  memorial.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity to commend my col leagues, Mr.  SAM  GEJDENSON, Mr.  SONNY MONTGOMERY,  and my distin guished minority chairman, Mr. FREN ZEL, for their countless hours of hard  work in developing a compromise that  was satisfactory to all with respect to  this legislation before us today.  0 1515  It is the sense of Congress that it  would be most fitting and appropriate  for this commemorative to be located  within the 2.2 acres surrounding the  Vietnam Veterans' Memorial and that  this is the sense that is expressed in  the legislation. However, in its site and  design selection, the project must pro ceed with the full approval, which we  have every hope of getting, of the Na tional Capital Memorial Commission.  The United States will not pay any  expense for the establishment of this  memorial.  Mr. Speaker, once again I want to  take this opportunity to commend my  colleagues, Mr. GEJDENSON, Mr. MONT GOMERY' Mr. HARRIS and certainly my  distinguished  minority  chair,  Mr.  FRENZEL and his staff and my staff for  the countless hours, literally that they  put in, in developing this compromise  that would make sure that this legisla tion was conforming.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I  think most  Americans knew or had heard of or  loved a number of the 57 ,000 Ameri cans who were killed  in Vietnam.  I  think the fact that we are once again  making this memorial even more per fect, it seems to me, just attempts to  achieve the reconciliation that we all  want with respect to the Vietnam war.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank every one again.  Mr. SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  STENHOLM). The question  is on  the  committee amendment in the nature  of a substitute.  The committee amendment  in  the  nature of a substitute was agreed to.  The Senate bill was ordered to be  read a third time, was read the third  time, and passed.  The title of the bill was amended so  as  to read: ""A bill  to authorize the  Vietnam Women's Memorial Project,  Inc., to establish a memorial on Feder al land in the District of Columbia or  its environs to honor women of the  Armed Forces of  the United States  who served in the Republic of Vietnam  during the Vietnam era.""

1828,1314,17,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President,  this is obviously encouraging news. We  want to welcome the four members of  the Republican Party that supported  this motion. There are a  few of our  members that were necessarily absent  that would support thisproposal.  I want to indicate that I believe that  we are on the edge of having a success ful resolution of the obstacles which  we are faced with here, and that would  permit us to move ahead, hopefully,  with a vote on the Kennedy-Byrd pro posal on the subminimum. So I  am  grateful to those that have supported  this proposal.  I am very hopeful, with that very in creasingly clear picture, that we might  now move ahead and see if we cannot  get a debate and resolution of some of  these matters, because  I  think it  is  going  to be quite clear that we are  going  to be able  to get cloture.  would seem  to me that it would be  useful for us to start voting on these  various measures and  these various  amendments.  So I thank those members who sup ported our motion. Hopefully, if there  is no further discussion, we will move  It  Is  toward a vote on the Kennedy substi tute or perfecting amendment.  ",1988
1829,1314,17,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  there further debate?  ,1988
1830,1314,17,Mr. DOLE.," Madam  President,  I  would not read  too much  into  that  vote. It is Friday and some people are  confused. (Laughter.> But by Monday  or Tuesday they will be clear-headed  again and they will understand what is  at stake here.  This is a procedural vote.  I would  again indicate to those who may have  voted  today for cloture on  this side  that we hope we can have a minimum  wage  increase, a modest increase, an  appropriate  increase.  I  believe  that  there might be votes for a modest in crease on this floor-not the Kennedy  bill, but a modest increase.  So  I would not want  the Senator  from Massachusetts  to celebrate  too  much this weekend thinking that he  was  in sight of victory because we  have  a  little  something  there we  cannot quite explain, but we will work  it out  by Tuesday  or Wednesday,  whenever the next vote is.  We will work out a minimum wage  bill in 30 minutes, but I  think there  are some other matters we would like  to discuss at the same time.  I would say to those who feel pres sured by organized  labor that orga nized labor does not have much of a  stake in this. I do not know anybody in  the unions that is worried about mini mum wage. But this is a  labor issue  and they are calling in their chips. In  my view there is more at stake than  what organized labor may want.  I again point out that in the state ment of the Senator from Massachu setts I believe he used GEORGE BUSH'S  name 45 times. This is all politics. Let  us not be misled.  I say to my colleagues on this side,  let us  take another look next week.  Let us understand these are procedur al votes and that we are linking these  votes  to many other  items  that we  think we would like to conclude by the  end of this year.  I hope, in the meantime, if we want  to start working on amendments, al ternating amendments,  then I  think  the Senator from Utah would be very  pleased  to agree  to  that, at  least  I  would encourage him to do that.  But, on the other hand, if we cannot  off er Republican amendments, then I  do not know why we should provide  the votes for cloture on this side. I do  not understand it. I do not think we  will, in the final analysis. We will see  what happens in the event the majori ty leader should file another cloture  motion. Maybe he will pull  the bill  down.  ",1988

1834,1327,17,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, we are  today  taking  the  final steps  toward  sending S. 328, the Prompt Payment  Act Amendments of 1987, to the Presi dent to be signed into law. Given the  broad,  bipartisan  support  for  this  bill-support which can best be de scribed as overwhelming-I am confi dent that the President will sign this  much needed legislation into law.  My colleagues will recall that I  in troduced S. 328 in January 1987 with  some 55 cosponsors. The list of cospon sors on the bill eventually grew to 88.  When taken up in the Senate in Octo ber of last year, S 328 was unanimous ly approved by a rollcall vote of 86 to  0. The bill enjoyed similar unanimous  support  in  the House. The vote on  final passage in the House last month  was a resounding 394 to 0.  Mr. President, the impressive votes  in both the Senate and House under score our commitment  to  the basic  principle behind the Prompt Payment  Act-getting the Federal Government  to pay its bills on time. For too long,  foot-dragging on bill payment by Gov ernment agencies sent a very danger ous message to the business communi ty,  that  the  Federal Government  simply was not a responsible business  partner.  This shortcoming led to passage o.f  the original Prompt Payment Act in  1982. And we did see some  improve ments in Government bill paying prac tices with passage of that measure.  However, the Prompt Payment Act  has never quite lived up to its poten tial. Clever Government bureaucrats  managed to find loopholes and ambi guities in the act to delay payment to  business contractors.  The General Accounting. Office stud ied the Government's compliance with  the Prompt Payment Act  in a 1986  report entitled, ""Prompt Payment Act:  Agencies Have Not Fully Achieved  Available Benefits."" The GAO found  that nearly 25 percent of Government  payments were  still  late. Moreover,  GAO found that required interest pen alties were seldom paid. Agency per sonnel routinely abused the so-called  grace periods contained  in  the act,  thereby delaying payment to vendors.  The list of abuses goes on and on,  Mr.  President. These  shortcomings  were underscored at the 1986 White  House Conference on Small Business.  Delegates to that conference ranked  closing the loopholes  in the Prompt  Payment Act as one of their top prior ities. A  recommendation  supporting  corrective legislation was one of the  final recommendations coming out of  that conference.  The hearing record which we estab lished on S. 328 both in the Senate  Government Affairs Committee and in  the House Government Operations  Committee  brought  out  testimony  that again  illustrated  the abuses of  the act and urged swift, remedial legis lation.  I would  add, Mr. President,  that  testimony before both commit tees brought forth modifications to S.  328 which I believe greatly enhanced  the bill.  As such, S. 328 goes very far in ad dressing the different short-comings in  the Prompt Payment Act. The bill  eliminates  the various grace periods  currently in the Prompt Payment Act.  These grace periods were originally in tended to provide transitional relief to  Government agency  in adjusting  to  the Prompt Payment Act. Unfortu nately,  Government  bureaucrats  abused these grace periods and used  them  to stretch out  the period for  timely  payment  on  contracts. The  elimination of these grace periods will  help expedite such payments.  The bill also addresses the problem  of nonpayment of interest penalties.  My colleagues will recall that under  the Prompt Payment Act, if a Govern ment agency is late in paying its bill it  must also pay an interest penalty. Yet,  as I have noted very few of such inter est penalty payments are being made.  Indeed,  the GAO report found  that  only 1 in 6 of such payments due is ac tually made.  To correct this problem, S. 328 enti tles a contractor to an additional inter est penalty payment prescribed by the  Office of Management and Budget in  such cases. I believe this will provide  both the additional incentive and the  necessary oversight  for Government  agencies to comply with the interest  penalty provision already in the law.  My colleagues will recall that one of  the major provisions  in S. 328 deals  with applying  the provisions of  the  Prompt Payment Act  to subcontrac tors. This is an issue which we wres tled with for some time in the Senate.  We modified our  language on  this  matter several  times  in an effort to  provide  responsible  relief  to subcon tractors. Our colleagues in the House  have further modified our provisions  on this point and have come up with  language which I believe addresses the  problems of subcontractors while bal ancing  the  needs  and  concerns  of  prime contractors.  Mr. President, these are just are few  of the highlights of S. 328 .. I would ask  unanimous consent that a section-by section analysis of the bill be included  in the RECORD  immediately following  my remarks.  ",1988

Mr. President,  I note  I have been  joined here on the floor by the distin guished manager of  this bill on the  other side, Senator TRIBLE, who has  rendered yeoman's service in bringing  this bill to the floor, on its passage  once before through this body.

1838,1340,17,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, the  House message now before the Senate  authorizes the construction of a new  building adjacent to Union Station to  consolidate the various components of  the Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts which are currently housed in  several locations throughout the city.  This conference report represents the  culmination of several years of work to  develop a unique public-private part nership for the construction of this fa cility.  While I understand the severe space  restrictions facing the Administrative  Office of  the Courts,  I believe, Mr.  President, our first priority in the Judiciary must be  to meet  the actual  costs associated with the operations of  our Federal courts which has resulted  from a burgeoning Federal caseload.  The Commerce, Justice, State, and  the Judiciary Appropriations Subcom mittee has just completed conference  on the fiscal year 1989 bill. The budget  constraints  facing  the subcommittee  were such that we were unable to pro vide the Judiciary's requested 30-per cent  increase and heard from many  Members as to the pressing needs of  the  Judiciary. My  concern with S.  1934, Mr. President, is not as to the  Administrative Office's need for addi tional space, but more to the question  of funding priorities with limited Fed eral resources.  When  this bill was originally ap proved by the Senate, provision was  made for  the chairman of the Com merce, Justice, State, and the Judici ary Appropriation Subcommittee to be  on the oversight committee for  this  project. However, the other body op posed our inclusion and this measure  now  includes no representatfon from  Appropriations. That is precisely my  complaint other people are running  up the costs that we are asked to pay  within a constrained Federal budget.  ",1988

1869,1353,17,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, press  stories covering the National Econom ic  Commission  cochairman  Bob  Strauss' Tuesday comments are mis leading as to his position on Social Se curity and Medicare.  As chairman of the Senate Special  Committee on Aging,  I  know  how  stressful and alarming  the  intermit tent clatter that is heard from time to  time from political leaders is to those  retirees who depend upon their Social  Security checks for their livelihood.  I read the press coverage and then  talked to Bob Strauss as to his posi tion and what  the Commission was  considering.  Particularly  in a Presidential elec tion year comments emanating from  this auspicious council which he co chairs receive significant media atten tion, and getting the word from the  horse's mouth is important. Well, I am  here to say that the old political war  horse from Texas, Bob Strauss, is not  about to worry the folks on Social Se curity  about  cutting  their  benefit  checks. While it is  true that part of  what the Commission reviews is enti tlements such as Social Security and  Medicare, nothing in the offing, as far  as Bob Strauss  is concerned, would  recommend a reduction of benefits for  the millions of  retired  folks whose  livelihood depends upon these Social  Security checks.  Furthermore, it is only Congress not  the Commission, nor  the Presi dent-that can alter the law that fixes  Social Security benefits, cost-of-living  adjustments, certain Medicare bene fits, or the costs of the supplemental,  part B,  and  catastrophic  coverages  that are assessed monthly to retirees.  And, by vote after vote over the past  several years, Congress has lined up  with big majorities to side with Social  Security and Medicare recipients. Fur thermore, the American public, in poll  after poll, also sides with them.  I know from frequent discussions in  senior citizen centers of the concerns  of retirees. I know from the testimony  that we have  received  in the public  hearings of the Senate Special Com mittee on Aging of the concerns of na tional organizations of retirees. And I  know from their collective judgments  that they approve of the trend that  has developed in Congress. That trend  is to protect the retirees on meager incomes and to require wealthy retirees  to contribute more toward the benefits  they receive.  Let me summarize that trend. Since  1975, earnings  limitations have been  indexed  to  the national average of  wages  for  those on Social Security.  For  those  65  through  69,  earned  income up to $8,400 in 1988 does not  reduce their Social Security benefits.  For them, for every dollar they earn  over $8,400, their benefits are reduced  50 cents. At age 70, the earnings limi tation and reduction in benefits cease,  and they can earn all they want with  no effect on their Social Security ben efits. Bills in Congress would increase,  double, or remove the earnings limita tions. Doubling  the  earnings  limit  would cost the trust fund $2 to $3 bil lion per  year. There has been no  action on the bills. Under present law,  starting in 1990 the reduction in bene fit will be reduced to $1 for each $3  earned over the limit. According to a  recent  report  of  the Congressional  Budget Office,  the earnings  limita tions affect only 1 of 10  in  the 65  through 69 age group.  The second  item  that reflects  the  trend in Congress was adopted in 1983.  It affects the taxes that the more af fluent Social Security recipients must  pay. They must compute their adjust ed gross  income and add one-half of  their Social Security benefits. Then  they must add all of the tax-exempt  interest income they receive. A retiree  who is single can deduct $25,000 from  that amount, and a  couple  filing a  joint return can deduct $32,500 from  that amount. One-half of that balance  becomes taxable, providing that it is  not more than one-half of their Social  Security benefits.  I  know  just  reciting  that  sounds  rather mixed up, but let me give you  an example.  A couple  filing a  joint return  re ceives $10,000 in Social Security bene fits and has $10,000  adjusted gross  income. One-half of their Social Secu rity benefit, or $5,000, is added to their  adjusted gross income. This particular  couple then has $20,000 in tax-exempt  interest income. The total of their ad justed gross income, one-half of their  Social Security  benefits,  and  their  $20,000  tax-exempt  interest  income  added together comes to $35,000. Sub tract $32,500 from the $35,000  to get  $2,500, and one-half of that balance,  or $1,250 of their $10,000 in Social Se curity benefits, becomes  taxable and  this  couple  pays more  in Federal  income  tax  into  the U.S. Treasury.  IRS statistics reveal that only a very  small percentage of Social Security  beneficiaries have to pay income tax  on part of their Social Security bene fits.  The third point in the trend in Con gress deals with catastrophic coverage  under Medicare. The catastrophic sup plemental premium that is charged a  Medicare recipient is based solely on  income tax liability. If that tax liabil ity is less than $150, no supplemental  premium liability is charged the Medi care recipient for the catastrophic cov erage. But if the Medicare recipient's  tax liability is over $150,  they pay a  supplemental premium based on a slid ing scale where the maximum that can  be charged for the first year is $800  and the maximum goes up gradually  higher in later years.  As  far  as  I  can determine,  these  steps  taken by Congress  in  recent  years have been satisfactory to retir ees, but it is clear that these are limit ed mean  testing for Social Security  and Medicare recipients. That is  the  trend in Congress and it is a careful at tempt to maintain the integrity of the  trust funds for both Social Security  beneficiaries  and Medicare benefici aries, while still protecting the retirees  who depend upon their meager Social  Security checks to pay their bills.  I believe this trend will continue, as  it should, and, while the more wealthy  retirees will find themselves subject to  making part of  their benefits check  liable for income tax and may have to  pay more of the cost of Medicare than  those retirees on lowest income levels,  it is reassuring for the integrity of the  Social Security and Medicare  trust  funds, which is the concern of all of  us.

1878,1379,17,Mr. SASSER.," I thank the Senator, I  fully agree.  ",1988
1879,1379,17,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I wish  to publicly commend my distinguished  colle&.gue, Mr. SASSER, for his help in  getting this bill to the Senate floor and to my colleagues for recognizing  the urgency and the magnitude of the  problem we have in our thrift indus try.  A comprehensive study of the indus try's problems and potentials  is  the  only logical approach to solving those  problems and maximizing those poten tials.  It will provide midand  long term direction for nursing the indus try back to health. This study will not  provide a short term, quick fix remedy  but will provide assistance for the next  several years as we work on this prob lem.  Through hearings  in  the Banking  Committee, we have examined the sav ings and loan crisis. But we owe the in dustry and the American taxpayer the  benefit of a thorough study conducted  by some of the finest and most experi enced analysts. It is vital that we keep  our  remaining  savings  and  loan's  healthy. Our efforts to do so justify  the continued confidence of the Amer ican people in their savings and loans.  The first week of August, the Bank ing Committee held 2 days of hearings  to examine this problem. Former Fed eral Home Loan Bank Chairman Pratt  estimated the savings and loan crisis  to be between $40 and $75 billion.  Others in the savings and loan in dustry have estimated that we lose $1  billion each month we delay. At that  rate, if we let this problem slide until  next year, we forfeit $6 billion.  Time is literally money in the resolu tion of the thrift industry's problems.  And we can't afford a nickel and dime  approach to a multibillion dollar pre dicament. We need the coherent over view a National Commission will pro vide. And because our global financial  industries are changing so rapidly, the  ongoing review and planning such a  Commission would allow will help to  avert similar disasters in the future.  One way to demonstrate our sincere  concern that the savings and loan in dustry  is  fiscally sound would be to  support this legislation. That is a debt  we owe to the American people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a  letter of support for the  Commission  for Mr. Richard Pratt,  former Chairman of the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board and an editorial  which I have written on the thrift in dustry be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MERRILL LYNCH,  September 21, 1988.  Hon. BOB GRAHAM,  U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR GRAHAM:  I am writing in  support of S. 2653, legislation that you and  Senator SASSER have introduced to establish  a National Commission on the Thrift Indus try. The creation of this blue ribbon com mission  to study and make  recommenda tions on  the vital  issues confronting  the  FSLIC and the thrift industry would be an  important first step for Congress and the  regulators in resolving these issues. A com prehensive plan authored by  industry ex perts and delivered to Congress in the cru cial early months of 1989 would, I believe,  act as a catalyst for the adoption of effec tive solutions, both legislative and regula tory.  While I have great confidence in the abili ty of Chairman Wall and the members of  the Bank Board to address the problems of  the industry, the existing resources of the  Board and the FSLIC are clearly inadequate  to resolve the industry's large and still grow ing problems. We must expeditiously identi fy and evaluate the legitimate alternatives  for funding the obligations of the FSLIC. In  addition, it is time to re-assess the industry's  regulatory structure and deposit insurance  system  to  ensure  long  term  safety and  soundness and  to  restore depositor confi dence.  There are a number of short-term recom mendations that Congress can make to address the problems of the industry and I  have addressed these in a letter that was re quested by Chairman Proxmire during the  August 3 hearing at which I  testified. A  copy of my letter is enclosed. These short term measures, however, are not a substi tute  for a  comprehensive plan  that sets  forth long-term solutions to the problem.  I commend you and Senator Sasser for in troducing this important legislation. If I or  any of my colleagues at Merrill Lynch can  be of assistance to you in any way, please do  not hesitate to call on me.  Very truly yours,  RICHARDT. PRATT  AMERICA'S SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY  <By Bob Graham, U.S. Senator)  WASHINGTON.-The biggest economic issue  facing the next President-behind the fed eral deficit  and  trade  imbalance-is  the  crisis ravaging America's thrift industry.  Too many  savings-and-loan  associations  are losing money, the federal insurance pro gram that backs deposits  is nearly broke  and Washington doesn't want to face reali ty.  Handling the thrift crisis will be an early  indicator of the fortitude of the Dukakis or  Bush presidency, and could help set  the  tone for the first half of the term.  But Congress shouldn't wait until the new  President is sworn in next January, hoping  this issue gets on the executive agenda.  Congress must act now. The wick is lit on  an economic bomb, and procrastination will  make the explosion louder, more costly.  One-third of  the  thrift  industry-some  1,000 savings-and-loan associations-is insol vent or sliding toward insolvency. Govern ment insurance on deposits has been over whelmed by losses.  The Savings &  Loan crisis has spilled  from Wall Street to Main Street.  It took a long time to get in this mess: so lutions will take years, but here's what we  can do in the next 60 days:  Speed up the rate of closing insolvent in stitutions. At the current rate of closings,  too many insolvent thrifts will continue to  operate into the next decade.  The argument has been made that regula tors need more personnel to speed the rate  of closings.  If so, additional auditors and  other experts should be retained.  Begin to break the cycle of using high-cost  money for high-risk ventures, a high-flyer  formula that often compounds losses. This  predicament  is  like Argentina borrowing  more to pay interest on existing debt.  Institutions  should be  required  to put  more of their own money into high-risk ven tures.  institutions  are  insolvent, we  should restrict their growth and, at the very  least, they should stay out of high-risk in vestments.  Meanwhile, we should begin moving from  the current flat-rate insurance premium to  a risk-based premium.  If state-chartered institutions get federal  insurance, their limits and activities should  fall within the range of limits and activities  on federally chartered thrifts. A handful of  states <Texas and California among them)  have  allowed  state-chartered  savings-and loans  to venture  into  riskier  investments.  This has exacerbated the problems of the  Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corpora tion <FSLIC).  Focus FSLIC's attention on sliding institu tions instead of concentrating only on the  insolvent ones. The government should look  If  ",1988
1880,1392,17,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, last week a very  special event took place in my own State of  New Jersey. On September 16, Hudson Coun ty's historic courthouse was  rededicated as  the William J. Brennan, Jr., Courthouse. This  fitting  tribute  to Justice Brennan honors  the  longest serving Justice  in  the history of  the  Supreme Court and one of our Nation's most  outstanding jurists.  It also recognizes an  indi vidual who has been a source of great pride  to his home State of New Jersey.  Justice Brennan began his long and distin guished  tenure on  the bench as a superior  court judge in Hudson County before his. eleSeptember 23, 1988  vation to the New Jersey Supreme Court.  In  1956, President Eisenhower appointed Justice  Brennan to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Throughout his remarkable career, Bill Bren nan has been a dedicated and ardent guardi an of the Constitution. His hallmark has been  fairness, decency, and an unwavering commit ment to justice.  In the areas of civil liberties,  voting rights, civil rights, and  freedom of the  press, Bill Brennan has left an indelible mark  upon  our Nation  and  in  the process,  he  changed the course of history.  I am privileged to call Bill Brennan my good  and longtime friend. We share the same roots  as natives of Newark, NJ, and graduates of  Barringer High School. I want to join in paying  tribute to this great American. The William J.  Brennan, Jr., Courthouse will stand as a testi mony  to Bill's many  contributions  to  our  Nation and  it will serve as a reminder of his  enduring  legacy as a protector and defender  of the Constitution.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to include in my  remarks  the  following article  from  the Star  Ledger:  [From the Star Ledger, Sept. 17, 19881  JUSTICE SERVED: HUDSON COURTHOUSE NAMED  FOR BRENNAN  (By Patricia Cappon)  Supreme Court Justice William J. Bren nan Jr., an ardent guardian of civil rights  and civil  liberties, was honored  in Jersey  City yesterday as a jurist whose legal con victions reflected a vision of America at its  best.  In the hushed grandeur of Hudson Coun ty's historic courthouse rotunda, some 100  lawyers, public officials and fellow  jurists  gathered  for  the  rededication of  the 82year-old building as Justice William J. Bren nan Jr. Courthouse.  Brennan, a former Superior Court judge  in Hudson County and a former New Jersey  Supreme Court justice, was praised for de f ending the rights of accused criminals and  minorities, securing greater protections for  a free press and championing an America of  ""compassion and dignity for all people.""  ""It reflects  a  vision of what America  should be and what any society should be,""  said New Jersey Chief Justice Robert Wi lentz.  ""It is a vision that has breathed new life  into the Constitution, a vision often unpop ular, a vision always clear,"" Wilentz said.  ""Even his critics must concede that no out side voices  controlled or  influenced him  except the voice of his conscience and the  voice of justice.""  At 82, Brennan is the court's oldest and  longest-serving justice, and one of two re maining liberal voices, along with Justice  Thurgood Marshall.  Brennan said he was more  than ""over whelmed"" by the honor of having his name  attached  to  the courthouse  in which he  once presided, built the same year he was  born.  ""I was terribly proud to sit on the New  Jersey courts and I'm prouder today than  when I did,"" he said. ""All I can say from my  heart, it's a great honor and I'm not sure  really that I'm deserving of it. Thank you,  thank you, thank you very much.""  ",1988
