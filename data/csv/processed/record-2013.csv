2,House,113,0.593,13,2013-01-14,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as I  speak on the House  floor, there are  guns by the doors—to the north, to the  south, to the east, to the west—on the  roof, on all of the entrances, and by the  steps: the armed guards of the excellent Capitol Police protecting us.  But most citizens don’t have government  guards  protecting  them  24/7.  Many people  feel defenseless. Some  people of this Chamber expect protection for themselves while advocating  more restrictions on guns for the people of America—hypocrisy at its highest. In fact, one of the proposals for  more gun laws mirrors the stringent  D.C. gun laws. If the D.C. gun laws  worked, D.C. would not be such a violent city. If D.C. gun laws worked, why  do we have so many armed guards at  the Capitol?  The elites forget it’s the shooter, not  the gun. They want more government  power and control while taking away  liberty from the rest of us. They want  to punish the guns, not the people who  commit crimes with guns. They want  to keep their special government protection while  redlining  the Second  Amendment for the people. They say,  Protection for me but not for thee.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  THE KING DREAM LIVES ON  (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of  Illinois  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.  Speaker, yesterday, I had the opportunity to experience a great event in  the community where I live and work.  People had a tribute to Dr. Martin  Luther King, who happened to have  lived in that community of Chicago for  a period of time. We went to all of the  places that he used to eat and where all  the meetings were held. It was quite an  emotional  experience,  especially  for  those who were there and who got a  chance to know him, to meet him, to  shake his hand.  So  I  simply commend  those  residents, friends, neighbors of mine for  making sure that the King dream lives  on.  f  RIGHT THIS WRONG: PUNISHING  PARENTLESS RUSSIAN CHILDREN  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2013
3,House,113,0.202,13,2013-01-14,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, the  Russian President  recently  signed a  law to prevent American citizens from  adopting Russian children. Sadly,  it  appears that the Russian Government  is playing politics with children and is  destroying the dreams of many Americans already in the process of adopting.  Last year alone, nearly 1,000 Russian  children were adopted by American  families, and many of these children  struggled with  physical  disabilities.  Every child deserves the opportunity  to be raised in a caring environment.  Over the past 20 years, almost 60,000  Russian children have been welcomed  into the United States. Many of these  children have found loving parents in  my congressional district. Regrettably,  President Putin’s new law now takes  away  this possibility. This  law not  only prohibits  future adoptions, but  even more disturbingly, it attempts to  put a halt to those already in progress.  Among those impacted is a family  from my  district, Marc  and April  Pongitory. They’re in the process of  adopting  two  children  from Russia.

5,,113,0.259,27,2013-01-14,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the bravery of City of Ripley Fire  Chief Richard H. Gobble, II. Chief Gobble, a  lifelong resident of the community he serves,  heads an all volunteer fire department in Ripley, WV, a small town in my district.  On the morning of December 29, 2012, Ripley’s Mayor received an anonymous letter detailing a heroic event that happened the week  earlier, just before the Christmas holiday. The  letter’s anonymous author had been traveling  down Route 33 when he witnessed a frightening car wreck, in which the vehicle left the  road and landed in the frigid waters of a nearby creek.  The first emergency responder on the scene  was a man from the fire department, who, according to the anonymous author, waded into  the cold waters without hesitation to help the  trapped motorist. The fireman successfully retrieved the elderly man from his almost completely submerged car and helped him  to  shore, reassuring him along the way that everything would be alright. By the time the fireman helped the elderly man to the creek bank,  other members of the fire department, paramedics, and police had arrived on the scene  to assist.  Once  the elderly man was safe  from  the  frigid waters and receiving medical treatment  from paramedics, the letter’s anonymous author asked a member of the fire department  for the name of the fireman that risked hypothermia to save the motorist. The fireman responded,  ‘That’s our chief!’ ’  It was Ripley’s  volunteer fire chief, Richard Gobble, who had  rescued the man from the frozen creek and  saved his life.  Mr. Speaker, the level of devotion to community by Chief Gobble is one deserving of  great respect and recognition.  I wish to thank Chief Gobble for his service  to his community. The City of Ripley is fortunate to have such a heroic man leading their  fire department.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT  OF  RICHARD  HENRY  RAILEY FROM UPS  HON. MIKE ROGERS  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 14, 2013  ",2013
6,,113,0.338,27,2013-01-14,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would  like  to ask  for  the House’s attention  today to recognize Richard Henry Railey who  is retiring  from  the United Parcel Service  in  Opelika after 34 years of service.  Mr. Railey was born on October 18, 1957,  in Ashland, Alabama, to Talma and Georgia  Alberta Railey. He graduated  from Wadley  High School in 1976 as Class Salutatorian, lettering in both football and baseball and serving as Class President.  He attended Southern Union State Junior  College receiving an A.S. Degree and serving  as President of the Student Government Association. He  then attended Auburn University  and graduated in 1981 with a B.S. Degree in  Vocational Agri-Business with a teaching certificate.  In November of 1978, Mr. Railey started  working part-time at UPS while  in school at  Auburn.  In 1979, he was promoted  to part-  time management and  in 1984,  to  full-time  management. In April of 1981, Richard married Debbie Renee Gilbert in Pine Mountain,  Georgia, and later they had two sons, Patrick  Ryan Railey and David Richard Railey. While  at UPS, Richard has also  volunteered at  United Way,  taught Junior Achievement at  Opelika High School and Auburn High School  and achieved many job promotions during his  time there.  Mr. Speaker, we join his family and friends  in celebrating Mr. Railey’s retirement and wish  him the very best.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF BETTY  RAMACHER  HON. JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 14, 2013  ",2013
7,,113,-0.187,27,2013-01-14,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to the life of Betty Ramacher, who  passed away on November 20, 2012, at the  age of 86. A  respected elected official and  community leader, Betty leaves behind a wonderful legacy and serves as an example for  generations to come.  Betty was a woman of many  trades. She  served as a first grade teacher in Caruthers,  California and operated a dress shop in the  Fig Garden Shopping Center in Fresno, California. With her background as an educator  and small business owner, Betty successfully  ran  for  the Fresno County Board of Supervisors  in  1983.  Betty  served  the  third  supervisorial district for five years.  Betty’s progressive  ideas along with her  ability to get things done made her a well-respected political mind in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Aspiring political candidates would  often reach out to Betty first when running for  office. Betty and her husband, Richard, were  a formidable team—especially when it came to  organizing campaigns and winning elections.  Along with being a political trailblazer, Betty  was also a wonderful wife, mother, and grandmother. Betty’s family was everything to her.  She was a caregiver for a majority of her life—  providing for her disabled son, Eric, for over  50 years, and caring  for Richard after his  stroke. Betty truly understood the importance  of love and family.  Betty leaves behind her daughter, Mary and  son-in-law, Ted Mooradian; her grandchildren,  Ali Mooradian-Pesce and her husband Andres,  Lauren, Jacob, and Joseph Mooradian.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in paying tribute to the life of Betty Ramacher.  Her unwavering commitment to bettering the  lives of residents in Fresno County will never  be forgotten. Betty will be remembered as a  woman with a kind heart and loving soul.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

I am  proud  to  have  this  excellent  organization  headquartered in my Congressional district in  Topeka, Kansas.  NATM was  founded  in 1987 by a small  group of 5 horse and livestock trailer manufacturers, and  it has now grown  to  represent  more  than 400  trailer manufacturing companies and 350 supplier companies across the  country. Many  are  small  businesses,  and  these members collectively employ more than  270,000 workers who produce hundreds of  thousands of trailers each year and contribute  billions of dollars to our economy.  The core purpose of this association is to  promote safety and best manufacturing processes across the light and medium duty trailer  industry.  Since  its  inception,  NATM  has  worked  to advance  industry and public recognition of the importance of compliance with  Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requirements, and industry guidelines.  In order to advance this goal, NATM created  a voluntary Compliance Verification Program  in 2002. The program is designed to enhance  safety in the industry by helping manufacturers  to comply with  federal safety  requirements.  Last year, association members voted unanimously to make participation in the program a  condition of membership.  NATM and its members demonstrate dedication to improving safety and performance in  the trailer industry by working with legislators  and regulators alike to address issues of concern.  I congratulate  them on  the milestone  achievement of their 25th annual convention  and trade show, and wish them many years of  continued successes.  f  TRIBUTE TO ‘‘HOT AS HELL’’  HON. GEORGE HOLDING  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 25, 2013  ",2013
25,,113,0.658,17,2013-01-25,Mr. HOLDING.," Mr. Speaker, on January 25,  1944 a B–24 assigned to the Air Force’s 425th  Bombardment Squadron set out on a resupply  mission to Chabua, India from Kunming, China  as part of the Pacific campaign in World War  II. Tragically this plane named ‘ ‘Hot as Hell’ —  and  its crew—never reached  their  final destination.  I rise to honor the 69th anniversary of the  fatal crash that took the lives of the eight crew  members proudly serving in the United States  Air Force. Extreme weather conditions caused  the formation that day to separate and eventually led to the downing of five B–24 ’s—two of  which were not immediately recovered.  For years the families of those brave servicemen  remained without answers and closure.  In  the post-war years,  the Army conducted search operations in an attempt to locate the downed aircraft but failed to discover  any signs of  the aircraft. Eventually, all  the  members of  the  crew—1st Lt. William A.  Swanson, F/O Sheldon L. Chambers, 1st Lt.  Irwin Zaetz, 1st Lt. Robert E. Oxford, SSgt.  Harry B. Queen, SSgt. Charles D. Ginn, Sgt.  Alfred H. Gerrans, Jr., and Sgt. James A.  Hinson —had  their names  inscribed on  the  Tablets of the Missing at the Manila American  Cemetery in Manila, Philippines.  In 2006, over sixty years after the fact, the  families of  those airmen received some closure. Arizona native Clayton Kuhles, who has  dedicated part of his life to locating and recovering missing-in-action US airmen from World  War II in China, Burma, and India, successfully located the aircraft that went down in the  mountains of northeast India. This incredible  discovery  is one example of  the work Mr.  Kuhles continues  to do on behalf of  those  families and friends who lost loved ones defending our nation.  f  RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF  THE 2013 PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION  AWARDS  HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 25, 2013  ",2013
26,,113,-0.306,17,2013-01-25,Mr. CONNOLLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the recipients of the 2013 Prince  William County Human Rights Commission  Awards.  The Prince William Board of County Supervisors, BOCS, implemented the Human Rights  Ordinance January 15, 1993, formally establishing  the Human Rights Commission. Two  years prior,  the BOCS  formed  the Human  Rights Study Committee to explore the needs  of a community that was growing in population  and diversity. An exhaustive effort  that  included numerous Committee meetings and  public hearings identified a strong community  desire for a human rights ordinance and an  agency to enforce it. The Human Rights Ordinance prohibits discriminatory practices based  on race, color, sex, national origin, religion,  marital status or disability,  in employment,  housing, public accommodations, education  and credit, in Prince William County.  The BOCS approved the Ordinance in September 1992  to ensure  that  ‘each citizen  is  treated fairly, provided equal protection of the  law and equal opportunity to participate in the  benefits, rights, and privileges of community  life.’ ’ Residents enlist the services of the Commission if they feel their rights have been violated in the areas of employment, fair housing,  credit, education and public accommodation.  In celebration of Universal Human Rights  Day,  the Human Rights Commission  recognizes  individuals and organizations  that promote the principles of human rights in Prince  William County. It is my honor to enter into the  CONGRESSIONALRECORD the recipients of the  2013 Prince William County Human Rights  Commission Awards: Stephen Dittmer, Connie  Moser, Lillian Garland, Ralph Smith, Lydia  Stewart.

27,House,113,-0.306,5,2013-02-05,Mr. CONNOLLY.," Mr. Speaker, I can’t  resist saying the Second Amendment  right does not preclude background  checks to protect the very people we  represent.  Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court ruling last summer on the Affordable Care  Act was a victory  for all American  families—and  small businesses  especially—by ensuring that our constituents have access to affordable, quality  health insurance.  The ruling preserved the integrity of  Medicaid  partnerships  between  the  States and the Federal Government,  giving Governors the option of accepting the Federal Government’s generous  offer to pay the cost for expanding coverage  of  low-income  residents who  might otherwise not have access to  health insurance.  Though some of my Republican colleagues remain opposed to the act, I’m  pleased to see Republican Governors,  including those from Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and now Governor Kasich  in Ohio, putting policy ahead of politics to support this expansion of Medicaid. Those Governors have acknowledged that they were motivated not  only by the desire to reduce the number of uninsured, but also by the compelling business case.  Medicaid expansion is part of the vision for a new continuum of coverage  that will begin in 2014, when the major  provisions  from  the Affordable Care  Act take effect. This will fill the longstanding gap in Medicaid coverage for  low-income adults by expanding eligibility for those earning up to 133 percent of the Federal poverty level.  As of 2011, there were 48 million nonelderly uninsured in America. As an incentive for States to expand coverage  for those folks, the ACA commits the  Federal Government to paying 100 percent of the additional costs of covering  them, and after 2016, 90 percent thereafter.  I wrote the Republican Governor of  my State and the General Assembly  membership urging them to join us in  extending this critical health care coverage. The Virginia General Assembly  is currently divided on the matter, but  I was encouraged last week by the announcement from our Republican Lieutenant Governor, who said:  There is no State better prepared to move  forward with this reform and the coverage  expansion of it than the Commonwealth of  Virginia.  Like  me,  Lieutenant  Governor  Bolling understands the economic benefits for Virginia. Expanding Medicaid  will help 300,000 Virginians get access  to health care coverage who currently  have none and invariably wind up accessing health care through the most  expensive portal there  is: the emergency room. The cost of that uncompensated care is, of course, borne today  by hospitals and those who are insured  through their premiums.  The Governor’s Advisory Commission  on Health Reform said expanding Medicaid, coupled with other reforms  in  the act, would reduce uncompensated  care  in Virginia by more than half.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Virginia would receive more than $9.2 billion in the first 5 years. A recent State  analysis shows that during that same  time period Virginia would actually  save $300 million by expanding coverage. And Virginia’s costs for the first  10 years, now estimated at $137 million,  are considerably  less than originally  estimated and a great return on that  investment.  Time is running out, and our residents cannot afford for States to miss  this opportunity. In fact, I believe they  would be making such a historic mistake that I am proposing an additional  incentive to help motivate those Governors who might not yet still be convinced.  This week I introduced the Medicaid  Expansion Incentive Act. This simple  bill adds a ‘‘use it or lose it’’ provision.  If a State doesn’t want to expand Medicaid coverage, then we will ship those  dollars to other States who are willing  to partner with us to help defray costs  and expand their coverage.  b1040  Just so the residents of a particular  State are fully aware of how their Governor’s decision is affecting them, my  bill will require HHS to publicize the  list of States that are not partnering  with us and giving up this opportunity  and the amount of money their Governor has  left on the table and the  number of uninsured people who will  thereby not be covered.  The Affordable Care Act is the law of  the land, and residents of any State  should not be penalized because of  their Governor’s  ideological agenda.  The choices we face are momentous.  Will we move forward together to implement these historic reforms and reverse the unsustainable trajectory of  spiraling prices, or will we let slip this  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help  those most in need, realize savings, and  spur economic activity? I hope more  Republican Governors,  including my  own, will follow the leader of their colleagues elsewhere and put their citizens’ health ahead of partisan orthodoxy.  f  U VISA REFORM ACT OF 2013  ",2013
28,House,113,0.65,12,2013-02-05,Mr. WOODALL.," I thank my friend  from Massachusetts because he’s highlighting exactly what our challenges  are and exactly why it’s so important  that we pass both the rule and H.R. 444  today. He went  through  item after  item after item that have absolutely  tied our economy up in knots. Short-  term problems and  short-term  solutions are trumping the discussion of  long-term problems and long-term solutions.  The sequester that he mentioned, Mr.  Speaker, do you know that it was the  month of May last year that this House  first passed a replacement to the sequester? Now, as you know and as history has recorded, the Senate never  acted on any replacement of a sequester, and now we talk about what happened on January 1 as if it was something that was created by this House,  as if that fiscal cliff was something  that this House invented. In fact, we  have a very proud history, bipartisan  history, of looking further down the  road to try to find the best answers and  the best solutions to very serious problems. But we can’t do it alone, Mr.  Speaker.  One of the great successes we’ve had  just early in this year—and by ‘‘we,’’ I  mean this entire House, the people’s  House—is that we appear to have persuaded the Senate to pass a budget for  the first time in 4 years. All indication  is that this year, unlike last year and  the year before that and the year before that, this year they’re going to  pass a budget to lay out their plan.  But what does it say, Mr. Speaker,  about this House, about this process,  about the future of this country that  it’s controversial whether or not the  President of the United States should  introduce a budget that balances ever?  That’s the debate today, Mr. Speaker.  That’s how out of touch Washington  has become. That’s how confused the  speeches have been written. We’re debating whether or not the President  should  introduce a budget that ever  balances.  I’m  advocating,  yes,  he  should. Others are advocating, no, that  shouldn’t be a requirement; when you  take the oath to fully execute the laws  of the land, when you take the oath to  faithfully  protect  and  defend  the  United States of America, it shouldn’t  be a  requirement  that you balance  budgets. In fact, you should be free, not  just for 10 years, not just for 20 years,  not just for 40 years, not just for 80  years, but forever to deficit spend, to  borrow from a generation of children  and a generation of grandchildren to  pay for our wants today, taking away  from their needs tomorrow.  b1320  This rule debate is going to come to  a close in 40 minutes and we’re going to  vote. Then  if the rule passes, we’re  going to go into a vote on the underlying bill. There are going to be ‘‘no’’  votes on the board that say, no, the  President should never have to explain  to  the American  people how we’re  going to make our fiscal tomorrow better than our fiscal today.  I would like to change his mind, Mr.  Speaker, but for now I’m going to focus  on changing the minds right here in  this Chamber. Because if there is anything that unites us in this body, rather than divides us, it is a true love of  this country. And I challenge anyone,  Mr. Speaker, to define their love of our  freedoms and of our country in a way  that allows us to continue borrowing  from the next generation forever.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2013
29,,113,0.29,33,2013-02-05,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to honor The Peck School  in Morristown, New Jersey, which  is celebrating  its  120th Anniversary in 2013.  Originally created as a school for women,  Peck School was opened on Franklin Street  under  the name Miss Sutphen’s School  for  Young Ladies in 1893. After nearly 23 years,  the school had become one of the most prestigious  in Morris County with over 100 students and 9 teachers. However, in 1917, the  school was purchased by Lorraine T. Peck  and  the name was changed  to  the Peck  School in 1918. In 1920 the school was relocated to Elm Street where it would stay for another quarter of a century. By 1946 the school  had assumed its current colors of white and  blue and in 1948 moved into where it currently  resides, on South Street  in  the Lindenwold  Mansion and adjacent property.  Over  the next decade, The Peck School  saw  rapid expansion and  improvement.  In  1950  the Mother’s Association was created  opening up the door to more programs including parent-teacher conferences, Parents Visiting Day, the Student Council, and the Alumni  Association. Due to enrollment exceeding 200  students  for  the  first  time,  the school constructed a new gymnasium/auditorium in order  to accommodate the influx of young men and  women. Moreover,  in 1959  the school was  split into two divisions. The first division would  include Kindergarten  to 4th graders and  the  second division would include 5th to 8th graders.  As the times changed, Peck School did the  same by constantly adapting to the needs of  its students,  faculty, and parents. With  the  dawn of technology in the 1980s, Peck was  able to add computers to the school, creating  new facilities for technological related studies.  These  facilities  included  the addition of  the  ‘Bridge’ ’ and ‘ ‘Fine Arts’ ’ wings in 1984. These  new  sections  of  the  school  offered  comprehensive  group  studies  on  computers,  woodworking, and foreign languages. Additionally,  the Mother’s Association was  renamed  the Parents’ Association  to mirror  the  increased paternal involvement in student academic activities.  After celebrating its 100th Anniversary with  the opening of the Deetjen Kindergarten Building in 1993, the school decided to embark on  even further expansion. These ground-breaking improvements consisted of the Caspersen-  Tomlinson Upper School in 1995 and the F.M.  Kirby Lower School on 1998. With new space  and resources, Peck integrated an All-School  Technology Plan, establishing the school as a  quintessential model for computer-based curriculum at the elementary and middle school  levels. Finally, in 2006, Peck opened the massive 35,000 square foot Eckert Huff Building  complimented by the new 32,000 square feet  Athletic Center in 2007.  Today, over 330 students attend the Peck  School and study a diverse set of curriculums  comprising  of  communication  arts,  drama,  English, library studies, math, music, physical  education,  reading,  science,  history,  technology,  family  life, visual arts, woodworking,  and foreign languages. The school also contains an Individual Development and Community Responsibility Program designed to teach  character development and life skills. Additionally, Peck houses one of the most competitive  private-school 5th  to 8th grade athletic programs in Northern New Jersey.  In  its 120 years, Peck School has grown  from an organization of 6 children to a nationally recognized institution focused on the development of  young minds  into  successful  adolescents.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and your colleagues  to join me in congratulating The Peck School  as it celebrates its 120th Anniversary.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  OBSERVING  THE  DAY  OF  CIVIL  ROSA PARKS  RESOLUTION  100TH  BIRTHRIGHTS  ICON  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 5, 2013  ",2013
30,,113,-0.658,33,2013-02-05,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to  introduce  this  resolution  observing  the  100th birthday of civil rights icon Rosa Parks.  Through her quiet courage, Mrs. Parks came  to symbolize all that is vital about nonviolent  protests, enduring threats, yet persisting as an  advocate for the basic values of human rights  and dignity. Her act of civil disobedience in refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama is credited by historians with sparking  the modern day civil rights movement, earning  her  the  title  ‘mother of  the  freedom movement.’ ’  After she left Alabama in 1957, she and her  husband Raymond moved to Michigan. I was  honored to have her play a significant role in  my  first election  for Congress. Many of you  know that Mrs. Parks went on to serve on my  congressional staff  for more  than 20 years.  Her presence in my office embodied a tireless  spirit of commitment  to public service and  served as a constant reminder of the power of  a single act of courage.  Though she led a more private life in Detroit, her commitment  to public service  remained strong. In 1987, along with her close  associate Elaine Steele, she co-founded  the  Rosa and Raymond Parks  Institute  for Self  Development, pursuing  the mission of motivating and directing young people to achieve  their highest potential. Grounded in her philosophy of quiet strength, the Institute continues  to build upon the Parks legacy by sponsoring  youth programs that teach life skills and promote a cross-cultural perspective.  For her role as the First Lady of Civil Rights,  Rosa Parks was  the  recipient of numerous  awards and accolades. This list includes the  Congressional Gold Medal,  the  Spingarn  Award for civil rights contributions, the highest  honor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest  civilian honor in the United States. She was  even named one of the 20 most influential and  iconic figures of the 20th century. When she  died in October 2005, the outpouring of grief  and respect was worldwide. In recognition of  her historic contributions, this Congress voted  to allow Mrs. Parks to lie in honor in the Capitol rotunda so that the people of the United  States could pay their last respects to a great  American.  In this spirit of honoring her legacy, yesterday  the Henry Ford Museum  in Dearborn,  Michigan, sponsored a program  to highlight  her contributions to the civil rights movement.  The program was designed to reflect on the  spirit of Mrs. Parks’ commitment, calling for a  National Day of Courage.  The day-long event, both virtual and on-site  at the museum, featured nationally-recognized  speakers, music and dramatic interpretations  to commemorate her extraordinary life and accomplishments. I believe that this program will  serve as an opportunity to reflect on the value  of  individual contributions  to  the struggle  for  equality and, through reflection on her example, inspire all Americans to stand up for freedom and the principles enshrined in the Constitution.  By refusing to give up her seat and standing  for equal rights, Rosa Parks inspired a movement and became a legendary example of the  value of a single courageous act. At a time  when our nation  faces challenges, both domestic and global, I believe that the example  of Rosa Parks remains relevant every citizen.  We should always use her birthday to reflect  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Feb 06, 2013 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A05FE8.007 E05FEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j ‘ ‘ ‘         ",2013
31,,113,0.503,1,2013-02-14,Mr. MULLIN.," I began running a business when I was only 20 years old. Back  then, if you worked hard and followed  the rules, you had a pretty good shot at  getting ahead. Today,  it  seems  the  deck  is  increasingly stacked against  those who work hard and pursue their  own dreams, especially if you’re a business owner.  More and more, businesses are faced  with consistent uncertainty caused by  Washington’s inability to take action  on today’s pressing problems. The failure of uncertainty, with tax rates near  chaos in the markets and a never-ending stream of impractical regulations,  is a cloud of doubt that has been cast  over  the entire economy. For most  business owners, it is a daily struggle  just to keep the doors open in large  part because the government itself is a  consistent obstacle.  The National Federation  of  Independent Businesses recently released  figures from December indicating the  mood of businesses is at a recession  level. Seventy percent of business owners that were surveyed identified the  current environment as a bad time to  expand,  and  political  uncertainty  topped the list for the reasons not to  attempt economic growth.  Lee Buddrus, a resident of Muskogee,  Oklahoma, and president of Acme Engineering & Manufacturing Corporation, told me that a lot of small businesses are struggling just because they  had to go in debt to stay afloat during  the recession. Mr. Buddrus went on to  tell me, ‘‘Now they’re not able to make  the kind of money they need to to pay  down their debts,’’ due in large part to  the environment the government has  created.  As a freshman Member, I join a small  group of Members  in Congress who  have owned a business. I have felt the  weight of the current hostile business  climate and faced unprecedented difficulties in ensuring my business succeeded. I step on the floor of the United  States House of Representatives with a  firsthand understanding of how high  the hurdles are for a business to succeed and just simply jump over.  Last month, when President Obama  was sworn in to his second term, I was  reminded of something he said 4 years  ago,  in his  first  inauguration. The  President said:  The question we ask today is not whether  our government is too big or too small, but  whether it works—whether it helps families  find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.  Unfortunately, all we have seen from  this President is reckless spending and  heavy-handed regulation.  At the time of the President’s first  inauguration, the national unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. At the time  of his second inauguration, it was exactly the same, and this month unemployment rose to 7.9 percent. While the  rate of unemployment has been mostly  stagnant, the national debt has not. In  the past 4 years of failed Obama policies, the Nation has added $6 trillion of  new debt onto the backs of citizens and  businesses. Today, our national debt  stands at $16.4 trillion. Broken down by  American citizens,  that’s  $52,210  for  every man, woman, and child in this  country.  We must get back on the right track  and bring optimism into the business  climate. First, we must pull back some  of the regulations that bind the hands  of our Nation’s job creators. Second,  Congress must make the difficult decisions we were elected to make and restrain  government  spending.  Businesses cannot grow or expand in a climate of higher interest rates and higher taxes. Third, we have to be about  creating a job-friendly environment.  I came to Congress as a businessman  who simply got fed up with the government hindering my ability to create  jobs. My mission every day is to make  it easier for businesses to start to expand and to be successful.  In business, we know first you must  face a problem honestly and then come  up with real solutions that actually  solve the problem. The economic policy  of government trying to spend its way  to prosperity has failed. Those of us in  business know it’s the private sector  that creates real jobs, not the government.  Strong leadership and meaningful reforms are needed to move the looming  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

32,House,113,-0.204,8,2013-02-14,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, this afternoon a group of 20 freshman Members  of Congress will gather to announce  that we are putting aside our partisan  differences to do the right thing for the  American people. For Democrats, this  means that 10 of us are willing to compromise on spending so long as we keep  our promise to seniors that they can  retire with dignity and have access to  affordable, quality health care. My Republican colleagues have said that they  are willing to compromise on revenues  so long as Democrats meet them halfway.  Like most Americans, to those of us  who are new  to Washington,  ‘‘compromise’’ isn’t a dirty word. It’s what  regular, ordinary people do  in their  daily lives. The American people get it.  If you have a problem that arises in  your office, you and your coworkers  may disagree on how to address it, but  your company does not wait until it  gets to the last minute to solve it. You  simply meet with your colleagues, put  differences aside, and  find solutions.  Not everyone will get what they want,  but we move forward. And this is precisely what the American people have  sent us to Washington to do. They have  sent us here to solve problems on their  behalf and not argue all the time.  Mr. Speaker, the challenges before us  are serious, and they deserve serious  proposals. While our economy is growing, we still have many families that  are looking for work or waiting for our  economy to grow more quickly. Many  parents are working two and three jobs  and yet cannot  find a way to save  money  for retirement or send their  kids to school. I see this all the time in  my community in places like Kendall,  Westchester, and Islamorada.  This status quo is unacceptable to  me, just as I know it is unacceptable to  my  Republican  colleagues.  Yet  it  seems that when we gather  in this  Chamber, rather than finding commonsense solutions to our problems, we engage in ideological debates that are designed for political posturing that lead  us to nowhere.  At a minimum, if we can’t agree on  every issue, we should be working hard  to solve problems. The American people may not know this, but the fact is  that of the 31 days that we met here  last month, Members of Congress only  gathered  six  times. And  in  those  6  days, the only bill of any real significance was the Hurricane Sandy relief—  a bill that should have been approved  last year. Maybe this is the way Washington works; but in the rest of America, if you show up to your job less  than  20 percent of  the  time—that’s  about  1 day a week—you probably  won’t have a job for too long. And yet  some of my colleagues find this acceptable. Well, I don’t.

33,House,113,-0.565,22,2013-02-14,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I would alert my colleague  from Georgia that I have no further requests for time, and I’m prepared to  close.  ",2013
34,House,113,0.605,29,2013-02-14,Mr. HARRIS.," I want to thank the  gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from Georgia.  Following up on what the gentleman  from Georgia said, Mr. Speaker, the  President stood there and told America  that health care costs have gone down.  Now, I don’t know if the President has  been in a pharmacy lately or been to  the doctor or bought a health care insurance policy lately, but the fact of  the matter is the price has gone up—in  some  cases,  dramatically—and  it’s  going to go up more, especially for the  young, who actually are the highest  percent of the uninsured of any age  group.  Look, it’s just the facts. Folks, when  they’re 18, 19, 20, 25, they don’t think  anything is ever going to happen to  them, so they don’t buy a policy. And  the policies now, I sat down with someone whose daughter was insured, and  she had one of the HSA accounts, those  health  savings  accounts,  and  $2,500  goes into the health savings account.  The  first $2,500 she would pay, and  above that, the insurance would kick  in. It was an affordable policy. It used  to be less than $100 a month. Imagine  that, $100 a month, guaranteeing that  young person, God forbid they get into  a bad accident, God forbid they develop  a tumor at an early age, they have coverage for the really expensive things  that you may need. That was affordable. I think most people would say $80  a month is affordable.  That policy went up to $110, and this  time the renewal was 22 percent more  than that. And it’s going to get worse  because the President now, in the Affordable Care Act—ObamaCare, as he  prefers  it to be called—actually reduces the amount that those health  savings accounts can hold.  It’s now  limited to $2,500. You can’t get your  premium lower by saying, Okay, I’ll  take a little more risk, increase my  health savings account. So those costs  are going to skyrocket. And when they  skyrocket, the gentleman from Georgia  is absolutely correct, a young person is  going to say, I’ll pay the penalty.  So a young person who may have had  insurance before because it was only  $80 a month—and it protected us from  having to pay for those medical costs,  God forbid that young person had a  catastrophic  illness or  injury. That  person is going to make what looks  like a logical choice now and say, You  know what; I’ll pay the penalty and  drop my insurance. It’s going to have  exactly the opposite effect of what was  intended, and predictably so, when you  force those premiums up.  Again, the President stood here and  said that health care costs went down.  I’ve got to tell you, I still have yet to  run into someone at one of my town  hall meetings  that  says, Good  job,  ANDY; my health care costs or my insurance  is going down. It’s not,  it’s  going up.  Let me address, because  the gentleman from Tennessee touched on it,  one of the problems that the President  didn’t consider—tort reform. You have  three physicians here, two of whom  spent their professional  lives  in the  labor and delivery suite delivering babies, practicing obstetrics. I practiced  obstetric  anesthesiology,  do  those  epidurals, those spinals, relieve women  of their pain in childbirth.  Over my career, my generation—I  finished my training in 1984, 28 years  ago. At that time, to show you what  the effect of not having tort reform is,  the cesarean section rate for American  women having a baby was 15 to 17 percent. One in six to one in seven women  would have to have a cesarean section.  Now, 28 years has passed. I don’t know  if the Speaker is aware, but the cesarean section rate is now 33, 35 percent,  in some hospitals 40, up to as high as 70  percent  in some hospitals. That’s  in  one generation.  I will tell you, as a physician, not  much has changed to patients in one  generation. What has changed is that  you don’t find an obstetrician who’s  willing to take the risk of doing a delivery in a high-risk patient, a normal  delivery, because of the medical malpractice exposure—not that they would  commit it, but they would be charged  with it, that a baby doesn’t come out  perfect, because  that’s  the way  the  world is. Yet they would be charged,  brought into a court of law, and lose  millions of dollars in a settlement. So  what do they do? They choose, when  there is any question, to do a cesarean  section, and who can blame them to do  it.  Mr. Speaker, those women who are  watching, they know exactly what I’m  talking about, because they know if it  was their daughter or granddaughter or  a friend of theirs, they all know someone who has had a cesarean section. If  the women who are in the audience  now think back to one generation ago,  it was much more rare. So what’s happened? We haven’t had tort reform.  But that’s not all. By the way, the  cost to the system is billions of dollars  a year for those extra cesarean sections, billions of dollars direct cost to  the health care system.  If that was all, we’d say maybe we  can tolerate that, a doubling of the  rate of cesarean sections, but that’s  not all. When those women go to see  their obstetrician now, one generation  ago when I started, when I had my first  child, my wife went to an obstetrician.  It was a solo practice. And that obstetrician apologized to my wife and said,  You know what, I’m sorry, but every  other weekend someone may have to  cover my practice, so I may not be able  to guarantee you that I’m there with  you at your delivery.  Let’s fast-forward one generation, 28  years. You can hardly find an obstetrician in solo practice anymore. They  simply cannot afford the medical malpractice premium. They may never  have been sued in their life, and they  may have to pay over $100,000 a year  just for the medical malpractice premium, never having been sued in their  life. So what happens? They’re  all  forced into large groups.  Now, that same conversation, if my  daughter now goes in to see an obstetrician, that conversation would run  like, You know, ma’am, you’re going to  have to see everyone in the group during your pregnancy, and we have seven  or eight people in the group. So every  time you’re going to have to see someone else so that everyone gets to see  you because we don’t know who’s going  to be there the day you deliver.  Now, is that good care? Is that a good  relationship that woman develops with  her obstetrician when she doesn’t even  know who’s going to be there to deliver  her? In fact, she doesn’t even know who  might see her the next time she’s in  the office, one of the most important  times in her life. We have completely  changed  the doctor-patient  relationship because we don’t have tort reform  in this country.  If it was just the rate of cesarean section doubling or just the fact that you  have to see seven or eight people and  you don’t really know who’s going to  deliver you on a given day, we might  accept that, but it goes beyond that,  Mr. Speaker. Because what’s happened  now, a good, highly trained obstetrician stops delivering babies  in their  forties or fifties because they have developed their practice, they have seen  those patients. They just take care of  their gynecology problems and they  spend the last 20 years in their career  not delivering a baby. Having delivered  them for 20 years, gaining all that experience, the most experienced obstetricians don’t deliver our babies anymore. And why don’t they? Because if  they stop delivering babies and promise  their insurance company they will not  deliver a baby, all of a sudden that  $100,000 premium becomes  $20,000.  If  you were in your forties and fifties and  could afford to do that in your practice, you might say, You know what; it  makes sense for me to stop doing this.  So when you add up all the things  that have happened because the President, in his Affordable Care Act, refused to have real tort reform—and it’s  possible, because it happened in California. I mean, there are areas in the  country that have it. But nationally,  he refused to have  it—and the gentleman from Georgia is very familiar  with this because his bill deals with  this. Because of that, we have a cesarean section rate that’s twice as high as  it ought to be, and some people will  tell you it might be three or four times  as high as it ought to be. We have  women who never develop a close doctor-patient relationship with their obstetrician because you really can’t. I  mean, you’re seeing a group of seven or  eight purely because the malpractice  premiums are now  spread out. Frequently,  somebody  else  even  pays.

35,House,113,-0.543,36,2013-02-14,Mr. ELLISON.," Thank you, Congressman. I’m going to wrap up in about 5  minutes or so. But I just want to hit a  few things that need to be touched on.  One is that the Progressive Caucus is  very concerned about this looming sequestration. Now folks out there this  evening, Mr. Speaker, might think, sequestration, what is that? Is that like  when you go on jury duty or something? No. Sequestration is what we’re  calling some really dramatic cuts to  Federal spending that are coming up in  about 2 weeks.  b1710  And now you’re thinking, How did we  end up here? Here is what happened.  In August 2011, the Republicans had  taken the majority in that session, the  first session of the 112th Congress, in  January, and they started out with an  agenda to dramatically reduce the size  of government. They started out with  something called Cut, Cap and Balance,  and they wanted to cut all kinds of  programs. They never wanted to touch  defense, but they wanted to cut the  Federal Government. I’m talking about  Head Start, Women Infants, and Children nutrition, programs that help support State and local governments, for  police, fire, all kinds of stuff like that,  they wanted to cut. And they wanted  to cut big-time. They wanted to cut  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  And so they came forward with this  proposal. Now, they knew they couldn’t  get it past the Senate, but they said,  Oh, the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling,  we can use that as a lever to make the  Democrats give us significant cuts to  the Federal budget.  So what they did,  in August 2011,  they said that we’re going to allow—  we’re not going to raise the debt ceiling. We’re going to allow the Federal  Government to default on previously  acquired  obligations  of  the United  States—so not pay our bills that we already acquired and risk our triple A  credit rating—if you do not impose dramatic cuts.  And so what the President did is said,  Okay, we’re going to give you some  cuts up front and we’ll set up something  called  the  supercommittee.  Three Democrats from the House, three  Republicans from the House, three Republicans  from  the  Senate,  three  Democrats from the Senate, we’ll call  that the supercommittee, and they are  going to work out a compromise and  give us an up-or-down vote on some  more cuts. But if they don’t, then we’re  going to have this thing called the sequester and there will be across-the-  board cuts in a dramatic and really imposing way.  The sequester is what we’re facing  now  because  the  supercommittee  failed. Now, the supercommittee didn’t  just fail. What we didn’t know is that  when the Republicans, both House and  Senate, appointed their members of the  supercommittee, all of them had signed  a promise  to a man named Grover  Norquist never to raise any taxes. And  so what happened is that they got on  this supercommittee and refused to negotiate. Democrats said, We’ll do some  cuts, but we need some revenue. We  need to raise some taxes and close  some loopholes.  Republicans said, No way, and Democrats said, Well, wait a minute. So you  want it all cuts and no raising taxes.  They said, That’s right, we’re not going  to negotiate with you on this.  And so the supercommittee failed in  its work. When it failed in its work,  that meant that we were going to deal  with sequester, and that’s where we are  now.  Sequester is going to impose automatic, arbitrary cuts that could lay  off,  according  to  the Congressional  Budget Office, up to about 750,000 people. There are going to be cuts in domestic spending and cuts to military  spending. Some of us think that military cuts are warranted. Others of us  are absolutely  concerned about  the  people who are going to be affected by  these domestic cuts.  Let me wrap up. I just want to say  that I am concerned that several Republicans seem real cavalier about sequester, and you should look at the  list. The Progressive Caucus’ solution  is to repeal sequester. What we would  propose to do with our legislation is to  say 50 percent cuts, 50 percent revenue.  We already cut $1.7 trillion in revenue,  and then last New Year’s Eve we got  some money in the door through raising taxes and now we need to balance  to 50–50. This is what we call the Balancing Act.  Our bill would bring it to balance by  raising money through closing  loopholes, carried interest, jets and yachts,  stuff like that. Oh, yeah, you didn’t  know they could write off their jets  and their yachts? Oh, yeah, they can.  And then put about $300 billion into  jobs.  Let me wrap up by saying the Balancing Act, you can go online and look  it up. It’s a great program. We urge  you to support it. In the last 1 second,  if I may—I’ve promised my friend 20  minutes and I’m messing up right now.  On February 22, the Supreme Court  will hear oral arguments in the Shelby  County, Alabama v. Holder case. This  threatens to take away serious voting  rights. I’m going to be talking about  this, because democracy must prevail.  We have not reached the point where  everybody has a fair vote in this country. I don’t have the time to elaborate  on it now, but please be aware that this  Shelby County v. Holder is a critical  issue. The Supreme Court is going to  take it up on the 27th of February. We  need to be aware of that if we want to  believe that you ought to be able to  cast a fair vote in America.  With that, I am going to yield to the  gentleman from Colorado. Thank you  very much, Congressman.  ",2013

40,Senate,113,-0.06,71,2013-02-14,Mr. MANCHIN.," Madam President, I  am proud to support Chuck Hagel for  Secretary of Defense.  If Chuck can  make it through the jungles of Vietnam, he can surely make it through  the bureaucracy of the Pentagon.  America needs Chuck as  its Secretary of Defense to bring our troops  home and to keep our military the  strongest in the world. Sergeant Hagel  is an American hero. When so many  Americans were dodging the draft, he  volunteered to serve in Vietnam. The  draft board gave him the option to return to college, but Chuck refused. He  said:  I think the best thing for me is to go in the  Army. It may not be the best thing for the  Army, but I think that’s the way to get all  this straightened out. I was the oldest of four  boys. My father [had] passed away, and I just  was not coming together the way I should  come together. There was a war going on in  Vietnam. I felt a sense of some responsibility. So I said, ‘‘No. Let’s—let’s go. And so  I volunteered for the draft, went in the Army  and celebrated my 21st birthday down at  White Sands Missile Range.’’  And Chuck didn’t serve in a safe billet. When assigned to Germany, he protested and asked to deploy to Vietnam.  So he volunteered for Vietnam and saw  the horrors of war as an infantry sergeant.  Chuck and his younger brother Tom  are the only known American brothers  to serve side by side in Vietnam. At  different times, they risked their own  lives to save each other’s. At one point,  Tom  frantically  dressed  a  wound  around Chuck’s chest hoping, praying,  that his older brother would make it  out of Vietnam alive. And Chuck eventually returned the favor by dragging  Tom out of a burning vehicle just before it exploded, saving his brother’s  life. Talk about brothers in arms, these  were real brothers in arms.  These experiences made Chuck who  he is, and they help you and me understand why he is the right man to run  the Pentagon and to be put in charge of  defending America. Just listen to how  Chuck describes what it was like to  serve in Vietnam. He says:  I walked a lot of point, and my brother  Tom and I together walked a lot of point,  which was all right. You know what happens  to a lot of point men, but I always felt a little better if I was up front than somebody  else.  Chuck is willing to walk point for  America now. He has been walking  point for most of his life. This is how  Chuck describes a point man:  A point man, as I think most people know,  is the individual who is out front. And these  are usually squad-sized patrols, sometimes a  company-sized patrol, depending on the mission. And you have the front—physically the  front position, but also the responsibility of  essentially not walking your squad or your  company into an ambush or a trap. So you  had to be very, very focused on the peripheral vision and the antenna and  just the  sense  and  the  instincts  that  something  doesn’t look right or grenades hanging in  trees, which booby traps were just a way of  life. You dealt with that all the time. And  there were a lot of guys who just didn’t pay  attention to it. They just—that’s just the  way they were. And I, again, always felt better if I was up front than maybe some others.  Let me repeat that: Chuck Hagel always felt better if he was up front,  where it was most dangerous. We live  in dangerous times today and we need  a man such as Chuck Hagel right now  who has seen the horrors of war and  will do all he can to prevent another  generation from seeing them.  In my  interactions with Chuck,  I  have been struck by his honesty, his  sincerity, and his commonsense approach. I know if he were still a sitting  U.S. Senator, we would probably be  great friends. That is because we come  from similar backgrounds and the same  generation. He is like many Americans.  He grew up in a working class, ‘‘salt of  the earth’’ family. In Chuck’s words, he  was raised in Little Town, NE, where  the local legion club and the VFW hall  were the centers of the universe.  I could go on and on about Chuck  Hagel, but let me say this in closing.  When I think about people and I go to  my little town in my community where  I grew up—in Farmington, WV—and I  know Chuck grew up in a small town—  I can shake people’s hands and look  them in the eye and they see me to my  soul. They know if I am sincere or I am  telling the truth. And I want to say to  all of you that I have shaken Chuck  Hagel’s hand. I have looked him in his  eyes and I saw the soul of a good man,  a man I want leading this country and  taking care of our youth, our infantry,  our men and women in uniform. So I  implore all of my colleagues to consider voting for Chuck Hagel.  ",2013

43,Senate,113,-0.395,85,2013-02-14,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, as President Obama reminded us in his State of  the Union Address this week, 2 months  have passed since the heartbreaking  school shooting in Newtown, CT. Since  then, we have mourned the loss of the  20 wonderful children and 6 extraordinary adults who were murdered that  day. Their lives were taken by a mentally deranged  individual who easily  obtained a  semi-automatic military-  style assault rifle with a high capacity  ammunition magazine.  It has been estimated that there are  currently 18 million assault weapons in  circulation around the United States.  If no action is taken, this number will  continue to grow. Across our Nation,  any dangerous individual can walk into  a gun show and walk out with the same  type of weapon that the perpetrator in  Newtown used to murder so many innocent people. These weapons, along with  high-capacity ammunition magazines,  can easily escalate confrontation into  murder, petty crime into tragedy, and  a killing of one or two people into a  massive slaughter.  The weight of evidence shows that  since Congress allowed the Federal assault weapons ban to expire in 2004, the  use of military style assault weapons  in crime has surged around our Nation.  For example, a 2010 study conducted by  the Police Executive Research Forum  found that since the ban lapsed, 37 percent of police agencies have reported  increases in criminals’ use of assault  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:18 Feb 15, 2013 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14FE6.049 S14FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2013

46,Senate,113,0.208,113,2013-02-14,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to reintroduce legislation to  clarify Federal mining law and remedy  a problem that has arisen from the extension process for ‘‘small’’ miner mineral claims.  Under revisions to the Federal Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 28(f), holders  of unpatented mineral claims must pay  a claim maintenance fee originally set  at $100 per claim by a deadline, set by  regulation, of September 1st each year.  Since 2004 that fee has risen. But Congress also has provided a claim maintenance fee waiver for ‘‘small’’ miners,  those who hold 10 or fewer claims, that  they do not have to submit the fee, but  that  they must  file  to  renew  their  claims and submit an affidavit of annual  labor, work  conducted on  the  claim, each year, certifying that they  had performed more than $100 of work  on the claim in the preceding year, 30  U.S.C. 28f(d)(1). The waiver provision  further states: ‘‘If a small miner waiver  application is determined to be defective for any reason, the claimant shall  have a period of 60 days after receipt of  written notification of the defect or defects by the Bureau of Land Management to: cure such defect or defects or  pay the $100 claim maintenance fee due  for such a period.’’  Since past revisions of the law, there  have been a series of incidents where  miners have argued  that  they  submitted their applications and affidavits  of annual labor in a timely manner,  but due to clerical error by BLM staff,  mailing delays or for unexplained reasons,  the applications or documents  were not recorded as having been received in a timely fashion. In that case  BLM has terminated the claims, deeming them null and void. While mining  claim holders have argued that the law  provides them time to cure claim defects, BLM has argued that the cure  only applies when applications or fees  have been received in a timely manner.  Thus, there is no administrative remedy for miners who believe that clerical errors by BLM or mail issues resulted in loss or the late recording of  claim extension applications and paperwork.  There have been a number of cases  where Congress has been asked to override BLM determinations and reinstate  mining claims simply because of the  disputes over whether the claims had  been filed in a timely manner. Congress in 2003 reinstated such claims in  a previous Alaska case. Claims in two  other  incidents were  reinstated  following a U.S. District Court case in the  10th Circuit first in 2009 in the case of  Miller v. United States and secondly  earlier this year in a second Alaska  case. Legislation to correct the provision to prevent this problem in the future actually cleared the Senate  in  2007, but did not ultimately become  law.  In the past two Congresses I have introduced legislation intended to short  circuit continued litigation and pleas  for claim reinstatement by clarifying  the intent of Congress that miners do  have to be informed that their claims  are  in  jeopardy of being voided and  given 60 days notice to cure defects, including giving them time to submit  their applications and to submit affidavits of annual labor, should their submittals not be received and processed  by BLM officials on time. If all defects  are not cured within 60 days, the obvious intent of Congress in passing the  original act, then claims still are subject to voidance. But this administration has opposed the legislation arguing that it would be too expensive to  notify all small miners who fail to file  their small miner waiver documents on  time and giving them time to solve the  defect prior to the loss of their claims.  It has even been suggested that giving  small miners simple due process would  just encourage miners to  ignore the  deadline for filing for their fee waivers.  I  find  the  cost  complaint  unpersuasive. Many Federal  departments and agencies, the Federal Communication Commission, as one example, routinely sends out notices on permit and license applications. The FCC  sends out hundreds of  thousands of  such notices to Americans who have  small radio  licenses expiring yearly,  warning them that they need to file applications for license renewal. The Bureau of Land Management certainly  should be able to afford a few hundred  50-cent stamps to perform a similar  service. Given  the  value  of  claims  placed at risk and the bother, inconvenience and fear of loss of claims, it is  highly  unlikely  that miners would  avoid filing their waiver paperwork on  time just because a notification process was clearly in place before claims  could be terminated.  So today I reintroduce legislation to  solve the notification issue and include  language to remedy an injustice to one  of my constituents who has lost his  rights to nine mineral claims on the  Kenai Peninsula, near Hope, Alaska.  The transition  language would reinstate claims  for Mr. John Trautner,  who has lost title to claims that he had  held from 1982 to 2004. Mr. Trautner  suffered this loss even though he had a  consistent record of having paid the  annual  labor assessment  fee  for the  previous 22 years. The local BLM office  did have a time-date-stamped record  that the maintenance fee waiver certification form had been filed weeks before the deadline but just not a record  that the affidavit of annual labor had  arrived when he dropped it office in the  Anchorage office at the same time.  This  legislation,  supported  in  the  past by the Alaska Miners Association,  will clarify that small miners do have  a right to simple due process to be able  to have a chance to file their small  miner waiver applications in the event  of mistakes in processing, rather than  immediately lose their rights to patented mining claims without effective  appeal or recourse. I appreciate that  the Justice Department and BLM Jan.  22,  2013  reinstated claims owned by  Alaskans Don and Judy Mullikins of  Nome, finally reversing a decision that  they should lose their claims following  a 2009 application filing incident. But  the legal expense, bother and uncertainty that the Mullikins went through  in getting their claims reinstated are  clear  reasons why Congress  should  clarify past changes to the small miner  waiver provision and permit claims to  be retained in the event of clerical errors or honest mistakes by claim holders in missing the deadline for filings.  Such a change would simply provide  justice for small miners.

47,,113,0.661,127,2013-02-14,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the legacy of President Richard Nixon in  this centennial year of his birth.  President Nixon took the oath of office at a  time of domestic upheaval and  far-reaching  social, economic, and political change. I doubt  there was ever a day when he did not wake  to an agenda of pressing challenges and difficult decisions.  But his true legacy lies in foreign policy.  Few Presidents have entered  the White  House with a deeper understanding of international affairs, and we are very fortunate that  he did. For when he first walked into the Oval  Office, he inherited a world in which the U.S.  was faced with enormous difficulties and problems that seemed to have no solution, from  our grinding engagement in Vietnam to an increasingly emboldened Soviet Union.  He understood  from  the  first  that  the old  ways of doing things simply would not work in  a new and dangerous world and repeatedly  astonished his admirers and opponents alike  with a surprisingly flexible and sophisticated,  albeit tough-minded, approach.  That was most  famously demonstrated by  his stunning reaching out to China.  For decades this action has been the subject of much discussion and comment, and it  is commonly cited as a model  for similarly  bold action today.  But there is danger in easy comparisons. It  is of key importance to stress that he did not  suffer from an illusion that Mao’s dictatorship  was reforming itself or that our mutual hostility  was primarily the fault of the United States. Or  that a handshake could somehow  transform  conflicting goals into a broad partnership.  Instead, it was based on a clear-eyed understanding of how the world actually works  and  that a  rigid adherence  to  ideology can  blind one to inconvenient facts and potential  options. Only someone deeply confident in his  beliefs could have done so. But he did not  take unnecessary risks, he did not leap into  the dark, hoping for the best. Instead, he took  deliberate steps on a well-thought-out path to  specific goals.  Even  then, his eyes were not  focused on  China, but on a much larger purpose, namely  reordering the international system to give the  U.S. new options that it otherwise would not  have had, including an ability to exploit divisions among opponents  that  rendered each  eager for improved relations with the U.S.  What a contrast to today’s world, where the  U.S. often goes hat in hand to professed enemies in the illusion that they can be bribed to  abandon their fundamental goals, that unilateral concessions will generate good will, or  that they can somehow be convinced to become good international citizens through pleas  or lectures.  Nixon knew that peaceful outreach and negotiations were possible only when the other  side had no doubts of your toughness. Sometimes a smile is helpful, but often a stick is  more convincing. No one ever doubted  that  Richard Nixon understood the difference.  His no-nonsense view of the world can be  seen in the aftermath of the murder of Israeli  Olympians  in Munich by PLO  terrorists on  September 27th, 1972 when he warned that if  we want safety, we must not seek  ‘accommodations with savagery, but  rather act  to  eliminate it.’ ’  That was written  twenty-nine years before  the devastating 9/11 terror attacks, but it remains a crucial guide to action today.  As Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee,  I deal on a daily basis with  the  many problems  the U.S.  faces around  the  world. Some would be  familiar  to President  Nixon; many are quite different. But the deep  understanding, the commitment to basic principles, the pragmatic flexibility that characterized his approach are as essential today as  they were then.  I met him once when he spoke before the  House  Republican  Conference  in March,  1993, shortly after  I  first entered Congress.  The subject was Russia in the aftermath of the  collapse of the Soviet empire, but even after  many years out of office, and only a year before his death, his understanding of the range  of  issues and problems  facing  that country  and ours impressed everyone in the room. He  was masterful to the end.  Afterward, the President mentioned his old  House seat to me, and he asked me to join  him for a meeting with members of the Senate, organized by Senator Patrick Moynihan.  There he spoke of the future challenges and  opportunities with respect  to China, Eurasia,  Africa, and Latin America. As usual, he spoke  without using notes.  Perhaps his greatest legacy is what any student of his accomplishments  can  see  for  themselves:  that  the United States has no  choice to be a leader in the world if we are to  secure the safety and interests of the American people, that passivity and a surrender to  events can bring only disaster, that refusing to  recognize that the world is often a dangerous  and unforgiving place is to live in illusion, that  foolishly acting as though our resources were  unlimited with no need to prioritize our goals  is a certain road to defeat.  So it gives me pride to recognize President  Richard Nixon during  the centennial of his  birth. We owe him our respect for what he accomplished on behalf of  the security of  the  United States in a turbulent world.  f  HONORING JOHN BRENKLE  HON. MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 14, 2013  ",2013
48,,113,-0.395,127,2013-02-14,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize Monsignor  John  Brenkle on the occasion of receiving the Jefferson Award for his work in the Napa Valley  community.  The Jefferson Award  is a national award  given to those serving the community at a national  and  local  level,  which Monsignor  Brenkle has done for the past three decades.  He is known throughout the Napa Valley as a  mercenary who goes above and beyond to ensure the well-being of those in the community.  Monsignor Brenkle attended St. Patrick’s  Seminary in Menlo Park, California, and was  ordained on June 14, 1958 through the Archdiocese of San Francisco. He  received his  Doctorate  in Canon Law  from The Catholic  University of America in 1962. He served as  Chancellor of the Diocese in Santa Rosa until  1971,  followed by  two years of  teaching  in  Zambia.  Monsignor Brenkle has worked tirelessly to  help  low-income  families and  farm workers.  He played a pivotal role in creating housing for  migrant farm workers, and assisted in the decision to build low income housing sites in the  valley. He serves on numerous local boards,  including Catholic Charities, the Board of Directors of Justin-Siena High School, Catholic  Community Foundation, California Human Development Corporation, and  the St. Helena  Mayor’s Multi-cultural Committee.  It is because of all his hard work that he  was  recognized  to  receive  this outstanding  award. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, it is my  distinct pleasure  to congratulate Monsignor  John Brenkle on this joyous occasion.  f  COME AND TAKE IT  HON.

Ken was a loving husband to Debbie Berry,  a vital member of my congressional staff who  previously served in the office of former Representative Mike Pence. Ken brought joy, love,  and laughter to those around him and was a  wonderful partner in life for his entire family.  A longtime member of Oak Park Church in  Richmond, Ken enjoyed singing and gospel  music. He was a small business owner and  known around  the  region as an  impressive  auctioneer with a matching personality—warm,  friendly, and instantly approachable.  Ken and his family’s dedication to the people of  Indiana will be  forever appreciated.  I  ask  the entire 6th Congressional District  to  keep Debbie, son Matt, and the entire Berry  family in your thoughts and prayers.  f  TRIBUTE TO RUSSELL WALLING  HON. KEN CALVERT  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 14, 2013  ",2013
51,,113,0.348,134,2013-02-14,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine,  Russell Walling. Russell  passed  away  on  Tuesday, February 5, 2013. A long time resident of Riverside, California, he was a pillar of  the community and he will be deeply missed.  Russell was born December 7, 1917  in  Douglas, Arizona,  the  son  of  Luther  and  Francis Walling. His family relocated to Riverside in 1927, where he attended Lowell Elementary School, Riverside Polytechnic High  School and Riverside Community College. Following graduation he worked as a draftsman  for the noted architect G. Stanley Wilson, and  later moved to Los Angeles to work for a large  architectural firm. Russell met the love of his  life, LouElla Scott, at See’s Candy where she  worked and  the  two were married  in 1941.  Russell served his country honorably as a  Lieutenant in the Navy Seabees during World  War II.  After  the war he returned  to Riverside  to  work with his  father,  forming L.A. Walling &  Son. Together they built many homes in the  Wood Streets area, including Prince Albert Estates, the first exclusive custom tract homes in  Riverside.  In  the mid-1950s Russell started  Russell Walling,  Inc.  to continue  residential  building. His first commercial project was an  A&W restaurant on University Avenue in Riverside. Over  the years he built many  large  commercial buildings  in Riverside, such as  DeAnza Chevrolet, Caddock Electronics and  Johnson Tractor. Russell’s proudest accomplishment was the construction of an extensive  complex of buildings for Bourns Incorporated,  which won Building of the Year in 1962. In the  early 1970s he built Los Amigos, the first private upscale condominiums on Victoria Avenue. In the late 1970s he purchased the original Security Pacific Bank building on the corner of University & Main, now known as the  Walling Building.  It is hard to imagine that Russell would have  any  free  time on his hands yet he always  found time for his community. He had served  as President of Riverside ’s Chamber of Commerce and Citizen of the Year; President of  the Riverside Rotary Club; President of  the  Riverside Community Hospital Board;  and  President of  the Monday Morning Group. A  longtime member of the Victoria Club where  he was first a caddy in his early years, and  later  an  avid  golfer, Russell  and George  Champion spearheaded a major  three year  renovation of the Victoria Club in the 1990s.  Russell  loved  the outdoors and spent many  years with his  family at  their  trailer on  the  beach at El Morro near Laguna. He loved and  cherished his time with family, especially his  children  and  grandchildren.  Russell  and  LouElla  traveled extensively  throughout Europe, Asia and South America. They spent  many happy years doing annual fishing treks  to Whaler’s Cove off the rugged coast of Alaska’s Admiralty Island.  Russell was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 69 years, LouElla; his brother  Foster and sister, Mary. He is survived by his  daughter Lee Walling Good of Grants Pass,  Oregon; his son Terry Walling and daughter-  in-law Cathleen of Riverside; grandchildren,  Karen Lalonde of Greenwood, South Carolina;  Tracy Cauble and Susanne McGee of Grants  Pass, Oregon; David Good  of Greenville,  South Carolina; great grandchildren, Marrissa,  Kaitlyn and Steven Franquez, Shelby and  Caden  Morrison,  Madalyn  and  Gregory  Cauble, and Jakob and Lukas McGee; and  great great granddaughter Mya Franquez.  On Wednesday, February 13, 2013, a memorial service honoring Russell’s life was held  at the First Christian Church in Riverside. Russell will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the  community and love of family. His dedication  to his family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will  continue.  I extend my condolences  to Russell’s family and friends; although Russell may  be gone, the light and goodness he brought to  the world remain and will never be forgotten.  THE NATIONAL RUNAWAY SWITCHBOARD BECOMES THE NATIONAL  RUNAWAY SAFELINE  HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 14, 2013  ",2013
52,,113,-0.606,134,2013-02-14,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize  the National Runaway  Safeline, which changed its name last month  from the National Runaway Switchboard.  The NRS was established in 1971 to fill a  need for comprehensive crisis intervention for  young people in Chicago. It was conceived as  a centralized organization with  free 24-hour  services, expertise in all youth-related issues  and as an information clearinghouse of youth  services.  In 1974, NRS received an eight-month federal demonstration grant  to establish a national hotline for runaway, homeless, and at-  risk youth. The need for the service was clearly demonstrated over the eight-month period,  during which time 11,000 calls were received.  Since then, its capabilities and services have  grown  considerably,  now  handling  over  100,000 calls each year.  Since its founding, NRS grew into a national  organization and expanded its crisis intervention offerings to include bulletin boards, crisis  emails, and  live chat. Recognizing  that  the  term  ‘switchboard ’ ’ does not reflect  the various ways youth in crisis can connect with its  services,  the organization has changed  its  name to the National Runaway Safeline.  The organization maintains  its holistic and  expert crisis intervention model focused on addressing at-risk issues immediately. Its services  remain  confidential,  anonymous,  and  available  24/7,  providing  a  comprehensive  connection to more than 10,000 different organizations and resources for at-risk youth and  their  families. The organization continues  its  service as  the  federally-designated communication system  for  runaway and homeless  youth.  As a strong advocate of helping homeless  individuals and as a long-time supporter of the  organization, I am pleased that the NRS will  continue  its mission  to help keep America’s  runaway, homeless and at-risk youth safe and  off the streets. We are proud to have this nationally-recognized effort housed  in Chicago,  and  I congratulate Maureen Blaha and her  staff for their vision and leadership.  I welcome this opportunity to celebrate the  growth, progress and impact that the National  Runaway Safeline has had in the last 42 years  and will continue to have in the decades to  come.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

53,House,113,0.425,3,2013-02-25,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield as much time as he may consume  to  the  gentleman  from  California,  KEVINMCCARTHY, the majority whip  and, I might add, the originator and  author of this bill.  ",2013
54,House,113,0.462,3,2013-02-25,Mr. MCCARTHY of California.,"  I  would like to thank the chairman for  his work.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 667, to honor two great pioneers  in American aeronautics and space exploration, Dr. Hugh Dryden and Astronaut Neil Armstrong.  Neil Armstrong was a Navy fighter  pilot, engineer, test pilot, astronaut,  and educator who was always proud to  serve this Nation.  Before joining the Astronaut Corps in  1962 and eventually taking the  first  small step for a man, Armstrong served  as a test pilot for 7 years at what is  presently  called  the NASA Dryden  Flight Research Center in Kern County, California, which I am proud to represent. Armstrong  flew thousands of  hours as a test pilot there, mainly in  experimental jets and high-speed rocket planes. He was also part of the team  in the early 1960s who developed the  Lunar Landing Research Vehicle used  to train our astronauts on how to safely land on the Moon.  After the success of the Apollo 11  mission, Armstrong remained an active  contributor  to  the  aeronautical  research programs at  the Flight Research Center. Most notably of these  was the digital  fly-by-wire program,  which  is recognized today as a  far-  reaching technological breakthrough.  He returned to visit the center in the  years that  followed and, throughout  his life, remained a strong advocate of  flight research.  H.R.  667 would  rename  the NASA  Center in his honor, the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center.  H.R. 667 would also honor Dr. Hugh  Dryden’s  contributions  to  aerospace  engineering that made many of Neil  Armstrong’s career achievements possible.  Dryden was a key figure in the development of America’s aerospace programs from the early part of the 20th  century to the much more complex  programs  that are  still ongoing at  NASA  Flight  Research  Center,  Edwards Air Force Base, and China  Lake Naval Air Station in my district.  He was an early pioneer  in aerodynamics over the first half of the 20th  century and enabled many scientific  breakthroughs. When NASA was created in 1958, Dr. Dryden was chosen to  be its first deputy administrator, focusing his energies on the programs  that allowed our country to explore  space and send our astronauts to the  Moon.  H.R. 667 will memorialize both men  by redesignating the Dryden Flight Research Center as the Neil A. Armstrong  Flight Research Center and naming the  center’s test range as the Hugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.  b1710  Edwards Air Force Base, Naval Air  Weapons  Station  China Lake,  and  NASA Flight Research Center in eastern Kern County remain a hub of scientific discovery, aeronautic  innovation and space exploration. I look forward to many more groundbreaking  achievements from the men and women  inspired by the  legacy of Neil Armstrong and Hugh Dryden.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 667  is a  fitting  tribute to Armstrong and Dryden, and  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to celebrate the remarkable lives of both men.  Ms EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 667 has been offered to redesignate the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration’s  Dryden Flight Research Center as the  Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research  Center. The bill would also rename the  Western Aeronautical Test Range as  the Hugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test  Range.  While I plan to support this bill, it is  a bit unfortunate since it honors one  aerospace pioneer by stripping away  the honor previously extended to another worthy pioneer, Hugh L. Dryden.  Dr. Hugh Latimer Dryden was director of  the National Advisory Committee  for Aeronautics, NACA,  from  1947 until the creation of the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration  where he was named deputy administrator.  President Johnson said of his passing  that it was:  A reason for national sorrow. No soldier  ever performed his duty with more bravery,  and no statesman ever charted new courses  with more dedication than Hugh Dryden.  Whenever  the  first American  spaceman  sets foot on the Moon or finds a new trail to  a new star, he will know that Hugh Dryden  was one of those who give him knowledge  and illumination.  NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, was named  in his honor on March 26, 1976. The center is NASA’s premier site for aeronautical flight research. At the dedication ceremony,  then-NASA Administrator, James Fletcher, stated:  It is most fitting that this Flight Research  Center, with its unique and highly specialized capability for solving aerospace problems, should memorialize the genius of Hugh  Dryden.  Neil Armstrong joined NACA in 1955  following his service as a naval aviator.  Over the next 17 years, he was an engineer, test pilot, astronaut and administrator  for NACA  and  its  successor  agency, NASA.  As a research pilot, he flew over 200  different models of aircraft, such as the  storied X–15. He transferred to astronaut status in 1962 and was command  pilot for the Gemini 8 mission on which  he performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space. As spacecraft commander  for Apollo 11, Neil  Armstrong successfully  led the  first  manned lunar landing. His service and  his  famous words,  ‘‘that’s one small  step for man, one giant leap for mankind,’’  inspired millions around  the  world,  including this Congresswoman  sitting in front of a black and white  television.  Mr. Speaker, it’s clear that Mr. Armstrong never sought the honor of having a NASA center named after him  while alive. In truth, his name will live  on throughout history whether or not  we ever name anything  for him.  I  doubt, in this era of declining funding  for NASA, that either Neil Armstrong  or Hugh Dryden would want a single  precious dollar to be spent on a cosmetic facility name change when that  money could be spent instead on fulfilling NASA’s mission to reach for the  stars. And,  in  fact, when Neil Armstrong  appeared  before  our Science  Committee, he  almost  said  exactly  that.  While I expect that we will approve  this legislation today, I hope that all  the Members who vote to honor Neil  Armstrong  today will  remember his  testimony before the House Science,  Space and Technology Committee during which he said:  The key to the success of American investment in space exploration is a clearly articulated plan and strategy supported by the administration and the Congress and  implemented with all the consistency that the vagaries of the budget will allow. Such a program will motivate the young toward excellence, support a vital industry and earn the  respect of the world.  I hope we can honor his words. But  his words were foreshadowed by Hugh  Dryden in a letter he wrote to Senator  Robert Kerr, chairman of the Senate  Committee on Aeronautical and Space  Sciences in 1961:  The development of space science and technologies  strengthen our whole  industrial  base and serves as insurance against technological obsolescence. Education will profit.  The discipline of cooperation in a great national effort may well be the instrument of  great social gain.  If the same Members who vote to rename these two NASA facilities today  will commit to working in the coming  months and years for those exploration  goals to which both men devoted their  lives, then we will have truly honored  both of their legacies in an enduring  and a meaningful way.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2013
55,House,113,0.586,10,2013-02-25,Mr. SESSIONS.," I appreciate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for leading the discussion tonight in honor of  the great Member of Congress from the  Third  Congressional  District,  SAM  JOHNSON. I want to take a few minutes  tonight to not just acknowledge how  great SAMJOHNSONis to the Texas delegation but really to highlight what he  means to this body.  SAMJOHNSONhas been a Member of  this body since 1991. He came in a special election as a result of a hard-  fought race in Dallas, Texas, when Congressman Steve Bartlett stepped down.  And SAMJOHNSONcame to the United  States Congress not just with a background of 29 years of serving in the  United States Air Force as being a top  gun pilot and a man who had served  this country in war and at the Hanoi  Hilton, but he came here with thoughts  and ideas about his home of Texas, representing Collin County and Dallas  County, Texas.  It’s not just a high honor for us to  have SAMas our Member of Congress at  that time and currently, but SAMcame  to this body with ideas that he felt like  would make our country stronger and  better. More than just respect for the  flag  and  respect  for  the men  and  women that serve in our military, but  really for respect for human life and individuals, he believes that individuals  make our country stronger and better;  and he has devoted his life, the times  we fly back and forth, SAMtalks about  how important people are and people’s  dreams, people back home. He remembers not just the stories about individuals, but I think he idolizes hard work  and people who commit themselves to  the sacrifice for others.  SAMis known in this body for several  years now as the most admired Member  of Congress. And he’s not the most admired Member of Congress because of  just being a nice man—and that he is—  but really for standing up and talking  about the values of this country, the  values of this country, what we stand  for and how he wants it to be even better.  He and Shirley have, for years, stood  up across Texas and across this country and talked about how important we  are if we sacrifice to make others’ lives  better, if we leave our country better  than the way we found it. And so tonight on behalf of the people of the  32nd Congressional District, which is  Dallas, which is right next to Congressman SAMJOHNSON, I stand up and applaud the life of SAMJOHNSON, his service to our country, not just the United  States Air Force and the American  people, but also the man that calls  home Plano, Texas, and the Third Congressional District, our great  friend  and colleague, Congressman SAMJOHNSON.  So, SAM, congratulations. Congratulations for not just a job well done but  for the 40 years that you have been  back home and what you have done to  your life as a result of the service for  what you believe was the right thing to  do.  I thank the gentleman from Texas,  Judge POE, for the time.  ",2013

60,Senate,113,-0.3,38,2013-02-25,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President, as I have  every year since I came to the Senate,  I rise to commemorate Black History  Month. This year, we are privileged to  recognize Bill Strickland, a man whose  approach is unique and whose accomplishments are of great consequence to  African-Americans, and in fact, to all  Americans. From the age of 19, Bill  Strickland has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those living in poverty, to give them a setting they can  thrive in and a future they can take  pride in.  Bill grew up in the Manchester neighborhood of Pittsburgh, on the city’s  north side. Prior to the decline of industry  in the city  in the mid–1960s,  Manchester was a solid, working class  community. But by the time Bill was  in high school, the area around him  had slid into urban decay and instability. Though surrounded by poverty,  Bill’s mother was determined to provide a safe environment for her family.  And though she didn’t have a high  school diploma herself, Bill’s mother  held firm to the belief that a good education was the ticket to a better life.  At Oliver High School, when he began  his senior year Bill had neither plans  for after graduation or a clear picture  of what his future might look like.  Then one day while walking down the  hallway at school, Bill was attracted  by the smell of fresh coffee. The coffee,  along with the sounds of jazz, led Bill  to the art room in Oliver High where  he watched a pot being formed from a  mound of clay on a turntable. Seated  at the potter’s wheel was Frank Ross,  Oliver High’s art teacher who would become Bill’s close friend and mentor.  Over the next year, in the calm atmosphere of Frank’s well-lit art studio,  Bill would develop a talent for ceramics. As importantly, it provided a safe  and stable sanctuary from the chaos of  the streets. At the potter’s wheel Bill  found his passion, and although he  didn’t know it yet, he was also forming  the beginning of a vision that would  become Manchester Bidwell Corporation.  In 1967, Bill graduated from Oliver  High School and, at the instance of  Frank Ross, applied to the University  of Pittsburgh where he was accepted,  but only as a probationary student. Although he had begun his studies full-  time, Bill never  lost the connection  with his neighborhood. In the summer  of 1968, as Manchester grappled with  the racial tensions that swept many  inner cities, Bill decided to open an  arts center in his neighborhood. He had  seen the power a bright, orderly, safe  place like Frank Ross’ studio and the  artistic work done there had had on his  own life. He wanted to give the young  people of Manchester a place where  they too could escape the effects of  economic and social devastation and  experience something beautiful. A conversation with a young minister working in the area led Bill to his first  $25,000 in funding and the Manchester  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:07 Sep 25, 2013 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD13\RECFILES\FEB2013\S25FE3.REC S25FE3 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 5 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2013

MALLOY AT THE INTERFAITH  VIGIL FOR FAMILIES OF SANDY  HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  HON. JOHN B. LARSON  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 25, 2013  ",2013
62,,113,-0.4,59,2013-02-25,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in memory of the lives lost at Sandy  Hook Elementary School. I submit the remarks  of Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy, at  the Interfaith Vigil for the families and community of Newtown, CT with the President of the  United States.  Pat, thank you for all of the great work  that you have done for this community in  the last three days. To the police chief and  to the superintendent of schools, thank you  for your great service, as well. To all of the  first responders, thank you.  When I came into the hall, one of the first  songs to be played on the piano was ‘‘Amazing Grace,’’ which is fitting for any number  of reasons. Its become an anthem for first responders. It has great words. It also speaks  of the power of faith.  ‘‘Amazing Grace’’ was written by a former  sea captain engaged in the slave trade. And  those profound words that ‘‘I once was lost  and now am found’’ speak to us on a day like  today when we are called upon—dare I say  required to be invested in our faith.  A faith so evident in this room and in this  community at this time. A faith that is,  after all, at its very core a gift from God. A  faith in which we find comfort and hope and  compassion. A faith in which we are given  the power to go on, to survive that which has  befallen  this  community,  these  families,  these spouses. That which has happened and  is unimaginable and unthinkable and was  never, we thought, intended to be upon us  here in Connecticut, or in Newtown, or in  Sandy Hook.  I choose to think about the fact that in the  coming days we will officially enter winter.  And that is always to be followed by the  spring. Let me assure you that in winter,  each time I see the beginning of a snowfall,  I will be thinking of those 27 souls lost just  a few days ago.  Each time the day gets a little longer, I  will think and dream of the lives that might  have been and the lives that were so full of  grace. And when the flowers start to come  out of the ground, and when they rise up, I  will know that we are in touch with those  that we have lost in the last few days.  We will go on, we will find strength. Faith  is a gift, as is our ability to support one another in our greater community.  To all of you, I extend my most profound  condolences on behalf of all of your fellow  citizens for what you have seen, for what you  have witnessed and for what have you personally experienced.  We will move on, we will never forget, we  will in many ways be made stronger for what  has transpired and we will get better.  We are blessed today to have with us the  President of the United States, who upon  meeting with Pat and me just a little while  ago said that the most difficult day of his  presidency was Friday, when he heard the  news of that which had befallen this community. I assured him that Connecticut, Newtown and Sandy Hook are strong, and I welcomed him on your behalf to our community.

63,,113,-0.404,59,2013-02-25,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I join my  colleagues and people all over  the world  in  recognizing the tragedy known as the Khojaly  Massacre which occurred on February 26,  1992 in the small Azerbaijani town of Khojaly.  The attack resulted  in  the massacre of 613  Azerbaijani civilians and  is one of  the most  devastating acts of  violence  in  the South  Caucasus in recent history. According to some  accounts, the fate of 150 Khojaly inhabitants is  still unknown, even after twenty–one years.  The numerous casualties and acts of torture  in the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan  underscore the need for a political–rather than  a military–solution  to  the Nagorno–Karabakh  conflict. A fair and comprehensive settlement  is the only effective tool to encourage stability,  prosperity, and a lasting peace in the region.  As co–chair of the Minsk Group, the United  States remains committed to working with both  sides to that end. With that goal in mind, we  remember and mourn  the 613  victims of  Khojaly and work  together  to safeguard  the  human rights of all.  f  HONORING THE JACKSON,  MISSISSIPPI FIRE DEPARTMENT  HON.

65,,113,-0.465,66,2013-02-25,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to a  remarkable  theologian and  dedicated community servant. Dr. William P.  Diggs has  retired after 50 years of  leading  Trinity Baptist Church  in Florence, South  Carolina. He has set a tremendous example of  stewardship and service for future generations  to follow.  Dr. Diggs was born  in Columbia, South  Carolina, but grew up in Rock Hill. Always a  dedicated student, he graduated  from Morehouse College, earned a Master of Arts in Sociology from Atlanta University, a Master of Divinity from Colgate-Rochester Divinity School  in Rochester, New York, and a Doctor of Ministry from McCormick Theological Seminary in  Chicago.  Educational opportunities  took him around  the country, but Dr. Diggs  longed  to  return  home to South Carolina. Upon his return, he  served as Pastor at Flat Rock Baptist Church  in Clover, South Carolina, and Galilee Baptist  Church in nearby York. In 1962, he truly found  a home when he took the position as Pastor  of Trinity Baptist Church where he remained  until his retirement in December 2012.  During his half-century at Trinity, the church  itself grew in size and influence. The improvements  to  the physical structure  included a  church manse, a complete renovation of the  edifice, and  the construction of a new education building. The church also purchased  two buildings—Trinity Annex and the Old Seaboard Depot—and secured  land  for a new  parking  lot. A new addition which houses a  pre-school; additional Sunday school classrooms; meeting rooms; and a  fully-equipped  kitchen was also built. And in 2010, the church  purchased  commercial  property  on  North  Dargan Street  that  includes barber shops,  beauty salons and a restaurant.  The church’s community influence also grew  with its size. Dr. Diggs made education a priority and  led Trinity Baptist Church  to contribute nearly $35,000 annually to higher education facilities. He also instituted a pre-school  which is licensed by the State of South Carolina and has been recognized  for  its excellence. The church also organized a federally  operated credit union, which has assets of almost three million dollars.  Dr. Diggs accomplished quite a lot at Trinity  Baptist Church, but his contributions did not  stop at the church’s door. He served as an  Assistant Professor of Sociology at Friendship,  Benedict and Morris Colleges for a total of 24  years, and  is a  former Adjunct Professor at  Francis Marion University. He is a sought after  speaker having addressed students at Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Religion,  Interdenominational  Theological  Center,  Bishop College, the University of South Carolina, Winthrop University and Coker College,  and many sermons at churches throughout the  country.  He has also contributed his time and talents  to other faith-based organizations; serving as  Past President and Past Dean of  the Congress of Christian Education, Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc., and Past Dean  of the South Region. He is also a Past Moderator of the Pee Dee Baptist Association, and  the Past Dean of the Pee Dee Baptist Workshop.  He has served as a member of the Boards  of Trustees at Friendship College, Benedict  College, and Morris Colleges, a member of  the Boards of Directors at Morehouse School  of Religion,  the  Interdenominational Theological Center, and as a board member of  Nannie Helen Burroughs School, the Greater  Florence Habitat for Humanity, and the Mayor’s Human Relations Committee.  Dr. Diggs is a Life Member of the NAACP,  and Past President of  the Florence Branch.  He helped to organize the first ‘ ‘sit-in ’ ’ demonstrations in South Carolina, which occurred  on February 12, 1960 in Rock Hill.  Dr. Diggs  is  the  recipient of numerous  awards including the Order of the Palmetto in  1996, the highest civilian award given by the  Governor of South Carolina. He was inducted  into the South Carolina Black Hall of Fame in  1998 by 100 Black Men of South Carolina,  Inc. and the United Black Fund. The Greater  Florence Chamber of Commerce awarded him  the Building Bridges Humanitarian Award  in  2000. He is also the recipient of the Pee Dee  Area Council Boy Scouts of America Whitney  Young Award and the AARP Andrus Award for  Community Service  for  the State of South  Carolina among many other honors.  Dr. Diggs is married to the former Clotilda  Daniels, and  the couple has  two children—  Mary Lynne and William, Jr. (Lennette). They  have one grandson, William IV.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues  to join me in commending Dr. William P. Diggs  for his more than 50 years of service in the  ministry. His ministry  is a  living example of  Peter’s admonition,  ‘As each one has  received a special gift, employs it in serving one  another, as good stewards of  the manifold  grace of God.’ ’ I am proud to call Dr. Diggs a  dear friend, and I wish him well in retirement.  f  HONORING SERGEANT FIRST  CLASS LLOYD CLAUDE ‘‘L.C.’’ RICE  HON.

66,,113,0.75,66,2013-02-25,Mr. MULVANEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life and mark the passing of Sergeant First Class L.C. Rice, one of my constituents, a highly decorated veteran, and a  true servant of our nation.  SFC Rice was born in Greer, SC, in 1923,  the son of the late Bunyon Clinton Rice and  the  late Tenie Jane Beaver Rice. L.C. Rice  grew up during the Depression, so after completing the lower grades, he went to work. In  January 1941, SFC Rice joined the Navy at  the age of 17.  He was a machinist mate stationed on the  USS Pennsylvania at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on  the morning of December 7, 1941. His ship  was in dry dock when it was attacked, and all  weapons and ammunition had been removed.  SFC Rice spent that day ‘ ‘which shall live in  infamy’ ’ rescuing the wounded and collecting  the dead.  Next, SFC Rice was sent on a secret mission to deliver the cruiser USS Milwaukee to  the Russians. His  family could not be  told  where he was, and he was gone for so long  they believed him missing in action. Later, he  was stationed on a ship off the coast of Normandy, which was  torpedoed and sank beneath him. Although he was hit by shrapnel,  he swam through the debris and made it to  shore, rescuing others along  the way. Once  on land, L.C. was given a rifle and helped fight  against  the Nazis. During World War  II, he  served both  in naval and ground combat  in  both  the Pacific and  the European  theatres.  SFC Rice also participated in the Pacific Island campaigns and was part of  the atomic  bomb tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1946. For his  service to our nation, SFC Rice was awarded  the Purple Heart.

68,House,113,-0.686,124,2013-03-04,Ms. LEE of California.," Let me thank  you  for your  tremendous  leadership  and pulling us all together tonight to  talk about this impact of sequestration. And I also want to thank our  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, MARCIA for once again  sounding the alarm and keeping us on  track.  Let me first just start by saying we  need to stop the sequestration, and we  need to create jobs, lift the economy  and reduce poverty.  The sequester will impact my congressional district in my home State of  California and every single household  in America. It will push 750,000 Americans into the unemployment line and  slow our entire economy.  In my home State, for example, it  will cut 8,200 children from Head Start  and shut the door to college for about  9,600 students. Additionally, 600,000 to  775,000 eligible low-income women and  children are going to be denied nutritional assistance because they’re going  to be cut from the WIC program.  Sequestration will impact everyone,  but it will have a particularly harmful  effect on communities of color who  were hit first and worst by the Great  Recession and have yet to significantly  feel the effects of the recovery.  Let me just read out 10 reasons which  were recently highlighted by the Center  for American Progress, and why  communities of color and the African  American community and Latino community particularly should pay attention to sequestration and the impact it  will have in these communities.  First, there are going to be deep cuts  to the long-term unemployed and the  reduction of benefits will disproportionately affect people of color.  Extended  Federal  unemployment  benefits remain vulnerable under sequestration, and the long-term unemployed—those out of work and searching  for  a new  job  for  at  least  6  months—could lose almost 10 percent,  mind you, 10 percent of their weekly  jobless benefits if the sequester goes  into effect.  Now, 13.8 percent of African Americans and 9.7 percent of Latinos are unemployed. Worse than that, 40 percent  of unemployed Asians, 38 percent of African Americans  and  28  percent  of  Latinos  have  been  unemployed  for  more than 52 weeks.  Secondly,  workforce  development  programs  that are vital  to communities of color such as YouthBuild and  Job  Corps  face  significant  cuts.  YouthBuild is a program that connects  low-income youth  to  education and  training, and it could be cut about 8  percent  Cuts  to  critical  job-creation  programs such as Build America Bonds are  also on the chopping block. This was  created in 2009 and provides incentives  for infrastructure investments through  the Tax Code.  Fourth, Federal budget cuts under  sequestration would quickly mean cuts  to Federal, State, and local public sector jobs which disproportionately employ women and African Americans. In  2011, employed African Americans comprised 20 percent of the Federal, State,  and local public sector workforce, and  women were nearly 50 percent more  likely than men to work in the public  sector.  Early child care funding could be cut  by more than $900 million, impacting  thousands of children of color who benefit  from  these programs, programs  that directly help the most vulnerable  families and children such as, as I said  earlier, WIC. They’re threatened by sequestration.  Federal education funding cuts will  disproportionately  hurt  students  of  color. If sequester goes into effect in  the way it has been designed, nearly $3  billion would be cut  in educational  loans, including cuts to financial aid  for students and to programs for our  most vulnerable youth.  Cuts to medical research put patients  at  risk. The National  Institutes of  Health would lose $1.5 billion in medical research funding, meaning fewer  research projects would be aimed at  finding treatments and cures for diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, all of which are among the  leading  cause  of  death  for African  Americans.  b1940  Since 2010, funding for housing has  been cut by $2.5 billion, meaning any  additional  cuts would  significantly  hurt low-income families and communities. Many housing programs, such as  section 8 housing assistance, provide  vouchers to low-income families for affordable housing in the private sector.  Finally, as the Nation continues to  endure a cold winter, programs such as  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps bring down  the  cost of heating  for  low-income  households, are critical.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like  to  insert  for the RECORD an article  from today’s New York Times, headed:  ‘‘As Automatic Budget Cuts Go into  Effect, Poor May Be Hit Particularly  Hard.’’ It explains that sequestration  cuts, as they are called, still contain  billions of dollars in mandatory budget  reductions and programs that help low-  income Americans, including ones that  give vouchers for housing for the poor  and the disabled and another that provides  fortified baby  formula  to  the  children of poor women.  So I think we need to really listen to  the Congressional Black Caucus and  understand what this means in terms  of vulnerable, marginal communities—  communities of color and individuals  who were hardest hit by the recession  and who have yet to feel any of the  economic  recovery  that  has  taken  place and who are going to now have  another hit in terms of the safety net  and the quality of life. They don’t deserve this. We need to get back to the  drawing board and do what is right and  what is fair.  [From the New York Times, Mar. 3, 2013]  ASAUTOMATICBUDGETCUTSGOINTOEFFECT,  POORMAYBEHITPARTICULARLYHARD  (By Annie Lowrey)  WASHINGTON.—The $85 billion in automatic  cuts working their way through the federal  budget spare many programs that aid the  poorest and most vulnerable Americans, including the Children’s Health Insurance Program and food stamps.  But the sequestration cuts, as they are  called, still contain billions of dollars  in  mandatory budget reductions  in programs  that help low-income Americans, including  one that gives vouchers for housing to the  poor and disabled and another that provides  fortified baby formula to the children of poor  women.  Republican  and Democratic  lawmakers  largely resigned themselves to allowing sequestration—a policy meant to force them to  the negotiating table, not to actually reduce  the deficit—to take wider effect after  it  started on Friday. That leaves agencies just  seven months to carry out their cuts before  the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. In many  cases, they will eventually have to deny aid  to eligible needy families.  Unless a deal  is reached to change the  course of the cuts, housing programs would  be hit particularly hard, with about 125,000  individuals and families put at risk of becoming homeless, the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated. An  additional 100,000 formerly homeless people  might be removed from emergency shelters  or other housing arrangements because of  the cuts, the agency said.  Local administrators are trying to decide  how to put the mandatory 5.1 percent budget  cuts into effect by the end of September.  Adrianne Todman, the executive director of  the District of Columbia Housing Authority,  said that no person in her program currently  using a housing voucher or living in a public  facility would be affected or put out on the  street.  But to absorb the cuts, Ms. Todman plans  to defer maintenance and leave staff vacancies open. She may also not be able to fill  open public housing units as tenants vacate  them. And she may stop rolling over housing  vouchers to  families on the waiting  list.  Eventually, she said, she may have to furlough employees.  ‘‘It’s a shame. It’s more than a shame, it’s  despicable,’’ Ms. Todman said, noting that  her agency already lacked enough capacity  to meet the district’s needs. ‘‘These are real  families that we have deemed eligible and  are waiting to receive their voucher from  us.’’  In Washington and across  the country,  families and individuals generally need to  have very low incomes to be eligible for federal assistance. Public housing residents in  Washington have an average annual income  of just $12,911. More than 40 percent are either children or the elderly, and more than a  quarter live with a disability. In the voucher  program, the annual income is even lower,  just over $10,000 a year, and similarly large  proportions of residents are elderly, disabled  or young.  ‘‘These people are very, very, very poor,’’  said Sheila Crowley, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, speaking of recipients of federal housing support  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:24 Mar 05, 2013 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K04MR7.031 H04MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2013

70,Senate,113,0.375,145,2013-03-04,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. President, today  I wish to remember Barry M. Horstman  of Cincinnati, OH, for his dedication to  his community and distinguished career  in  journalism. Mr. Horstman  passed away suddenly while working in  the  newsroom  of  the  Cincinnati  Enquirer on February 25, 2013.  Known as a ‘‘newsman’s newsman,’’  Barry Horstman developed a reputation as a tough but fair investigative  reporter who showed his commitment  to his community by being relentless  in his work.  Horstman’s passion  for  journalism  was inspired by his fourth grade teacher who encouraged him to write. In  high school, he started a column for  the Western Hills High School newspaper  called  ‘‘Straight  from  the  Horstman’s Mouth.’’ He went on to  earn a  journalism degree  from The  Ohio State University.  While a student, Horstman worked at  the Cincinnati Post, jumpstarting his  long and fruitful career in journalism.  Horstman’s career  included positions  as  a Washington  correspondent  for  Scripps Howard News Service, a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, a reporter for the Cincinnati Post, and a  writer and supervisor for the Las Vegas  Sun before he returned to his hometown to join the Cincinnati Enquirer in  2008.  Barry covered me off and on for over  20 years, and even when I might have  wished his story had been written a little differently, I never questioned his  professionalism  as  a  journalist, his  commitment to reporting the facts as  he saw them, and his decency and fairness as a person.  A local history buff, Horstman wrote  profiles  of  local  Cincinnati  area  newsmakers that were compiled into a  book published in 1999: 100 Who Made a  Difference: Greater Cincinnatians Who  Made a Mark on the 20th Century. He  was known for his high energy and enthusiasm in all endeavors, especially  for taking fantastic vacations around  the globe.  Horstman grew up on the west side of  Cincinnati,  raised  in  an  apartment  above the Glenmore Bowl, the bowling  alley managed and later owned by his  father, Les. He was an avid runner and  a talented bowler.  I honor Barry Horstman for his dedication to Cincinnati and contributions  to the field of journalism.∑  CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL  EMERGENCY  ORIGINALLY  DECLARED  IN EXECUTIVE ORDER  13288 ON MARCH 6, 2003, WITH RESPECT  TO  THE ACTIONS AND  POLICIES OF CERTAIN MEMBERS  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  OF  ZIMBABWE AND OTHER PERSONS  TO  UNDERMINE  ZIMBABWE’S  DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS, AS RECEIVED DURING RECESS OF THE SENATE ON  MARCH 1, 2013—PM 4  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message  from  the President  of  the United  States, together with an accompanying  report; which was referred to the Committee  on  Banking,  Housing,  and  Urban Affairs:  To the Congress of the United States:  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides  for the automatic termination of a national  emergency  unless, within  90  days prior to the anniversary date of  its declaration, the President publishes  in the Federal Register and transmits to  the Congress a notice stating that the  emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to  the Federal Register for publication the  enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive  Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of  Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes  or institutions is to continue in effect  beyond March 6, 2013.  The crisis constituted by the actions  and policies of certain members of the  Government of Zimbabwe and other  persons  to  undermine  Zimbabwe’s  democratic processes or  institutions  has not been resolved. These actions  and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the  foreign policy of the United States. For  these reasons, I have determined that  it  is necessary to continue this national emergency and to maintain in  force the sanctions to respond to this  threat.  THEWHITEHOUSE, March 1, 2013.

71,Senate,113,0.109,152,2013-03-04,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to discuss two separate problems  facing our Nation—the first is sequestration, which is underway now and indiscriminately affecting a wide range  of programs. The second is the prospect  of a long-term Continuing Resolution  to fund the Federal government for the  remainder of the fiscal year, also not  the way we should be doing business.  Both will result in damage to our military readiness.  In order to tackle these two separate  but equally devastating problems, I am  introducing two measures today.  The first bill, which I am pleased to  join my colleague, Senator UDALL, in  sponsoring, will help mitigate the consequences  of  sequestration  by  providing Department and agency heads  additional flexibility in implementing  the cuts. The second bill, which I am  introducing with my colleague  from  my home state of Maine, Senator King,  will fund the Department of Defense  for the remainder of the fiscal year at  levels approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in the funding bill  that was reported unanimously by the  Committee on August 2, 2012.  As Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash  Carter has repeatedly warned, failing  to pass an annual defense appropriations bill and requiring the Pentagon  to operate under last year’s law will  continue to lead to dangerous absurdities that have ramifications that last  far beyond the six months left in this  fiscal year.  Military readiness will suffer. A hollow force will be created. The Pentagon  will be unable to increase production  rates for existing weapons, start new  programs, or sign multiyear procurement contracts that would provide significant savings for taxpayers.  When I questioned Deputy Secretary  Carter on February 14, at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing about  what the continuing resolution means  for the Navy and our domestic shipbuilding capability, he testified that:  We’re in the absurd position where we’re  five months into the fiscal year and we have  the authority to build the ships that we built  last year and no authority to build the ships  that we plan to build this year. That’s crazy  . . . and that has nothing to do with sequester, by the way, that’s the CR.  I have long argued that we need to  bring the annual appropriations bills to  the floor to be considered individually  on their merits. I believe that CRs represent an abdication of our responsibility  and  should  be  avoided  altogether. But given where we find ourselves  today, at  the very  least we  should be able to come together to pass  the  full-year Department of Defense  funding bill and the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs appropriations.  With  regard  to  sequestration, we  have known this day could arrive for a  year and a half now. Yet, instead of  working together to avert sequestration and replace it with a more rational alternative, the time has been spent  jockeying for partisan advantage and  engaging in a blame game. Last week,  the Senate spent time voting against  proceeding to debate on two partisan  proposals that both sides knew beforehand were doomed.  The bill Senator UDALLand I are introducing today is a bipartisan effort  to mitigate the harmful effects of sequestration. As a result of sequestration, vital priorities such as defense,  education,  transportation,  and  biomedical research, all face indiscriminate, meat-ax cuts. No distinction is  made  between  high-performing  programs and poorly performing ones.  The legislation we introduce today  seeks to fix that. Instead of mindless  across-the-board budget cuts, this legislation provides the heads of Federal  agencies  and  departments with  the  flexibility to  implement the savings  targets required by the Budget Control  Act until such time as a bipartisan  agreement is reached to replace the sequester cuts or until Congress passes  new appropriations bills for fiscal year  2013 that meet the sequester levels.  The bill requires these agency and  Department heads to submit their proposals to the Appropriations committees of both the House and the Senate  for approval.  This approval is an important step in  the process because these Committees  know the budget of each agency and  can provide oversight of agency plans.  This provides a strong  incentive  for  each agency to put forth serious plans  in order to avoid the across-the-board  sequestration cuts that would otherwise take effect.  Let me emphasize that while our proposal is intended to mitigate the harmful and mindless across-the-board approach of sequestration, a comprehensive, bipartisan approach to put our fiscal house in order must remain a top  priority.  I urge my colleagues to support both  bills that we are introducing today.  f  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND  PROPOSED  SA 25.

Annala for  her 23 years of service as President and CEO  of  the United Way of Central  Indiana. The  people of my Congressional district and  the  State of Indiana are forever grateful for Ellen ’s  contributions and commitment to making the  United Way what it is today, a powerful force  for positive local development.  Over the years, Ellen’s leadership has been  critical in providing community leaders with the  vision and necessary  resources  to discover  new solutions and address the needs of our  state and ensure the welfare of our citizens.  As the first female leader of the United Way  of Central  Indiana, Ellen has been  instrumental  in bringing  together Hoosier  leaders  from all walks of life to make our communities  better places to live.  Due to Ellen’s strong leadership, the United  Way  is making  tomorrow a better place by  helping children today. She has tirelessly promoted early childhood learning by partnering  with Indianapolis Public Schools in an effort to  dramatically increase the number of children  performing at grade level by sixth grade.  Today, the United Way of Central Indiana is  even better equipped to support many of the  region’s  rural  communities as a  result of  Ellen’s guidance. She has opened offices and  brought  resources  to  the  five counties surrounding Indianapolis, giving the United Way  the unique ability to respond to local needs.  On behalf of the grateful constituents of the  Fifth Congressional District,  I  congratulate  Ellen on the occasion of her retirement. Thank  you, Ellen,  for your 23 years of dedicated  leadership with the United Way of Central Indiana. Best wishes to you as you pursue new  challenges in the many bright years ahead of  you.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF CASIMIR  PULASKI DAY  HON. JANICE D.

75,,113,-0.514,400,2013-03-11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise with great  sadness as I pay tribute to one of the most  dynamic and influential members of the State  of New York, Dillard T. Boone  II, who has  passed away recently. As  I speak with profound sorrow, I ascend to celebrate a life well  lived and to remember with fondness the accomplishments of a remarkable leader.  Mr. Boone was an accomplished senior executive with extensive experience in organizational management and business administration. He was an experienced project manager  in both the public and private sectors. A resident of Mount Vernon, New York for 14 years  and serving in City Government for 3 of those  years, Mr.  Boone  serves  his  community  through arts and culture and business. He is  the principal producer of many of  the city’s  cultural activities. He has worked with  local  businesses in producing special events, such  as the two-day Katrina Relief Concert held in  Mount Vernon.  He served as the Chairman of the A’Vatar  Foundation of Westchester, a non-profit, multicultural arts organization, created  to  fill  the  gap of cultural difference. The organization  has  collaborated with  the City  of Mount  Vernon’s Department of Recreation over  the  past 11  years,  in producing  the Summer  Breeze Concert Series, which has presented a  series of concerts directed at the cultural diversity of the city. Jazz, & Gospel, Traditional  &  Italian Classics, Brazilian Fest, Klezmer  Music, Dominican Fest, Caribbean, and world  music have been the core direction that the  organization has successfully maintained.  Previously a Harlem resident for 30 years  and a member of St. Charles for more than 25  years, Mr. Boone began his professional career working for the City of New York. He first  served as a supervisor  for social services,  then promoted to Deputy Director, the Office  of Labor Relations for Human Resources Administration. Upon graduating  from Cornell  University with a Masters degree in Industrial  Labor Relations, Mr. Boone was  then appointed  to Assistant Commissioner with  the  Agency for Child Development. There he supervised  the  technical department of engineers, architects, and building inspectors, as  the project manager  for major construction  and renovation of 140 head start and day care  facilities citywide.  After  leaving city government he was appointed to District Manager, Community Board  #10, Manhattan  (Central Harlem) where he  was the Administrator of the Community Board  that represented over 150,000 Central Harlem  residents. Mr. Boone became manager of residential and commercial property as on-site  manager at Concourse Village, (Bronx, NY),  2,000 units and 4 commercial spaces,  then  Rochdale Village, (Queens, NY), 6,000 units  and 74 commercial spaces,  Mr. Boone then embarked upon his current  professional career of arts and entertainment.  He will be remembered as President of  the  International Entertainment Enterprises (IEE),  a special events and production management  company which specializes in the business of  the arts and entertainment industry. He was  the first manager of the renowned Boys Choir  of Harlem. In addition, he was Concert Manager, for Dionne Warwick, the O ’Jays, Nancy  Wilson, Roberta Flack, Max Roach, Kool and  the Gang, and many more acclaimed artists.  To  list his numerous affiliations would exhaust the limits of this record, but I would be  remiss not to acknowledge his significant and  very productive years as a senior advisor to  The Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce.  Chamber president, Lloyd Williams expressed,  on behalf of  the Chamber and HARLEM  WEEK,  Inc., profound sorrow  to no  longer  have  the mind,  thoughts,  direction,  recommendations and  the spirit of Dillard as a  part of the annual planning and programs. Mr.  Williams pledges  to continue his extended  family relationship with Dillard ’s children, two  of whom are his ‘ ‘godchildren.’ ’  His was  indeed a  life of remarkable consequence and memorable production and he  will truly be missed by so many who relied on  his managerial  skills and  that magnificent  voice and smiling  face, and none more  remorseful than his wife and five children.  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the 150th anniversary of  the Emancipation Proclamation,  the 50th anniversary of the March On Washington, the Inaugural Ceremony of President  Barack Obama, let us celebrate the life of our  beloved Dillard Boone who dedicated his life  to the black experience and African American  culture.  f  NAGORNO-KARABAKH  HON.

Pastor McKinley was a  kind man who committed his  life  to serving  others.  Pastor Jackson was a long-time resident of  Fort Worth, Texas. Rev.

He was a former Fort Worth  City  Councilman  for  District  #5;  lifetime  NAACP member, and served  in  leadership  within many local, state and national civic and  religious organizations.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues please join me  in honor and remembrance of Pastor McKinley  Jackson, Senior whose kind spirit and dedicated service touched many lives. I offer my  condolences and deepest sympathy  to his  wife, Eddie Ruth Jackson; sons, Ronnie Jackson, Michael Jackson, Jesse Jackson and  Reverend William McKinley Jackson; daughters, Sharon  Jackson and Alicia  Jackson;  adopted  daughter, Angie  Johnson;  uncles;  aunts;  and  a  host  of  cousins,  nephews,  nieces, grandchildren, great grandchildren and  the Samaria Church Family.

77,House,113,0.49,6,2013-03-15,Mr. KLINE.," Madam Chair, I am very  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE).  b 0940  ",2013
78,House,113,0.495,6,2013-03-15,Mr. GOODLATTE.," I want to thank  the gentleman  from Minnesota,  the  chairman of  the Education and  the  Workforce Committee,  for  his  outstanding work on this.  I want to say to all of us that we  should be sure that the people who are  needing job training in this country  are being trained and prepared for the  jobs of the future, the jobs of opportunity, the jobs that are being created  in the communities; and whether people are teenagers or women who have  been the victims of domestic violence  or anyone else, they can be sure that,  with the kind of flexibility and creativity  in this  legislation, they will  have the best opportunity to be trained  for those jobs.  As we stand here today, there are approximately  12 million  Americans  without jobs. The numbers get worse  the closer you look at them. Over 40  percent of these Americans have been  unemployed for more than 6 months,  and the percentage of Americans participating  in  the workforce has  recently fallen to under 64 percent, which  is the lowest number since 1981. The  situation is even bleaker for America’s  youth, who should be at the dawn of  their careers. For people between the  ages of 18 and 29, the unemployment  rate is a shocking 12.5 percent. This is  simply unconscionable.  It is time for Congress and the President to take steps to address both the  high unemployment and unsustainable  debt that  is shackling this country.  The SKILLS Act is an important first  step. This bill streamlines duplicative  Federal programs related to job training, and it reduces bureaucracy so that  more funds and support can go to the  people who need it—and not to Washington bureaucrats.  Specifically,  the  bill  requires  increased coordination among Federal,  State, local, and tribal agencies to ensure that money is well spent, including on the Federal reentry programs  that are focused on helping prisoners  reintegrate back  into  society. Also,  within the Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction, the bill ensures that employment and training services for refugees are provided through the streamlined system set up in the Workforce  Investment Act as opposed to through  several different systems.  I would like to thank the gentleman  from Minnesota again for working with  the Judiciary Committee on these provisions; and I support this commonsense legislation that seeks to solve a  serious problem by making better use  of the limited resources that we have,  an approach that I hope can be applied  more broadly.  I commend the gentlewoman  from  North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) as well as  Chairman KLINEfor their leadership on  this issue, and I urge my colleagues to  support the bill.  ",2013
79,House,113,-0.488,6,2013-03-15,Mr. TIERNEY.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  We could have had a bipartisan bill,  and that seems to be the real shame  here. This has been historically a bill  that has not been hyperpartisan as the  one that’s before us today, the one by  which the parties have generally sat  down together and considered each other’s opinions in order to come to the  best solution, but it didn’t happen.  The underlying bill arbitrarily eliminates and consolidates all  the programs and collapses them into one. It  tries to substitute that, I guess, for an  analysis of what ought to be done. It  relies on the comments of a GAO report that said some of the programs  may have overlapped somewhat, but it  did not reach the conclusion that they  thank  the  genwere duplicative or that they didn’t  serve  necessary  and  unique  populations.  Instead, the majority has seized on  that to collapse all of the programs together and to freeze the funding instead of doing what our bill would do,  which is to provide for data and analysis in consideration of what programs  ought to be sustained; to make them  justify how they’re improving and serving the populations; and to determine  whether  or  not  there  need  to  be  changes or whether some do, in fact,  need to be terminated or consolidated.  That process has been avoided and ignored throughout.  It’s interesting to note that the administration is invoked from time to  time as being opposed not just to this  year’s  version  but  to  last  year’s  version, which was fairly identical and  that it indicates that it doesn’t meet  the administration’s goals set out for  training in this country.  The underlying bill would dissolve  youth training programs.  I’ve heard  comments  about  the  seriousness  of  being involved with youths who are out  of work, but the underlying bill dissolves youth training dedicated funds  and other service delivery priorities,  like to veterans and the disabled. It  also has virtually no support amongst  all of the people who are really involved  in workforce development  in  this country. There was very little, if  any, consideration of their views and  their input into that despite the labor  they put in and the policy decisions  that they help make day in and day  out. The substitute has broad support.  It did go out and listen to the stakeholders on that, and it did get their  opinions and incorporated them, and  that’s why  a  bipartisan  discussion  amongst Members would have benefited the bills on that.  We have better accountability. The  main bill abdicates to the Governors  who have taken Federal policy responsibility here where it’s deserved. There  are many, many, many other reasons  to oppose this bill that we will get into  when we talk about the substitute.  ",2013
80,House,113,0.527,6,2013-03-15,Mr. WALBERG.," I thank the chairman.  Madam  Chair,  our  country’s  job  training program often stands, sadly,  as a barrier between workers and the  employers who want to hire them. In  December 2012, employers reported 3.6  million  job openings all across our  country despite the 12 million Americans searching for work. The challenge  is that today’s job hunters are getting  increasingly frustrated by bureaucratic  inefficiencies in their getting the specific skills they need to fill many of  these jobs.  The SKILLS Act would reform the  Nation’s workforce development system and better equip job seekers with  the  abilities  they need  for  today’s  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:41 Mar 16, 2013 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MR7.008 H15MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2013

82,House,113,0.397,41,2013-03-15,Mrs. NOEM.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding and for his work on this  particular issue.  Madam Chair, we face some specific  challenges in Indian Country in South  Dakota, and this amendment ensures  that 1 percent of the funds within the  Workforce Investment Fund would be  dedicated towards meeting those needs.  Madam Chair, the three most impoverished counties in the Nation are located in South Dakota. Each of these  counties is located on or near reservations, and the poverty rate in these  counties hovers around 50 percent.  Life in Indian Country certainly has  its  challenges, and among  those  is  chronically high unemployment. While  some of our tribes face an unemployment rate of around 10 percent, we  have one of them, the Rosebud Reservation in Todd County, and the Pine  Ridge Reservation in Shannon County,  which  face almost 80 percent unemployment. Again, this  is challenging  for Indian Country and needs to be  dealt with.  It is very clear that we can and must  do better for Indian Country, and making our  job-training programs work  better  through  legislation  like  the  SKILLS Act is an effective way to do  that.  Guaranteeing  the  set-aside  money for Native Americans with this  amendment is going to make sure that  that is available to them.  I’ve  toured Lakota Foods on  the  Lower Brule Reservation where they  make some of the world’s best popcorn.  Lakota Foods has over 12 full-time and  part-time employees right now. With  the right training, they can employ  around 50 people.  Also, there is a similar success story  in Pine Ridge, where Native American  Natural Foods produces Tanka Bars. It  is a healthy snack made out of buffalo  meat and cranberries inspired by traditional Lakota food. Tanka Bars caught  on and are sold in over 3,000 stores now  nationwide. With  the  right  training  and workforce development, they could  expand to over 20 full-time employees.  We need to ensure that tribal businesses like this have an opportunity to  survive, and that’s the type that we  want to have in Indian Country.  I ask for support on this amendment.  ",2013
83,House,113,-0.282,41,2013-03-15,Ms. GABBARD.," Madam  Chair,  I  would like to give thanks to Representatives DONYOUNG, TOMCOLE, and Representative NOEM for offering this very  important  amendment. The Hawaii  Members have had a long relationship  with Alaska on Native issues, and I  look forward to that great relationship  continuing.  This amendment would require that  each State provide exactly 1 percent of  their total allotment for Native grants.  As the bill stands, Native grants are  capped at 1 percent, which could result  in major funding reductions or no funding at all.  b1040  With this amendment, we can ensure  our native populations are guaranteed  at least 1 percent. This is a critical  provision to ensure that our native  populations are not forgotten or left  behind.  In my home State of Hawaii, for example, ALU LIKE is able to take critical workforce  investment  funds and  help Native Hawaiians as well as Alaska Natives and Native American Indians advance their academic or occupational skills and put them on a path to  personal and economic self-sufficiency.

125,,113,-0.565,125,2013-03-15,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to introduce a resolution honoring  Yoani Sa´nchez, a courageous blogger and activist for freedom in Cuba, for her ongoing efforts to challenge political, economic, and social oppression. She has become a prominent  voice through social media for millions of Cubans who reject the oppression of the Castro  regime, having said,  ‘We Cubans don ’t deserve what we are living through. I think Cubans deserve to be citizens of the 21st century, in all senses, to test the challenges of  modernity.’ ’  Yoani Maria Sa´nchez Cordero was born in  Havana, Cuba on September 4, 1975, and  went on to major in Spanish Literature at the  Pedagogical Institute before completing a degree in Hispanic Philology at the University of  Havana  in 2000. While working at Editorial  Gente Nueva, Sa´nchez came to the realization  that, like many Cubans, the wages she earned  legally were not enough to support her family  and highly qualified individuals were unable to  find sufficient work. Disenchanted and seeking  greater economic opportunities, she moved to  Switzerland in 2002 but returned to Cuba in  the summer of 2004, discovering her passion  for computer science.  In 2004, Sa´nchez and a group of like-minded compatriots  founded Consenso, a magazine of reflection and debate, and three years  later she worked as a web master, columnist,  and editor  for  the website Desde Cuba.  In  April 2007, Sa´nchez created the blog known  as ‘ ‘Generation Y,’ ’ which started as an outlet  for self-expression but has since found an audience with half a million people around the  world. Through her weekly blog posts, tweets,  and Facebook updates, made possible thanks  to  the donations of online supporters and  Sa´nchez’s unwavering persistence, she has  provided an unfiltered glimpse into the realities  of day-to-day life in Cuba.  The Castro regime branded Sa´nchez as a  dissident and, since March 2008, blocked access to her blog from within Cuba, where mobile phones,  flash drives, and used  laptop  computers have become  lifelines of communication given economic and government barriers to the internet. Sa´nchez refused to be silenced and continued to write with the help of  friends and volunteer collaborators abroad,  who post her entries  in solidarity and have  translated Generation Y into 20 languages.  Sa´nchez  attempted  to  travel  outside  of  Cuba on 20 occasions, but was repeatedly denied the required exit visa. In January 2013,  the Cuban government lifted travel restrictions  for citizens and  issued Sa´nchez a passport,  allowing her  to embark on an 80-day  international tour, including Brazil, the Czech Republic, Spain, Mexico, and the United States,  to share her experiences living under the Castro regime firsthand. On her first U.S. visit, she  will meet with Members of Congress in Washington, D.C. Following her tour, Sa´nchez intends  to return  to Havana, where she  lives  with her husband Reinaldo and their 20-year-  old son Teo, and dreams of starting an independent news outlet, saying, ‘ ‘Life has taught  me that the wall comes tumbling down only  when you push it.’ ’  Sa´nchez is the recipient of numerous honors and awards for her activism. In 2009, she  became the first blogger to ever interview U.S.  President Barack Obama, who applauded her  efforts to ‘ ‘empower fellow Cubans to express  themselves  through  the use of  technology.’ ’  She has also received the Ortega y Gasset  Award  for Digital Journalism  in 2008, was  named one of Time magazine ’s 100 Most Influential People in the World in the ‘ ‘Heroes  and Pioneers’ ’ category for 2008, been awarded the Maria Moore Cabot Prize from Columbia University  in 2009  for coverage of Latin  America,  and  received  the  International  Woman of Courage Award  from  then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2011.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this  resolution, which  honors  Yoani  Sa´nchez and commends  individuals  like her  who have dedicated  their  lives  to protecting  and strengthening civil rights in the face of adversity. Despite violent attacks and protests  from Castro supporters and leftists, she has  vowed to never stop writing until the people of  Cuba are able to express their views freely. I  join Yoani Sa´nchez and her fellow activists in  looking forward to the day when all Cubans  can freely express themselves in public without fear of reprisal.  f  HONORING JACOB CONNER WILSON  HON.

129,House,113,0.547,3,2013-04-15,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, today is tax day. This year,  millions of Americans spent more time  than ever before preparing their taxes  as a result of ObamaCare’s 21 new tax  increases, which added up to more than  $1 trillion, destroying jobs.  The Tax Code is extremely complex,  with over 4 million words, and is comprised of over 74,000 pages. House Republicans understand that we need to  reform the Tax Code to make it more  fair and simple.  Our budget proposal,  the Path  to  Prosperity,  not  only  repeals  ObamaCare  and  the  job-destroying  taxes associated with it, it also reforms  our Tax Code to encourage new jobs by  small businesses. By simplifying our  Tax Code, closing loopholes, and lowering rates, small businesses will be  able to begin hiring again and increase  wages for American workers.  The Presidential and Senate budget  plans keep ObamaCare taxes in place  and advocate for billions in new taxes.  Raising taxes takes money from small  businesses and destroys jobs.  I encourage the Senate and the President to begin working with House Republicans to clean up the Tax Code,  rather than increasing regulations and  taxes that will destroy jobs.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE  VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTING  (Mr. TIERNEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

Like a snowball rolling down a hill,  the United States Tax Code has grown  and bloated itself over time, resulting  in an avalanche of overregulation coming down on the heads of American taxpayers.  There have been over 4,400 changes to  the Tax Code in the last decade alone.  That averages to more than one per  day. Is it any surprise, then, that the  United States boasts more  tax preparers than we do police officers and  firefighters combined?  We’re facing a four-alarm tax emergency in this country, and the House  Republicans have a plan to address it.  We stand committed to fundamental,  comprehensive tax reform that makes  our Tax Code fairer and simpler for all  Americans, a Tax Code that makes our  corporations more competitive,  that  will stop the hemorrhaging of American jobs overseas and bring jobs back  to our shores.  Tax  reform would  increase  hardworking Americans’ take-home pay so  that they have more money to live on,  instead of the government having more  of their money to spend.  Mr. Speaker, that’s what American  taxpayers deserve.  f  CONGRATULATING HOPWOOD JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ON  ITS  50TH  ANNIVERSARY  (Mr. SABLAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

How long did it take you just to figure  out the complicated tax forms and get  everything together just to file your  returns? It takes the average American  13 hours. Not the best use of your time,  is it? But, then, it’s not hard to imagine when you consider that our Tax  Code contains over 70,000 pages of regulations.  That’s not the tax system that our  fellow Americans deserve. We need a  Tax Code that is fairer and simpler for  everyone—families, students, business  owners, and all hardworking taxpayers.

I hesitate to call what the  event was; but whatever it was, it was  a terrible tragedy. No matter how you  measure it, whether official or unofficial terrorism, anyone who acts in such  a manner is clearly an evil person and  deserves to be called as such.  I know that today the rest of America stands with us, as we have stood  with others before us, hopefully  to  never have to do it again. This event  was not just a Boston event. The Boston Marathon is an international event  that draws people  from around  the  world. I would not be shocked if many  of the people injured today were not  just from Massachusetts. They’re probably from other States and possibly—  probably—other countries.  Today is a holiday in Massachusetts.  It’s a State holiday called Patriots  Day. It’s the day that we celebrate the  actions of our patriots back  in 1776  that  started  the  Revolution  that  brought to birth this country. We remind ourselves regularly what it is to  be an American, what it is to be a patriot, what it is to be a member of a society that cares for each other.  I know that the Members of this  House will join me in wishing well all  those people who were  injured and  sending our deepest condolences and  sympathies to those people who were  killed, as well as wishing well our men  and women of law enforcement. I have  absolutely  full  faith and confidence  that they will find the people that have  done this and bring them to justice so  that we can all rest a little easier at  some point.  The SPEAKER.

137,House,113,0.298,18,2013-04-26,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation to give the Federal Aviation  Administration,  FAA,  and  Department  of  Transportation, DOT, flexibility to use unobligated funds to ensure the safety of our nation’s air transportation system and American  travelers. Specifically I rise to affirm the intent  of this legislation that grants the Secretary of  Transportation  the ability  to use unobligated  balances of the Airport Improvement Program  account to prevent the closure of 149 contract  air traffic control towers and halt the furloughs  of air traffic controllers.  Maintaining service at all contract air traffic  control  towers  is  inherent  to  the authority  given in this legislation to ensure a safe and  efficient air  transportation system. Over  the  past seven weeks, Congress has seen a swell  of reaction to the FAA’s decision to furlough  and lay off hundreds of air traffic controllers  across the country. In my district in New York,  it was announced  that  the  Ithaca Tompkins  Regional  Airport  control  tower would  be  closed. Since  this announcement,  residents,  local businesses, and employees at the airport  have flooded my office with feedback that this  closure will have serious safety and long-term  economic impacts in the region.  Many Members of Congress as well as industry representatives who utilize our nation’s  general aviation system have expressed grave  concerns over the closure of contract towers  and furloughs of air traffic controllers, both of  which contribute  to  the overall safety of our  nation’s air transportation system. The inaction  of the Department of Transportation to request  sequester reprogramming authority and maintain some level of service at all contract towers is unacceptable and has led to the need  for this legislation. The safety and efficiency of  our skies have been put at risk and it has become incumbent upon the Congress to direct  this authority  to  the Secretary of Transportation.  I look forward to working with the FAA and  DOT to ensure that the Ithaca Tompkins control  tower, as well as  the other 148  towers  across the country, remain up and running to  ensure our skies are safe.  ",2013
138,House,113,0.702,18,2013-04-26,Mr. RADEL.," Mr. Speaker,  the President  warned Americans would feel the pain of sequestration. What he failed to mention was his  White House would play politics to guarantee  pain was  felt. House Republicans  told  the  President to prioritize and find places to cut  American families would not feel. He refused.  This is why I am proud to support the Reducing Flight Delays Act, correcting the gross incompetence happening at the White House to  ensure Southwest Floridians see shorter wait  times at airports.  ",2013
139,House,113,-0.478,18,2013-04-26,Ms. WILSON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, while  today’s action to stop FAA furloughs will reduce delays, 149 of the nation’s contract control towers are still at risk of closure on June  15th. These towers are not only essential for  passengers: they’re essential for flight training,  public safety, and small business.  South Florida’s North Perry Airport, which I  represent in Congress, is one of the key pilot  training facilities in the Southeast and an important backstop for the region’s international  airports. Without  further action,  this airport  may be forced to close this summer.  I rise today to affirm that the intent of the  Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 grants  Secretary LaHood the authority to use unobligated balances of  the Airport  Improvement  Program account to prevent the closure of the  149 contract air traffic control towers, including  North  Perry  Airport.  I  call  on  Secretary  LaHood to exercise this option to save these  essential facilities.  Now,  it’s up  to Congress  to pass a comprehensive bill to stop the sequester.  ",2013
140,House,113,-0.428,18,2013-04-26,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  today’s  vote may be  the  first of many  to undo  the  painful and unfair impact of sequestration on  our food safety system, housing services, public schools, Head Start programs, our  transportation programs, and a host of other vital  government services. However, I fear that a  piecemeal approach would represent a continuation of  the  incredibly broken process  in  Washington, DC. Even though I will vote for  today’s measure, it will be an embarrassment  if  this  is  the only action we  take  to reduce  these cuts.  I voted against the Budget Control Act for a  reason;  sequestration was  intended  to be  painful. Picking and choosing programs to restore, instead of reforming our budget overall  and raising revenue, shirks our  fundamental  responsibility as members of Congress. We  must address the big picture: we need to cut  programs that are irrelevant or even harmful,  such as the nuclear arsenal and agricultural  subside. We need new revenues that address  the inequities in the tax code. It will require a  comprehensive approach but will result  in a  sustainable budget future.  By all means protect the vital operation of  the FAA. More  importantly, restore  the hundreds of vital programs crippled by sequestration by replacing them with strategic cuts and  new revenues that will strengthen our economy and county. This should be our number  one priority.  ",2013
141,House,113,-0.187,18,2013-04-26,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  support of legislation to provide the U.S. Secretary of Transportation with  the  flexibility  to  transfer certain funds to prevent reduced operations and staffing of the Federal Aviation Administration. While  it  is  imperative  that  the  U.S. Congress consider and pass legislation  to replace the entirety of the sequester, this  legislation will help ensure the safety and efficiency of our nation’s air  transportation system.  Specifically, I rise to affirm the intent of this  legislation that grants the Secretary of Transportation  the ability  to use unobligated balances of the Airport Improvement Program account to halt the furloughs of air traffic controllers, to maintain the midnight air traffic control  tower shift at airports across the country including Fresno-Yosemite International Airport,  and to prevent the closure of 149 contract air  traffic control towers including Castle Airport’s  contract air  traffic control  tower. Maintaining  service at all contract and non-contract air traffic control  towers  is central  to  the authority  provided in this bill to ensure the safety of our  air transportation system.  Many Members  of Congress  have  expressed concerns over the closure of contract  towers, reduced service at non-contract towers, and furloughs of air traffic controllers, all  of which contribute to the overall safety of our  nation’s air transportation system.

142,House,113,-0.397,25,2013-04-26,Mr. CASTRO of Texas.," Today I’d like  to take a moment to honor the life of  Demetrio P. Rodriguez, a great American we lost earlier this week in my  hometown of San Antonio. Demetrio  passed away at the age of 87 after a  long and rewarding life, a life that literally transformed public education in  Texas and across the Nation.  Demetrio, like many of the folks who  grew up on the west side of San Antonio, was a humble man. Born into a migrant farm-working family, he served  in the Navy and later in the Air Force  Reserve, and he worked for years at  Kelly Air Force Base.  In 1968, with 15 other parents, he led  the charge to change the way we do  school finance, not only in Texas, but  in the United States of America. He objected to the fact that property-poor  districts were so far outspent and given  much more money than property-rich  districts in Texas. He led that charge.  In 1973, the Supreme Court said that  education wasn’t a fundamental right,  but he didn’t give up the fight. And in  1989, the Texas Supreme Court ruled  that the children of Texas should have  an equal education, no matter their income.  He was a great man. He’ll be sorely  missed. He was a fighter and a champion of people.  f  THE SEQUESTER HAS REAL  CONSEQUENCES  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2013
143,House,113,-0.606,25,2013-04-26,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Some of my Republican colleagues were raging that  air traffic was slowed by a so-called political manipulation of the sequester. I  joined most of my House colleagues in  voting to make a special exception for  the FAA because we do want traffic to  flow.  But I have a news flash: cutting billions of dollars from the budget in a sequester in a meat-ax way does have  real consequences.  Furloughs are also occurring at the  Departments  of Defense  and Agriculture, at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Head Start is cutting  70,000 slots  for early childhood education.  In my neighboring  Indiana,  there’s a raffle being held to decide  which children are going to be kicked  out of the Head Start program.  Four million Meals on Wheels are  going to be cut for seniors who are depending on them.  The Medicare Anti-Fraud Division is  being cut. That makes no sense. And  the  sequester  is  projected  to  cost  750,000 American jobs this year.  So, Mr. Speaker, I too ask unanimous  consent to bring H.R. 900 to the floor  that would repeal the sequester.  ",2013
144,House,113,-0.398,32,2013-04-26,Ms. TSONGAS.," Mr. Speaker, on April  15 and in the days after, local, State,  and Federal law enforcement personnel  from across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and nearby States of Rhode  Island and New Hampshire joined in a  weeklong effort to respond to the marathon bombing and assist  in  finding  and capturing the suspects. These dedicated first responders saved hundreds  of lives in the immediate aftermath of  the attack and saved countless more  from the threat of future attacks.  Through unprecedented communication and confident  leadership, public  safety agencies at every level coordinated to bring justice down upon those  responsible. Their actions proved that  no act of terror can blunt the spirit of  resiliency, of  fortitude, of endurance  that is at the heart of the American  people.  As relief and pride wash over the Boston area, we must not forget that there  is still much healing to be done. Our  thoughts and prayers continue to be  with the families of Martin Richard, a  young boy whose big smile we will  never forget and whose sign, ‘‘No more  hurting people. Peace,’’  is a  living  challenge to all of us; Krystle Campbell, a fine young woman who, since  she could, has attended virtually every  marathon day, so emblematic of the  great event that it is for the city of  Boston, but also for the entire Commonwealth and region; Lu Lingzi, a  young student from China, so emblematic of the ways  in which Boston’s  great academic institutions draw people from across the world to share in  the great treasure that we have there,  but also to participate in those great  days that are uniquely American, like  Patriots’ Day; and Officer Sean Collier,  somebody beloved by the student body.  b1430  I had several MIT students in to see  me just a couple of days ago. They said  everybody knew him and everybody  liked him.  And the more than 200 innocent people—a number from my district—who  suffered  severe  injuries  from  this  senseless attack, we want to remember  and encourage all of them as they go  forward.  Jeff Bauman, who suffered tragic loss  of limbs, but who, as he came out of  surgery, was able to help identify the  suspects.  The Corcoran family, a mother and  daughter who are currently sharing a  hospital room together as they begin  the long journey of recovery but who  are already having tremendous assistance.  Lowell  High  School,  where  Krystle is a student, sent prom tickets  to be sure that she would make her  way there. And many amputees, who  have successfully gone on to new lives,  were in the waiting room waiting to  encourage them as they go forward and  to show them what is possible.  Richard Donohue, Jr.,  the MBTA  Transit policeman who rushed to assist, doing his duty critically injured.  Also  from my  district,  Brittany  Loring,  Steven  Byrne,  James  Gauntlett, David Yepez, many members of the White family, the Brassard  family, and Roseann Sdoia; remarkable  people who shared in a tremendous and  troubling moment in our history.  I’d also like to remember some other  specific people who have roots to my  district.  Commissioner  Ed  Davis.  I  have  known Commissioner Davis since his  early days on the beat in my hometown  of Lowell. During a 28-year career at  the Lowell Police Department Davis  worked as a beat cop, a detective, and  a  vice  and narcotics  officer  before  being named chief in 1994.  During his  time  in Lowell, Chief  Davis helped to turn around our city  and set it off into an age of growth. We  were proud of him when he left to become the Boston Police Commissioner,  and we are even more proud of him  now.  Commissioner Davis showed extraordinary  intelligence,  professionalism,  poise  and  confidence  from Monday  through the capture of the suspects on  Friday. He was a calming influence in  a time of great chaos and crisis. He deserves the thanks and gratitude of the  people  of Boston,  of  our Commonwealth, and of our country.  I commend Special Agent in Charge  Richard DesLauriers, who proved himself extremely capable during the entire crisis as he oversaw the massive  operation of identifying and tracking  down the suspects and helped bring the  swift arm of justice down upon those  responsible.  Also, at times of great crisis we look  to our leaders for guidance and confidence. Our  leaders—city, State and  Federal—did not shy away but rather  confronted  the chaos head-on, challenged the evil, and pushed forward so  that we could, together as one community, arrive quickly at healing and justice.  In particular, Mayor Tom Menino.  This mayor came from the hospital to  be involved in the aftermath and suspect search. Seeing him on television  in a wheelchair gave everyone a great  feeling of pride, and we couldn’t help  but notice how deeply he cares for the  city he has so ably overseen for many  years. He embodies the grit and toughness that Boston is known for. He embodies Boston Strong.  Governor Deval Patrick was a true  leader during a  time of  crisis. He  helped oversee the coordination of so  many agencies to ensure optimal collaboration and made sure the public  was up to date and aware of the situation as it developed, as we all watched  moment to moment from our homes or  whatever we might be. He stood with  gravitas  and  a  determined,  strong  composure that trickled down throughout the State public safety agencies.  And we will always appreciate President Barack Obama’s deep involvement  since the start. His words during the  service at the Cathedral of the Holy  Cross were a touching example of our  Nation’s unwavering resolve. As much  as we are Boston Strong, Commonwealth Strong, we are all one and we  are all strong.

145,,113,-0.41,46,2013-04-26,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor of Irene Garas and in recognition of her  centennial birthday on April 29, 2013.  Irene Garas is a truly remarkable woman.  As a Holocaust survivor, she has been a courageous example of perseverance and tenacity. During World War II, Irene, her daughter,  Kathy, and her sister, Margaret, all avoided  capture when  the Nazis occupied Hungary.  Irene escaped the deportation of virtually all  Jewish residents in her community by hiding in  an armoire  in her apartment complex, ultimately obtaining forged papers identifying her  with an alternate surname. She secured papers not only for herself, but also for Kathy  and Margaret, helping them to avoid capture  as well. Irene’s first husband, Louis, was also  incredibly daring, escaping from a labor camp  to avoid deportation to another camp outside  of Hungary in 1945.  After World War II, Irene’s brother, who already  lived  in  the United States, obtained  visas that allowed a number of family members and  friends  to  immigrate.  Irene and  seven other family members and friends left  for America on the SS Washington from England, and arrived in New York City in March  1948. Before World War II, Irene was a well-  respected corsetiere in her Hungarian hometown. When she arrived in the United States,  she used her business skills and  leadership  abilities to open her own store in New York  City—helping her to live the American dream.  Irene  is  cherished by her  two  children,  Kathy and Andrew, her grandchildren —Gary,  Michael, Julie, Lisa and  Ira —and her  five  great-grandchildren: Chase, Alexa, Cydney,  Zoe and Owen.  Like so many  immigrants  throughout our  history, Irene fled from incredible danger and  hardship to seek out liberties that many of us  take  for granted:  the  freedom  to be herself  and the ability to shape her own future. She  is a role model for her community, and as a  fellow New Yorker, it is an honor to acknowledge her during this momentous milestone in  her life.  Mr. Speaker, I join with her family, friends,  and neighbors in celebrating Irene Garas for  her bravery, accomplishments and contributions to our community. I wish her many more  joyous years.  f  98TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  HON. SANDER M. LEVIN  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 26, 2013  ",2013

I want to especially recognize Marine Lance  Cpl. Thomas Parker  of Ronan, Montana.  Lance Cpl.

147,,113,0.596,53,2013-04-26,Mr. ROKITA.," Mr. Speaker, on Saturday,  May 4, 2013,  the Parks Foundation of  the  town of Avon, Indiana, will dedicate the Avon  World War II Memorial Park in honor of our  valiant World War  II veterans. The park  includes a sculpture in the likeness of one of  Avon ’s remaining World War II veterans, Brigadier General Clyde C.  ‘Chet’ ’ Wright, who  exemplifies  the sacrificial service of our veterans.  Brigadier General Wright was born in 1918  in  Indianapolis. He graduated  in 1938  from  Ben Davis High School in Marion County, and  two years later enlisted in the 139th Field Artillery Infantry Division of the Indiana Army National Guard. By December 1943, Chet Wright  was deployed to New Guinea, staging there in  preparation  for some of  the hardest  fought  battles in the South Pacific theater, Leyte and  Luzon. After the war, Chet Wright returned to  the states and to active duty with the Indiana  Army National Guard. He served  in several  leadership positions, and was appointed as  Assistant Adjutant General, Army,  for  the  State of Indiana in March 1973.  In Avon today, all citizens enjoy the manifold blessings of liberty secured by veterans  like Brigadier General Wright. Entrepreneurship is alive and well. Our growing economy  includes world class transportation and logistics-based businesses. We are blessed with  good schools, good government, and natural  and abundant resources, including rich farmland which plays a pivotal role in feeding our  nation and world.  It is my sincere hope that this memorial will  properly honor the bravery and sacrificial service of our World War II veterans. May it serve  as a daily reminder to all who pass it of the  sacrifice that was required to secure this experiment  in  freedom known  throughout  the  world as America, the land of liberty. May it  fortify the resolve of this current generation to  be vigilant in our sacred duty to preserve and  protect  it at all costs. May God bless our  World War II veterans, may God bless Avon,  Indiana, for its efforts to honor these heroes,  and may God continue  to bless  the United  States of America.  f  IN HONOR OF GERARD BELCHER  HON.

148,,113,-0.576,60,2013-04-26,Ms. BASS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Health IT Modernization for Underserved Communities Act, legislation that would  amend the Health Information Technology for  Economic and Clinical Health (HI TECH) Act  to extend Electronic Health Record  (EHR)  Medicaid incentive payments to all physician  assistants  (PAs) whose patient volume  includes at least 30 percent Medicaid and other  financially needy beneficiaries.  The HITECH Act currently offers the incentive payments to physicians and nurse practitioners who provide primary care to the requisite 30 percent threshold of Medicaid recipients, but limits the EHR incentive payments to  care provided by PAs in ‘ ‘PA-led ’ ’ rural health  clinics and federally qualified health centers.  Enhanced, quality patient care is the goal of  electronic health records, and patients are the  ultimate beneficiaries of  this  legislation. The  current HITECH  limitation on Medicaid EHR  limits  the development of EHR systems  for  Medicaid beneficiaries who are  served by  PAs. This  legislation extends additional support  to community health centers and other  medical practices in which PAs provide care to  a high volume of Medicaid patients.  I have firsthand knowledge of the key role of  the Physician Assistant profession and  the  role the profession serves in bringing primary  medical care to rural and other medically underserved communities. Before I was elected  to the U.S. House of Representatives and before I served in the California Assembly, I was  a Physician Assistant, and I know that the PA  profession  adds  tremendous  value  to  our  health care system. PAs provide quality, team-  based, patient-centered medical care and extend  the  reach of medicine  throughout  the  U.S. It is a cost-efficient approach to providing  needed medical care.  There are over 90,000 practicing PAs in the  U.S. today. PAs are one of three health care  professionals providing primary medical care  in the U.S. Although PAs practice in virtually  all medical specialties, primary care  is  the  largest area of specialty practice for PAs.  The PA profession  is uniquely  flexible  in  adapting  and  responding  to  the  evolving  needs of the U.S. health care system by virtue  of comprehensive educational programs  that  prepare PAs for a career in general medicine  and a team-based approach to providing patient-centered medical care.  I am pleased to introduce this important legislation and ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Health IT Modernization for Underserved Communities Act.  f  COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF  CALIFORNIA’S HELEN L. DOHERTY  HON. GLORIA NEGRETE McLEOD  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 26, 2013  Mrs. NEGRETE MCLEOD. Mr. Speaker,  I  submit  the commemoration of  the  life of a  great American and dear friend of mine, Ms.  Helen L. Doherty, who passed away April 11,  2013.  Helen was a proud member and tireless advocate of the Cherokee Nation and she was a  teacher who worked  throughout her professional career  for children of all ages. She  wrote numerous successful grants  for education and founded the Kudos for Kids Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to  the needs of children. She gained the support  of many  teachers, students and parents  for  her work with youth in after-school programs.  As she continued her work with students even  after her retirement.  I knew Helen for many years and during my  legislative career, her counsel and wisdom  have been invaluable to me. She will be sorely  missed by all her friends, loved ones, and her  community.  Additionally, the Native American community  has lost an unparalleled leader who was constantly engaged in the defense of their heritage and quality of life. We can rest assured  her dedication and love for America will continue in the many lives she touched.  f  IN HONOR OF PASTOR LORENZO L.  HEARD  HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

149,,113,-0.281,60,2013-04-26,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to an outstanding Man of  God, Pastor Lorenzo L. Heard,  for  twenty  years of dedicated civic leadership and pastoral service to the Albany, Georgia community. Pastor Heard will celebrate his twentieth  anniversary as  the distinguished pastor of  Greater Second Mount Olive Baptist Church  with an anniversary celebration  that will be  held on Friday, April 26, 2013 at 7:00 p.m. on  the campus of Albany State University in Albany, Georgia.  A Georgia man through and through, Pastor  Heard is a native of Leesburg, Georgia and a  1981 graduate of Lee County High School. He  attended  Fort  Valley  State College,  now  known as Fort Valley State University and  transferred  to Morehouse College  in Atlanta  after two years. He earned a Bachelor’s Degree  in Business Management  from Albany  State University.  Pastor Heard began preaching the Word of  the Lord at the young age of seventeen. Just  three years later, he began his first pastorate  at Macedonia Baptist Church  in Patterson,  Georgia before becoming the pastor of Saint  Galilee Baptist Church in Sparta, Georgia in  1987. In 1993, he became pastor of the Greater 2nd Mt. Olive Baptist Church, where he has  been called to lead for the past twenty years.  Under Pastor Heard’s leadership, more than  2,500 people have joined the congregation of  Greater 2nd Mt. Olive Baptist Church. A dynamic and ever faithful pastor, he has taught,  mentored, and ministered to every soul who  has walked through the doors of the church.  Pastor Heard goes a step further by teaching  people life skills such as how to manage their  finances, and encourages everyone  to become active in civic and political engagement  to better the community.  Always pressing  towards  the mark  for  the  prize of  the high calling of God  in Christ  Jesus, to better improve the craft of Christian  ministry and discipleship, Pastor Heard has  led the church in building a strong outreach  program  for  the East Albany  community,  touching and changing many lives for the better.  Pastor Lorenzo has been  repeatedly acknowledged for his outstanding achievements,  service and public distinction. He has authored  two books, Stuck in a Storm and Missing Your  Calm: Discovering God’s Purpose  for Your  Life and Lessons in Money Management.  Pastor Heard has achieved numerous successes in his life, but none of this would have  been possible without the grace of God and  his loving wife, Leslie Parrish Heard, and family.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today in paying tribute to Pastor Lorenzo L.  Heard for his life of selfless service to God,  the church and to humankind.  f  WILSON  ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL  ACHIEVES  THE  STATUS  OF A  GREAT  EXPECTATIONS MODEL  SCHOOL  HON.

150,,113,0.602,60,2013-04-26,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, I am proud  to congratulate Wilson Elementary School of  the Coppell  Independent School District  in  Coppell, Texas  for earning  the distinction of  Great Expectations Model School on March  26, 2013.  Great Expectations is a professional development model organization  for educators.  In  order to earn Model School status, ninety to  one hundred percent of  the  teachers must  successfully  implement one hundred percent  of Great Expectations’ seventeen classroom  practices. The classroom practices are designed to achieve the Great Expectations mission to motivate, inspire, and challenge individuals to achieve excellence in learning and  living.  Wilson Elementary achieved Model School  status within one school year. The elementary  school was committed to adopting the model  in an expeditious fashion to enhance the quality of learning for its students. In June, 2012,  the educators were trained by the Great Expectations  Institute.  In September of 2012,  Principal Chris Nester submitted  the paper  work to apply as a Model School and a representative from Great Expectations visited the  campus for review. Meanwhile, throughout the  school  year,  the  staff  attended  numerous  meetings with the Great Expectations development team, which helped achieve the ranking.  Additionally, the Wilson students worked diligently to follow the principles and expectations  of the program.  Wilson Elementary is one of only five Model  Schools in the entire state of Texas and it is  the first in North Texas. Wilson has become a  leader in the area, and it is a role model for  other campuses to implement Great Expectations in the years to come.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 24th Congressional District of Texas,  I ask all my distinguished colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Wilson Elementary School on its accomplishment as a Great Expectations Model  School.

For almost two decades, the South Florida  After-School All-Stars has provided year-round  programs to at-risk youth in successful efforts  to better steer and empower our young people. This organization started as a summer  camp servicing less than 50 students in 1997,  and has since grown  into a  full-service program  reaching over 4,000 students a year.  With programs in fields ranging from health to  scholastic achievement, this organization has  managed  to engage young people with  increasingly varied  interests and continues  to  reach them in meaningful ways.  The South Florida After-School All-Stars  serves as an exemplar organization for youth  engagement, and has undoubtedly earned our  community’s admiration,  respect, and gratitude.  f  RECOGNIZING MAY AS DIRECT DEPOSIT  AND  DIRECT  PAYMENT  VIA ACH MONTH  HON.

The House and Senate acted on two competing proposals last month, but these plans  have  languished  because  the Republican  Leadership  refuses  to  appoint  conferees.  Why? Perhaps consensus would have to be  reached.  Back in the real world, $85 billion in indiscriminate cuts from sequestration continue to  take their toll on our national security, health,  and economic growth.  The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects 750,000 jobs will be lost from sequestration in this year alone.

154,House,113,0.601,2,2013-05-14,Mr. BROOKS of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker, today I applaud the Alabama Legislature’s Scottsboro Boys Act, which  granted posthumous pardons to eight  African American young men wrongfully accused in Alabama in 1931. The  Scottsboro Boys case profoundly impacted America’s civil  rights movement and American law.  In two different landmark decisions,  the United States Supreme Court ruled  that  the Constitution  requires  legal  counsel  for criminal defendants and  held that arbitrarily excluding African  Americans from jury pools was unconstitutional.  It is never too late to call wrong by  its name. As Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., wrote  in his  ‘‘Letter  from Birmingham Jail’’:  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere.  I pray  that  the  families of Olen  Montgomery, Haywood Patterson, Ozie  Powell,  Willie  Roberson,  Charlie  Weems, Eugene Williams, and Andy  and Roy Wright may take comfort in  Alabama’s full acknowledgement of the  innocence of these wrongfully accused  young men.  f  OBAMACARE’S THREAT  (Mr. MULLIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

156,House,113,-0.368,9,2013-05-14,Ms. HANABUSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like  to thank Chairman MILLERand Ranking Member BRADY for allowing this  bill to be heard on the floor today.  As was stated, the Senate Concurrent  Resolution  10 would  permit use  of  Emancipation Hall to allow us to celebrate King Kamehameha and the lei-  draping ceremony.  King Kamehameha has a unique history; and, as you know, Hawaii is the  only kingdom  that  is  part  of  the  United States. This is going to be the  44th time such a celebration has taken  place in the United States Capitol.  June 11 is a State holiday in Hawaii,  a day of celebration honoring King Kamehameha. He was believed to have  been born around 1758 and is credited  with unifying the major islands by the  year 1810. By uniting the Hawaiian Islands, King Kamehameha secured Hawaii’s future as a viable and recognized  political entity.  King Kamehameha was the first in a  long  line of Hawaiian—what we call  ‘‘ali’i,’’ which is our royalty—who held  the needs and well-being of their people  as  their  foremost  priority.  Kamehameha’s  legacy  and  commitment  to Hawaii’s people  is evident  today through organizations created by  his prodigy, like Kamehameha Schools,  the  Queen  Lili’uokalani  Children’s  Trust, Lunalilo Home, and the Queen’s  Hospital. These organizations are the  bedrock foundations in Hawaii and provide crucial services to native Hawaiians while ensuring the maintenance of  our State’s uniquely Hawaiian  identity.  The Hawaiian lei that we’ll be draping is a special bond, or relationship,  between two people that is figuratively  represented by the stringing of flowers  together in a circle. The Kamehameha  lei-draping ceremony emphasizes the  strong bond Hawaii’s people have with  each other and our State’s rich history.  Honoring King Kamehameha in this  lei-draping ceremony acknowledges our  deep appreciation for his sacrifice and  success  in unifying our  island home  and reaffirms our connections with one  another and the responsibility we all  share to care for one another.  The significance of holding this ceremony  in  the Capitol of  the United  States cannot be overemphasized as it  demonstrates to the Nation and the  world that the rights and needs of the  people should always be at the heart of  the work that we do here. This is the  legacy of King Kamehameha and his  prodigy, and we should honor that by  approving this event.  The celebration of King Kamehameha  has been honored for over 140 years in  Hawaii. It was first recognized in 1871,  when Hawaii was still a kingdom, by  Kamehameha V, his great-grandson. It  was the first holiday proclaimed by the  Governor and legislature when Hawaii  became a State in 1959.  The statue of King Kamehameha and  the traditional lei draping is over 100  years old itself. In Hawaii, the lei-draping ceremony is celebrated as a 2-day  festivity in tribute to the great King.  We celebrate  it with parades, hula,  music, chanting, storytelling, and arts.  It is the way for Hawaiians to celebrate  our history.  The  American  sculptor,  Thomas  Gould, was commissioned by the Kingdom of Hawaii to create the statue. It  was sculpted in 1879 from his studio in  Rome. It was completed in 1880, but the  ship that was transporting the original  from Germany sank. In 1883, the second  statue made its way to Hawaii. The  first statue was ultimately recovered  and erected on North Kohala on the  Big  Island, and that  is where King  Kamehameha’s birthplace is.  The statue stands 81⁄2 feet tall with  the King in his royal clothing. In it,  King Kamehameha wears a mahiole,  which is the helmet, and the ’ahu ’ula,  which is the cloak. They are finished  with gold leaf, reminiscent of the rare  yellow feathers from the mamo bird  the King wore. The spear in his left  hand is the symbol of his kingdom and  the fact that he is willing to defend it  himself, and his right hand is extended  towards the direction of the Hawaiian  Islands.  The statue in Emancipation Hall in  the Capitol Visitor Center is a mold of  the second statue which stands in front  of our Ali’iolani Hale, the home of the  Hawaii Supreme Court. This was dedicated as a gift to the National Statuary Hall from Hawaii in the year 1969.  As everyone knows, President Obama  was born in Hawaii. And on June 20,  2010, President Obama issued Proclamation 8534 in honor of the bicentennial of the unification of Hawaii.  President Obama said:  On this bicentennial King Kamehameha  Day, we celebrate the history and the heritage of the Aloha State, which has immeasurably enriched our national life and culture. The Hawaiian narrative is one of both  profound triumph and, sadly, deep injustice.  It is the story of native Hawaiians oppressed  by crippling disease, aborted treaties and the  eventual conquest of their sovereign kingdom. These grim milestones remind us of an  unjust time in our history, as well as the  many pitfalls in our Nation’s long and difficult journey to perfect itself. Yet through  the peaks and valleys of our American story,  Hawaii’s steadfast sense of community and  mutual support shows the progress that results when we are united in the spirit of limitless possibility.  Mr. Speaker, that is what this celebration means to us. It is a symbol of  how the Hawaiian people have the spirit of limitless possibility.  With that, Mr. Speaker,  I yield 5  minutes to the gentlelady from Hawaii  (Ms. GABBARD).  b1740  ",2013

I would next like to yield to my good  friend, the gentleman from New York,  Representative COLLINS.  ",2013
158,House,113,0.366,16,2013-05-14,Mr. COLLINS of New York.," I want to  thank the gentleman for holding this  special session tonight.  Mr. Speaker, the American public is  often concerned there  is not enough  agreement  in the Halls of Congress.  Well, I am pleased to report there is  growing agreement among both parties  and in both Houses of this Congress  that ObamaCare is truly a train wreck,  as recently described by Democrat Senator MAX BAUCUS. As  this massive  piece of  legislation  is being  implemented, the negative impact it is and  will have on our economy is becoming  clear:  ObamaCare  guts  the  funding  for  Medicare Advantage to help cover its  growing price tag. So, for all those seniors out  there,  like my  86-year-old  mom, who are happy with the coverage  they receive through Medicare Advantage, I have news for you: you can’t  keep your existing plan, as promised,  because ObamaCare effectively ends it.  What the administration could not  raid  from other  sources  to pay  for  ObamaCare it makes up in new taxes.  Just  last week, as chairman of the  Small  Business  Subcommittee  on  Health and Technology, I heard from  small business owners and advocates  about the impact the health insurance  tax will have on the bottom line of  America’s  small  businesses.  The  amount of that tax will be $8 billion in  2014, increasing to $14.3 billion in 2018,  and will  increase based on premium  trends thereafter.  Supporters of ObamaCare will  say  these fees are supposed to be paid by  the health  insurance companies; but  common sense, substantiated by independent studies, tells you the insurance companies are passing these costs  directly on to consumers in the form of  higher premiums. To avoid the taxes  and fees, companies are cutting jobs,  not hiring, and are reducing employee  hours to stay under ObamaCare thresholds, all this at a time when national  unemployment  remains  embarrassingly high.  ObamaCare is built on the premise  that the young and the healthy will  pay to  insure the old and the sick.  Well, guess what? The young and the  healthy are too smart to have their  pockets picked. Knowing they can’t be  denied coverage down the road, the  young and the healthy are going to  drop out of the insurance market and  instead pay the $95 penalty and their  out-of-pocket medical expenses. They  know this approach will be  far,  far  cheaper in the end than paying thousands of dollars for an individual or a  family plan under ObamaCare. It’s like  not buying collision insurance on your  new car because you know you can get  it after you’ve been in a wreck.  When  attempting  to  defend  ObamaCare, its supporters like to tout  all those ‘‘free’’ things that ObamaCare  offers the American people. That sales  pitch crystallizes what is wrong with  ObamaCare and the tax-and-spend policies this town is famous for. Nothing is  free in this world. For every free service ObamaCare  offers,  someone  out  there in America is paying for it with  his hard-earned money; or, worse yet,  we’ll just add a few more bucks onto  our staggering debt to cover this so-  called ‘‘free’’ service.  This country can’t afford ObamaCare  figuratively or  literally. ObamaCare  must be repealed. It needs to be replaced with commonsense, cost-effective ways to improve health care in  this country.  ",2013
159,House,113,0.376,16,2013-05-14,Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.," Thank you  to the gentleman from Indiana for organizing this.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 45, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  ObamaCare is bad for the young and  for the elderly.  I recently received a letter from a  high school senior in my district. She  noted that her family’s out-of-pocket  premium costs have risen $7,000 in recent years while their deductible has  increased tenfold. She said she is worried about how she is going to pay for  health care on her own in the future.  She is right to worry. According to a  study published by the American Academy of Actuaries’ magazine, 80 percent  of Americans under the age of 30 will  because  of  increases  face  premium  ObamaCare.  The costs of ObamaCare are more  than monetary. Americans will also  have fewer health care choices because  of  it. Specifically,  the  Independent  Payment Advisory Board will threaten  the options available today to Medicare recipients. This board of 15 officials will get to choose which treatments and which procedures Medicare  will reimburse and which it will not.  What a doctor prescribes or what a patient needs will come second, if at all.  The IPAB is unelected and won’t report  to Members of Congress or  to any  elected official. The budget  for this  board is given directly by the executive  branch. IPAB doesn’t even have to justify its finances to the public.  My friends on the other side of the  aisle like to say Republicans want to  change Medicare as we know it; but, in  fact, it is ObamaCare that is changing  Medicare,  putting  bureaucrats  in  charge of decisions that should be between senior citizens and their doctors.  Repealing ObamaCare will right this  wrong for the young and for our seniors. I urge the adoption of this important bill.  ",2013
160,House,113,0.703,16,2013-05-14,Mr. YOHO.," I would like to thank my  colleague from Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in  support of H.R. 45, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  It’s not just the House Republicans  who want this or House freshmen who  want to repeal this law; it’s the American people. The American people don’t  like this. The people of my district  overwhelmingly desire  the  repeal of  this legislative debacle.  Let’s face it: in March of 2009, with a  Democratic Congress,  this  bill was  passed through in the twilight hours.  The Speaker said—and I think we all  remember those infamous words—that  we have to pass it to see what’s in it,  that we have to pass it to see how it’s  going to work.  America deserves better. Americans  deserve better, and they demand better.  The Affordable Care Act is the number one  job-killing bill  in America.  When the President speaks of job creation and of stimulating the economy,  the 800-pound gorilla in the room that  nobody talks about is the Affordable  Care Act. It’s the number one job-killing bill—bar none. Here are a couple of  examples:  I had a person call in today. A young  lady, one of my constituents, said that  even though she doesn’t have  insurance, it’s because she doesn’t have a  job; and the reason she doesn’t have a  job is due to this bill.

163,Senate,113,-0.232,37,2013-05-14,Mr. KAINE.," Madam President, I rise  today to talk about the continuing efforts by a minority of this body to  block a Federal budget by blocking a  conference with the House to find compromise. I spoke about this one week  ago, but the stalemate continues.  Today there was an announcement  that in my Commonwealth, 90,000 civilian Department of Defense employees  and hundreds of thousands of DOD civilians nationally will be  furloughed  for 11 days between now and the end of  the  year. This  furlough  announcement—along with ample other evidence  we have discussed in this body in the  last  few  weeks—demonstrates  that  budgetary gridlock, budgetary indecision, and budgetary stalling has real-  life consequences.  I  rise  to  implore my Senate colleagues to do what is right and to do  the job the American public has sent us  here to do. This is not only about budgets, it is also about something even  bigger than budgets. It is about something fundamental to the entire system  of government we have; that is, the  willingness to work together to find  common ground and find solutions.  I truly view this budgetary stalemate  as an attack on compromise. We cannot survive as a Senate or as a Congress or as a nation without finding  common ground.  I know the Presiding Officer, like me,  was out on the campaign trail a lot in  2012. I heard a repeated critique of this  body during the campaign. I heard that  this body was unable  to produce a  budget since 2009. There were some arguments back and forth about whether  that was technically accurate. As  I  looked at it as a candidate, it was at  least clear that a normal budgetary  order in accordance with the Budget  Act of 1974 had not been followed for a  number of years.  As a candidate and citizen of the  Commonwealth and country, I said: If I  have the opportunity to serve in this  body, I am going to work with my colleagues to make sure we do the public’s  business  in  the way  that was contemplated in that statute.  Although I didn’t ask, I was assigned  to be on the Senate Budget Committee  as soon as I got to this body. I immediately made clear—along with many  other Members, both newcomers and  Members who had been on the committee for a while, including the new  committee chair, Senator MURRAY—  that this body needed to return to normal budgetary procedures.  It seemed as though over the past few  years, Congress tried a  lot of other  things—supercommittees,  sequesters,  and  continuing  resolutions—none  of  which were working to do the Nation’s  fiscal business. Along with many Senators of both parties, I said the right  strategy for us is to return to normal  budgetary procedure. We can make it  work just as Congresses in the past  have made it work.  I entered the body on January 3—  more than 4 months ago—with the profound belief that we needed to embrace  the normal procedures about doing a  budget. Those normal procedures are  known to all. People read in textbooks  about how bills become laws. Essentially, in the spring the Senate and  House, under normal procedure, would  each pass a budget. Those budget bills  would likely be significantly different.  Even when the parties controlling  the two Houses are the same, the two  House budgets are different. There is  then some effort to find a compromise  between  the  two  differing  versions  often through use of a conference committee. Once that compromise is found,  then that compromise is sent back to  each House for a vote, and it then becomes the guidance that is used by the  Appropriations Committee to write the  bill’s appropriating dollars for the next  fiscal year. That is the normal process,  and it is the way Congress has operated  under both parties, under split Houses  for many years.  Here is the good news: The Senate  Budget Committee embraced this challenge. Chairman MURRAYworked with  staff and members of the committee to  create a draft budget, and then early in  mid-March we had robust committee  hearings, a  full debate, and a  full  amendment process about a Senate  budget.  In March the committee ultimately  considered the chairman’s mark for 13  hours, and we had a full amendment  process. We voted on over 30 amendments,  the majority of which were  made by Republican members of the  committee. We debated and voted on  those amendments.  I  sat  there and  voted for a number of the Republican  amendments to the budget that then  became part of the ultimate committee  product.  Republican members offered numerous amendments.  In response to an  amendment offered by a Republican  member,  I  remember my  colleague  from Maine, Senator KING, asking: If I  vote  for your amendment, are you  going to vote for this committee budget? The answer was given in public.  The answer was: No. I want you to  vote for my amendment, but I am still  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:55 May 15, 2013 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14MY6.012 S14MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2013

The State of Maine has long benefited from  Laird’s tenure in the health care field. In addition to serving as President of CMMC since  July 2008, Laird has also helped direct  the  center as Chief Operating Officer and Vice  President  for Medical  Affairs. Outside  of  CMMC, he spent 3 years serving as Chief Executive  Officer  at  Bridgton  Hospital  in  Bridgton, Maine and was Vice President at  North Country Hospital in Newport, Vermont.  Few people can claim to embody the spirit  of compassion and community engagement as  completely as Laird. He is a proud and active  member  of  the  Lewiston  Auburn  Future  Forum, which has been a driving force behind  community efforts to make Lewiston and Auburn a better place to live. He has also served  as Chairman of the Board at the Androscoggin  Home Care and Hospice  (AHCH) and as  President of the Board at Camp Sunshine, an  institution  for  families of children with  life-  threatening diseases in Casco, Maine.  In 2011,  I was proud  to  join Laird  in announcing CMMC’s collaboration with Maine  Research Associates on a new medical  research expansion project. The study, which focuses on treatments for conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,  has enabled hundreds of patients in Maine to  access cutting-edge medicines. It also helped  draw national attention to the important work  being done in Maine to help solve some of our  nation’s most persistent health  challenges.  This project would not have been able  to  move forward so successfully without Laird’s  leadership.  Mr. Speaker, please join me again in congratulating Mr. Laird Covey on an exceptional  career in the field of public health.  f  RECOGNIZING TOM ULBRICH  HON.

166,,113,-0.345,79,2013-05-14,Mr. HIGGINS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize Tom Ulbrich as he is awarded the  2013 Small Business Advocate of  the Year  Award by  the Amherst Chamber of Commerce.  Few have been so generous with their time  and  talents as Tom Ulbrich. As one of our  community’s most passionate advocates  for  small business, and a business owner himself,  Tom intimately understands the incredible significance of entrepreneurship to the economy  and culture of the United States of America.  Tom has selflessly dedicated his personal  and professional work to small business advocacy. Tom is a member of the National Federation for Independent Business’s New York  State Leadership team, and a frequent author  and orator on  topics concerning  the  importance of small business and entrepreneurship  to the vitality of the American economy.  A testament to Tom’s insights is his recent  TED talk, ‘ ‘Is There a Better Way? ’ ’ which explores  the necessity of developing entrepreneurial skills and spirit  in students  from a  young age.  In a world where modern  technology and unprecedented access to information have rendered entrepreneurial skills essential, Tom ’s keen business sense and inimitable knowledge are invaluable.  Currently, Tom serves as the Executive Director of  the University at Buffalo School of  Management’s  Center  for  Entrepreneurial  Leadership. Since assuming the role in 2008,  Tom has worked  tirelessly  to advance  the  Center ’s mission of  invigorating  the Western  New York economy and community  through  entrepreneurial development. Under Tom’s direction, the Center has expanded its sophisticated  interdisciplinary approach  to educating  emerging business leaders.  Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to  recognize Tom Ulbrich, a  true champion  for  the American economy.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOHN OSCAR  BOONE, SR.  HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.

168,,113,-0.283,79,2013-05-14,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  to honor Reverend Dr. Samuel Berry  McKinney for his more than 55 years of service and leadership building Mount Zion Baptist  Church and the community of Seattle, Washington.  Rev. McKinney moved to Seattle in 1958 to  lead one of Seattle’s oldest and most prominent Black churches. During his time as Senior Pastor, he mentored over 40 ministers and  lectured throughout the nation. With an eye toward the future, Rev. McKinney also oversaw  the building of  the church’s educational unit  and encouraged economic development in the  church and the community.  Rev. McKinney grew up in Cleveland, Ohio  in the 1920s and 1930s as the son of a prominent and politically engaged African-American  minister. He  attended Morehouse College,  where he was a classmate of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. He also served as a minister in  Providence, Rhode Island in the mid-1950s.  When Rev. McKinney arrived in Seattle, he  quickly became a leader in the movement for  human rights, which included playing a major  role  in  the Central Area Civil Rights Committee. Always committed to social justice, he  was a  founding member of  the Seattle Civil  Rights Commission and he facilitated the only  visit of the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  to Seattle.  In addition, Rev. McKinney was a founder of  Liberty Bank, the first African-American-owned  bank in Seattle and was the first African-American President of the Church Council of Greater Seattle. He has served on the board of the  Meredith Mathews East Madison YMCA, the  Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,  and the Washington Mutual Savings Bank.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I recognize the work Reverend Dr. Samuel McKinney has done for his church and the community.

169,,113,-0.429,86,2013-05-14,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of the Fifth Congressional District of Florida and myself, I rise now  to offer a tribute to the career and success of  my friend, Dr. Stanley H. Stone, who served  as  the Vice President of Human Resources  and Diversity for Valencia College in Orlando,  FL  for  the past  ten years. A visionary and  scholar Dr. Stanley H. Stone is a true leader  of  the Central Florida Community and  the  great State of Florida.  We exalt Dr. Stone for his accomplishments  while the legacy honoring the man, husband,  father, and a community  leader who  is beloved by many in the Central Florida area. A  man dedicated to education and committed to  achieving  athletic  excellence,  Dr.  Stone  earned a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in Political  Science  in 1974  from Howard University  in  Washington, District of Columbia while on a  track athletic scholarship. During his tenure at  Howard, he was acknowledged as a College  All-American  in Track and Field. This prestigious honor catapulted him toward his aspirations of representing the United States in the  Olympics after winning several sprinting competitions. Continuing his pursuit of academic  scholarship, Dr. Stone was awarded his Juris  Doctorate degree in 1977 from Howard University.  Upon relocating to the State of Florida, Dr.  Stone began his professional career as a staff  attorney  for Central Florida Legal Services,  Inc. In 1979, Dr. Stone’s call to service lead  him to the classrooms of Seminole Community  College in Sanford, FL and Valencia Community in Orlando, FL as an adjunct professor,  where he taught both business and law classes at each  respective  institution. Within  the  year, Dr. Stone became the Program Director  of  the Paralegal Program at Valencia. Progressing forward, he became the Dean of the  Business and Public Services department and  served in this capacity for 10 years. Because  of his exceptional work ethic, management  skills, and business savvy, Dr. Stone was promoted  to Provost of Valencia College, East  Campus in 1994 and remained in this position  until 2003. It was during his tenure as Provost  that  the East Campus experienced extraordinary growth in student enrollment, increased  number of grants awarded to faculty and staff,  and the expansion of buildings and facilities.  Subsequeetly, by the end of his term, the East  Campus  bolstered  an  enrollment  of  over  17,000 students per semester, greatly exceeding that of the other three respective Valencia  Community College campuses. Also as campus Provost, Dr. Stone served as the Chair of  the college-wide Equal Access/Equal Opportunity  Committee,  responsible  for  recommending college policies and procedures  for  contlucting employment discrimination  investigations, sexual harassment complaints, and  provided guidance to administrators on college  recruiting and hiring practices. As a result of  being an advocate for students, Dr. Stone was  awarded an honorary membership into the Phi  Theta Kappa Society.  In recognition of exemplifying phenomenal  leadership, Valencia ’s President, Dr. Sanford  Shugart, promoted Dr. Stone to the position of  Vice-President of Human Resources and Diversity division in 2003. Dr. Stone is the first  to hold this position and was the only African  American  on  the  president’s  cabinet. He  served as the president’s liaison to the College’s Black Advisory Committee. Dr. Stone  holds memberships in the American Association of  the Community Colleges,  the Florida  Association of Community Colleges and  the  College and University Public Administrators  organization.  As a community leader Dr. Stanley H. Stone  efforts are unrivaled. He has served on numerous  boards,  commissions  and  panels  throughout the Central Florida area. In September, 2006, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer appointed Dr. Stone as Chair of  the Mayor’s  Safe Orlando Task Force his unprecedented  recommendations to resolve law enforcement  issues and  reduce crime were unanimously  accepted  recommendations  for  implementation.  In addition, Dr. Stone serves on  the  Board of Directors  for  the African American  Chamber of Commerce,  the Central Florida  Urban League, 100 Black Men organization  and Boys and Girls Club. Dr. Stone reached  the pinnacle of his volunteerism and philanthropic efforts by being recognized by several  organizations  such as  the Orange County  Black History Committee who  named Dr.  Stone, Educator of  the Year  in 2006; The  Links, Incorporated in 2009; and he was most  recently recognized by Zeta Phi Beta Sorority,  Incorporated as a Blue Indigo award recipient.  Though Dr. Stone H. Stone is a celebrated  educator and exemplary community  leader,  the title that suits him best that which he is  most proud of is father. Dr. Stone enjoys leisure time with his son, Terrance, and his loving wife, Barbara.  In memory of  their most  cherished and  treasured daughter Shannon,  who transitioned in 2007, Dr. and Mrs. Stone  established a  foundation  through which several students have been granted scholarships  and book awards. A devoted and active member of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church  in  Oviedo, Florida, Dr. Stone is a man of great  faith. Through his  faith he has persevered  from his childhood in the inner city to his stellar achievements as a community servant. Always remembering to reach back, Dr. Stone’s  commitment and dedication to our youth has  provided young people with the opportunities  that were not so easily afforded to him.  We pay tribute to a man of God Dr. Stanley  H. Stone, as a humanitarian, man, husband,  father, educator, and  community  leader  in  Central Florida whose life work and achievements symbolize compassion, thoughtfulness,  patience, wisdom, confidence and faith.

170,House,113,-0.465,4,2013-05-23,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  On July 1, interest rates on federally  subsidized Stafford student loans will  double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.  At a time, as everybody said this morning, when job prospects for students remain  few and  far between, we must  not—or should not—let student  loan  interest rates rise.  That is why it’s so disappointing that  instead of helping the college students,  the majority  is doing  ‘‘go-nowhere’’  legislation—because  the Senate will  not take this up—that would actually  increase  loan costs  for the Nation’s  students.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a student  who borrows the maximum subsidized  Stafford loans for each of the next 4  years would actually pay $1,056 more  under the majority’s plan than they  would if Congress failed to act and interest rates doubled. That’s a rather  sobering idea.  This is just the latest example of putting  politics  and  special  interests  ahead of the American people. As we  speak, the majority  is preventing a  budget  from  being  finalized  even  though they have been calling for a  budget for years.  Currently, both the House and the  Senate have passed the budget resolutions, which means the only step left—  and everybody who knows how a bill is  passed knows this—the only step left is  to organize a conference committee to  finalize the conference report; yet the  majority of the House refuses to appoint  conferees and begin  the  conference process.  Now, why is the majority suddenly  abandoning their quest to produce a  budget? Is it because their desire for a  budget is nothing more than to make  political points?  It is clear the majority is consistently choosing to put political interests before the welfare of the Nation,  even  if  it means that the American  people will and are suffering. This obstructionism must come to an end.  I urge my colleagues, once again, to  reject today’s rule and the underlying  legislation that will never go past the  House so that we can get busy solving  the American student loan debt crisis  in a bipartisan way. Let’s protect our  Nation’s students from a doubling of  student loan interest rates and work  together to craft a solution that will  end the growing mountain of student  debt and ensure college is more affordable for our Nation’s students. Our Nation’s future depends on it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2013
171,House,113,-0.413,18,2013-05-23,Mr. MEEKS.," Mr. Speaker, I’m puzzled. This is not the America that I  know. It can’t be.  When we were growing to make ourselves a great Nation, we were talking  about trying to make sure that our  young people had a free education. I  can’t figure out what’s going on here.  So many Americans that are doing well  now, when I talk to them about when  they were going to school back in the  forties and the fifties and the sixties, it  was a free education. Now we want to  ask our young people, the ones that are  going to be the middle class, the ones  that are going to strengthen this country, to be more in debt than ever.  How could we say to our students—  when we’re talking about financial literacy everyplace and trying to teach  them how to be financially able—that  you’ve got to take a bait-and-switch  loan? Didn’t we learn anything from  this last financial crisis?  What are homeowners doing now? All  who had these adjustable-rate mortgages, all of them are running to make  the adjustable-rate mortgages  fixed-  rate mortgages. And yet we take what  we say are our precious resources—our  children—to say that you’ve got to pay  these resources is ridiculous. Some are  wealthy, some are not.  ",2013

176,Senate,113,0.919,60,2013-05-23,Mr. LEE.," Madam President, I thank  my friend and my colleague, the Senator from Texas, for his remarks and I  speak briefly to respond to a couple of  points that have come up today.  First of all, it is important for us to  remember that although the rules of  our body might allow for a conference  committee to meet in public, and although that may have happened in the  past from time to time, it is not the  norm. In asking around to some senior  staff members who have been here  longer than I have, it typically has not  happened in recent years. In fact, it  has become relatively rare in recent  years. So to suggest it necessarily is an  open process because it has the capacity to be made into an open process,  those are not the same things. Typically, we can legitimately expect for  this  to be a backroom, closed-door  process.  That is not the end of the world; we,  of course, need conference committees.  They do valuable, important work. We  are not disputing that. We are not disputing the fact that sometimes it is  important  for conference committees  to meet  in order to reconcile competing versions of the same  legislation—one passed in the House and one  passed in the Senate. But what we are  talking about here is a very limited request: to limit the scope of their work  (Ms.  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:42 Apr 24, 2014 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD13\RECFILES\MAY2013\S23MY3.REC S23MY3 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2013

178,Senate,113,0.782,74,2013-05-23,Mr. COBURN.," Madam President, 4  percent of the farmers in this country  receive 33 percent of the benefits from  crop insurance. I don’t think it could  be said any better than Senator DURBIN  has said it. The point is, what we ought  do is make sure there is a safety net,  and crop insurance is the way to do  that. But like every other program, we  eventually are going to ask those who  have more to participate more.  I have the location and how much the  top five farmers in this country actually get. The No. 1 farmer in the country gets $1.9 million worth of subsidies  a year. All we are going to do is cut his  subsidy to $1.6 million. His income is  far in excess of $750,000.  The No. 2 farmer is from Washington  State. We will cut his subsidy from $1.7  million to $1.4 million, and, of course,  he made far more than that in the last  year and in the previous years.  No. 3, located in Minnesota, we are  going to cut from $1.6 million to $1.4  million. We are still going to subsidize  $1.4 million a year for this one individual who is going to make in excess  of $2 million this year.  All we are asking is to appropriately  limit the benefits that are coming from  borrowed money against our children’s  future  for the very wealthy  in this  country.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  ",2013

Roberto Maestas  is a 12th grader at Standley  Lake High School and received this award because his determination and hard work have  allowed him to overcome adversities.  The dedication demonstrated by Roberto  Maestas is exemplary of the type of achievement that can be attained with hard work and  perseverance.  It  is essential students at all  levels strive to make the most of their education and develop a work ethic which will  guide them for the rest of their lives.  I extend my deepest congratulations to Roberto Maestas for winning the Arvada Wheat  Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.  I have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedication and character in all of his future accomplishments.  f  HONORING CHAPLAIN (LT. COL.)  CHARLES CURRIE, RET.  HON.

They are the lights of our neighborhoods  and  families  that bring hope  long after  they  are gone. I rise today to celebrate one such  glorious light and honor the legacy of Chaplain  (Lt. Col.) Charles Currie, Ret.  Chaplain Currie dedicated his life to the calling of the Almighty and in service to the country he  loved. During World War  II, Currie  played the trombone in the 11th Airborne Division Band. He  returned  to  the Army as a  Chaplain after graduating  from Dallas Theological Seminary with a Master’s Degree  in  Theology. He preached of the goodness and  hope  of  the  Almighty  at  Ft  Bragg,  Ludwigsburg, Germany, Fort Campbell, Pajori,  Bayreuth, and Nuremberg, Germany, Vietnam,  and Fort Knox. He retired as a Lt. Colonel with  more than 20 years of service and began to  travel the world serving and leading mission  trips to more than 38 countries.  From all of Judea to the ends of the Earth,  Chaplain Currie’s legacy will be long remembered. Mr. Speaker, the Tennessee 7th Congressional District  is better  for his  lasting  goodwill. I ask my colleagues to join with me  in honoring  the  life and service of Chaplain  Charles Currie.  f  HONORING CAPTAIN EMERY BURK  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.

For the last 25 years, she  has served the people of South Louisiana for  three Members of Congress as a dedicated  Congressional staffer.  Penny began her career  in public service  working as a legislative assistant for Louisiana  State Representative Harry L. Benoit. She  then worked with U.S. Representatives James  ‘Jimmy’ ’ Hayes and Chris John of South Louisiana. In January of 2005, Penny joined my  staff as a constituent service representative.  From Day One, Penny has been a great resource to the Third Congressional District of  Louisiana. Her knowledge and guidance provided my office with a strong  foundation  to  build on. Her personality and reputation have  forged many bonds across South Louisiana. I  will miss her ability to provide help and insight  to constituents and most importantly, to me.  As Penny enters retirement, I would like to  thank her for the work she ’s done as a public  servant. However, I am positive her husband,  Kendall, and daughters, Abbey and Lindsey,  will be happy to have her around a little more.  Penny, I wish you nothing but the best as you  enter this next phase of your life and hope you  know how grateful I am for all of your hard  work over the course of these many years.  f  IN HONOR OF COLORADO STATE  SENATOR PAT STEADMAN  HON.

183,,113,-0.398,151,2013-05-23,Ms. TSONGAS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize and pay tribute to Second Lieutenant Luther McIlwain, of the United States Army  Air Corps’  famed  Tuskegee  Airmen. Mr.  McIlwain recently passed away at the age of  91 and I seek to honor him for his dedicated  service to the United States as an airman escorting bombers during World War II.  Lieutenant McIlwain was born  in Blaine,  South Carolina. His  family moved  to Lawrence, Massachusetts when he was two and  he  lived  there  until  his  graduation  from  Methuen High School  in 1939. He attended  college at Allen University in Columbia, South  Carolina. Upon graduation, he sought to join  the military in order to serve his country at a  momentous time. On his first attempt, military  recruiters ridiculed him  for his desire  to become a pilot. He was repeatedly told that he  would not be able to fly because of his race.  Undeterred, Luther enlisted  in  the Army Air  Corps in 1943 and ultimately became an aviator with the famed Tuskegee Airmen.  The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of soldiers who continuously placed their country’s  needs above their own, often in the face of extreme adversity. Due to the segregation of the  military at the time, the Tuskegee Airmen were  routinely  subjected  to  racial  discrimination  from their fellow service members and civilians  alike. This never dissuaded their devotion to  their duty or their Nation. They chose to pursue difficult  training, knowing  it would ultimately place them in direct confrontation with  enemy combatants. Luther McIlwain proudly  stood as a member of this elite unit.  Luther McIlwain fought in the skies above  Europe and North Africa with bravery and distinction. He continued to place others first by  serving as an instructor during the war, training nearly one thousand aviators in his unit.

Every year since 1963, May has been a  month to honor older Americans and highlight  the value that senior citizens contribute to our  communities.  The theme for Older Americans Month 2013  is ‘ ‘Older Americans: Connecting the Community.’ ’ Older Americans are more active  in  community life than ever before and continue  to make a significant impact across the region.  Our seniors are mentoring the leaders of tomorrow, taking to heart the need for intergenerational learning to guide and inspire young  minds.  In my Congressional District, we are lucky  to have many older Americans embracing their  role in building connections for the community.  I want to recognize individuals who were recently honored by the Cayuga County Legislature as Senior Citizens of  the Year: Trudy  Buxenbaum of Aurora, Joni Lincoln and Anita  Messina of Port Byron, and Betty Miller of Auburn.  I appreciate this opportunity to recognize the  accomplishments of older Americans in New  York’s 24th District and applaud the Cayuga  County Office for the Aging for its efforts to  enhance the quality of life for seniors and encourage them to share their lifetime of experience with those around them.  f  COMMEMORATING THE FIVE YEAR  ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNLAWFUL  IMPRISONMENT  OF  THE  IRANIAN BAHA’I LEADERSHIP  HON.

185,,113,-0.408,158,2013-05-23,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the Iranian Baha’i community, Iran’s largest minority religion, and in  commemoration of the five year anniversary of  the unlawful  imprisonment of  its  leadership,  known as the Yaran-i-Iran, or ‘ ‘friends of Iran.’ ’  In 2008 the Iranian regime arrested seven  members  of  the  Yaran-i-Iran  on  several  trumped  up  charges  including  espionage,  propaganda  activities  against  the  Islamic  order, the establishment of an illegal administration, cooperating with Israel, sending secret  documents outside the country, acting against  the security of the country, and ‘ ‘corruption on  earth.’ ’  Fariba  Kamalabadi,  Jamaloddin  Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saeid Rezaie, Mahvash  Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Vahid Tizfahm  were  ‘tried’ ’  in a series of closed-door sessions  from January  to August 2010, during  which they were denied meaningful access to  their lawyers.  Shirin Ebadi, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate  and a member of the group ’s legal team, has  said that there is no evidence against them to  sustain  the charges. Nonetheless, all seven  were sentenced  to 20 years  in prison —the  longest of all prisoners of conscience in Iran.  The conditions within  the prison where  they  are being held are appalling. Their unfortunate  circumstance  reminds us of  the  intolerant  character and brutality of the current Iranian  regime, not only towards the Baha’i, but also  the Iranian population as a whole.  In conclusion, I want to reiterate my support  for the Baha’i community in calling for the immediate release of the Yaran-i-Iran members,  as well as the release of all Iranian prisoners  of conscience. I will continue to monitor this  situation and hold  Iran accountable  for  its  abuse of its citizens.  f  HONORING MR. DANIEL SISTO  HON. PETER T.

Mr. Sisto is one of the nation’s leading experts on health care public policy. Over  the  course of his nearly three decades as President of HANYS he has worked tirelessly to advance positive change  in health care and  achieve fairness and balance in resolving essential health policy  issues. Because of his  leadership, Mr. Sisto has helped establish  HANYS as a valued, trusted voice on health  policy matters  in Washington, D.C., and  in  New York State.  Mr. Sisto has never been satisfied with the  status quo. Recognizing the need to improve  the health care delivery system to ensure efficient, high–quality care for all New Yorkers, he  embraced patient–centered delivery  system  reform, worked to expand coverage, and has  positioned HANYS as a leader in guiding quality  improvement  initiatives at hospitals and  health systems across the state.  Under Mr. Sisto ’s guidance, HANYS has  worked with hospitals, nursing homes, and  other health care provider organizations  in  collaboratives,  including  the New York State  Partnership for Patients, sharing best practices  and  facilitating  the widespread adoption of  proven clinical protocols to improve care delivery for all New Yorkers.  Mr. Sisto began his career  in health care  advocacy on Long Island, New York, as the  Executive Vice President of the Nassau–Suffolk Hospital Council and former Deputy Director of  the Nassau –Suffolk Health Systems  Agency. Mr. Sisto holds a Bachelor of Science  degree in Management and a Master of Business Administration degree in Marketing from  St. John’s University.  During his nearly  three decades of distinguished work in health care, Mr. Sisto has repeatedly proven himself  to be one of New  York State’s most  respected advocates and  health care  leaders and we, as New York’s  Delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives, wish him health and happiness in his retirement.  f  HONORING CHRISTIAN THORNTON  BRYAN  HON.

187,,113,0.602,158,2013-05-23,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the outstanding work and admirable  service of a very special military support non-  profit in Texas—Support our Soldiers (SOS).  Led by Teresa Nelson, whose father served  in  the Army’s 101st Airborne Division, SOS  was founded to care for our troops at home  and abroad with support they might otherwise  not receive. SOS volunteers often create custom boxes  to meet  the unique needs of  troops. Just this week, a Marine unit serving  overseas received a shipment of pillows after  SOS learned they had none. Since its establishment in June 2011, over 17,000 pounds of  food and supplies have been sent overseas to  benefit more than 500 soldiers.  Texans are always looking for ways to give  back  to  the men and women of  the United  States armed  forces, and SOS provides a  wide range of opportunities for its surrounding  communities to serve those who wear the uniform. Teresa and her team host monthly meetings with sell-out crowds and organize community events across 6 cities in Tarrant and  Johnson County  to  raise awareness,  funds,  and support for our troops. Beyond collecting  and distributing material goods, SOS also  works with ROTC programs and students to  teach them the importance of patriotism.

189,House,113,-0.473,13,2013-06-03,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss a number of concerns I have about H.R. 1919,  the Safeguarding America’s Pharmaceuticals Act of 2013. It’s a bill designed to improve the integrity of our  drug supply chain. Unfortunately, this  bill falls far short of achieving that  goal.  Throughout last year, Members on a  bipartisan, bicameral basis engaged in  extensive discussions on legislation to  protect our drug supply chain. During  those months of discussion last year—  and  at  the Health Subcommittee’s  hearing this past April—we repeatedly  heard loud and clear from FDA, the National Boards of Pharmacy, and many  others, that if we want a secure drug  supply chain, we will ultimately need  an  electronic  interoperable  system  that tracks each package of drugs at  the unit level and that involves the entire supply chain. This kind of system  would enable us  to  identify  illegitimate product in real-time and prevent  it from ending up in patients’ hands.  We also heard repeatedly that creating  this kind of system is doable. Unfortunately,  the bill we are  considering  today will not create that kind of system. The bill does not require the establishment of an  electronic,  interoperable unit-level system.  By 2027, 14 years from now, FDA will  be required to issue proposed regulations for such a system. But there’s no  requirement  that  these  regulations  ever be finalized. And if they are ever  finalized, they cannot go into effect for  at least 2 more years. Almost certainly  we are looking at 2030 or beyond under  this proposed legislation; and, in fact,  it may never be done.  This bill also has a number of additional  deficiencies.  It  fails  to adequately address the potential for bad  actors to introduce illegitimate product into the supply chain through supposed  returns  from  pharmacies  to  wholesale distributors. In the meantime, it will prevent States from responding to particular needs they may  have in regulating their wholesale distributors, and it preempts important  existing State safeguards against the  entry into the supply chain of unsafe  counterfeit drugs before any adequate  substitute will be in place.  Two weeks ago, Mr. Speaker,  the  Senate HELP Committee unanimously  approved a bill sponsored by Senators  BURR, BENNET, HARKIN, and ALEXANDER  that requires the establishment of a  unit-level,  electronic,  interoperable  system within 10 years and is not dependent upon FDA issuing regulations.  But the Senate bill still provides plenty of notice, input, and guidance for industry stakeholders. FDA is required  to hold public meetings, one or more  pilot projects, and to issue draft and  final guidances and, as needed, regulations. Because they will not be able to  delay or prevent implementation of the  system, stakeholders will have the incentive to work with FDA to see that  the guidances and any needed regulations are developed and released.  Our fundamental goal in establishing  a Federal system should be to prevent  Americans from being harmed by counterfeit and substandard medicines. If  we cannot assure the public that legislation will establish a system that will  protect them and that will do so by a  date certain, then, in my view, it’s not  worth doing. The House bill needs significant improvement as it moves forward if our goal is to enact legislation  that will truly protect the American  public.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.

191,House,113,0.339,13,2013-06-03,Mr. UPTON.," Certainly,  this afternoon I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 1919, the Safeguarding America’s  Pharmaceutical Act of 2013. I want to  thank the bill’s authors, including Mr.  LATTA, for their bipartisan leadership  on this very important issue.  This bill strengthens the prescription  drug supply chain in order to protect  American families against counterfeit  drugs. The bill also would help prevent  increases  in drug prices, avoid additional drug  shortages, and  literally  eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars worth of duplicative government  red tape on American businesses that  is harming job growth.  As Mr. LATTAsaid, supporters of the  Federal track and trace legislation include the U.S. Deputy Sheriffs’ Association and also those in the supply  chain, including the National Community Pharmacists Association. According to the CBO, the bill would reduce  the deficit by $24 million.  Last Congress, we spent a significant  amount of time working on this very  important  issue  as we  successfully  moved the Food and Drug Administration  Safety  and  Innovation  Act  through  the  legislative process, and  our efforts continued beyond enactment and into the 113th Congress. During that entire process, we also sought  input from stakeholders like Pfizer and  Perrigo, in my district in Michigan, as  well as our smaller pharmacies, too.  This hard work allowed us to better  understand the issue, and this bill reflects that understanding.  At the Energy and Commerce Committee, we held a legislative hearing on  the bill last April. We approved the bill  in both subcommittee and  full committee by voice vote. We certainly did  have a spirited debate at the committee, but we stand here united in our  belief that the prescription drug supply  chain has to be strengthened.  We look forward to working with our  Senate colleagues on H.R. 1919 on a bipartisan basis to improve the bill, including how it addresses issues related  to wholesale distributors during phase  one. Because of the hard work that has  already been put in on this issue and  the importance of protecting our Nation’s families from counterfeit drugs,  I am hopeful we can get a product to  the President’s desk by the August recess.

This bill before us today is a product  of several years of collaboration. It’s a  really complicated issue, and it’s important that you have a lot of collaboration to address something of this  complexity.  This legislation that Mr. LATTAand I  have introduced together will provide  what I think are important steps for  the security of our prescription drug  supply chain from counterfeiters and  other bad actors. We’ve seen in recent  press reports about fake drugs slipping  into the supply chain, so the threat of  counterfeit drugs is a growing problem  in  this country.  In  fact, when you  think about  it, the counterfeit drug  trade may be a more lucrative opportunity  than  the  illegal drug  trade,  since the United States, overall, spends  roughly $325 billion a year on prescription drugs. This bill is an effort to try  to keep those bad actors from entering  the drug supply.  Since we’ve had some of these problems, some States have, rightly, tried  to take action to deal with this.

194,House,113,0.455,27,2013-06-03,Mr. GARDNER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time.  I rise today in support of Senate Bill  622, the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Reauthorization  Act of 2013.  This legislation will reauthorize two  very important programs at the Food  and Drug Administration that will provide farmers, ranchers, pet owners, and  veterinarians with  speedy access  to  medications  that  they need  for  the  treatment of herds and pets.  I would like to thank Senator HARKIN  for leading its passage in the U.S. Senate, and I would also like to thank  Congressman SHIMKUS for his leadership with the House version of H.R.  1407.  These programs have been a success  story at the FDA, and this legislation  will ensure that drug approvals are  done efficiently and  to  the highest  quality  standards.  ADUFA  and  AGDUFA expire at the start of September, and we will need to pass this  reauthorization today to assure there  is no delay for animal caretakers and  livestock producers. This bill will also  help companies that develop and manufacture animal drugs by providing predictable time lines. It will also help  them to benefit from a more stable review process so they can make decisions about where to invest research  dollars.  Colorado has a thriving livestock industry which supports rural communities and economic strength for the  entire State.  I said this during the  committee markup of H.R. 1407: there  is more livestock in my district than  people, or at least that’s what I’m told.  Colorado is also home to one of the Nation’s premier  schools of veterinary  medicine at Colorado State University.  Keeping livestock animals healthy, in  particular, is crucial to ensuring our  own health, not to mention the health  of our family pets. The ADUFA and  AGDUFA  program  keeps  our  food  healthy and safe, while the application  of animal drugs poses no risk to animal  health.  I had the honor of introducing, with  bipartisan support, H.R. 1408, the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act, or  AGDUFA. The bill was  later  incorporated into H.R. 1407. This program at  FDA has achieved noteworthy success  since first being authorized in 2008. The  FDA has decreased a backlog of applications and reduced the review time for  new generic drug applications. The reauthorization of this program will continue this success and allow our animal  caretakers and livestock producers to  utilize cost savings associated with generic medications.  ",2013
195,House,113,-0.587,41,2013-06-03,Ms. FUDGE.," Thank you so very, very  much for yielding. And I, as always,  want to thank Congressmen HORSFORD  and JEFFRIES for leading the Congressional Black Caucus hour.  Today’s topic is critically important.  The rapid rise of poverty and, particularly, the rapid growth of poverty in  minority  communities,  is  troubling.  The latest Census Bureau numbers report that 15 percent of Americans live  in poverty.  The  poverty  rate  among African  Americans  is nearly double  the national rate, 27 percent. And almost 1 in  4 African American children lives in  poverty. I’m not sure how many children you come in contact with each  day,  but  this  statistic means  that  every  fourth African American child  you see lives a life of struggle. Food is  scarce in their home. Their neighborhoods are riddled with crime. There is  no guarantee that the lights and heat  will be on when they come home from  school each day.  As our economy sputters and more  Americans slip below the poverty line,  Federal anti-poverty programs are essential. Yet, over the last year, conservatives on and off the Hill have  begun to spin a story of how anti-poverty programs have done nothing but  foster a culture of dependency.  On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have used  this narrative over and over again, giving them license to place social safety  net programs on the chopping block.  While the Republican budget retains  tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans,  it places Social Security and  Medicare on the chopping block.  House leadership will send a farm bill  to the floor that reduces total spending  by almost $40 billion over 10 years. And  what’s most troubling, more than half  of  the cuts come  from  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  otherwise known as SNAP, otherwise  known as food stamps. This bill alone  would cut off nearly 2 million people  from SNAP.  Making matters worse, anti-poverty  programs around the country are reducing services because of sequester.  Our communities cannot continue to  face cut after cut, while Washington  does little to create economic opportunity.  This week we will consider the Military Construction and Veterans’ Affairs appropriations bill.  I want  to  make sure we bring attention to the  vast poverty plaguing veterans. As our  troops come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States must prepare for their return. Many of our vets  will need help from local safety net  programs; but due to budget cuts, help  is not guaranteed. As the statistics  show, homelessness will be the reality  of thousands of returning veterans.  This Congress cannot continue to ignore poverty in our communities. This  Congress cannot ignore the fact that  nearly 11⁄2million veterans live in poverty. America cannot be complicit in  allowing  families, children, and our  Nation’s veterans to struggle without  assistance, not now, not ever.  b1940  The CBC will continue to advocate  for policies that eliminate persistent  poverty. We will  rightfully  defend  critically  important antipoverty programs. Our goal is to create opportunities  for all Americans—opportunities  that help improve lives and move people closer to achieving their version of  the American Dream.  ",2013

I strongly oppose the Northern Route Approval Act and I  would have voted ‘ ‘no ’ ’ on passage of H.R. 3.  This legislation is another reckless attempt to  disregard due process for reviewing projects  with significant implications for national security, the environment and public health. I have  consistently stated that TransCanada’s application for a permit to build the Keystone XL  tar sands pipeline must undergo a full environmental review and public comment period, as  required by  law, before  the President determines whether  the project  is within  the national interest. It is irresponsible to waive environmental review and public comment, much  less ‘ ‘deem approved ’ ’ a project of such magnitude as the Keystone XL pipeline, especially  in  light of  the  recent  tar sands disaster  in  Mayflower, Arkansas that spilled 210,000 gallons of heavy crude oil and displaced 22 families from their homes.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF LINDA  HUTCHENRIDER  HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 3, 2013  ",2013
199,,113,-0.329,83,2013-06-03,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and congratulate Linda Hutchenrider  upon her upcoming retirement from her position as Town Clerk of Barnstable, Massachusetts.  Ms. Hutchenrider has been a constant figure  in Barnstable’s Town Hall since she first took  a position with the town’s local government in  1987. She was elected to her current position  in 1993, and has been reelected in every election since. She has administered over 38 elections during her twenty-year tenure as Town  Clerk, and her knowledge of the many intricacies of the position has gained her the respect  and admiration of Clerks throughout the Commonwealth.  Ms. Hutchenrider’s many accomplishments  include having served as President of  the  Massachusetts  Town  Clerks  Association,  President of  the Cape and  Islands Town  Clerks Association, and Chair of the New England Municipal Clerks’ Institute and Academy.  During her  time as Barnstable Town Clerk,  Ms. Hutchenrider also attained her Master Municipal Clerk (MMC) and Certified Massachusetts Municipal Clerk  (CMMC) designations,  both of which  required many hours of advanced training. While Ms. Hutchenrider may  be retiring this June, she has not finished giving back to her field, and plans to serve as a  volunteer teacher for the New England Municipal Clerks’ Institute and Academy this summer.  It  is  fitting  to acknowledge and  to  thank  those who have offered service to their communities, and Ms. Hutchenrider is a true embodiment of such an individual. I thank her for  all that she has done for the Barnstable community, and wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join  me  in  recognizing and  congratulating Ms.  Linda Hutchenrider upon her retirement.  f  CONGRATULATING CARTERSVILLE  BASEBALL  ON  THE  DIVISION  AAA STATE CHAMPIONSHIP  HON. PHIL GINGREY  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 3, 2013  ",2013
200,,113,0.561,83,2013-06-03,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  today I rise to recognize the Cartersville High  School Baseball team. On May 25th, the Purple Hurricanes swept the North Hall Trojans in  a best of three championship series to win the  AAA division state championship.  Although  the North Hall Trojans put up a  memorable  fight,  the Purple Hurricanes ultimately hit walk–off single to clench the program’s 6th title in 12 years.  This  season, Coach Stuart Chester, his  staff, and these young men have worked tirelessly to earn their place in Georgia baseball  history. The  team’s 14 seniors—who are no  strangers  to adversity—will enter  the next  chapter of their lives knowing that they have  upheld their school’s legacy of excellence and  have set a high bar  for  future Purple Hurricanes teams to strive for.  I encourage the entire team to savor their  victory and remember the season ’s important  life lessons of responsibility, persistence, and  self-discipline;  they will  undoubtedly make  them better citizens and fathers as they grow  older.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I congratulate the Cartersville Purple Hurricanes on  their well-deserved 2013 division AAA State  Championship title and wish them luck as they  defend  their  title next year. This  team has  brought great pride to their school, the city of  Cartersville, and Georgia ’s 11th District. Go  Canes.  f  RECOGIZING THE JEWISH COMMUNITY  CENTER  OF  SYRACUSE’S  150TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. DANIEL B. MAFFEI  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 3, 2013  ",2013
201,House,113,0.703,10,2013-06-12,Mr. HENSARLING.," Madam Speaker,  I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to  revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous materials  for the  on H.R. 2167 currently under  consideration.  ",2013
202,House,113,-0.313,10,2013-06-12,Mr. HECK of Washington.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I would like to begin by reciprocating  and  thanking  the  gentleman  from  Texas for his leadership on this issue,  and perhaps as notably the gentleman  from Pennsylvania for his leadership  and cooperation and collaboration in  helping to solve this important problem. I thank you, sir. And, more importantly, I thank you on behalf of the  many people who will benefit as a result of our action here today.  Madam Speaker, currently the Federal Housing Administration  underwrites 100 percent of all reverse mortgages. Let me say that again. The Federal Housing Administration  underwrites 100 percent of all reverse mortgages, and that is a program that is  deeply troubled, as enumerated by the  capable chair of the Financial Services  Committee.  And so if you believe, as I do, that reverse mortgages are a financial product  that actually ought to be available to  some people, but under appropriate circumstances and conditions, it’s all the  more important that we enact H.R. 2167  today,  and  not  just  because  TV  pitchmen—let’s see if I can name them  all—James Garner, Henry ‘‘the Fonz’’  Winkler, Fred Dalton Thompson, Pat  Boone,  and Robert Wagner—entreat  our elderly to do so, but because this  legislation is very important.  So the question is, as with all legislation: What’s the problem? There’s probably no better statement of the problem than is represented in this chart  which says that 7 percent of the FHA’s  portfolio  is related to reverse mortgages, but 17 percent of their portfolio  that is underwater is attributable to  reverse mortgages. That is a stark, salient representation of why this legislation is needed.  I might add, frankly, that if you were  to compare reverse mortgages across  all,  just  the going  forward,  30-year  fixed mortgage market,  it would be  even more stark. This is against all  products.  So what’s the solution? As the chair  indicated, it is to give the FHA the authority through mortgagee  letter to  adopt certain reforms. The alternative  is to wait and to endure the arduous  rulemaking process.  I had an agency  in the office the  other day for which I had a problem,  and I sought a solution through the  rulemaking  process.  I  asked  them,  what’s the minimum amount of time  that would be required for adoption of  rules, and they indicated the best of  circumstances would be 18 months—  sighed, paused—then said more like 24  to 36 months. We can’t wait that long,  Madam Speaker.  So what are those reforms that are  likely to be adopted via mortgagee letter at the FHA? I think most notably,  it would require a financial assessment  of potential borrowers to ensure that  this financial product is suitable for  them. There are others as well. It may  reduce the amount of funds granted up  front to the borrower, and it may require escrow for provision of payment  of taxes and insurance, something that  is not uncommon in the mortgage industry.  But the financial assessment portion  that very well may ensue as a result of  passage of this legislation, it’s important to note that that is a tool and  technique used by the VA when it underwrites reverse mortgages. Let me  say that again. The VA uses this tool  to underwrite reverse mortgages. And  how much of a problem does the VA  have with  reverse mortgages? Zero.  Zero.  So we know with a virtual certainty  that this solution which the gentleman  from Pennsylvania and I bring to you  today will solve the problem.

203,House,113,0.378,17,2013-06-12,Mr. CRAWFORD.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume just to simply say that by passing and enacting H.R. 742, it would send  a clear message to the international  community that the United States is  strongly  committed  to  global  data  sharing and  is determined  to avoid  fragmenting the current global data  set for over-the-counter derivatives.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 742, and  I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  ",2013
204,House,113,-0.285,24,2013-06-12,Ms. BROWNLEY of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman of  Massachusetts for yielding.  It has already been stated—but it is  worth repeating again—in 2012, 26,000  servicemembers  were  sexually  assaulted. If only one servicemember was  assaulted, that is one too many.  Sexual assault in the military is intolerable—period. It is a terrible entrenched cultural flaw of our military  that allows victims to be abused without accountability or justice.  While there are a number of legislative proposals to address this issue, the  consensus is clear: we need a fail-safe  solution  that  increases  transparency  and accountability so that the military  no longer is a place where sexual assault is tolerated.  I am pleased that H.R. 1960 takes  steps to improve the military justice  system. However, I do believe the bill  does not go far enough. We must do a  better job.  ",2013
205,House,113,-0.656,24,2013-06-12,Ms. WATERS.," Thank you very much.  I rise to oppose the closed rule on  H.R. 1256.  H.R. 1256 really has no business being  hidden in this bill at all. It is another  attempt to keep the debate from taking place so that people will know what  is happening when we are trying to  have a regulatory regime that will protect us from having to bail out big institutions.  We are simply saying that we can’t  allow our financial institutions to have  subsidiaries overseas  that are doing  business and trading and putting us at  risk. Every time they get involved in a  trade in which they don’t have comparable rules in that country, what we  are doing is putting this country at  risk that we are going to have to bail  out a big financial institution because  the harm will come right back to the  parent company.  We, in Dodd-Frank, have said that we  must have comparable rules, that we  must have regulatory regimes that are  comparable to ours in order to do business and to do trading in order to protect against big institutions failing. So  now we have this H.R. 1256 that would  undo all of that and drag it back into  the shadows, this derivatives trading,  and put us all at risk. We can’t even  debate  it. We  can’t  even have  an  amendment  because,  again,  they’re  trying to kill Dodd-Frank.

206,House,113,0.688,31,2013-06-12,Mr. GARRETT.," Finally, in a formal  Statement of Administration Policy,  the administration argues that the bill  will somehow slow down implementation of title VII. This can’t be further  from the truth. By requiring the agencies to work together and put the same  rule, this will remove legal obstacles  here in Washington and ensure that we  have the appropriate regulatory framework sooner rather than later. It will  remind the people saying that we will  somehow slow down implementation of  these rules that, no, that cannot be further from the truth. Dodd-Frank was  passed almost 3 years ago, and we’re no  closer today than we were 3 years ago  to getting this done.  Mr. Speaker,  let us restore, then,  some common sense and some clarity  to the rulemaking process and actually  bring it some additional transparency.  Let us not play into the narrative that  the rest of the country has of a dysfunctional Washington. Let us make  sure that our financial regulators are  actually working together and not trying to allow some to front-end each  other.  Let us pass this legislation.  ",2013
207,House,113,0.591,38,2013-06-12,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, may I  inquire as to how much time remains  on each side?  ",2013
208,House,113,-0.186,38,2013-06-12,Mr. MURPHY of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman from Georgia for yielding.  I rise in support of H.R. 1256.  Title VII of Dodd-Frank contains important structural reforms to the derivatives market so that complicated,  unregulated financial instruments can  never bring our economy to its knees  again. However, no law is perfect, and  we should look for ways to improve  Wall Street Reform to keep unintended  consequences from trickling down to  Main Street.  The bill before us would put SEC and  CFTC on the same page, giving American businesses the ability to compete  with foreign companies on a level playing field. This will not destabilize the  global financial system because the bill  demands a broadly equivalent swaps regime as Title VII.  The global derivatives market deserves smart regulations, not duplicative or conflicting requirements. I urge  my colleagues to support this commonsense, technical adjustment.  ",2013
209,House,113,-0.53,38,2013-06-12,Ms. MOORE.," I thank the gentleman  from Georgia.  I rise today to support H.R. 1256, the  Swap Jurisdiction Certainty Act.  I proudly supported the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform Act because I believed that regulations of derivatives  were desperately needed, and today I  stand here to support what is a very  modest change because I believe that  the inability of the CFTC and the SEC  to come together on a definition of  ‘‘U.S. persons’’ is centrally important  to effective cross-border rules and regulations and rules of the road.  Now,  I did support the gentlelady  from  California’s  amendment  for  switching the presumption. Because of  the closed rules, we were unable to  take that up at this time, and I believe  it would have improved the bill. However, although this amendment was not  adopted, I believe that the regulators  will continue to have the authority to  regulate  any  overseas  swaps  transactions under U.S. rules if they conclude that it is appropriate.  I believe that without this bill we  could find U.S. companies going outside not only the jurisdiction of the  United States and our losing our competitiveness, but those swaps activities  could migrate away from U.S. companies overseas to companies outside of  the reach of U.S. regulators. So I would  urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  ",2013

I would now like to call upon my  good  friend, Dr. JOHNFLEMING from  Louisiana. As a dedicated physician  who cares deeply about the health care  system in our country, I know you can  provide us with extraordinary insights  into the problems with the implementation of the new health care law. But  I think it’s important to point out that  you are one of the lead cosponsors and  a coauthor of the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, and we are very  grateful for your leadership as well.  Dr. FLEMING.  ",2013
212,House,113,0.59,59,2013-06-12,Mr. FLEMING.,"  I  thank  the  gentleman  from Nebraska  (Mr. FORTENBERRY) for bringing us together this  evening with a number of colleagues  talking about an extremely important  topic today, and that is health care  conscience rights. You’ve heard some  of the major points here, and I’m going  to touch on more.  On August 1, 2013, the administration’s coercive health care mandate  will take effect. It will force religious  organizations, American  family businesses, universities, and countless others across the great country of ours to  violate the deeply held moral and religious beliefs that we have. The HHS  mandate is a serious affront to religious  freedom and  leaves American  businesses, nonprofit religious organizations, and individuals with three terrible decisions.  First, they could violate their conscience and religious convictions and  comply with the mandate, purchasing  and providing items and services they  find morally objectionable.  Second, they could resist the mandate, not complying with the Federal  regulations, and face fines up to $100  per employee, per day.  Or third, they could drop employee  health coverage altogether—which defeats the purpose, the basic  idea of  ObamaCare to begin with—leaving employees to fend for themselves and still  pay a Federal fine of $2,000 per employee, per year, according to the business that employs that person.  These are not actually choices, but a  top-down, burdensome Federal  regulatory scheme that forces the American public to participate in a government-run health care plan that violates their values.  Who are we talking about? Who will  be affected by the HHS mandate? Mr.  Speaker, to date, 61 cases and over 200  plaintiffs have filed suit against the  Federal Government to preserve their  First Amendment right of freedom of  religion. One of the nonprofit lawsuits  was filed by Louisiana College, a private Baptist college in Pineville, Louisiana just outside of my district.  Offering  degrees  in  art, music,  science,  nursing,  social  work  and  teaching, this central Louisiana school  has over 70 programs of study, has a  student enrollment of about 1,500 students, and a faculty/student ratio of 13–  1.  The HHS mandate requires that Louisiana College provide employee health  insurance  covering abortion-inducing  drugs and counseling on the use of such  drugs. This, Mr. Speaker, is a violation  of Louisiana College’s belief that all  life is sacred, including the life of the  unborn.  Who else? Hobby Lobby is another  example  of  a well-known  business  throughout the country—we have 11  stores  in Louisiana—employing more  than 2,000 people in 41 States. The business practice of Hobby Lobby mirrors  their religious principles. Their hours  of operation are family friendly, and  they are closed on Sundays. Employee  pay is important.  Well, what is the anecdote to this  problem created by ObamaCare and the  rules rolled out of this administration?  I’m going to  just quickly touch on  them, and then yield back to my good  friend from Nebraska.  Section 3 provides much needed protections to ensure that the Federal  Government cannot force individuals,  charities and businesses to buy plans  for their employees that provide or facilitate coverage of items or services to  which they have a deeply held moral or  religious objection.  Section four provides much needed  protections to ensure that any government  agency  that  receives Federal  funds cannot force pro-life health care  entities to be complicit in abortion or  discriminate  against  them  because  they are pro-life.  Section 5 of the Conscience Rights  Act  amends  title  II  of  the Public  Health Service Act. It includes a private right of action for victims who  have been discriminated against. You  see, at this time, Mr. Speaker, people  who are discriminated against, or coerced or forced in some way by this  mandate don’t have access to courts.  This opens up a private right of action  so that those of us who may object  through our conscience will have our  day in court.  Just in conclusion I would like to  say, Mr. Speaker, that ObamaCare has  provided many, many problems and  really no solutions. But there are even  unintended consequences, and that is  forcing people of conscience to have to  make that decision on whether to end  providing certain care  for their employees or for their—really to their patients—or suffer  large  fines, or  just  give up on health care coverage at all  for their employees.  I think it’s time that this country  comes together and decides, let’s make  health care attractive and affordable  and protect life, and protect those who  want to protect life, and not have this  top-down, bureaucratic, coercive system that’s now in law that will require  many of us to do many things against  our conscience. That  is  simply un-  American.  With that, I thank the gentleman for  his time today.  ",2013

214,Senate,113,-0.342,87,2013-06-12,Mrs. MURRAY.," Madam President, a  few months ago I met two sisters from  my home State. They are Mari and  Adriana Barrera. These  two  sisters  were brought here by  their parents  when Mari was 7 and Adriana was 3  years old. They were raised by a single  mother who spoke no English after  their father left the family behind.  Growing  up,  their mother,  who  worked at a local hotel, did whatever  she could to support her family, but  Mari and Adriana often had to depend  on themselves. Unlike other children  her age, Mari told me she grew up the  moment her father left. She told me  about how she scheduled all of her family’s doctors’ appointments and how  she translated  legal documents, and  how, at the age of 13, she started working as a hostess at a local restaurant,  and not for money, as most teenagers  want for their own indulgences, but to  support her family.  Mari also  told me when  she was  about to enter high school Adriana had  to have life-threatening surgery, and a  dream was born within herself. As her  sister’s life hung in the balance, Mari  realized she wanted to become a pediatric  cardiothoracic  surgeon.  She  wanted to help others the way she  watched doctors help her sister that  day, and she decided she would commit  herself to getting the education and  work toward that dream.  When I talked to Mari that day a few  months ago it was just after she had  been forced to drop out of the University of Washington because she could  no longer afford it. Living in Seattle,  she told me about how she had been unable to find a job to support her studies. Why? Because she lacks a Social  Security  number. Mari’s  dream,  it  turns out—the same as for many like  her—has been put on hold. It has been  put on hold because our immigration  system  remains  broken. All  those  dreams have been put on hold because  for far too long Congress has failed to  act. They have been put on hold because, despite  the  fact  that young  women  such as  the Barrera  sisters  want to contribute to our Nation, our  current system won’t let them.  It is not only stories such as those of  the Barrera sisters that point to a system badly in need of reform, I see it everywhere in my State. I see it in rural  parts of my State, in cities such as  Yakima and Moses Lake, where farmers can’t get the seasonal agricultural  workers they need to support one of  our State’s largest industries. I see it  in big cities such as Seattle and Vancouver and Spokane, where high-tech  businesses struggle to hire the world’s  best and brightest. I see it in neighborhoods throughout my State where families have been ripped apart by a system that  forces them to choose between legal immigration and long-term  separation from the people they love. I  see  it along our northern border  in  Washington State where the need to secure a long, porous border must be balanced with smart enforcement policies  that don’t use intimidation and fear as  a weapon. And I see it in my State’s  LGBT community—a community that  badly lacks fairness and equality under  today’s broken system.  But these aren’t problems that cannot be fixed. Although previous reform  efforts have fallen short, this Senate is  not incapable of this task, especially  now. And that is because today—due to  the changing demographics of our Nation, because of the growing political  voice of a new generation of Americans, and because of the energy, determination, and hard work of immigration advocates in my home State and  across the Nation—we are at a historic  moment of opportunity. For the first  time in the history of this debate there  is broad bipartisan agreement this system must be fixed and that a bipartisan solution is within reach.  No one in this country needs to be reminded it is a rarity here when Senators from different parties and from  very different States come together to  agree on common solutions to a big  issue. So it is truly remarkable that  over the course of the past year the bipartisan so-called Gang of 8 has worked  to craft this bill that is now before the  Senate. The bill we are considering is  focused on four bipartisan pillars that  have drawn consensus  support  from  Members of Congress and the American  people.  First of all, this bill includes a path  to citizenship, so that with a lot of  hard work many of the immigrants living in this country who are dreaming  of citizenship can achieve that goal  over time.  Second, the bill provides employers  certainty in a system that has often  left them without any answers.  Third, this bill will help continue the  progress we have made in securing our  borders by focusing on the most serious  security threats and by utilizing new  technology.  Finally, this bill helps to reform our  legal immigration system so it meets  the needs of our families and our Nation going forward.  These are all important steps. But  this bill is only the beginning of a full,  fair, and open public debate over reforming immigration in this country.  And while it will be tempting to get  caught up  in  the  specifics  of  one  amendment or policy in this debate, we  can’t forget about the larger questions  this bill addresses, because at its heart  this is a bill that touches nearly every  aspect of American life, from our economy to our security, from our classrooms to our workplaces. It is about  what type of country we want to be,  what we stand for, and what type of future we all want to build.  These are the questions I have actually posed in meetings with advocates  and businesses and leaders in meetings  all over my State, both in recent weeks  and going back many years. Those conversations have stirred a lot of passion,  brought new facts to light, and helped  me bring the voices of countless advocates to this debate today. They have  also helped me to arrive at the core  issues I believe are essential to repairing our broken immigration system—  the issues I will fight for as we debate  in the weeks to come.  Sitting and talking about the aspiring Americans this bill will affect has  made clear  that protecting  families  must be a central priority  in comprehensive immigration reform. Immigration reform isn’t just about a person’s  status,  it  is  about  sons  and  daughters and mothers and fathers and  families who want to live full, productive lives together in this country. We  know when workers have their families  nearby they are more likely to be satisfied  with  their  job,  they  are  healthier, they work harder, and they  contribute to our economy.  We know families are the building  block  of  strong  communities. Yet  under today’s broken system, family-  based  immigration has  been  pitted  against  employment-based  immigration, and far too often immigrant families are being forced to choose between  the country they  love and the ones  they love. I firmly believe it is in our  long-term national interest to change  this approach. For immigration reform  to best meet our national ideals we  have to keep our focus on keeping our  families together, reducing these backlogs, giving women immigrants access  to green cards, and reuniting  immigrants with their families.  Immigration  reform must also  include a pathway to citizenship for the  11 million undocumented  immigrants  residing in this country. Many of our  undocumented immigrants have lived  in this country for more than a decade.  They are our neighbors, our friends,  our colleagues. They go to church with  us, they pay their taxes, and they follow our laws.

215,,113,-0.686,157,2013-06-12,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to honor  the  remarkable  life of Mr.  Landon Bonniepaul Vernon. A  loving  son,  brother,  husband,  father,  grandfather  and  friend, Mr. Vernon was exemplary in his familial devotion, entrepreneurial spirit and community pride. With his passing on March 5, 2013  we are reminded of his life’s journey and the  joyful legacy he inspired.  Born in Franklinton, Louisiana on August 26,  1936, Landon was the third of six boys born  to Sherman Vernon and Sara Crawford. The  family  relocated  to California  in  the early  1940s, settling in Oakland, where Landon attended local schools and played high school  and college basketball.  Mr. Vernon married his high school sweetheart  and  the  love  of  his  life, Barbara  McKellar-Vernon, and  together  they  raised  three children, Landon Carl, Wayne and Darlene. An avid businessman and entrepreneur,  Mr. Vernon started a janitorial service as early  as high  school. Over  the  years, he also  worked  in a variety of roles at stalwart Bay  Area businesses like Aerojet, Wonder Bread,  The National Association of Home Builders  and Oakland’s Outreach Development Program.  Yet, Mr. Vernon also continued to achieve  his dream of entrepreneurial success while becoming co-owner and co-manager of several  Bay Area clubs, including Celebrity Club, Consultants Lounge, Bird Kage, Dock of the Bay,  Old Golden, Bosn’s Locker and Nick’s Lounge.  Many of these locales were African American  cultural institutions that contributed to the important  legacy of Black- and minority-owned  small businesses in the East Bay. Mr. Vernon  was also the owner of the vending machine  company LV Rentals.  In addition to Mr. Vernon’s commitment to  his business ventures, he was an avid sports  buff who supported East Bay athletic organizations and cofounded the Bird Kage Golf Tournament. As a member of the ‘ ‘Sportsmen Club  All Stars’ ’ basketball team, Mr. Vernon played  with the likes of Wilt ‘ ‘The Stilt ’ ’ Chamberlain,  Charlie Hardy, Don Barksdale, Richard Whitehurst and Harold Theus. His enthusiasm  in  supporting athletic and business communities  of color undoubtedly helped to pave the way  for more organizations to follow.  In addition  to  this community activity, Mr.  Vernon loved to travel. He was especially fond  of visiting extended family and friends back in  Louisiana and making sure that the bonds of  family and  friendship were always  strong.  Fishing was also one of his favorite pastimes  for relaxation, and he often noted  that  if all  mankind could fish, the world would recognize  and want that kind of peace every day. His life  was  truly one  that was  ‘well-lived and well-  loved,’ ’ and his memory is a testament to the  benefits of forming and sustaining meaningful  relationships with others. Furthermore, Landon  was a personal friend who I met in the early  1970s. He was fun, smart and extremely kind  to my family. We are deeply grateful for his  friendship.  Today, California ’s 13th Congressional District  salutes  and  honors  Mr.  Landon  Bonniepaul Vernon. His  vibrant  spirit  and  sense of fellowship will continue to guide others  to connect with  their communities and  loved ones for years to come. I offer my sincerest condolences to Landon’s surviving family and  to  the many  friends and associates  whose lives he touched over the course of his  incredible life. He will be deeply missed.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF SRIRAM  HATHWAR  HON. TOM REED  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 12, 2013  ",2013

I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring  this organization.  Founded in 1983, Loaves and Fishes has  been serving  the Sacramento area by providing food, shelter, and social services for the  area’s homeless. They are a haven of safety,  sustenance, and shelter for the men, women  and children  that seek  their assistance. Today’s ‘ ‘30 Years of Food, Warmth, and a Path  Home’ ’ celebration has been dedicated to the  hard work of Loaves and Fishes’ countless  volunteers.  Loaves and Fishes,  led by Sister Libby  Fernandez and a committed Board of Directors, has shown compassion and devotion to  meeting the needs of the homeless and indigent  in  the greater Sacramento area. They  place  the dignity of each person  that  they  serve at the forefront of their efforts and strive  to meet the needs of each person that walks  in their doors. To fulfill its mission of compassion, Loaves and Fishes  relies on  financial  support  from a number of private donations  and church groups.  Mr. Speaker, I hereby recognize Loaves and  Fishes for their continued service to the homeless men, women, and children of the Greater  Sacramento area. I ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring this organization and wishing  them continued success as they endeavor to  serve Sacramento’s homeless.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE LAKEWOOD  FOUNDATION  AND  THE  2013  NATIONAL  INTERCOLLEGIATE  WHEELCHAIR  BASKETBALL  ASSOCIATION  TOURNAMENT  HON.

Lakeshore started as a hospital dedicated to  treating the national scourge of tuberculosis in  the 1920s. In 1984, it became fully focused on  its current mission:  to provide  rehabilitative  recreational and sports programs to improve  the lives of people with disabilities. At Lakeshore, the connection between physical activity, from basic fitness to competitive athletics,  and emotional restoration  is understood and  nurtured.  The world-class athletic  facilities at Lakeshore Foundation are used by individuals of all  ages, from young children to senior citizens. It  is a training location for the U.S. Paralympic  Team. After 9/11, it created a special program  called  ‘Lima Foxtrot’ ’  to  help  courageous  wounded warriors recover their physical skills  after severe injury.  Most  recently, Lakeshore Foundation and  the University of Alabama at Birmingham have  formed the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative. The joint effort between Lakeshore and  UAB is a world-class research program in rehabilitative  science. The  collaborative  links  Lakeshore ’s extraordinary programs for people  with physically disabling conditions with UAB’s  research expertise.  A special event  took place  from March 7  through March 9 of this year when Lakeshore  Foundation teamed with the University of Alabama and the National Wheelchair Basketball  Association (NWBA) to successfully host the  National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball  Association Tournament. The University of  Alabama is known for having one of the top  adaptive athletic programs in the nation.

218,House,113,-0.391,6,2013-07-09,Mr. CICILLINE.," Mr. Speaker, Washington’s failure to replace sequestration is imposing real penalties on families all across our country. This week,  in my home State of Rhode Island,  more than 3,000 civilian Department of  Defense employees at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the U.S. Naval  War College were furloughed, imposing  the equivalent of a roughly 20 percent  pay cut through the end of the fiscal  year. And it doesn’t stop there.  Sequestration is expected to cost the  American  economy  750,000  jobs  this  year alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Americans have  had enough of dysfunction, gridlock,  and political posturing between Republicans and Democrats in Washington.  It’s time for Congress to start getting  things done for working families, and  that’s why I’m calling on the House  Republican leadership to immediately  bring H.R. 2060 to the House floor for  an up-or-down vote so we can replace  sequestration with  smart,  targeted  spending cuts and new sources of revenue by eliminating subsidies for big  oil companies and closing tax loopholes  for corporations that ship American  jobs overseas, commonsense solutions  that all of us in this Chamber should  agree on.  f  REPEAL AND REPLACE  OBAMACARE  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Steven Pezenik began his distinguished career as a Consumer Service Specialist with  the New York State Public Service Commission, where he served with distinction for 14  years. He then joined United Way New York  City/AFL–CIO as a Constituent Liaison, before  moving on to the United Food and Commercial Workers/Retail Wholesale  Department  Store Union. There, he proudly served  the  working men and women of Local 338 as Director of Special Projects, coordinating  the  local’s public relations, and writing in and editing a quarterly newspaper. In his most recent  position as Deputy Director of Constituent  Services  for New York State Senator Jose  Peralta, Steve acted as a liaison between government agencies to help secure services for  constituents.  Mr. Speaker, Steven Pezenik was a tireless  public servant and advocate  for  the underserved and most  in need. He helped  raise  over $11 million for The United Way and organized AFL–CIO toy, blood, and food drives, including a  large-scale effort after September  11, 2001. With work  that spanned almost  three decades, he exemplified the meaning of  public service. As a board member of  the  Queens Jewish Community Council, Steve always put  first  those most  in need. Steve’s  commitment to working families functioned as  the  foundation  for his activism and commitment to social justice.  The  legacy he  leaves behind  reflects  the  love he had for his community. Yet, nothing  was more important to Steve than his love for  his family, his wife Lisa and daughter Sasha.

Brown on July 9th, 1938. Brown  was believed to be the first female, certainly  the  first African-American woman,  to have  founded a newspaper. Later  the paper was  placed  in  the hands of Brown’s niece, Dr.  Marguerita Washington, who now heads  the  newspaper.  Since 1938, the policy The Omaha Star has  been to print only positive news and to be a  vigilant  champion  for  African-American  progress. The circulation of The Omaha Star  is 30,000 and its archives are a miniature history of Omaha’s black community. Its work for  equal rights for all Americans are legendary.  Two  significant  accomplishments  of The  Omaha Star are leading the charge to open  public accommodations  to African-Americans  and working with the public school system of  Omaha  to ensure  that black  teachers have  equal  participation. Over  the  years,  The  Omaha Star has received many awards and  was inducted into the Chamber of Commerce  Business Hall of Fame on July gth, 1996.  Currently, The Omaha Star concentrates of  news coverage  that  is  relevant  to  the particular market  that  they have continued  to  serve proudly  for decades.  It has been Nebraska’s  largest African-American newspaper  and the Omaha’s most effective publican highlighting ways to improve the lives of African-  Americans. The Omaha Star has stood  the  test of time and continues to provide relevant  information, education and positive motivation  to Omaha’s citizens.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating The Omaha Star on their 75th Anniversary.

237,,113,-0.379,1,2013-07-17,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, for civilian  defense employees at Pax River Naval  Air Station, Webster Field, and the  Naval Surface Warfare Center at Indian  Head, all of which I represent—and Mr.  JONES, who is on the floor, represents a  substantial number as well in his district—sequestration  hit  home  last  week as furloughs began. The same is  true of 650,000 civilian defense workers  throughout our country.  The furloughs brought on by the irrational  policy  of  sequestration  are  harming our national security and putting our military readiness at risk. At  the same time, they also represent a  severe 20 percent pay cut in the form of  days when  they are  forced  to  stay  home without pay, forbidden even from  volunteering  to continue performing  their important tasks.  Federal employees,  including those  in civilian defense positions, have already contributed $114 billion over the  last 3 years for the next 7 years toward  deficit reduction from pay freezes and  changes in retirement benefits. These  are hardworking, dedicated men and  women who only want to serve their  country and make a difference.  As I said on this floor last week, I  went to Pax River 2 weeks ago to meet  with many of those preparing to be furloughed. I heard their concerns about  the sequester’s effects on the missions  of our men and women  in uniform  whom  these civilian employees  support.  We have men and women at the point  of this spear, but we have a lot of men  and women who are making sure that  they can be as effective and as safe as  possible at the point of that spear. And  I heard from them about how the sequester is affecting morale on and off  base.  What I did not hear much at all from  those employees was concern for themselves, about how furloughs will impact  their  own  families. That’s  because  their number one concern, even facing  an undeserved 20 percent pay cut, is  still their ability to serve and get the  job done for our troops and all of us  who depend on a strong national defense.  After my meeting with civilian defense employees from Maryland’s Fifth  District, I received an email message  from an employee at Webster Field. He  wrote this:  We pride ourselves in not only delivering a  quality product but on being responsive to  the emergent needs of our soldiers and sailors around the world.  He went on to say:  If our dedicated folks are told to turn the  lights off and lock the doors at 4 p.m. on a  Thursday, then who will provide that level of  responsiveness  our military  counterparts  have so desperately come to expect and rely  on when no one is here to respond to the call  on Friday? What message does that send to  the civilians and contractors who have made  it their mission to ensure our military never  goes without critical equipment, data, and  training they need?  He goes on to say:  I genuinely worry that  it devalues the  level of effort that our employees have put  forth. And when you’re losing your pay and  your work appears to be less important, it  will become much harder to retain a lot of  these very talented folk.  Not my words, Mr. Speaker, but the  words of one of America’s many selfless  public  servants who  are  concerned  about this dangerous sequester.  What will it take for Congress to act?  We’ve also  seen air combat units  grounded,  and  some  classes  at  the  Naval Academy this fall could be canceled if sequester continues. The only  way  to  reverse  these  effects, Mr.  Speaker, on our military readiness and  training  is to replace the sequester  with a big and balanced alternative.  Budget Committee Ranking Member  CHRISVANHOLLENhas proposed a balanced alternative seven times, but the  majority has not allowed us to consider  a balanced plan on this floor. If we had,  on this floor, an alternative to the sequester that achieves real deficit reduction—which we know we need—  through a balance of revenues and targeted spending cuts, Mr. Speaker, I believe that the majority of us, Republican and Democrat, would come together and would support it. It’s time  for Speaker BOEHNERto appoint budget  conferees so that House and Senate negotiators can begin to reach agreement  on a balanced compromise.  I will continue, Mr. Speaker, to call  on both parties to listen to the men  and women of Pax River, of Webster  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

This bipartisan legislation would provide matching funds and a new loan  program to assist our communities in  developing and redeveloping parks and  recreational facilities.  As a former mayor, I have seen firsthand the value that investing in parks  brings to our communities. When we  make  investments  in our parks,  it  leads  to healthy,  vibrant neighborhoods in which businesses want to invest and  families want to  live. Our  parks and recreational centers are also  instrumental in helping to achieve the  important national goal of increasing  exercise and in providing recreational  opportunities for our youth and disabled or injured veterans.  The Community Parks Revitalization  Act has the support of many national  organizations, including the National  Recreation and Park Association and  the American Society of Landscape Architects, and it has strong bipartisan  support in the 113th Congress.

These young  people are the  future  leaders of our  State, and it’s exciting to hear about  their ideas and aspirations for making  their communities and our State a better place to live and to work.  As a father of four and personally,  myself, as a product of Montana’s public schools—in fact, from kindergarten  in Bozeman all the way through college  at Montana State University—I know  that Montana’s students have so much  potential. Our oldest daughter, Annie,  will be graduating from Montana State  University this fall with a degree in elementary education. That’s why  it’s  critical that they have access to quality education and training that prepares them to pursue careers and goals  they are passionate about.  We must work towards commonsense  reforms that empower our schools and  teachers to innovate and address our  students’ unique needs. No two students or schools are the same. More  local and State input and less Federal  bureaucracy will help provide our educators with the flexibility they need to  help our kids learn. I am looking forward to our upcoming debate on how  we can work to improve our education  system.

240,House,113,-0.343,8,2013-07-17,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Madam  Speaker, this week, over 650,000 civilian employees of the Department of  Defense are required to begin taking  involuntary furlough days. Over 25,000  of these employees reside in San Diego.  This represents about a 20 percent pay  cut for the next 3 months for these  public servants. This pay cut is in addition to the fact that Federal employees  have not received their standard salary  adjustments for the past 3 years.  These salary cuts have a very damaging effect on the employees and on  their families, an effect which should  be clear to all of us; but they also have  disastrous secondary effects. I am worried  particularly  about  the  impact  these cuts will have on the recruitment  and retention of the civilian workforce.  As one of my San Diegan constituents  in the Federal workforce said:  Furloughs send a very demoralizing and  humiliating message to all Federal employees, one that suggests that we are not valued  and that the work we do is not valued.  We must do better. We can start by  appointing  budget  conferees  immediately.  f  IN SUPPORT OF AUTHORITY FOR  MANDATE  DELAY  ACT  AND  FAIRNESS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES ACT  (Mr. MARCHANT  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

The  administration announced by way of a  blog post that it could not implement  the  employer mandate by  its  legal  deadline despite  repeated assurances  that everything was okay.  It is completely unfair for the administration to grant an extension to businesses but not to individual tax-paying  Americans.  House  Republicans  are  fighting  for all Americans. There  is  still much work to be done. ObamaCare  continues to be a drag on our economic  recovery, leading to fewer choices and  more expensive insurance premiums.

In my home State of  Iowa  alone, 17,480 people will be diagnosed  with cancer this year and 6,420 will lose  their battles with this disease. Like  every State,  Iowa  receives essential  funding from the NIH.  NIH  funds  lifesaving medical  research that is leading to the development of new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer and  other  diseases. The  research  takes  place at thousands of universities, hospitals, cancer centers, and laboratories  across the country, including at the  University  of  Iowa’s Holden  Comprehensive Cancer Center. In addition  to the obvious benefits of combating  cancer and so many other diseases, NIH  funding supports economic activity and  jobs, something we often don’t think  about. In 2012, NIH funding supported  3,934 jobs in Iowa alone.  Funding for cancer research and the  NIH, I believe, must be a top priority.  I urge Congress to support this lifesaving research.  f  OBAMACARE PERMANENT DELAY  (Mrs. WALORSKI  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)

Even after 3 years of preparation,  this law is far from ready for implementation  and  has  proven  to  be  unaffordable. Just today, we  learned  that we have already paid an additional $1 billion in new taxes on the  medical device tax alone. If there is a  delay  enacted  for  businesses,  then  there needs to be a Hoosier delay for  hardworking taxpayers as well. After  all, the American people are the building blocks for our companies. These individuals include parents, young people, single moms, veterans, and seasoned employees. Together, they form  our Nation’s workforce.  In our district in northern Indiana, I  have heard from schools, restaurants,  manufacturers,  and  small  business  owners who strongly oppose this mandate. At the very least, news of this  delay is a relief, but the future is still  clouded with uncertainty as  long as  this law exists. Hoosiers know that a 1-  year delay of the employer mandate,  and even of the individual mandate, is  no more than a Band-Aid.  ObamaCare is a roadblock for American companies. According  to  small  businesses in the Second District, this  law is the number one job killer. That’s  why I ask for the President to permanently delay the health care law.  f  SEQUESTER  (Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2013

246,House,113,0.402,29,2013-07-17,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week the administration announced it  would delay  the  employer mandate  under ObamaCare. Even though the administration does not have the authority to do this, it is a sign that even the  law’s authors are realizing the law is  unworkable.  Under ObamaCare, Americans’ premiums are skyrocketing and employers  are being forced to cut jobs, hours, and  wages. Individuals, families, and businesses all deserve relief from this bad  law.  This  is about  fairness—fairness  for  both hardworking taxpayers and American businesses.  While  I  have  long  opposed  ObamaCare and believe the best solution is full repeal and replacement of  the law, we must pass the Authority  for Mandate Delay Act  to  provide  greater certainty to all Americans.  ",2013
247,House,113,-0.4,29,2013-07-17,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," I want  to thank the gentleman from Michigan.  Most importantly, I’m here today because I want to thank my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle for their  embrace of ObamaCare. After 38 attempts to repeal it, we see at least,  however grudgingly, an acceptance and  understanding of the importance and  significance  of  this  very  important  care.  Whether this embrace is the kiss of  Judas, as some may say, or some may  say this is just merely a charade, I  commend them for understanding that  Medicare  isn’t an entitlement. After  all, it’s the insurance that people have  paid for. Every American knows this  because all they have to do is go to  their pay stub to check it out.  So we thank our colleagues for this  embrace of this very important issue  before us today. I thank them because  I see an opportunity here. I see an opportunity to bring forward the best of  public health, the best of science and  innovation and technology, the best of  entrepreneurialism, kind of like what  the Heritage Foundation came up with  and that a Republican Governor piloted  in a Democratic State, which is what  we now  today  call  the  ‘‘Affordable  Health Care Act.’’  There are studies that suggest that  there is over $700 billion to $800 billion  annually in fraud, abuse, waste, and inefficiencies. Let’s work  together  to  drive out the inefficiencies.  Thanks for the embrace today and  the understanding that if we do this,  we cannot only pay down the national  debt, we can end sequestration and we  can provide an opportunity for our citizens to make sure they live out their  lives in dignity by having the most important program for their retirement—  Medicare—there for the future.  I thank my colleagues.  ",2013

I have to tell you, my constituents  are wanting to know: When did the  President decide he could pick and  choose what laws he’s going to enforce  and what laws he’s going to waive?  Over the course of 3 days, this administration decided they were just going  to waive and rewrite this law, and it  took them 3 years to try to implement  it. I think what we’re seeing is they’re  finally admitting this is a train wreck  and it is not ready for prime time.  However, it is not fair that the President is choosing to protect big business  from ObamaCare, but not hardworking  American taxpayers, individuals, families. It is also eerily similar to the  closed-door manner in which the law  was written and passed. And now that  people are reading it, they’re finding  out what is in it.  This  legislation  before  us  today  would  delay  the  requirements  that  nearly all Americans purchase minimum essential health insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty until 2015.  The delay of the individual mandate is  needed.  Due to the administrative delay of  the employer mandate, my constituents overwhelmingly oppose this law,  and I work each and every day to stop  the harmful  effects  it’s having  on  American families and businesses and  to continue the fight for solutions to  spur economic growth, create new jobs,  and provide a more secure future for all  Americans.  I encourage support of the legislation.  ",2013

Thanks to ObamaCare, premiums in  my home State of Ohio are expected to  increase 88 percent, leaving taxpayers  on the hook for those significant rate  hikes.  Now the administration has decided  to delay only the employer mandate,  while leaving the individual mandate  intact. That is blatantly unfair to my  constituents and all Americans.  Why does  the administration  suddenly  find  it acceptable to give big  companies a better deal than the average Ohioan? Come January 1, individuals could still face stiff penalties if  they do not carry insurance, insurance  an employer may decide they may no  longer provide.

250,House,113,-0.448,36,2013-07-17,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my good friend for the time; and I rise  in strong opposition to the seriously  misnamed  H.R.  2668,  Fairness  for  American Families Act. It’s a lot of baloney. This  is nothing more than a  sorry political stunt that would undermine the critical portions of the Affordable Care Act, which  is already  bringing  enormous  benefits  to  the  American people.  Delaying the individual mandate by 1  year will simply undercut ACA when it  is the time that we must be focusing on  fully  implementing  the  law.  Just  today, we found that the health insurance premiums in New York are going  to fall by an average of 50 percent when  the  exchanges are up and  running.  Other States can do the same thing,  and that is the experience which we’re  finding across the country. This is happening elsewhere.  b1645  I would point out that repealing the  individual mandate  is going to cost  Americans  additional  health  care  costs, not decrease them.  Let us move forward with the implementation. I ask my Republicans colleagues to cooperate with us in that  goal. I ask them to work with us to  better the welfare of the American people by seeing to it that this comes into  law. The Congress has spoken and the  American people approve. I say that it  is time for us to provide real benefits  to the American people rather than  continue playing these sorry and tired  political games.  I say shame on those of us who are  wasting the time of this body. Let us  address the problems of the economy.  Let us deal with jobs, employment. Let  us deal with student loans, where the  interest rate is doubling. Let us see to  it that we implement this law which  will do away with things that are so  hurtful to the American people, such as  having Americans unable to get insurance because they have a preexisting  condition or where insurance companies can cancel a policy because people  are getting sick. It is time for us to  deal with the real problems.  Einstein observed  that  insanity  is  doing the same thing over and over  again with the full expectation that  the results are going to be different,  but getting the same result. I say this  country needs better leadership, better  understanding, and a Congress  that  will work on behalf of the American  people. As I look around, I do not see  that on this floor today.  Again, I say shame. This is a terrible,  terrible waste of the people’s money  and the people’s time. It costs a lot for  us to make this Congress meet and to  conduct its business, and we are wasting that time now with this kind of  nonsensical legislation.  ",2013
251,House,113,0.494,36,2013-07-17,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  I rise in strong support of the Fairness  for American Families Act. As  chairman of the Health, Employment,  Labor, and Pension Subcommittee, I’ve  held three hearings outside the Beltway—one in North Carolina—where we  talked to businesses and  individuals  about the effect of the Affordable Care  Act on them and their businesses.  Let me just tell you about some people that I heard from. One was a divorced server in a restaurant that had  her hours cut from 40 to 29 so that the  company could stay in business. This  woman now is missing an entire week’s  worth of hours every single month. She  can’t pay her bills unless she gets another job. The same problem for adjunct professors at the local community college.  And now, the audacity of what we’ve  done is we’ve forced businesses to cut  these hours, where  they make  less  money, and then penalize you when  you  don’t  buy  something.  That’s  wrong. The right thing to do is to delay  this for both individuals and businesses  so they can work out the problems.  That was the President’s suggestion. I  strongly support this bill.  ",2013
252,House,113,0.343,43,2013-07-17,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, it appears that the Obama administration has finally come to the  conclusion that the employer mandate  in ObamaCare is a job killer.  Many  have  speculated  that  the  Obama  administration’s  decision  to  delay the employer mandate until after  the 2014 election was due to fears that  job  cuts  and hour  reductions  that  would result from the mandate’s implementation would negatively impact the  President’s party at the polls.  It does seem that those fears are justified. Recently,  the Teamsters and  other labor groups wrote to Senate Majority Leader HARRYREID and House  Democrat Leader NANCYPELOSIstating  that the implementation of ObamaCare  put at risk the 40-hour workweek, the  health care, and the take-home pay of  their members.  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the Teamsters that the employer mandate is a  job killer. Eliminating the employer  mandate would not stop the individual  mandate which requires every American to purchase government-approved  insurance  that  they may not want,  that they can’t afford, and may not be  provided by their employers or otherwise they have to pay a penalty. Is that  fair to American families?  The legislation, Mr. Speaker, that we  are considering today would give every  American—every American—the same  1-year reprieve from ObamaCare that  the President has offered to businesses.  Because we extend this help to all of  the American people, the President has  threatened to veto this bill.  Mr. Speaker, the President is not a  king. He is the President. He does not  have the authority to change the law  and to delay the employer mandate on  his own. Congress must give him that  authority.  I would say to the President that we  will  delay  the  job-killing  employer  mandate, as he has asked, and we will  also extend the same relief to all of the  American people.  The President and Members of Congress who vote against this bill will  have to explain to the American people  why they heard the concerns of business but not those of the people. We  have heard the people, we share their  concerns, we stand with them, and I  would urge all of my colleagues to  stand with them as well and to support  this very vital legislation.  ",2013

255,House,113,-0.299,57,2013-07-17,Ms. TITUS.," Madam Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from  California  for  yielding me time, and I also thank him  for organizing this Special Order.  We’ve heard a lot on this floor and in  the press and  from our constituents  about the moral, the social, the political reasons for us to enact comprehensive  immigration  reform,  but  we  haven’t done enough talking about the  economic aspects, so this is a good opportunity do that.  I’m very pleased to say that, in the  Senate version of the comprehensive  immigration reform bill, there is a provision that has to do with increasing  H–1B visas. Those visas will bring with  them increased jobs, which, of course,  support the economy.  A second part of that provision is  also something that I’ve been urging  my colleagues on the House side who  are working on the comprehensive immigration reform bill to include, and  that provision would use the revenue  from these high-skilled H–1B visas to  promote STEM education at minority-  serving colleges and universities. You  can just look at this chart and see how  many new jobs will be created both in  2013 and 2014 by the increase in the  number of these visas that would be allowed.  If we increase the number of visas,  we’re  also  going  to  increase  the  amount of funds that come from companies that are willing to pay to bring  people from outside the country here  for these STEM jobs. I say let’s use  those funds both to create scholarships  for low-income minority students who  are pursuing STEM degrees and also to  provide funding for American colleges  and universities that serve those minority students. We want our new citizens to also be well-prepared citizens.  There are colleges and universities  all across the country, including several in the First District of Nevada,  that are working hard to attract students to the STEM fields. Earlier this  year, the College of Southern Nevada  hosted approximately 3,000 K through  12 Nevada  students at  their annual  science and  technology expo  to get  local students  from all backgrounds,  including our minority communities,  excited about careers in STEM fields  before they enter college. Then in January, the University of Nevada, Las  Vegas hosted a STEM summit to feature STEM research and to get students involved in presenting that research and their work in the STEM  fields.  These are significant and important  efforts to promote STEM, but our colleges and universities need our help to  expand and improve their STEM outreach and training. By increasing access to STEM education, we can help  American and immigrant students gain  the knowledge and skills they need in  the sciences, technology, math, and engineering so they can compete for the  jobs of tomorrow.  This is particularly critical for minority students, who are significantly  underrepresented  in these  fields. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in  the 2009 American Community Survey,  only 12 percent of STEM workers in  this country are African American or  Hispanic. We can and should be doing  better, because a strong STEM workforce is important to American innovation and competitiveness.  So science and technology companies  that  are  paying  our  government  through  the H–1B visa program  to  bring  foreign workers to the United  States to fill these STEM jobs should  be making a contribution. Why not use  these  funds  that  they’re paying  to  train Americans to have the skills to  fill these jobs in the future? Providing  scholarships  to STEM  students and  granting funding to colleges and universities that serve minority communities  to  improve  STEM  programs  would strengthen our educational system. It would help our economy and  also our position as a global leader in  science and technology.  So I would urge the Republican leadership  to  immediately  take up  the  mantle of reform, make it law, and include these provisions for these high-  tech visas, using the funding for the  visas then to train our own students,  many  in minority communities,  including the children of those  immigrants that we are working to help, for  the jobs of the future.  Fixing our broken immigration system is not just a moral imperative,  but, as we are all discussing tonight,  it’s an economic necessity.  Mr. CA´RDENAS. Thank you very  much, Congresswoman TITUS.  It’s really important for us to understand and recognize the diversity of  people who are speaking on this issue  today, but the one common theme is  the fact that economically this is the  right  thing  to do. There are many  other reasons why we need to fix our  broken  immigration system, but the  number one benefit to every American  citizen in this country is going to be  economic growth for every corner of  our country.  With that, I  invite to the podium  Congresswoman SINEMAfrom Arizona.  ",2013
256,House,113,-0.109,57,2013-07-17,Ms. SINEMA.," Thank you, Congressman CA´RDENAS, for being a leader on  this issue and for inviting me to speak  today.  Madam Speaker, Arizona is Ground  Zero for the Federal Government’s failure to address our immigration crisis  with a comprehensive solution. Arizona  has been waiting too long already. We  deserve a solution now.  Comprehensive  immigration  reform  is the number one issue about which I  receive constituent feedback. Over 70  percent of the feedback encourages us  to get comprehensive reform done. In  short, my district wants us to get to  ‘‘yes.’’  In our State, there is broad agreement among businesses and towns that  conduct  international  trade,  among  schools that recruit international talent, among  local chambers of commerce;  there’s agreement  that comprehensive reform is an economic imperative. For  this  reason,  Senator  MCCAINand Senator FLAKEled a bipartisan effort in the Senate to pass a  comprehensive  bill.  Our  Senators  worked across the aisle to get this  done.  Senator MCCAINand Senator FLAKE  understand that securing the border is  a critical component of comprehensive  reform. Controlling our borders prevents dangerous criminal cartels who  traffic guns, drugs, and people from entering our country. It also creates an  opportunity for those who want to do  good to join us and contribute to our  economy.  Business leaders at home agree that  comprehensive  immigration  reform  will help us meet our labor demands. It  will create opportunities for us to recruit and invest in the world’s top talent. This much-needed reform will fortify our international trade relationship with Mexico. That’s Arizona’s and  one of America’s largest trading partners.  Mayors in my community are unified. They believe a hyperpoliticized  border is bad for business and it’s bad  for our economy.  We can no longer continue to educate  young dreamers, cultivate their talent,  and then send them to a different country where they’re competing with us.  Their pathway to citizenship is vital  for our economy.  When hardworking families are able  to come out of the shadows and take  part in the American Dream, our community grows stronger.  Arizona’s families and our economy  depend on the U.S. House’s commitment to a bipartisan solution. I call on  my colleagues in both parties to put  aside ideology and work to find a workable, practical, and pragmatic solution.  Arizona has been waiting too long already. We owe it to our State to pass  immigration reform this year.  Thank you, Congressman, for yielding time to me to speak on this important issue.  Mr. CA´RDENAS. Thank you, Congresswoman SINEMA.  It’s really important for us to also  recognize that there are many industries that you might not think of that  have to do with benefiting the economy  as a whole for your community. If you  have any activity of tourism in your  community, you need to understand  that  comprehensive  immigration  reform is going to benefit you, as well.  With that, I invite Congresswoman  GABBARDto take the floor.  ",2013

To reflect on the junior Senator’s comments about the EPA nominee Gina McCarthy, who has not only  worked in Connecticut but in Massachusetts, she has surrounded my State  of Rhode Island. We have had plenty, I  would say, indirect exposure to her. I  think she is terrific. I could not agree  more with the Senator’s comments. I  look forward to a swift confirmation  for her to get to work rapidly on the  issue that brings me to the floor again  for the 39th time, which is to try to get  this body to wake up to the threat of  climate change.  SENATORMARKEY  Speaking of Massachusetts,  I will  also welcome our new Senator  from  Massachusetts, my New England neighbor EDMARKEY. For decades Ed has  been a passionate leader in Congress on  energy and environmental issues. He  has been a true champion on climate  change. He and I serve as cochairs of  the Bicameral Task Force on Climate  Change, along with our colleagues Representative  and  Senator  CARDIN. So I really  look  forward to  continuing to work alongside now-Senator Markey to forge commonsense solutions to the crisis of climate change.  WAXMAN CLIMATECHANGE  We need common sense in a place  where the barricade of special interest  influence has blocked action on climate change and where even the debate  itself is polluted—polluted with falsehood and fallacy and fantasy. Look no  further than the Republican response  to the announcement  last month of  President Obama’s national climate action plan.  The President described in his speech  some of  the overwhelming evidence  that our planet  is changing. The 12  warmest years in recorded history have  all come in the last 15 years, he said.  Last year temperatures in some areas  of the ocean reached record highs, and  ice in the Arctic sank to its smallest  size on record faster than most models  had predicted it would. These are the  facts. That is what the President said.  Here in the Senate, the President’s  facts were challenged. Those are not  the facts, Mr. President, flatly replied  one of my Republican colleagues. It is  not even true. So  let’s  look. Where  were  the  facts and where were  the  falsehoods?  Well, according to NASA, the President had the facts right on warming.  Indeed, he may actually have understated the severity of global warming.  In fact, the 13 hottest years on record—  the red ones—have all occurred in the  last 15 years. The 13 hottest years on  record have been in the last 15 years.  I remind my colleagues that NASA is  the organization that right now is driving a rover around on Mars. We might  want to consider that these are scientists who know what they are talking about.  As to ocean temperatures—the other  part  of  the President’s  assertion—  NOAA says that ‘‘sea surface temperatures in the northeast shelf’s large marine ecosystem during 2012 were the  highest recorded  in 150 years.’’ The  President’s facts were right again. This  chart from the National Snow and Ice  Data Center at the University of Colorado shows, just as the President said,  that ‘‘the 2012 early sea ice melt in the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:27 Jul 18, 2013 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17JY6.061 S17JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2013

Pattea, a  lifelong advocate  for Native  American sovereignty, president of  the Fort  McDowell Yavapai Nation, and  former chairman of the Arizona Commission of Indian Affairs.  As a state  legislator,  I worked with Dr.  Pattea on issues important to our local communities, where his passion for education and  providing educational resources to the underserved was  renowned. Dr. Pattea  tirelessly  sought to fund scholarships for native peoples  across the state and in my district at Arizona  State University, where I am an Adjunct Professor in the School of Social Work.  Elected  to  the Yavapai Tribal Council  in  1960, Dr. Pattea thereafter led a decade-long  campaign  to stop construction of  the Orme  Dam, which would have flooded 17,000 acres  of tribal lands. The victory is celebrated annually, as is Sovereignty Day, commemorating a  peaceful standoff  led by Dr. Pattea against  federal agents seeking to seize Yavapai property. The non-violent protest led to the negotiation with Governor Fife Symington of a pact  considered a national victory for Native self-  determination.  Dr. Pattea will be missed by all who knew  him, and will be remembered by his family, his  Nation, the state of Arizona, and Native people everywhere. I ask that my colleagues join  me in posthumously recognizing Dr. Pattea for  his dedicated service  to his community, as  well as in grieving with his family and the Fort  McDowell Yavapai Nation at  the passing of  their leader.

260,,113,0.367,127,2013-07-17,Mr. BONNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to praise  a true American hero, retired Army Sergeant  Major Howard Bakeman, who passed away on  June 1, 2013, at the age 95.  A veteran of World War  II, Mr. Bakeman  survived  the attack on Pearl Harbor while  serving as a staff sergeant at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. Remarkably, two of his brothers were also stationed at Pearl Harbor during  the Japanese attack and all  three survived.  After  the war, he  remained  in  the Army  through peace-time and was again called to  action in 1950 to serve his country in the Korean conflict.  In 1959, he was promoted  to Sergeant  Major, serving nine more years before fulfilling  his obligation to Uncle Sam.  After completing his active duty  tour, Mr.  Bakeman moved to Mobile in 1968 where he  worked for two years as an Army ROTC instructor at Citronelle High School. During his  time in Citronelle, he was recognized for having the largest number of Army cadets to enlist from any of the schools in Mobile County.  Mr. Bakeman’s dedication to duty was typical of many who served during what is often  described as  ‘the greatest generation.’ ’ He  loved what he did and  looked at his  time  served as an adventure. In an interview early  last year with Mobile’s Fox 10 television, he  observed, ‘ ‘I didn ’t have to pay for anything.

Remember where you  are living. Respect authority and respect the  flag. Now if they can ’t do that, they better pack  and haul it.

261,House,113,0.405,2,2013-07-24,Mr. RIGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I come to  the floor this morning to call for a  change in the House calendar.  Mr. Speaker, leaders set priorities.  They identify the challenges and opportunities that  face their organization, then they assess them and put  them in the right order, and then they  align their organization’s calendar to  make sure that those top priorities get  addressed. That’s what the American  people rightfully expect of each of us.  Overall, our calendar and the priorities of the House are right on track.  I’m so proud of the  legislation that  we’ve passed that would move America  to energy independence and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.  But in one very critical area we’re seriously off track. Our calendar does not  reflect the challenges and the top priorities of our  country. Specifically,  we’re not on track to pass all 12 appropriations bills that fund the Federal  Government for 2014.  The fact is, we’re not even close to  passing those bills. And with our current congressional calendar, I cannot  possibly see a way that we can pass  those bills by September 30, which is  the end of the current fiscal year.  This is not without consequence. It  damages our economy, job creation. It  damages our military in a very real  way. And ultimately,  it hurts hardworking American families.  Now, let’s look at the status of the 12  bills, and then look at the time that remains on the congressional calendar to  debate and pass those bills in time to  avoid what’s  referred  to as a  continuing resolution.  And make no mistake here. A continuing resolution is wholly inadequate  as a financial vehicle to fund this government. It has serious adverse consequences, and that’s why this topic  merits the careful attention of this  body, and that’s why it merits a change  in our congressional calendar.  Well, here are the 12 bills that must  be passed. We’ve passed four of them.  Well,  that  leaves eight. My math’s  pretty good—there are 12 bills, 4 have  been completed.  Now, they’re not past due right now,  but they surely will be, at least some  of them.  As I mentioned, this has serious repercussions. I’ve spent a tremendous  amount of time in our district listening  to  the  hardworking men  and  women who keep our country safe and  those who support them.  Every time we pass a continuing resolution, our military reels with uncertainty. We have a deep obligation to  the young men and women around the  world who are keeping this country  safe to use every dollar wisely to ensure that we get the very best equipment and support to each of them.  That’s why I feel so strongly about  this issue, and it burdens me when we  fail the American people in this respect.  Well, let’s look on at the calendar  and see what we’ve got to work with  here.  b1015  Mr. Speaker, we have 15 calendar  days. They’re indicated right here in  the teal green color. These areas here  represent constituent work periods. I  work really hard  in our constituent  work periods. I know that every Member here does. It’s important that we’re  in our districts. There’s value to that—  to listen and to be accountable to the  good folks who sent us here.

262,House,113,0.513,9,2013-07-24,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I was  interested today to hear that the President was going to give a speech about  the economy. After all, Republicans  have a plan for growth and jobs. We’ve  been focused on that plan, and we certainly welcome the President’s ideas.  But the White House says not to expect any new proposals in this speech.  The President himself  said  it  isn’t  going to change any minds. All right,  so exactly what will change? What’s  the point? What’s it going to accomplish? I’ve probably got the answer:  nothing.  It’s a hollow shell.  It’s an  Easter egg with no candy in it.  If the President wants to help, he  ought to approve the Keystone pipeline  that has bipartisan support here in the  House. He ought to work with the bipartisan majority to delay the health  care bill to give the American people,  their  families,  and  individuals  the  same break he wants to give to big  businesses. And  he  ought  to  stop  threatening to shut down the government unless we raise taxes. Because  Americans aren’t asking, Where are  the speeches? They’re asking, Where  are the jobs?  f  ANNIVERSARY  OF  DEATHS  OF  CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS JOHN  GIBSON AND JACOB CHESTNUT  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

263,House,113,0.459,9,2013-07-24,Mr. GIBBS.," Mr. Speaker, I come to  the floor today to talk about the benefits of cancer research and the importance of  the National  Institutes of  Health, or NIH.  In my home State of Ohio, over 66,000  people will be diagnosed with cancer  this year and over 25,000 will lose their  battle with this devastating disease.  Like every State, Ohio receives essential funding from the NIH each year.  The NIH funds lifesaving medical research leading to the development of  innovative ways to prevent, diagnose,  and treat cancer. This research takes  place at universities, hospitals, cancer  centers, and labs across my State, including the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and the James Cancer Center at Ohio State University.  In addition to the benefits of combating cancer and so many other diseases, NIH funding also produces tens  of billions of dollars in new economic  activity across the country. According  to the Ohio Council of Medical Deans,  every dollar invested in biomedical research translates to a $2.21 investment  in the local economy. In 2012 alone,  Ohio received almost $800 million in  NIH  funding, which  supported more  than 13,000 jobs.  Cancer is a disease that does not discriminate against age or race. Many  people have friends or loved ones who  have been affected by this terrible disease. I urge my colleagues to support  cancer research.  f  b1215  DEVASTATING FUNDING CUTS TO  COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT  BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

265,House,113,0.584,37,2013-07-24,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Madam Chair, I  thank the gentleman on the other side  of the aisle, my friend.  These  prisoners  included  trained  fighters and ideological extremists who  are expected to travel to Syria to join  the fight with the rebels.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, the top military officer in the  United States, Martin Dempsey, has  warned us that intervening in Syria  could assist Islamist extremists, helping them gain access to chemical weapons and biological weapons and further  erode United States military readiness  already suffering  from sharp defense  budget cuts. He has said that using  force is ‘‘no less than an act of war,’’  and stated that some of the military  options for Syria may not be feasible  without  compromising U.S.  security  elsewhere.  He made reference to the chaos in  Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein  and Libya after Qadhafi. He warned of  the unintended consequences if Assad  fell without having a viable opposition.  He said ‘‘we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very  chemical weapons we seek to control.’’  This is a hub for jihadist activity.  The American taxpayer has no obligation. In fact, I say this body must protect the American taxpayer from being  involved in arming al Qaeda in Syria.  We must defeat this effort, and that’s  why I’m in support of this today.  Again, we have the major general  from the Israeli military intelligence,  and he said that right before our eyes  the center of global jihad is developing;  let’s not do it. I agree with him.

268,House,113,0.4,44,2013-07-24,Mr. ROGERS of Michigan.," I thank  the gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, I think the American  people and, certainly, some well-intentioned Members in this Chamber have  legitimate concerns. They should be  addressed. We should have time and  education on what actually happens in  the particular program of which we  speak.  I will pledge to each one of you today  and give you my word that this fall,  when we do the  Intel authorization  bill, that we will work to find additional privacy protections with  this  program which  have  no  email,  no  phone calls, no names, and no addresses.  Fourteen Federal judges have said,  yes, this comports with the Constitution; 800 cases around the 1979 case  have affirmed the underpinnings of the  legality of this case—800. So 14 judges  are wrong, and 800 different cases are  wrong. The legislators on both Intelligence committees—Republicans and  Democrats—are all wrong.  Why is it that people of both parties  came together and looked at this program at a time when our Nation was  under siege by those individuals who  wanted to bring violence to the shores  of the United States?  It is that those who know it best support the program because we spend as  much time on this to get it right, to  make sure the oversight is right. No  other  program  has  the  legislative  branch, the judicial branch, and the executive branch doing the oversight of a  program like this. If we had this in the  other agencies, we would not have  problems.  Think about who we are in this body.  Have 12 years gone by and our memories faded so badly that we’ve forgotten  what happened on September 11?  This bill turns off a very specific program. It doesn’t stop so-called  ‘‘spying’’ and other things that this has  been alleged to do. That’s not what’s  happening. It’s not a surveillance bill.  It’s not monitoring. It doesn’t do any  of those things.  What happened after September 11  that we didn’t know on September 10—  again, passing this amendment takes  us back to September 10, and afterwards we said, wow, there is a seam, a  gap—was somebody leading up to the  September 11 attacks who was a terrorist overseas, called a  ‘‘terrorist,’’  living amongst us in the United States,  and we missed  it because we didn’t  have this capability.  What if we’d have caught it?  The good news is we don’t have to  what-if. It’s not theoretical. Fifty-four  times  this  and  the  other  program  stopped and thwarted terrorist attacks  both here and in Europe—saving real  lives. This isn’t a game. This is real. It  will have a real consequence. This is  hard.  Think about the people who came  here before us  in this great body—  Madison,  Lincoln,  Kennedy  served  here—and about the issues they dealt  with and about the politics of  ‘‘big’’  and of moving America forward while  upholding the article I mandate to this  House in that we must provide for the  general defense of the United States.  Think of those challenges. Think of  those challenges that they met.  Are we so small that we can only  look at our Facebook ‘‘likes’’ today in  this Chamber, or are we going to stand  up and find out how many lives we can  save?  Let us get back to the big politics of  protecting America  and  of moving  America forward. Soundly reject this  amendment. Let’s do this right in the  Intel authorization bill.  ",2013

270,House,113,-0.658,44,2013-07-24,Mr. CONYERS.,"  I  thank  tleman for yielding to me.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House,  this amendment will not stop the proper use of the PATRIOT Act or stop the  FISA authorities from conducting terrorism and intelligence investigations.  I’d never block that.  All this amendment is intending to  do is to curtail the ongoing dragnet  collection and storage of the personal  records of innocent Americans. It does  not defund the NSA, and it will continue to allow them to conduct full-  fledged surveillance as long as it relates to an actual investigation.  Our joining together on this bipartisan  amendment  demonstrates  our  joint commitment to ensure that our  fight against terrorism and espionage  follows the rule of law and the clear intent of the statutes passed by this Congress. I urge my colleagues on both  sides of  the aisle  to vote  for  this  amendment.  I rise in support of this amendment, which I  am  cosponsoring with my  colleague  from  Michigan, Representative JUSTINAMASH.  This amendment will prevent mass collection of personal records, such as phone calling  information, under Section 215 of  the USA  PATRIOT Act. When Congress passed and  later revised this provision, we did not intend  for it to authorize the bulk, indiscriminate collection of personal  information of  individuals  not under investigation.  However, we have learned that this law has  been misused  to allow  the collection of call  detail information on every phone call made in  the United States under a bizarre interpretaSENBRENNER,  tion of  the statute’s authorization  to collect  ‘relevant ’ ’  information. As my colleague and  author of the statute, Representative JIMSENhas  stated,  ‘This  expansive  characterization of relevance makes a mockery of the legal standard. ’ ’  This amendment will not stop  the proper  use of PATRIOT Act and FISA authorities to  conduct  terrorism and  intelligence  investigations. All this amendment is intended to do is  curtail the ongoing dragnet collection and storage of the personal records of innocent Americans.  It does not defund  the NSA, and  it  would continue to allow them to conduct full  fledged surveillance as long as it relates to an  actual investigation.

272,House,113,0.561,58,2013-07-24,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," I’ve got  one last poster that I wanted to point  out, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues. It’s  a little complicated. I’ll try to make it  as simple as I can.  Basically, let’s start right here with  the employer. Under that, in this diagram, fewer than 50 full-time employees,  including  full-time  equivalents,  then no employer penalty for offering a  health  insurance benefit. But  in the  most egregious situation, the employer  has 50 or more full-time employees, including full-time equivalents, and the  employer decides not to offer coverage.  If a tax credit is obtained by at least  one of those full-time employees in an  exchange, then the annual penalty to  that employer is $2,000 for the year—  not just for that one, but for every single employee that he or she employs. It  could be hundreds; it could be thousands.  ",2013
273,House,113,0.618,65,2013-07-24,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentlelady  from Minnesota  for yielding,  and I appreciate the delivery you make  and  understanding  in  driving  this  issue. If a few of us don’t stand up and  drive this issue and remind, Mr. Speaker, that the American people observe  what  we  do  here—and  they  are  thoughtful, they’re intelligent, they’re  analytical, and they understand the  history of this country, and they don’t  want to have somebody feed them a  line. They want to know the squared-  away truth. That’s why I dig down into  a bill like S. 744, the Gang of Eight’s  bill in the Senate, and take it apart  and analyze it and put it back together  and come down with this conclusion.  From the beginning, I called it the  Always  is, Always Was, and Always  Will Be Amnesty Act. The reason I say  that is because you’d have to just kind  of have a little bit of license with our  grammar. But if you is in America, you  get to stay. If you was in America, you  get an invitation to come back. And if  you ever get here, you always will get  to stay here. So it’s the Always Is, Always Was, and Always Will Be Amnesty Act.  If that doesn’t trip your biblical trigger, then I can describe it this way in  more secular terms. It is the Perpetual  and Retroactive Amnesty Act, which  means it was on forever and it also invites the people who have been deported in the past. It says, We really  didn’t mean it. If we deported you in  the past, it was by a mistake that we  didn’t  realize because our President  hadn’t been elected yet, and he hadn’t  decided that he was going to violate his  constitutional oath and grant this executive edict that’s called the ‘‘Morton  Memos’’ that legalizes the people that  are here.  I would remind you, Mr. Speaker,  that we had 400,000 people that were adjudicated for removal in this country,  and the President issued an order and  used our precious resources to go back  and comb through the records again,  and that directive said, Look at them  on an individual basis. The reason they  do that  is because they claim they  have prosecutorial discretion. If they  deal with individuals, then they cannot  enforce the law. But If they have to put  it  into classes of people, then they  know that they don’t have prosecutorial discretion from a legal point.  So  they  use  resources  to  comb  through those 400,000 names of people  to find ways they can waive the application of the law. That’s amnesty by  executive  edict,  and  it’s  using  resources to grant that. It didn’t matter  that they were young or old. If they  hadn’t committed a felony and been  caught at it, or if they didn’t commit  and been caught at these three mysterious misdemeanors, they were going  to get the application of the law, which  was removal. They were just waiting  for their final removal order, and so  the President believed that he had the  constitutional authority to grant this  amnesty.  Now, this was just the precursor to  the balance of  the Morton Memos,  which are the DREAM Act lite, so to  speak,  this  executive  edict  for  the  DREAM Act. And it then sets up four  categories of people, generally young  people, but now we see, according to  the Gang of Eight’s bill, age up to 35. If  up to age 35, if you want to test that  you came to America, say, before your  16th birthday or your 18th birthday, depending on which policy you want to  take—now, it really wasn’t your fault;  it was your parents’ decision.  Well, it reminds me of a long shirttail relation who found himself in jail  on Christmas Eve, and his father decided he would bail him out and bring  him home for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Christmas dinner, and take  him back to the jail where he belonged  again. When his father showed up, let  me say this uncooperative son was so  resentful that he said to his father, It’s  not my fault, Dad, it’s your fault because you controlled everything. You  controlled my genes and you controlled  my environment. I didn’t control either one. I’m a product of nature and  nurture, and you are the one who produced the nature and nurture; therefore it’s your fault that I’m in jail. I  can tell you what his father said: You  can stay in jail if you think it’s not  your responsibility and think it over.  Well, I heard this new theory come in  the committee here just yesterday, I  guess it was, that young people can’t  form  intent. I wondered about that.  That was a bit of a new theory for me.  We do prosecute intent in this country  and we prosecute intent of juveniles.  ",2013

I would like to thank Chairman YOUNGand  Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for including report  language  I  submitted  to  the  Subcommittee on Defense regarding the DP3 program. I am proud to note that one of the management companies that helps make this program successful  is  located  in my congressional district.  Both the Chairman and the Ranking Member have  long standing commitments  to  improving the quality of life of military members  and their families. Our members of the military  are required to make countless moves during  their military  service. Providing high-quality  moves that provide satisfaction to the service  member and his/her family is important to morale, well-being and retention.  The Department of Defense also understands the tremendous challenges associated  with completing the countless number of defense personal property moves. Because of  dissatisfaction and nightmares associated with  previous military personal property movement  programs, the Department of Defense adopted  the Defense Personal Property Program with  the goal of achieving efficient, satisfactory,  and seamless military moves.  My purpose in speaking today is to note the  significant  contributions  that  management  companies are making  to DP3 by assisting  transportation  service  providers  to  reduce  costs and improve the quality of each military  move. While  improving  these critical moves,  DP3 has improved the quality of life enabling  higher levels of personnel readiness.  Madam Chair, again, I offer my thanks to  the Chairman and Ranking Member of  the  Subcommittee on Defense for their inclusion  of this important language on the DP3 and for  allowing me  the opportunity  to comment on  the  important role  that management companies play in the success of this program.  f  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2014  SPEECHOF  HON.

286,,113,-0.31,149,2013-07-24,Ms. ESTY.," Madam Chair, my amendment  would add five million dollars for support services for members of the National Guard and  Reserve to the Defense-Wide Operations and  Maintenance account in Title IX of the bill.  To prevent an  increase  in spending,  the  funding for suicide prevention is offset by reducing the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund  by thirty-eight million dollars. This amendment  is not only fiscally responsible, but urgent and  timely.  The cover of Time Magazine from exactly  one year ago today described the tragedy of  military suicide with the simple headline: ‘ ‘One  a Day. ’ ’  It drew attention  to  the grim reality  that military suicide rates were at record levels. By year ’s end, a record  three-hundred-  and-fifty active duty troops committed suicide  in 2012, amounting to almost one suicide per  day. We lost more troops to suicide than we  did to combat.  One year  later,  these  rates have barely  budged. The Department of Defense reported  one-hundred-and-sixty-one potential  suicides  among active-duty service members, reservists and National Guard members  through  April. This  is a pace of one suicide every  eighteen hours.  We owe far better to those who wear the  uniform and serve this nation.  I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member  for their leadership on this issue. Your tireless,  bipartisan commitment to suicide prevention is  reflected in the additional twenty-million dollars  for the Suicide Prevention Office provided in  this bill.  My amendment seeks only to bolster your  efforts by strengthening outreach and awareness programs to combat stigma and improve  access  to  resources. As  the chairman has  often reminded us, we should focus our efforts  on prevention. This amendment gives our outreach and prevention programs greater support to assist service members in need. It is  our job to serve our troops as well as they  serve us. We cannot —we must not —wait; it’s  up to us to act.  I urge Members to support this amendment.

As you know, TBI continues to be the signature wound of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with some 100,000  troops diagnosed  since 2003 with mild TBI. This number will  only increase as detection becomes more accurate. The Department of Defense has made  significant  strides  in  improving assessment  and diagnosis, but more needs to be done to  evaluate troops’ ability to return to duty and to  follow them after exposure to blasts. Intensive  and innovative rehabilitative care is also needed for those sustaining severe TBIs and left  with varying levels of disorders of consciousness.  This year ’s Defense Health Program  receives an  increase above  last year’s  level.  Specifically,  the bill contains $33.6 billion—  $858 million above  the  fiscal year 2013 enacted level —for the Defense Health Program  to provide for the health of our troops and retirees.  Increases above  the  request  importantly include $125 million for traumatic brain  injury and psychological health research, and  $20 million  for suicide prevention outreach  programs.  Our men and women serving  in uniform  must be given every possible opportunity for  the best medical care, rehabilitation and community reentry assistance that we as a nation  can provide.  It  is  important  these  funds be  used wisely  to ensure  that our men and  women in uniform are getting timely and proper care. Pre and post deployment testing, as  well as long term care and family services are  integral parts of preventing and  treating TBI  and PH. As a Congress, we must live up to  our commitment to our troops when they leave  the battlefield and in my capacity as co-Chair  of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force,  I  look  forward  to working with  the DoD  to  make sure these funds are used effectively to  address these invisible wounds.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

It  is  with a heavy heart that I rise to recognize the loss of a true legend in Louisiana, Ambassador and  former Representative Lindsay Boggs.  She was the perfect example of leadership—never afraid to fight for justice  and to demand equality. She took the  responsibility of service seriously, addressing the plight of everyday people,  and the State of Louisiana and our Nation are better for it. She was a first-  class woman who enjoyed numerous  firsts and was an effective legislator.  She loved this body, earning the respect of her colleagues on both sides of  the aisle, which  is exemplified here  today  through Congressman SCALISE  and me, and she loved her family—a  role model for all of us.  During Women’s History Month this  year, we were able to recognize former  Ambassador Boggs on her 97th birthday  with a tribute, which was led by our  leader, Leader PELOSI.  Mr. Speaker, after words from Leader  PELOSI, I would just ask that we have  a moment of silence in recognition of  the great contribution and sacrifice of  a true, remarkable Louisiana citizen  who, I think, displayed what was best  of the best in Louisiana.  f  REMEMBERING LINDY BOGGS  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

293,House,113,-0.491,5,2013-07-31,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlemen for the kind words that  they have said about our former colleague, Congresswoman Lindy Boggs,  and I associate myself with their remarks.  I will only add that bipartisanship  was the nature of how Lindy Boggs led  and served in this body. When we would  have our heated discussions on  the  floor, she would call us back and say,  ‘‘Darlin’, Hale used  to always  say,  ‘Don’t fight every fight as if it’s your  last fight.’’’ We are all friends. We are  a resource to each other to do good  things for our country. No wonder a  room is named for her, a room that has  shared bipartisan enjoyment and participation, in which we have come together as Democrats and Republicans  to bring about solutions.  It was referenced that we had a bipartisan tribute to her on her birthday,  March 13. I think you would find some  joy in the fact that, as a devout Catholic, on her birthday, which was when  we planned to have the tribute, it was  the day that white smoke went up in  the chimney in Rome. So, for her birthday, we could also celebrate a new  Pope, Pope Francis. What better gift  for her than to enjoy that on her birthday?  All of us are mourning and will be in  New Orleans for her service tomorrow.  Our prayers go to her family. I hope  it’s a comfort to them to know that so  many people  loved Lindy Boggs and  share their grief and are praying for  them at this time.  f  ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF NATURAL  GAS PRODUCTION  (Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

You set  the schedule, and you put together the  work agenda. The simple truth is that  this Congress is being recognized as the  least productive or accomplished in the  history of this country. We have an appropriations bill; we have budget bills;  we have the farm bill; we have immigration; we have the President’s jobs  bill; we have the debt ceiling limit; we  have Members of Congress threatening  to  shut  down  the  government—and  we’re going on a recess? It makes no  sense whatsoever.  It’s time that this Congress goes to  work, puts the subcommittees to work,  goes to work 5 days a week like everybody else in America, and does its job.  Put America back to work. Rebuild the  middle class. Get this country moving  again.

Will the quality of your health care  depend on whether or not you support  the President’s political views? The  IRS has already targeted conservative  political groups. Will this intimidation  be intensified once the IRS is enforcing  ObamaCare?  Is Sarah Hall Ingram, the IRS bureaucrat who previously managed the  tax  exemption  department,  really  qualified to run the  IRS-ObamaCare  enforcement division? Abuse of American citizens occurred on her watch. Is  anyone worried—at least a little bit—  that she now oversees our health care  decisions?  Mr. Speaker, the IRS has forfeited  any claim to impartiality and has violated the trust of the American people.  The IRS must not be involved in the  health care decisions of ordinary Americans. On Friday, I urge you to join me  in supporting H.R. 2009, the Keep the  IRS Off Your Health Care Act.

I hear about protecting rights all the  time and how important it is for the  government to be able to do the things  that they need to do. Let me tell you  what it’s like as a private citizen to be  sitting  in your office and getting a  phone call from somebody that says,  I’m sitting here in Detroit, I’m recording this, and I have a lawyer sitting beside me because we’re going to put you  out of business today.  And my response was, Give me a little bit of time. Let me get my lawyer,  and let me get a tape recorder and tape  what you’re saying to me.  Now what’s  right  anymore? Boy,  have we confused things. Is this a government that works for the people or  people that work for the government?  My goodness, have we gotten things  out of focus here.  We think we are so powerful, we are  so intelligent. We have reached a level  of arrogance that is unbelievable to the  American  people. Why  do  they no  longer trust us? I can record you but  you can’t record me. I can have a whole  list of everything that you’ve done, but  God help you if you ever try to look  into what I’m doing to you. Baloney.  It’s time for it to stop.  If we’re really going to restore trust  in this government, it’s going to take  both sides. This is not a Republican or  a Democrat issue. This is an American  issue. My goodness, how can we be so  far from what the Founders envisioned  when they had absolutely nothing to  work for, nothing to work with—nothing but the providence and the hand of  God in helping to form a government  that is absolutely phenomenal?  We’re sitting here today and saying  it’s not okay for a private citizen to  record what this government is saying  to them. Now the government can do  just the opposite. And I don’t want to  get mixed up with what’s legal, because  we all know that what’s legal has nothing to do with what’s right. We’ve seen  that too many times. We’ve watched it  pushed back and forth.  And while it may be funny to some,  I’ve got to tell you, it may be funny  when you sit here, but I would love you  to meet me in the private sector and  get a phone call from somebody from  the government. It is truly not just  chilling; it is freezing. You have got to  sit back and listen to these folks, and  they’re recording every single thing  you say. God help you if you stumble  or stutter. That’s what they’re looking  for.  This gives the private citizens the  same  rights  that  they  should have.  This is a government that’s supposed  to work for the people and not the people working for the government. It’s  time to restore trust in this government.  ",2013
297,House,113,0.723,26,2013-07-31,Mr. BENTIVOLIO.," I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, common sense is something often discussed here but  it  is  rarely put into practice. It’s time for  that to change. That’s why we need the  Common Sense in Compensation Act.  While the administration plays political games with the sequestration by  forcing hardworking Americans to take  a furlough, they continue to hand out  bonus checks to highly paid bureaucrats. Between 2008 and 2011, the Federal Government spent $340 million on  cash  bonuses  for  Senior Executive  Service employees. Some of these bureaucrats have used their time to attack  the average American  through  regulations and  the Tax Code. The  American people are not getting what  they paid for from many of these Federal regulators and senior staff.  The Common Sense in Compensation  Act brings much-needed reform to the  bonus system for Federal employees.  Under this legislation, employee discretionary bonuses are limited to no  more than 5 percent of their base salary while the sequestration is in effect.  Additionally,  it  limits  the  total  amount of Senior Executive Service  performance awards to 33 percent of all  SES employees in a given agency. Both  of  these  changes prevent  the most  wealthy in the Federal system from becoming richer while those actually engaging and serving the general public  are getting laid off.  Opponents of the bill may claim that  limiting Federal Government employee  bonuses may be an unsound business  move. Here’s what I think: it is an unsound business move being $17 trillion  in  debt  and  shackling  our  grandchildren with a Nation worse off than  how we received it from our parents.  When a business  is struggling, they  don’t pass out bonuses. They cut waste.  It’s time to rein in spending. And this  practice of excessive bonuses for the  very top of our bureaucracy must stop  while we’re all trying to tighten our  belts.  If we truly want to rein in our spending, we need to fix not just the amount  of money we choose to spend, but how  effectively we spend it as well. Making  sure that those who provide the actual  services to the public aren’t being furloughed at the expense of luxurious bonuses for upper management is a good  way to start.  ",2013

And  it is Mr. Rouhani as chief negotiator  who met the international community  with  delay, with more  centrifuges,  more missiles, more stonewalling. And  as my colleagues have pointed out, during that campaign he was the hand-  picked candidate of the Ayatollah, one  of  eight hand-picked  candidates because reformers were not allowed to  run, was the one on the campaign who  said—who boosted—about how he, as  chief negotiator in Iran, didn’t suspend  enrichment but instead completed the  program.  This is the individual who, when he  chaired Iran’s National Security Council between 1989 and 2005, was at the  table when Iran masterminded the 1994  bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos Aires. He  is the  individual who  gave the order and boasted of it; the  man who called on the regime’s besieging militia to attack the students in  1999 and crush  them,  in his words,  crush  them mercilessly, crush  them  monumentally—a  thousand  arrested;  hundreds  tortured;  70  disappeared;  many, many killed. This is the nature  of that man. Do not misunderstand his  intentions. That’s why we need this  legislation.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker,  last week  The Hill published a column entitled  ‘Don’t  force an irresponsible vote on Iran sanctions.’ ’  The column started with the following two sentences:  ‘The House of Representatives  is  under pressure to vote on a new Iran sanctions bill, H.R. 850, before members  leave  town  for August  recess. Scheduling such a  vote would be irresponsible and highly counterproductive to U.S. strategy on Iran.’ ’  The authors of the column were not some  peaceniks or pundits, but experts with real life  experiences in military, diplomacy and fighting  for a future of freedom for the people of Iran—  Gen.  (retired)  Joseph Hoar,  former Commander  in Chief of United States Central  Command, Col. (retired) Lawrence Wilkerson,  former Chief of Staff to General Colin Powell,  and Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council.  Today, the House of Representatives is advancing this ‘ ‘irresponsible and highly counterproductive ’ ’ bill  to push  Iran deeper  into a  state of  isolation and push  the U.S.  further  away  from a diplomatic  resolution  to  Iran’s  pursuit of nuclear weapons. Most disturbing,  by severely limiting diplomatic options for the  U.S. and our international partners, this bill advances the agenda of those who seek to once  again push  the U.S.  towards military confrontation. Our nation has been down this irresponsible, dangerous and costly path before  with the war in Iraq and I completely reject the  idea that war with Iran is inevitable or a viable  solution to this situation.  On August 3rd  the new president of  Iran,  Dr. Hassan Rouhani, will  take office. Dr.  Rouhani was elected as a moderate voice  who campaigned to ‘ ‘pursue a policy of peace  and  reconciliation’ ’ with  the West. The new  president was Iran’s former lead nuclear negotiator and was critical of  the nuclear  ‘extremism’ ’ of his dangerous predecessor, President Ahmadinejad. This is the absolute best  opportunity and most favorable conditions to  proceed with a diplomatic course.  Just in the past month, I received over 100  calls, e-mails and letters urging me to sign a  letter  to President Obama calling  for a  renewed diplomatic effort with Iran’s new leader.  On July 19th I joined 130 Democrats and  Republicans in signing the letter to Mr. Obama  urging him ‘ ‘to pursue the potential opportunity  presented by Iran ’s recent presidential election  by reinvigorating U.S. efforts to secure a negotiated nuclear agreement. ’ ’ Our letter goes  on to say, ‘ ‘we believe it would be a mistake  not to test whether Dr. Rouhani ’s election represents a real opportunity for progress toward  a verifiable, enforceable agreement on Iran’s  nuclear program  that ensures  the  country  does not acquire a nuclear weapon. In order  to test this proposition, it will be prudent for  the United States to utilize all diplomatic tools  to reinvigorate ongoing nuclear talks.’ ’  H.R. 850 and  its extreme sanctions  takes  the opposite course. It sends the signal that  the U.S. wishes to punish the Iranian people  and will only settle for submission, rather than  a negotiated, face saving solution that meets  the security needs of the United States, Israel,  and the entire international community and the  economic needs of the Iranian people. This bill  is a blunt instrument that harms U.S. interests,  undercuts President Obama, and gives no  hope to the millions of Iranians who look to  the U.S. as a beacon of freedom and inspiration.  Clearly there are no guarantees that diplomacy will work  in  the near  term and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is an absolute.  So, advancing H.R. 850 and tougher sanctions  can proceed at anytime in the months ahead  if Iran rejects negotiations or refuses to take  tangible, verifiable steps  towards an agreement. The House could vote on this bill in October or November, giving President Obama,  our international partners, and the new Iranian  leadership a legitimate window of time to seek  peaceful progress.  This bill has 375 co-sponsors so there is absolute certainty that this bill will pass and then  Congress can go on its August recess. This  bill will not move  in  the U.S. Senate  in  the  days ahead so nothing will be accomplished  by the passage of H.R. 850 other than some  chest pounding by politicians, the imposition of  an embarrassing obstacle to U.S. diplomats,  and a victory for the hardliners in Iran who reject negotiations as much as hardliners in this  country.  Today, at this moment in time, this is a bill  that harms U.S.  interests and  I will  vote  against it.  ",2013
301,House,113,0.303,68,2013-07-31,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Madam Chair,  I  yield myself the balance of my time.  Once again I want to thank Dr. CASSIDY for authoring this bill and bringing it to the House floor.  I would like to remind everyone that  EPA has made great strides. We all recognize  the  improvements  that have  been made in our air quality, water  quality, particulate matter, et cetera.  As a matter of  fact, carbon dioxide  emissions are the lowest that they’ve  been in 20 years here in America. Yet I  would say that EPA is not the Holy  Grail. The EPA does make mistakes.  I would like to just read a couple of  comments  from some witnesses who  testified over the last year at the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Energy and Power Subcommittee. Dr.  Peter Valberg, former member of the  Harvard School of Public Health, testified that  ‘‘there are major questions  about EPA’s forecast of serious health  effects caused by small increments in  particulate matter levels. EPA’s statistical approach is fraught with numerous assumptions and uncertainties.’’  Dr. Tony Cox of the Colorado School  of Public Health testified that ‘‘the use  of statistical associations to address  causal questions about health effects of  regulation is not only technically incorrect, but, as practiced by EPA and  others, is also highly misleading to policymakers.’’  Then Dr. Anne Smith, an economist  with  NERA  Economic  Consulting,  talked about the uncertainties and the  statistical models used by EPA having  serious flaws.  All we’re saying is at a time when  the  economy  is  struggling—particularly now—and when EPA is the most  aggressive that it has been in recent  memory—as a matter of  fact, even  though our CO2emissions are down to  the lowest level in 20 years, America is  the only country in the world where  you cannot build a new coal-powered  plant. All this  legislation does  is  it  says if EPA comes up with a new regulation, energy related, that costs over  a billion dollars, they’ve got to make a  report to Congress.  Then the Secretary of Energy, working with the Secretary of Commerce  and the Small Business Administration  and the Energy Information Agency,  they will look and they will see what is  the impact of this regulation upon the  cost of energy, the cost of gasoline, the  cost of electricity; what is the impact  on causing jobs to be lost or a plant  maybe not to be built and a job will be  lost or a plant will close. So it’s not  dictating anything.  It’s the Cabinet members of the same  administration simply reviewing all of  the evidence, doing its own analysis,  and then deciding that if it has significant impact on the economy, then they  can rule that the regulation will not  take effect, at which point the EPA  can go back, make some adjustments,  and redo it.  I think it’s a good piece of legislation  that provides additional transparency  and additional review of the regulation, the impact on the economy, the  impact on jobs, the impact on prices.  And what is wrong with that? What is  wrong with the Congress getting a report back from the agency and letting  the other Department heads in the government review it? That’s all this legislation is about.  I urge Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be  considered for amendment under the 5-  minute rule.

304,,113,-0.348,145,2013-07-31,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the memory of Robert Siev of South  Pasadena, California, a kind, brave and highly  respected man.  Robert was born on April 6, 1926, in Germany. During the Holocaust, at the age of thirteen, he and some of his family escaped by  boarding a moving train in Lithuania, getting  their visas stamped by Japanese Consul General Chiune Sugihara, and then jumping off of  that train. After a dangerous flight across Russia, they eventually made it to America. Having lost much of his family to the Holocaust,  including his younger brother Jonah, Robert  was eternally grateful to the United States for  permitting his  family  to emigrate,  live  freely  and  for  the  educational  opportunities  the  United States afforded.  The Sievs came to the United States and  settled in New York, where Robert attended  New York University. During this time period,  he  taught himself English,  joined  the Army,  and became a United States citizen. Robert  moved  to Philadelphia and while at Penn  State University, in 1943, he met the love of  his  life, Beatrice (Bea) Spector. Robert and  Bea got married and in 1946, their daughter  Carol was born.  In 1955, Robert moved his  family  to South Pasadena, California, where  he and Bea became active in the community.  A  chemical  engineer  by  trade, Robert  worked for renowned engineering companies  CF Braun, Aerojet General, and Bechtel from  which he retired. In his volunteer life, Robert  was involved in all aspects of the South Pasadena community. Generous with his time and  money, he was active in the South Pasadena  Educational Foundation—which supports  the  city’s schools, interested in city politics, and he  was a staunch ‘ ‘freeway fighter’ ’ in the effort to  stop the 710 freeway extension through South  Pasadena. Robert was a steadfast supporter  of  Israel and was proud of  the accomplishments made by  the Jewish people. He was  very  involved  in his  temple, Temple Beth  Israel in Highland Park, and was a continuous  contributor  to  the American  Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Holocaust Museum.  In addition, Mr. Siev was also occasionally the  featured guest speaker at various organizations, where he would speak about his own  experiences during the Holocaust.  Robert passed away on July 6, 2013, and is  survived by his wife of nearly 70 years, Beatrice,  daughter Carol,  brother–in –law Ellis,  son–in–law Stuart,  grandchildren  Lisa  and  Daniel, and one great–grand daughter Shana.  I ask all members to join me in remembering  Robert Siev, a  true  treasure  to  the South  Pasadena and greater Los Angeles community.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF COLONEL  JESSE EDWARDS GREEN  HON. DANIEL WEBSTER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 31, 2013  ",2013
305,,113,0.478,145,2013-07-31,Mr. WEBSTER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to honor the life and service of a  dear  friend, Colonel Jesse Edwards Green.  Col. Green passed away at the age of 90 in  Windermere, Florida, on June 30, 2013.  Col. Green was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, on September 30, 1922, to the late Claire  and Jesse Green. As  the son of a career  Army officer, he followed in his father’s footsteps and attended the United States Military  Academy at West Point.  In 1946, he graduated from West Point with his Army Air Corps  pilot wings and was assigned  to  the Air  Force’s first all jet squadron. In January 1947,  Col. Green married the love of his life, former  Caroline Bailey, and started a  family which  grew to four children.  Col. Green ’s  30-year military  career  included over 120 combat missions  in Korea,  where he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and two tours in Vietnam. He also  graduated as a test pilot from the Air Force  Flight Test School at Edwards Air Force Base  in California and was among the first Air Force  pilots to fly above 50,000 feet in the Lockheed  F–104 Starfighter. His bravery, dedication and  sacrifice to our nation will not be forgotten.  In 1976, after retiring  from  the Air Force,  Col.  Green  and  his  wife  moved  to  Windermere, Florida. During retirement,  they  both enjoyed water skiing, cooking and gardening together. Today, their papayas are legendary  on  Second  Avenue  in  downtown  Windermere. Col. Green was also a beloved  friend, board member and construction volunteer of the Edgewood Children’s Ranch and  West Orange Habitat  for Humanity. For 37  years, he volunteered alongside many friends  and neighbors building homes and varieties of  construction projects. The numerous contributions that Col. Green made to his community,  along with his legacy of hard work, strength  and love he leaves behind to his children and  grandchildren will be forever cherished.  He was a loving and dedicated father, son,  brother, grandfather, and uncle. On behalf of  the citizens of Central Florida, my prayers and  condolences go out to his loving wife of 67  years Caroline, his daughters Patricia, Molly,  and Judy, son Mike, grandchildren Leon, Cannon–Marie, Cody, Kyra, Serafina, Tyler, Evan,  Kellen, Caitlin,  and Michael,  sister–in–law  Anne Bailey, and many beloved nieces and  nephews. May God bless  them  through  this  time of remembrance.  f  CONDEMNING  THE  ATTACK  ON  THE TURKISH EMBASSY  IN SOMALIA  HON.

306,,113,0.269,145,2013-07-31,Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to express my sincere condolences  to the people and Government of Turkey.  On  July  27,  2013,  their  embassy  in  Mogadishu, Somalia was attacked by  three  suicide bombers. Two security guards and a  Somali student  lost  their  lives  in  the explosions, while several members of the embassy  staff were also  injured. An al –Qaida–linked,  Somali militant group named al–Shabab has  claimed  responsibility  for  the  attack. This  serves as a stark reminder that al –Qaida remains strong throughout the Middle East and  Africa and needs  to be confronted at every  turn.  Turkey has been a force for good in Somalia and is actively involved with Somalia ’s reconstruction. Turkish aid workers have been  assisting Somali authorities to rebuild their war  torn  country  by  undertaking  development  projects, including street renovations and the  construction of schools. Furthermore, Turkey  continues to strengthen commercial times with  Somalia to help boost its economy.  Mr. Speaker, I share the Obama administration ’s condemnation of this attack and express  my condolences in the strongest terms possible.  f  HONORING DANIEL WEICKENAND  HON.

310,House,113,0.749,4,2013-09-17,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," I thank the  gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a lot of the  Members here of the House of Representatives, I want to thank Peggy  Sampson for her tremendous work to  help us all. This is her birthday, Mr.  Speaker, and we wish her a happy  birthday. We hope she has 100 more and  that at least 90 of them are spent helping us here in this House to do a better  job. We appreciate her very much.  Mr. Speaker,  let me  also  thank  Chairman HASTINGSand leadership for  bringing this bill to the floor today, as  well as the bipartisan group of cosponsors for their support. I certainly want  to thank all of the Members of the Arizona delegation that are in support of  this bill.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1410, the Keep the  Promise Act,  seeks  to prevent Las  Vegas-style  gaming  in  the Phoenix  metropolitan area until  the gaming  compact that both the tribes agreed to  and the Arizona voters approved expires in 2027.  One Tucson-area tribe is trying to  build a major casino on lands that were  purchased in the Phoenix metropolitan  area at the very same time they were  in negotiations with other tribes in the  State to craft this gaming compact.  These actions are contrary to the public commitments that this particular  tribe made between 2000 and 2002 to the  16 other Indian tribes in Arizona, the  State itself, and the voters of the State  of Arizona; and they publicly supported  the passage of Proposition 202, a State  referendum to limit casino gambling in  the Phoenix metropolitan area. Mr.  Speaker, the bipartisan cosponsors of  H.R. 1410 are simply trying to keep all  the parties  to  their publicly  stated  commitment to the people of Arizona  not to engage in gaming in the Phoenix  metropolitan area.  Mr.  Speaker,  during  the  subcommittee hearing on this bill, witnesses made clear that there is a problem and a serious threat to the negotiated gaming structure in Arizona if  this tribe is able to break its promise  and develop a Las Vegas-style casino in  the Phoenix metropolitan area.  b1615  H.R. 1410 prevents an onerous precedent that could lead to an out-of-control expansion of off-reservation casinos as well as dangerous changes to the  complexion of tribal gaming in other  States across America.  Mr. Speaker, tribes across this Nation, including many of the other Arizona tribes that played an integral role  in the 2002 gaming compact, strongly  support this legislation due to the impact this situation could have on tribal  gaming enterprises nationally. The bill  is also supported by the State of Arizona, the city of Glendale, the city of  Litchfield Park, the city of Scottsdale,  the city of Tempe, the town of Gilbert,  and the editorial board of The Arizona  Republic, which is the largest newspaper in the State.  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, even  if  the casino weren’t in violation of Federal law or contrary to the voter-approved gaming compact, claims that  the operation would create  jobs and  benefit the economy of the surrounding  area are woefully misinformed at best  and shamefully dishonest at worst.  Tellingly, multiple organizations, including  the city of Glendale, asked  that the tribe release the data and  methodology  supporting  their  economic  study, which was  conducted  roughly 4 years ago, and to this day the  tribe continues to steadfastly refuse. In  other words, the tribe released a batch  of  numbers  extolling  the  supposed  amazing economic benefits of this new  casino and then refused to tell anybody  how they came about finding and coming up with those numbers.  Mr. Speaker, this bill does not impact any tribe’s ability to have lands  taken into trust, nor does it impact  any water or land claims. Consistent  with the intent of the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act and Proposition 202,  this bill merely restricts the ability of  tribes to game on the very lands on  which  they agreed  they would not  game.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that my colleagues join me  and the Members of Arizona’s delegation in supporting this bill.  ",2013

315,Senate,113,0.43,74,2013-09-17,Mr. BLUNT.," Madam President, as we  continue our debate about health care  reform, I would like to recognize an organization in Missouri that has been a  leader in innovation in driving down  the healthcare costs for manufacturers  and their employees. The Missouri Association of Manufacturers and their  CEO, Rita Needham, have been at the  forefront of the debate in my State.  She is committed to new strategies to  provide affordable health care through  consortiums of manufacturers that employ more than 2,100 people.  As  an  educator,  human  resource  manager and administrator, Rita Needham joined the Southwest Area Missouri Association, SAMA,  in 1999 as  community  affairs  director.  SAMA  reached out to support manufacturers  in the Springfield, MO area. Needham  was elevated to executive director 2  years later and created a health care  consortium which provided affordable  health care coverage for manufacturers.  Rita was the driving force in obtaining a two-year waiver from the Missouri Department of Insurance to enable companies of all sizes to join together in a pilot program to purchase  group health insurance. Before the consortium was  created,  the  initial  32  companies who joined the SAMA I Consortium had to buy their health insurance individually, but, under the consortium, they were rated as one policy  holder therefore achieving significant  savings. Six  smaller companies who  were part of the consortium were able  to access affordable health care for the  first time. The consortium members  were able to achieve long term rate  stability, create  large group buying  power and reduce claim risk  in response to their biggest concern—the  rising costs of health care.  In 2006, Rita led SAMA’s efforts to  persuade the Missouri General Assembly to pass House bill 1827, landmark  legislation known as the SAMA bill,  which allowed manufacturers of all  sizes the option of purchasing a group  health plan under the consortium.  In 2010, the Southwest Area Manufacturers Association became the Missouri  Association of Manufacturers, MAM,  with 170 member companies across the  State  representing  14,500  employees.  Today, MAM is a strong voice for manufacturing with free market positions  on trade, regulation, tax and energy  policy, education, health care and the  environment.  Rita is planning to retire this year,  but throughout her career she has been  a thoughtful, dedicated leader for Missouri manufacturers. I have always relied on her expertise and common sense  to better understand how Federal policy impacts health costs for manufacturers.  I wish Rita and her husband Jim a  wonderful  retirement. There  is  no  doubt that Rita’s advocacy and smart  leadership have improved the business  environment in Missouri.∑  f  LAS VEGAS NATURAL HISTORY  MUSEUM  ∑",2013

This accreditation is the highest  national  recognition of a museum’s  commitment to public service, professional standards, and excellence in education. This important milestone exemplifies the remarkable progress that  the Las Vegas Natural History Museum  has made, and attests to the central  role the museum plays in educating the  local community.  For more than 2 decades, the Las  Vegas Natural History Museum has  provided Nevadans of all ages and from  all walks of life the opportunity to explore the natural treasures of our past.  The museum has expanded the small,  loaned exhibit with which it began into  a premiere, multi-million dollar collection of wildlife and prehistoric exhibits. Today it offers a truly unique educational experience from which countless Nevadans have benefited. Under  the  leadership of Executive Director  Marilyn Gillespie, as well as a dedicated board of directors, the Las Vegas  Natural History Museum  has  completed a demanding process in order to  become nationally accredited. The museum and its leadership team should be  proud of this important achievement.  Centers of learning such as the Las  Vegas Natural History Museum enrich  our communities by making the learning process an engaging and exciting  endeavor.

While the old saying goes, ‘‘if at first  you don’t succeed, try, try again,’’ I  say to my colleagues across the aisle:  stop trying to shut down the Government of the United States of America.  Democrats  have  offered  a  compromise in which Republicans get the  spending levels they want.

323,House,113,0.505,16,2013-09-30,Mr. DUFFY.," Mr. Speaker, I’ve been  in this institution for 21⁄2years. The  minority leader from the other side of  the aisle talked about hounds. I heard  a lot of howling from the other side of  the aisle—howling about fairness and  howling about equality.  Well, talk  is cheap, because today  you have an opportunity to live and  vote  ‘‘fairness’’ and  ‘‘equality.’’ For  months, big business has come to this  town and they have asked for an employer exemption, an exemption from  the  employer mandate. All we are  doing tonight is saying let’s treat individuals in America the same way you  are treating big business. They may  not have as much money or as powerful  lobbyists, but they have us fighting for  them. Join us so we can treat individuals like the big businesses that you  give an exemption.  The President talks about how great  ObamaCare is, but we have to note that  he has excluded his administration.  The Press Secretary, Mr. CARNEY, he  gets up off and then talks about how  great this bill is. If it is so great, what  we do tonight is we allow the administration, like us in Congress, to come  into ObamaCare and we remove the  subsidy from us and from the administration. Let’s treat Congress with the  same equality and the administration  with the same equality as the American people, and let’s treat the American people  the  same way you are  treating big businesses in America.  This is easy. Walk the walk; don’t  just give us the talk.  Let’s vote for this rule and let’s pass  this bill tonight.  ",2013
324,House,113,-0.455,16,2013-09-30,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker, bring us  some leadership.  There is only one issue before the  United States Congress, and that’s the  issue to keep government open. The  bill to do that is in this House. The bill  to keep the government open is in this  House. If it were on the floor, we would  pass it in 1 minute. It would go to the  President and he would have it signed  before he went to bed. That’s all we  have to do.  But this rule brings all kinds of other  baggage and says, no, we don’t want to  keep government open; we want to get  into other issues. Well, aren’t all the  other issues what we are about for all  the other part of the year? This is the  only day and the only moment when  we can keep government open. It’s the  last chance.  They say: Oh, do you know what?  Well, you know,  this  is a partisan  thing. I heard the chairman say: You  know, it was a mistake to pass, the  President made a mistake. That’s what  you said.  Well, we  thought President Bush  made a mistake in invading Iraq. In  fact, the majority of Democrats fought  against it, argued against it, and voted  against it. But when we went to Iraq,  we didn’t try to stop the whole Congress to block the budget. No. In fact,  on the appropriations to pay for it, the  Democrats voted for it. We admit it—  we lost.  You lost on the ObamaCare, or whatever else you want to call it. It’s the  law. Some reports declared it. If you  want to deal with other issues, put it in  other bills, but don’t attach it to this  bill.  Reject this rule that brings the baggage. Bring the clean bill. Let’s pass it  in the next hour and, Mr. President,  have it signed by midnight, and let’s  keep this government open. It does so  much damage otherwise. So many kids,  so many women, so many poor people  really get hurt.  This is not leadership. This is meanness.  ",2013

You know, you can fool some of the  people some of the time, but you can’t  fool all of the people all of the time.  What happened tonight is the Republican-controlled extremists—bullies or  hostage-takers—took  the  American  Government and our economy hostage  to their demands. This is a shameful  day. This Congress makes the Gingrich  Congress look like moderates.  The Republican Party has shut down  the United States Government because  they don’t want the American people  to have affordable health care. Shame  on the Republican Party. Shame on  you.  Mr. Speaker, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people  all of the time.The American people know that  there is a small minority who are controlling  the Republican Party in the House, and they  are acting like bullies . . . or rather hostage  takers. Taking the American government and  our economy hostage to demands that will not  be met.  Shame, shame, shame on the Republicans.  Here we go again: I have been in office for  over 20 years and this is the worst, the most  extreme Congress  I have ever worked with.  Today’s Republican Party make the Gingrich  era members in the mid 1990 ’s look like moderates.  The Republican Party has shut down  the  government because they don’t like the idea  of providing health  insurance  to ALL Americans. And remember: The Affordable Care Act  passed both chambers of  the United States  Congress, was signed into law by the President of the United States, was upheld by the  United States Supreme Court, and received a  stamp of approval by  the American public  when they voted to re-elect President Obama.  It is now time for House Republicans to accept  the ACA and assist  their constituents  to receive  the many  heath  care  benefits  that  Obamacare offers.  On this day, the President helped move the  country forward with open enrollment for the  Affordable Care Act, and the GOP moved the  country backwards by shutting down the government.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to try and act like grown-ups so we  can all work  together  to pass a Continuing  Resolution  to keep our government open  to  provide the services that our citizens pay for  and deserve.  f  NO SPECIAL TREATMENT  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

328,Senate,113,-0.351,86,2013-09-30,Mr. SCHUMER.," We are  in, as has  been said by Leader REIDand my good  friend from New Jersey, an unfortunate  moment. There are millions of people  who are innocent. They wake up in the  morning, work hard, and hope to get a  paycheck to help feed and clothe their  families. They will not be getting a  paycheck tomorrow morning.  They might be Federal Government  workers. I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side demonize the  Federal Government. When I think of  the Federal Government, I think of individual people who are working hard,  who show up at work in the rain and  the snow, who work hard, as do people  in the private sector, people who work  for State governments or such as the  people who work for us. Why should  they be punished?  Then there are so many others, such  as the veteran who needs a change in  his or her disability formula and can’t  get it; the construction worker who is  working on a federally funded highway,  or somebody who works in a defense  plant, as a civilian, all of these people  now have been put at real risk.  There is an answer, as I mentioned in  my colloquy with the leader. The answer is for the House to pass the bill  that passed here—the key vote had a  majority  of Democrats  and Republicans, 25 Republicans—and keep the  government running.  They are busy working late at night  on another little subterfuge, a little  scheme. Have a conference.  As the leader said, conferences are  fine with us. We tried to do a budget  conference 18 times. Don’t do a conference as a charade while you are  shutting the government down. That is  what the other side is asking us to do.  Let’s modify what they are doing.  Let them pass the bill that is now in  the House that will keep the government running until November 15, and  then we will have a conference on how  to  fund the government  for another  year.  Make no mistake about it. Tomorrow  morning their next gambit will be defeated in the Senate and then we will  be back where we were, where we are  now.  There is a bill, a ready bill, in the  House of Representatives that can keep  the government  funded and prevent  these millions of innocent people and  our national economy from being hurt  and hurt significantly.  This is a final plea, at 12:15 a.m., 15  minutes after the government has been  officially  closed.  House  Members,  Speaker BOEHNER, let the bill come up  for a vote. It will pass. It will save such  trouble, and, even worse. For millions  of innocent Americans it will save our  economy from great risk. Then we can  go back to debating the many issues  that you and we wish to debate.  With that, with a bit of a heavy heart  because it didn’t have to happen, that  we have a small group of people who  are so sure that they are right that  they can hurt millions to pursue that  righteousness, that self-righteousness,  is a bad thing. I hope it doesn’t happen  again.  I yield the floor.  f  MORNING BUSINESS  f  SYRIA  ",2013

With 129 years of service, the Philadelphia  Tribune  is  the Nation’s oldest continuously  published African American newspaper and  has employed Mrs. Godfrey for over half of its  existence. Throughout her nearly seven decades of employment with the newspaper, Mrs.  Godfrey rarely missed a day of work, totaling  up  to approximately 17,500 plus days. Mrs.  Godfrey has been described as an anchor and  a historian for the newspaper, serving four different presidents of the paper from 1946 until  1980. At 92 years of age she continues to be  a vibrant and dedicated character in the lives  of those around her and will be sorely missed  at the Philadelphia Tribune.  I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Mrs. Godfrey for her lifetime of service and dedication  to Pennsylvania ’s First Congressional District  and the Philadelphia Tribune.

331,,113,0.307,1,2013-10-09,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Try and leave this world  a  little better  than you  found  it.’’  Those were the parting words of Robert  Baden Powell, a soldier, writer, and  founder of the world scouting movement. This was a message to all Scouts  that was found among his papers after  Powell’s passing in 1941.  I am a scouter, Mr. Speaker. It is  part of who I am, both as an American  and an elected official proudly representing Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. Scouter Powell’s  words today are part of scouting’s principles, to always  leave the campsite  cleaner than when you found it. It is  into service, serving others, and making the world a better place. They also  ring true in the debate taking place  now in Washington.  Today we are saddling future generations with mountains of debt. We have  made promises we cannot keep. We are  leaving the next generation worse off  than our own. We face a Nation with  grave  challenges,  challenges  that  aren’t being addressed. The fact of the  matter is that Congress has yet to deal  with the real drivers of our debt, a  large portion of which is health care  costs.  Mr. Speaker, I don’t care who won  the White House or which party holds  the majority  in Congress. Why? Because not until we actually tackle the  tough issues, the tough challenges, can  we honestly say that Congress or the  White House is doing what is right for  the country. Right now we aren’t making necessary progress, not on our  budget and deficits, not on our long-  term debt, not on bringing down the  cost of health care. Though we have  made some progress on spending, we  are nowhere near where we need to be.  We are also leaving the health system worse than where we  found  it.  Here are just two letters from my constituents that my office has received.  Tina, from Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, writes:  Please do not vote in any way to continue  funding the Affordable Care Act. It in no way  improves the situation of the average American. Yes,  it provides another option  for  health insurance, but the rates are no more  affordable than the private insurances; and  therefore, if a person cannot afford the private insurance, there is no way they will be  able to afford the government plan. In addition, the act places further strain on the system and will cause the shutdown of more  hospitals, cause more physicians to leave the  system,  and  further  crowd  our Nation’s  emergency departments.  Catherine from DuBois wrote:  I am  fortunate to have good  insurance  through my employer. However, I found out  from them that they may provide a lesser  form of health care due to the no-Cadillac  plan. They understandably want to avoid a  penalty  for providing a good plan. This  seems unfair to me, as if we are being penalized  for working and having a good employer. If they are willing to provide a good  health plan, why should they be penalized  and why should they have to lessen our coverage? I am very distraught about many layers of the health care plan that are starting  to come to light. I don’t know if anything  can be done.  I cannot stand idle as Congress acts  like  it  is solving problems when,  in  fact, it is failing to tackle the tough  issues, health being one of them. Let  me be clear that a government shutdown is unacceptable. However, each  day we stall and fail to deal with these  challenges, the worse it gets for the  next generation.  The real debate needs to be about  how we get our fiscal house in order  and  set a  course of  long-term  job  growth. Not until then will I be satisfied. It should be about addressing the  challenges  the people elected us  to  solve. Again, not until then will I be  satisfied. It is about trying to ‘‘leave  this world a  little better than you  found it.’’  f  GETTING TO A BIG DEAL  ",2013
332,House,113,-0.385,8,2013-10-09,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker, I have a  very simple message: let your people  go.  The American people are very frustrated by what we are doing here. They  want us to end this shutdown. In fact,  some 70 percent of them do not like the  way you or the Republican majority is  handling this crisis. So, Mr. Speaker, if  you will just let your people go and  allow us to bring a clean continuing  resolution to the floor, we can end this.  Despite your claims to the contrary, it  is clear to everyone that we have at  least 17 votes required from your side  of the aisle to pass the continuing resolution. So, Mr. Speaker, why don’t you  just let your people go?  I have a simple question for you: If  you think to the contrary that their  votes are not there, then why not put  your cards on the table and allow a  vote?  The American people cannot afford  more rounds of betting their economic  futures on politicians’ betting on a pair  and thinking they have a full house.  The American people think it’s time to  call your bluff. Mr. Speaker, let your  people go.  We can reopen the World War II Memorial and the VA today. We can ensure that all military families receive  death benefits and can travel to Dover  Air Force Base to receive their loved  ones’ remains. We can end what Senators on the other side of the aisle have  declared ‘‘shameful and embarrassing.’’  We can end this today, Mr. Speaker,  if you let your people go.  Holding back on a vote prevents the  opening of lifesaving clinical trials at  the NIH. It prevents the opening of national parks and museums for use by  families everywhere. The shutdown is  costing  taxpayers  $12.5 million each  and every hour you refuse to vote, and  it is costing the American people already $2.5 billion.  Don’t listen to me. Listen to your  own  caucus Members:  Enough  is  enough,  said one Republican  in  the  House. Let’s get on with the business  we were sent to do.  Another Republican agreed with him:  The politics should be over, he said.  It’s time to legislate.  Another said: I’d vote for a clean CR  because I don’t think this strategy is  working.  Many more echo these sentiments,  Mr. Speaker: let your people go. Instead, you seem to be listening to a  small faction in your caucus that says  they want to ‘‘win at any cost.’’ They  say they won’t be disrespected and that  they need to get something out of this,  but they don’t know what it is.  Mr. Speaker, I hope you will see what  is clear to everyone around the world  who is watching this spectacle: there  are no winners. Mr. Speaker, let your  people go.  It’s blackmail to shut down the government because you don’t like the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Speaker, listen  to those blunt assessments from your  own caucus who call the followers of  this strategy ‘‘lemmings with suicide  vests.’’  Traditional allies of the GOP, like  the Chamber of Commerce, have said  this is ‘‘not in the best interest of the  U.S. business community.’’  The Wall Street Journal has called it  a kamikaze mission, and  in  fact,  in  their editorial headline, they said: Are  the Republicans nuts?  Another Republican Senator  said:  This strategy isn’t good for America.  This  last comment  really  says  it  best, that this is not good for America.  Mr. Speaker, let your people go, and  bring a clean CR to a vote.  f  THE DEFINITION OF ‘‘FAIR’’  ",2013
333,House,113,0.563,15,2013-10-09,Mr. YODER.," Mr. Speaker, the American people understand the importance  of making  tough decisions and balancing their budgets.  According to the Federal Reserve,  over  the past  3 months, Americans  have worked to pay down their credit  card debts by more than $6 billion; yet  the United States Government continues to operate in the red, as it has  operated in the red 55 of the last 60  years. Our national debt now stands at  $17 trillion. Now the administration is  asking Congress to increase our debt  by trillions more.  Mr. Speaker, Americans do not want  to raise the debt ceiling again unless  they see a path towards paying down  the national debt and balancing the  Federal budget. American citizens cannot take out a loan without a plan to  pay it back. How can our Nation continue to borrow money without any  plan to pay it back?  Mr. Speaker, let’s stop the culture of  debt and despair in Washington, D.C.  Let’s put a plan in place to pay down  our debt, and  let’s get our country  back on solid financial footing.  f  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN  EFFECTS ON CONSTITUENTS  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

334,House,113,0.714,15,2013-10-09,Mr. WEBER of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  House Republicans continue to call on  Senate Democrats and the President to  come to the table and negotiate.  Here’s one way to start: let’s tone  down the rhetoric.  Is it proper to refer to someone you  don’t agree with as a ‘‘hostage taker’’  or as a ‘‘legislative arsonist’’?  I don’t think so. We may disagree on  policy, but this kind of rancor will not  solve anything.  Let’s work together. It can be done.  The House just passed a bill which was  not just bipartisan but unanimous that  guaranteed back pay for Federal workers, and the bill has the support of the  Senate and the President. That’s encouraging.  Now the Senate should take up the  other  bipartisan  funding  bills  we  passed here in the House to fund things  like medical  research  and  veterans  benefits.

Social Security and unemployment checks are being processed. Citizens can get passports and food stamps,  and certain groups that have the right  ideology are even given permits to protest on our National Mall; but for some  reason, our military families, including  those at Fort Bragg in North Carolina,  cannot receive emergency death benefits.  This  is worse than excusable.  shameful.  Last week, Congress  unanimously  passed the Pay Our Military Act, with  the intent that all military pay and allowances will be disbursed during the  government shutdown. Unfortunately,  this administration has been playing  political theater with the families of  our war heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  To make our  intent crystal clear,  today the House passed the Honoring  the Families of Fallen Soldiers Act.  Certain things should transcend politics, and it is up to the Senate and the  administration. In  fact, they have a  moral obligation to join the efforts of  the House to fix this problem and to  express our deepest gratitude to the  families of our heroes.  f  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  LAMALFA).

337,House,113,0.598,36,2013-10-09,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, for a  government  that  shuts down,  there  sure seems to be a great deal going on.  Down here on the Mall, somehow the  National Park Service, which has been,  parenthetically  speaking  here,  presiding over a park service, beginning  with the Franklin D. Roosevelt memorial, has not had God mentioned in any  memorial since that time. We don’t  have time or a place for mentioning  God, as our memorials have in some  way in the past, but, by golly, we have  got time during a shutdown to approve  a permit to allow people who want to  demand that—though they are here in  this  country  illegally—they have  a  right to demand rights. This administration, just as it did with the Occupy  Washington  movement,  facilitates  that.  We know with  the Occupy Washington movement there was all kinds  of lewd, lascivious stuff going on in  public. The Park Service didn’t seem  to be bothered by that. But let veterans show up to the World War II memorial, and they have got barricades.  Let World War II veterans, who fought  their way to the top of Mt. Suribachi,  try to get to the monument that commemorates  climbing  to  the  top  of  Suribachi, they put up big obstacles to  our veterans getting there.  So the message from this administration very clearly is that if you are illegally in the country, we will bend over  backwards to let you commit all kinds  of acts on the Mall; we will send Capitol Police down to pick up your garbage; and if you just want to illegally  occupy a public area, we will let you do  that. We will let you use the basest  services in public. All kinds of lewd and  lascivious things were going on there  with  the Occupy Washington movement, and that was allowed to continue  on and on and on.  b1545  However,  if you have served your  country in the United States military,  then we’re going to try to make life  miserable  for you. It  just might be  those people that have hung on to their  God and their guns and love America  and  love  the Constitution,  so  this  Homeland Security  thing  is  sure a  threat. Which is quite interesting.  You know, with all the things that  are going on, we have seen that this administration has not had a problem  with some things that some of us felt  were a problem, such as, like I’ve mentioned in the last couple of years, one  of the members of what was originally  the  Countering  Violent  Extremism  Working Group named Elibiary from  Texas, who was placed on there. And  then he got a promotion  from Secretary Janet Napolitano up  to  the  Homeland Security Advisory Council,  and, gee, now we’re finding out that  he’s continuing to defend one of the  principals of the Holy Land Foundation.  We’re finding out that he is still defending, he still considers them to be  unjustly prosecuted even though Federal courts have  found  that crimes  were committed and  that  terrorism  was supported by the Holy Land Foundation. The Dallas Federal court, along  with the U.S. Court of Appeals in New  Orleans, found that groups like CAIR,  which has now changed its name to  WTF, and ISNA, groups like that were  the largest front group for the Muslim  Brotherhood in America.  So  it’s rather  interesting, because  this administration has made life so  difficult for our veterans just trying to  get here and enjoy the memorials. I’ve  been down to the memorials I think  every day until today, and it’s amazing.  I’ve been down  there different  days, all hours of the day and night.  You’re lucky if you see one park ranger  in the area of the World War II Memorial, and yet now they’ve got them  very strategically placed.  They will stand there with the barricades closed most of the time. If some  group  comes up  and  explains  that  they’re a World War II veterans group,  then  they’ll  open  and  let  them  through, but they stand there intimidating. Sometimes an officer comes by  with a canine, which is a bit more intimidating to most people. So unless  Members  of  Congress  are  standing  there, we see people come up and get  intimidated and walk away, unless a  Member of Congress goes up and says,  Please, come in. You are welcome.  Fortunately,  veterans  of Vietnam  and Korea are just going around the  barricades  and  fortunately  are  not  being stopped. At the Lincoln Memorial, though, when a couple of Members  of Congress encouraged people to come  on up, like they do at the World War II  Memorial, they said that it appeared  that the park SWAT team—I mean, officers came in from all over, threatening arrests. Get out of here.  It’s just amazing how far this administration will go to hurt Americans  that love America, that have served  this country.  And then we find out about Americans  killed  in Afghanistan.  There  should have been no problem whatsoever with the Defense Department cutting the $100,000 checks to these families. There should not have been. And if  there was any doubt, then the bill we  passed  before  the  shutdown  began  should have taken care of that. There  was plenty of prerogative to do that.  But we had to come back today and  pass another bill  just to say get a  check to the families of those who lost  a loved one serving this country, because  the administration  is playing  hardball and has gotten policies  in  place that are hurting as many Americans as possible. But when you look at  who’s advising this country’s top leaders, is it any surprise?  Here’s a story from October 6 from  The Daily Caller:  Senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security is an old friend of an activist  who was convicted in 2008 of financing the  terrorist organization Hamas.  In an  interview with The Daily Caller,  Mohamed Elibiary, a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council, reiterated  claims he made this summer that former  Holy Land Foundation President and CEO  Shukri Abu Baker is innocent and a victim  of political persecution.  Elibiary, who in his position on the council  also has regular access to classified information, said the United States insults Muslim  dignity and compared the Muslim Brotherhood to American evangelicals.  Elibiary  confirmed  to  journalist Ryan  Mauro of the Clarion Project in August that  he is a longtime friend of Baker. The Mauro  interview can be read at the Center for Security Policy.  Baker and four other officials of the closed  Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development were convicted of using the charity  to finance Hamas in 2008. It was the largest  terrorism  financing trial  in U.S. history.  Federal prosecutors described the  foundation, which was closed by the U.S. Government in 2001, as an entity of the U.S. Muslim  Brotherhood.  Elibiary first disclosed the relationship in  a 2007 article in The Dallas Morning News.  He met Baker as a teenager and was so  moved by the terrorist funder’s explanation  of alleged Israeli persecution of Palestinians  that he says he began donating monthly to  Baker’s foundation until it closed in 2001.  The  friendship  continued, with Elibiary  meeting with Baker for coffee the day before  he was convicted.  Elibiary maintains that Baker is innocent.  And in 2010, he wrote that the U.S. Government was ‘‘using the law to force compliance  with unjust foreign policies.’’ He reiterated  his belief that the U.S. should not have prosecuted the Holy Land Foundation.  The Muslim activist has never disguised  his support for Muslim Brotherhood extremism.

It  was  1 week ago President Obama’s  health  insurance  exchanges  opened,  and by all accounts it was a complete  disaster.  The administration had 31⁄2years to  prepare  for the big  launch. It spent  months and millions of dollars advertising the start date. Yet on October 1,  the American people had their  first  chance to sign up, and the exchanges  flopped. It was a complete fiasco.

341,House,113,0.486,11,2013-10-22,Mr. YOUNG of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  nearly 3,000 Hoosier children are currently eligible for adoption while living  in foster care. Now, I know all of us  can agree that these children and the  over  100,000  children  in  the United  States eligible for adoption deserve a  stable, permanent, and  loving home.  While there is no doubt our foster care  programs provide an essential service, I  strongly believe, as a proud father of  four young children and as someone  who used to provide free legal services  to those wanting to adopt, that there  can be no substitute for the care a loving family can provide.  Whether it is living with a family  member or being adopted into a new  family, we must do everything in our  powers to see that children everywhere  receive the best upbringing possible.  This legislation represents a step forward in finding these children caring  and supportive homes. By extending  the Adoption Incentives program, we  effectively encourage and  incentivize  States to help adopt more children out  of foster care so these children can lead  happy, healthy, and successful lives.  ",2013
342,House,113,-0.402,11,2013-10-22,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, at this  time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSONLEE).  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I  thank the managers of this bill, the  gentleman  from Washington and the  gentleman from Texas, my colleague  from, we would say on the floor, the  great State of Texas.  This  is a very  important measure  that I have had an opportunity to engage  in. A couple of years back—I  would say more years than I would like  to  remember—former  Congressman  Mike Andrews and myself were cochairs of the Foster Grandparents Program in Houston, and it drew me to the  importance of both  foster care and  adoption.  I have also spent some time with  Senator MARYLANDRIEU, who, as many  know, is a very strong advocate of the  idea of adoption and legal guardianship  for children in foster care.  One of the new phenomenons that we  are seeing more and more is the phenomenon of aging out for foster care  children; and so I rise today to support  H.R. 3205 and compliment the cochairs  of the Foster Care Caucus, of which I  am a member, Congresswoman BASS  and cochair MARINO, and really ask my  colleagues to support this important  initiative. I am very proud to cosponsor this legislation; and as a cochair  and founder of the Congressional Childrens Caucus, now almost 20 years, I  would like to say I strongly support it.  The more  times  that we can  say  something positive about children in a  bipartisan way on  the  floor of  the  House, the more of a national statement and commitment is seen by those  who are in the various venues in our  States and county government and city  government who work every day to  protect our children. Foster care serves  our children and  families  in a temporary placement by providing suitable, permanent living. Most children  are placed in foster care temporarily  due to parental abuse and neglect.  In Harris County, my  county  in  Texas, 2,388 children were taken into  protective custody in 2011. The average  number of children in foster care each  month in Harris County is 5,300. 2,440  children  in Child Protective Service  custody were placed in permanent living in Harris County in 2011.  This is the right direction to go. As  of September 30, 2012, 1,740 children in  the Houston region are still waiting to  be adopted; and, on average, children  stay in the system for almost 3 years  before either being reunited with their  families or adopted.  What a wonderful statement to know  that there are families or adults that  love you. Many times, those adoptions  are amongst  family members. Many  times, the grandparents take the children. Let’s thank them, because that  was the program I was involved in, to  give R and R, rest, to the grandparents  who foster care for many, many children.  Frequent moves, different  schools,  our children need  loving care. They  need stability. Many times these foster  parents provide that kind of stability.  Many foster children have been separated not only from their parents, but  from their siblings, and this can be  very detrimental socially, emotionally,  and psychologically.  ",2013

YOUNG,  Probably more than anyone in the  House of Representatives or Congress, I  have known BILL I  think,  longer. He and I were both aides to the  first Republican Congressman since the  Civil War, Bill Kramer. He was an aide  before I was, but we met and worked  together more than 40 years ago.  So I rise tonight not only as a colleague, but as a personal friend and political ally of a great human being,  someone who put his heart and soul  into his position, who loved our servicemen and -women, and his great legacy will be all he has done to honor  their memory.  Tonight, we honor his memory with  renaming Bay Pines veterans hospital  for BILLYOUNG, my friend.  ",2013
345,House,113,-0.281,18,2013-10-22,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," I thank the  gentlelady for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of  the legislation before us this evening  to rename the Bay Pines Veterans Affairs Medical Center  in Florida  the  C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. I am honored to join over 200 of my House colleagues as an original cosponsor of this  bipartisan legislation, a great tribute  to one of our dearest colleagues.  Indeed, BILLYOUNGwill be forever  known as one of the strongest supporters of our military and veterans in  the  history  of  this  Congress. His  staunch and unyielding support of our  military and our veterans is legendary.  Likewise, he was a true champion for  his district, and a fount of knowledge  about the chronicles of the U.S. House  of Representatives.  BILLYOUNGwill be missed in Washington, as well as in Florida. He, along  with the late Congressman Jack Murtha, were not only great friends and  mentors to me, but their wives, Beverly and Joyce, were also friends and  mentors to my wife, Vivian.  Chairman Murtha  and  Chairman  YOUNGwere neither Democrat nor Republican when it came to our national  defense. Regardless of which was the  chairman or ranking member of the  Defense Subcommittee, the men and  women of America’s military would be  taken care of.  I am proud to have  served as a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense  under both of these great leaders.  With BILLYOUNG’s death, the Nation  has truly lost one of the few remaining  statesmen. Our thoughts and prayers  are with Beverly and the entire family.  Congress and our Nation have lost one  of its greatest statesmen. I have lost a  dear friend and a mentor.  While we could use every word  in  every language spoken by mankind, we  would not have enough words combined  to adequately thank BILLYOUNG for  his service. But I am pleased to join my  colleagues in passing this resolution to  rename the Bay Pines Veterans Affairs  Medical Center in Florida the C.W. Bill  Young Department of Veterans Affairs  Medical Center.  It has been said that you make your  living by what you get; you make your  life by what you give.

365,,113,-0.404,39,2013-10-22,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize Roanoke Electric Cooperative that recently celebrated its 75th anniversary delivering affordable electricity  to  rural  eastern North Carolina. The Cooperative  is  headquartered in my Congressional District in  Aulander, North Carolina and serves seven of  the 24 counties I represent.  The Cooperative grew out of the Rural Electrification Administration  (REA)  created  by  President Franklin Roosevelt. REA’s goal was  to foster the construction of electric distribution  lines so that rural areas of the country could  avail themselves of the great benefits of electricity.  Roanoke Electric Cooperative was chartered  on September  30,  1938  and  construction  began immediately. By the middle of 1939, the  56 miles of electric distribution lines that had  been constructed went live and provided electricity to 317 individual locations in rural North  Carolina.  Before the Cooperative existed, Americans  living in rural areas began their day at sunrise  and ended it at sunset. Every task—be it simple or complex—had  to be done manually.  Washing and drying clothes, farm work, cooking, cleaning, and even accessing water took  time and effort  that had been drastically reduced in urban areas due to the existence of  electricity.  Struck by the glaring inequity between rural  and  urban  areas,  then-Nebraska  Senator  George Norris said ‘ ‘I had seen first-hand the  grim drudgery and grind which had been the  common lot of eight generations of American  farm women. I knew what it was to take care  of the farm chores by the flickering, undependable light of the lantern in the cold rains of the  fall and the icy winds of winter. Those rural  women were conscious of the great gap between their lives and the lives of those women  whom by birth or choice lived in towns and cities with electricity in their homes.’ ’  Now Roanoke Electric Cooperative  has  more than 2,000 miles of electric distribution  lines and serves nearly 15,000 individual locations in its seven county footprint. The Cooperative is led by Curtis Wynn who serves as  its President and CEO. Mr. Wynn is the first  African American  in  the nation  to serve an  electric cooperative in that capacity. Under his  visionary leadership, Roanoke Electric Cooperative has been recognized by the National  Rural  Electric  Cooperative  Association  (NRECA) and has  received  the Community  Service Network Award on two separate occasions. Mr. Wynn also serves on the Board of  Directors for NRECA.  Mr. Speaker, Roanoke Electric Cooperative  has proudly and effectively served my constituents in rural eastern North Carolina for 75  years. I offer my sincere congratulations to Mr.  Wynn and his  team and ask  that my colleagues join me in sending best wishes to Roanoke Electric Cooperative as it continues to  be a vital and integral part of the lives of families and businesses in eastern North Carolina.

Don Tuttle’s long career with the Humboldt  County Public Works Department’s Natural  Resources Division and his deep involvement  in key resource, energy and historical issues  has been a great benefit to Humboldt County  and California’s North Coast. His expertise  and meticulous chronicling of events continues  to be an asset on which the community relies.  Don Tuttle’s positions as administrator of  the Eel-Russian River Commission from 1978  to 1988, and as a member of the Trinity River  Task Force Technical Advisory Committee,  helped shape  the  recovery of  two essential  North Coast rivers. As chairman of the Humboldt Bay Harbor Safety Commission, he was  instrumental in developing the Humboldt Bay  Deepening Project, which allows the harbor to  act as a deep-water port and ensures  the  safety of all mariners. As a longtime member  of the Humboldt County Historical Society, and  president of  the society  from 1989  to 1992,  Don Tuttle has painstakingly worked  to preserve the county’s rich history.  Among the vital efforts in which Don Tuttle  was  instrumental are helping secure  funding  from Congress for a bank protection project to  shield King Salmon from wave and tidal action; assisting  in  recapturing water diverted  from the Eel River for the benefit of salmon  and steelhead; developing a mitigation bank in  conjunction with the Fay Slough Wildlife Area  north of Eureka; and  the creation of a vast  data bank of aerial photographs, maps, and  documents used by many professionals  in  Humboldt County.  Mr. Speaker, Don Tuttle’s  tremendous efforts  to preserve and protect  the Humboldt  County community and  its natural resources  are worthy of  recognition.

The collaboration between  Chairman  Ranking  Member  and  the rest of  the committee demonstrates that we can work together to invest  in our nation ’s infrastructure to make the U.S.  more competitive and grow the economy. The  backlog  of  unfinished water  infrastructure  projects and maintenance  is hindering economic recovery and hurting small businesses  by slowing trade. This bill helps address the  backlog by updating critical  infrastructure  to  allow goods to move more efficiently across  our nation’s waterways, ports and coasts.  However, like most pieces of legislation, this  bill  is not perfect. Although  this bill makes  some critical  improvements  to current  law,  I  continue to be concerned with changes in environmental assessments and public comment  periods  in  the U.S. Army Corps’ project approval process. That is why I supported Rep.  PETERDEFAZIO ’s (OR–04) amendment requiring the Army Corps to decrease their backlog  of water infrastructure improvements to under  $20 billion before the modified environmental  assessment process can go into effect. There  are currently over $40 billion in projects that  have been authorized under  the current approval process, but they lack sufficient appropriations  to actually complete  them. While  I  understand  the need  to  improve  the Army  Corps’ project approval process, it would be  helpful to start addressing the lack of appropriated  funds  for  previously  authorized  projects.  Although Rep. DEFAZIO ’s amendment failed,  I still supported  this  legislation because  it  makes many  important  improvements  to  the  Great Lakes water infrastructure that will improve transportation and trade as well as protect against invasive species. I will continue to  fight for policies that help the Army Corps decrease its backlog of construction and maintenance projects and protect our precious natural resources.  f  RETAIL INVESTOR PROTECTION  ACT  SPEECHOF  HON.

395,,113,-0.448,109,2013-10-30,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, well, here we  go again. The House is taking up another bill  that seeks  to gut  the Dodd-Frank Act. H.R.  2374’s authors purport that the bill is meant to  protect investors. But its practical effect would  be just the opposite. The bill would impose onerous—and unnecessary—new  requirements  on the Securities and Exchange Commission  from  imposing a common  fiduciary standard  on broker-dealers and  investment advisers  alike. Dodd-Frank directed that the Commission study this matter, and it did. The Commission found it necessary in a 2011 report  and stands ready, willing, and able  to complete a rulemaking. What ’s worse is that the  bill would also prevent  the Department of  Labor  from moving  forward with a  fiduciary  duty  rulemaking  for employee benefit plans  until after the Commission has acted. In the  simplest of terms, the Commission’s and Department of Labor ’s common  intention with  these rulemakings is to protect investors. H.R.  2374 ’s practical effect would be  to prevent  both from doing so.  This  is  another  example  of  not  having  learned  the  lessons of  the past.  Investor  abuses in part precipitated the 2008 financial  crisis. Passing H.R. 2374 would be a terrible  step backward and a validation of the practices  that nearly brought  this country  to  its  knees. The financial services industry is in no  way, shape, or form deserving of this type of  deregulation. Vote this bill down, and stand up  for the financial security of American investors.  f  RETAIL INVESTOR PROTECTION  ACT  SPEECHOF  HON.

396,,113,0.689,116,2013-10-30,Mr. BRIDENSTINE.," Mr. Speaker, on Monday, October 28, 2013,  the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3304, a bill to authorize  and  request  the President  of  the  United States to award the Medal of Honor to  Bennie G. Adkins and Donald P. Sloat of the  United States Army for acts of valor during the  Vietnam Conflict and to authorize the award of  the Medal of Honor to certain other veterans  who were previously recommended for award  of the Medal of Honor. I am a proud original  co-sponsor of H.R. 3304.  The  late Mr. Donald P. Sloat was a constituent in the First District of Oklahoma. Then-  Specialist Four Donald P. Sloat served our  country during the Vietnam Conflict. On January 17, 1970,  then-Specialist Four Donald  Sloat, a machinegunner with Company D, 2nd  Battalion, 1st  Infantry Regiment, 196th Light  Infantry, Americal Division was killed saving  the  lives of  three of his  fellow soliders by  shielding them from a grenade blast with his  own body.  For his gallantry and  intrepidity,  then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates determined  that Mr. Sloat’s actions merited the Medal of  Honor. I submit the following letter from Secretary Gates  to Representative Howard P.  ‘Buck’ ’ McKeon, Chairman  of  the House  Armed Services Committee. In his letter, Secretary Gates notes  that  the Medal of Honor  must be awarded ‘ ‘within three years after the  date of the act justifying the award.’ ’ Congress  must waive the time limit before the President  of the United States can award the Medal of  Honor to Mr. Sloat. By passing H.R. 3304, the  House of Representatives took the first step in  ensuring that Mr. Sloat receives the honor he  so richly deserves.  SECRETARYOFDEFENSE,  1000 DEFENSEPENTAGON,  Washington, DC, January 11, 2013.  Hon. HOWARDP. ‘‘BUCK’’ MCKEON,  Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House  of Representatives, Washington, DC.  DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing in response to requests from Senator Tom Coburn  and Representative John Sullivan for award  of the Medal of Honor (MoH) to then-Specialist Four (SP4) Donald P. Sloat under the  provisions of title 10, U.S.C., section 1130, of  ‘‘Consideration of proposals for decorations  not previously submitted in timely fashion:  procedures for review.’’  I reviewed the proposal for award of the  MoH to then-SP4 Sloat for saving the lives of  three of his fellow soldiers by shielding them  from a grenade blast with his own body on  January 17, 1970, during the Vietnam conflict. After giving the nomination careful  consideration, I believe then-SP4 Sloat’s actions merit award of the MoH. However, title  10, U.S.C., section 3744, requires that the  MoH be awarded ‘‘within three years after  the date of the act justifying the award.’’  Therefore, a statutory time waiver to title  10, U.S.C., section 3744, is required before the  President of the United States may, if he so  chooses, award the MoH to then-SP4 Sloat.  The  final award authority  for the MoH  rests solely with the President of the United  States. My  favorable determination  in no  way presumes what the President’s decision  might be.  If you have any questions regarding this  matter, please contact the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative  Affairs. A similar letter is being sent to the  Chairman  of  the Senate Committee  on  Armed Services, Senator Tom Coburn, and  Representative John Sullivan.  Sincerely,  ROBERTM. GATES,  Secretary of Defense.  f  DISAPPROVAL  LATING  TO  CREASE  RESOLUTION  DEBT  LIMIT  REINSPEECHOF  HON. JOHN D.

This week, Post 9094 celebrates their 75th  anniversary, which is a testament to the lasting commitment these veterans have to helping fellow veterans and non-veterans in Highland County.  The Korean War Memorial is inscribed ‘ ‘Our  nation honors her sons and daughters who  answered  the call  to defend a country  they  never knew and a people they never met.’ ’  In conflicts around the globe, the members  of VFW Post 9094 answered this call.  Southern Ohio and our nation are eternally  grateful to them for their service, and deeply  grateful  that  these dedicated veterans continue to answer the call to support and protect  all veterans and families in need in Highland  County, as Post 9094 has now done for 75  years.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL  WILDLIFE  REFUGE  EXPANSION  LIMITATION ACT OF 2013  HON.

398,,113,0.606,123,2013-10-30,Mr. FLORES.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I would  like  to honor  the heroism of Specialist Fifth  Class Clarence E. Sasser of the United States  Army.  Specialist Fifth Class Clarence E. Sasser  was a private in the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division and when  he earned the U.S. military’s highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his selfless and  courageous acts on January 10, 1968, in Vietnam.  As a combat medic in Vietnam, Specialist  Sasser served our country above and beyond  the call of duty.  On January 10th, 1968, his company was  making an air assault when it took fire from  enemy positions on three sides of the landing  zone.  While under enemy  fire, Specialist Sasser  helped drag a wounded soldier to cover, all  while refusing medical treatment for a wound  in his left shoulder. He then returned to help  more of his fellow soldiers. He quickly treated  soldiers in need and then continued to search  for other wounded.  Near the end of the action, even with two  additional wounds  immobilizing his  legs, he  crawled  through mud  toward another soldier  100 meters away, and while faint from blood  loss and in agonizing pain, he continued treating soldiers for hours until they were all evacuated.  Specialist Sasser  received  the Medal of  Honor from President Richard Nixon in 1969  and on November 7, 2013, he will become the  eighth Texas Aggie  to be added  to Texas  A&M University’s Medal of Honor Hall of  Honor.  Specialist Sasser was born  in Chenango,  Texas, and following his military service he attended Texas A&M University on a scholarship offered by  then President James Earl  Rudder in August 1969.  After attending Texas A&M, he began working at an oil refinery for more than five years  before going on to work at the United States  Department of Veterans Affairs.  Mr. Speaker, it is such a great privilege that  Specialist Sasser’s Medal of Honor and associated citation will be housed and showcased  on  the campus of Texas A&M University,  which I am honored to represent.  Specialist Sasser’s sacrifice and heroic efforts will never be forgotten. It is for his fearless courage, heroism and true dedication to  our country that Texas A&M is proud to remember and honor  the actions of Specialist  Fifth Class Clarence E. Sasser.  I would like to close by asking all Americans  to please pray  for our country and  for our  brave American men and women who serve in  the military to protect her.  f  TRIBUTE TO ARMY SPECIALIST  WESLEY ACUNA  HON. JOHN R. CARTER  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 30, 2013  ",2013
399,,113,0.467,123,2013-10-30,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  salute  Army  Specialist Wesley  Acuna  of  Round Rock, TX who was recently awarded  the Expert Field Medical Badge. This symbol  of excellence  is a sign of his  technical and  tactical proficiency.  With only a 17-percent pass rate, the Expert  Field Medical Badge remains one of the most  prestigious and coveted awards a medical professional can obtain in the Army. The testing  process, which mirrors the dynamic role medics play in operations today, emphasizes tactical combat casualty care, evacuation, communication, and warrior skills. The security of  America  permits  no  compromise when  it  comes to upholding these high standards.  Inspired by the support from both his section and his unit, Spc. Acuna excelled through  these challenging tests and finally persevered  through the grueling final stages of the qualifying event, a 12 mile march  in  full combat  load  in  the blazing Kuwaiti desert. Under  harsh and stressful conditions, he proved himself as both expert medical professional and  skilled warrior. That he was one of 21 elite  soldiers to be awarded the Expert Field Medical Badge speaks volumes about his excellence, professionalism, and determination.  Despite  his  tremendous  accomplishment,  Spc. Acuna has no time to rest on his laurels.  He  is currently deployed  to  the Middle East  with the 36th Combat Aviation Brigade in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The  needs of his mission and his country continue.  Spc. Wesley Acuna’s commitment to excellence not only displays the best values of central Texas, but is a reflection of the greatness  of the men and women of our armed forces.  I commend his achievements and celebrate  his commitment and perseverance.

400,House,113,0.334,6,2013-11-12,Mr. LANCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of S. 252, the PREEMIE  Reauthorization Act, which will provide vital and continued medical education and research in the national effort to reduce preterm births. This legislation will advance the great progress  made since the 2006 act and support  Federal research and community  involvement in premature birth research.  Our Nation’s premature birth rate is  among the highest in the world, and it  is the leading cause of newborn deaths  in the United States. Infants born just  a few weeks too soon can face serious  health challenges and are at risk for  lifelong health and  learning disabilities.  In addition to  its human toll  among  infants and  its toll on their  families, premature births cost our Nation’s economy much financially, and  while  the medical  community  has  made great strides in identifying the  risk factors associated with premature  births, far too many premature births  today have no known causes.  It is fitting that the House will consider this legislation this evening. November marks Prematurity Awareness  Month, a product of the fine work of  the March of Dimes. The March of  Dimes  estimates  that,  since  2006,  176,000 fewer babies have been born too  soon because of improvements in the  preterm birth rate. This  is why the  Members of the House and the Senate  have worked in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to reauthorize the 2006  act.  I thank Chairman UPTONand Chairman PITTSand Ranking Member WAXMANand Ranking Member PALLONE for  their leadership on this issue, as well  as Senator ALEXANDER and Senator  and Senator BENNET.

These men,  representing the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, are a part of the Greatest Generation,  and I am grateful to have the privilege of recognizing  their  service  as  our  nation  approaches Veterans Day.  These 15 veterans, honored for their service  including one awarded with  the Silver Star,  were engaged in active duty missions in Africa  and the European and Pacific theaters where  they were present for some of history’s most  poignant and  influential battles. One Marine  recounts a vivid tale set in a foxhole at the  battle of Iwo Jima. He notices his fellow Marines on higher ground unpredictably congregating in the distance. He directs the attention  of Marines nearby to the mountaintop scene,  and as he watches Marines raise an American  flag on top of Mt. Suribachi, he does not yet  realize that he is witnessing first-hand one of  the most quintessential images of the Second  World War.

To all who have  donned the uniform of a member of the United  States Armed Forces, thank you for your service.  f  TRIBUTE TO MAUDINE COOPER  HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON  OFTHEDISTRICTOFCOLUMBIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 12, 2013  ",2013
413,,113,-0.317,83,2013-11-12,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Speaker, we need to do  more to protect our environment, not less.  Last month, for the first time in six years,  the House passed a water infrastructure bill.  For the first time in six years, Congress authorized crucial investments in our ports and  inland waterways. And for the first time in six  years, we addressed flood risk management,  hurricane and storm damage  risk  reduction,  and environmental restoration.  The Water Resource Reform and Development Act will strengthen our national water  transportation network to improve our competitiveness, create more  jobs, and grow our  economy. But unfortunately, Mr. Speaker,  it  came at a cost.  This vital legislation coupled investments in  our nation’s aging infrastructure with the further weakening of one of  this nation ’s most  important environmental protections: The National Environmental Policy Act.  For more  than  four decades,  the National  Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, has provided  the  foundation  for countless  improvements in our environmental laws. It gives us  cleaner water, cleaner air, and a safer and  healthier  environment.  It  provides  critical  checks and balances on federal planning and  decision making, requiring the federal government to consider environmental impacts. And  it gives the public the opportunity to voice their  concerns about the impact of federal actions  on their health, safety, environment, and community.  This collaborative review process engages  millions of Americans along with federal and  state agencies, and forces the federal government  to  think outside  the box and consider  better alternatives.  Over  the years, NEPA has saved money,  time, and resources. It has also protected endangered species, public lands and historical  sites, all while producing better projects with  more public support. For example, when the  Army Corps of Engineers planned to repair existing breakwaters and replace the lock gates  of Chicago’s harbor, NEPA revealed a better  method of repairing and extending the life of  the breakwaters at a  fraction of  the cost.  NEPA has proven that it’s possible to protect  the environment and save the taxpayer money  at the same time.  Unfortunately, misperceptions  about  this  foundational  environmental  law  are  driving  congressional attempts to chip it away. NEPA  is frequently blamed as the leading cause of  project delays when, in reality, lack of funding  is actually to blame. We fault NEPA, when we  should be blaming ourselves.  We  continue  to  slash  funding  for Army  Corps construction despite the American Society of Civil Engineers’ D-minus rating of our  nation’s inland waterways. We can eliminate  project delays and protect the environment at  the same time, but a more serious investment  in our infrastructure is needed to do so.  Instead the WRRDA bill passed last week  alters the NEPA process, weakening environmental protections at a  time when  they are  needed the most. This WRRDA has made it  more difficult for the public to comment on environmental impacts by limiting the comment  period to as little as 60 or 30 days, depending  on the type of project. Environmental review  statements are often hundreds of pages long  and full of critical scientific research.  Many critics argue  this  is barely enough  time  to  read and understand a  review,  let  alone consult experts and submit  informed  public comments. These new arbitrary and unreasonably short deadlines hurt community  voices  in  speaking  out  against  harmful  projects and penalize agencies  for  fulfilling  their responsibility to fully deliberate on important environmental issues.  Good science takes time, and the proposed  changes to the environmental review process  give experts little time to adequately evaluate  the  impacts of a project. Environmental  reviews are a crucial tool for improving transportation projects and safeguarding the environment.  An  informed public engagement process  produces  ideas,  information and even solutions  the government might otherwise have  overlooked. Streamlining current NEPA provisions carelessly hurts our ability to make better  decisions  that  protect  our  health,  our  homes and our environment.  Meeting our transportation needs and protecting our environment are not mutually exclusive objectives.  NEPA, Mr. Speaker, is the solution, not the  problem.  f  THE RETIREMENT OF JEANNE  STONER  HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 12, 2013  ",2013
414,,113,-0.329,83,2013-11-12,Mr. DOYLE.," Mr. Speaker, one of my constituents, Jeanne Stoner, is retiring this month  from her position as Assistant Vice Chancellor  at the University of Pittsburgh, after a long and  productive career at this highly respected institution. I want to take this opportunity to recognize all the outstanding work that Jeanne has  done to help the University of Pittsburgh and  our community throughout her career.  Jeanne was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She earned a number of academic degrees,  including a bachelor of arts degree,  summa cum laude from Clarke College in Dubuque,  Iowa, a master of arts degree  in  English Language and Literature from the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Juris  Doctorate degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. After law school, Jeanne  went to work as an associate attorney for the  Pittsburgh law firm of Thomson, Rhodes and  Cowie, and she’s lived there ever since.  For the last 25 years, Jeanne has worked  for the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Her first position was as the Director of Federal Government Relations for the UPMC Health System  from 1989–1998. In 1999, she was appointed  to be the Corporate Secretary for UPMC. In  January 2000, Jeanne moved from UPMC to  Pitt  to become  the University’s Director of  Federal Government Relations, and she was  subsequently named Assistant Vice Chancellor and Associate General Counsel. In each  of these positions, Jeanne worked diligently on  the University’s behalf, addressing whatever  issues came across her desk with dedication  and professionalism.  Jeanne also served on many committees for  various higher education professional organizations including the Association of Public and  Land Grant Universities and the Association of  American Universities. In 2009, in recognition  of her many contributions to higher education,  Jeanne was awarded the Carolyn Cross Distinguished Service Award from the Association  of Public and Land Grant Universities’ Council  on Government Affairs.  Jeanne and her husband Bill have 4 children and 7 grandchildren, and she is an active  member of  the St. Thomas More Parish  in  Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.  I have known and worked with Jeanne for  most of her time at Pitt and UPMC on a number of public policy and community-related  issues. Consequently, I can say from personal  experience what a warm, gracious, intelligent,  and skilled professional she  is. She always  had Pittsburgh ’s best  interests at heart.  It’s  been a great pleasure to work with her over  the years, and her retirement will put a big  dent in the University’s institutional memory.  I have been privileged to know Jeanne and  work with her over the many years that I’ve  served in Congress. She has applied great intelligence, energy, and dedication on behalf of  both Pitt and Pittsburgh. I want to thank her  for her many contributions to our community,  congratulate her on the occasion of her retirement, and wish her the best as she begins the  next phase of her life.  f  HONORING THE MARTIN GUITAR  COMPANY  HON.

For nearly  two centuries, Martin Guitar has contributed  to  the  musical culture of America by producing some  of the finest acoustic instruments on the market.  The story of Martin Guitar’s beginning  is  uniquely American. The company’s  founder,  Christian Frederick Martin, Sr., was born  in  Markneukirchen, Saxony  (now Germany) on  31 January 1796. He became an apprentice  guitar maker at the age of 15, and after showing much promise in his early years, opened  his own shop. After struggling to run a successful  business  among Europe’s warring  trade guilds, Martin determined to seek his fortune in the United States. In 1883, he set up  a modest shop  in New York City. After  five  years of hard work, Martin was able to sell his  humble store and purchase eight acres of land  in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where  the company continues to grow and thrive today.

One of the constitutional responsibilities of Congress is to  ‘‘promote the  progress of science and useful arts.’’  This legislation does just that by deterring abuse of our patent litigation  system.  As a United States Attorney, I saw  how patent trolls abuse our patent litigation  system by acquiring patents  that they have no intention of using  for anything other than their own monetary gain. Patent trolls sue companies  for allegedly infringing on patents they  had no business acquiring in the first  place.  The  Innovation Act, which  I  am  proud to cosponsor, makes it more difficult for patent trolls to form a case.  It also aligns  fee shifting  in patent  cases,  which  discourages  frivolous  cases.  Madam Chairman, there is a lot of  opportunity  for  job creation  in  the  technology sector. The Innovation Acts  is essential to protecting these technology  companies  from  fraud  and  abuse.  I want  to  thank Chairman GOODLATTEfor his leadership on this issue.  ",2013

425,,113,-0.491,74,2013-12-05,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  last week, our  community  lost a great civic  leader, a  true  American success story and a pillar of the San  Francisco Bay Area: Masud Mehran. He  passed away on November 26th, at the age of  93, surrounded, as he always was throughout  his long life, by his family, by those he loved,  by those he cherished most.  Masud Mehran lived the American Dream.  He was an immigrant who came with his wife,  Maryam,  to  the United States  from  Iran  in  search of opportunity. He got an education  from some of our finest universities and traveled across our country. He made his way to  the Bay Area, to the region that would be his  home for more than 60 years, and started a  business. And over the ensuing decades, he  built Sunset Development Company into one  of the largest, most successful real estate developers in California.  For Masud, extraordinary success  in business was not enough; his values, his heritage,  and his conscience drove him to do more—for  our community, for our young people, for our  state and nation.  Beyond  his  extensive  leadership  roles  among associations of home builders and developers  in San Francisco and  statewide,  Masud’s generosity could be seen in his support for the health of our youth at Children ’s  Hospital;  the development of our children  in  the Boy Scouts of America; the education of  our students at Golden Gate University, Dominican College, UC Berkeley, and elsewhere.  His efforts were recognized with the Good  Scout award  for outstanding  leadership  in  helping to build a better American community;  the Democratic Heritage award from the Anti-  Defamation League; and the Award of Excellence from the Urban Land Institute for Large-  Scale Office Park Development.  All who knew him will long be inspired by  his  leadership, his values, his strength, and  his willingness to give back to those around  him. His legacy can be found in the impact of  his philanthropy and the example he set for so  many others in the Bay Area and nationwide.  Yet no legacy—in business or in community  activism —could ever compare to the extraordinary pride he always took in his family.  Devotion to his family was Masud’s first priority. Dedication to his loved ones was his defining characteristic. Spending  time with his  wife, Farideh, his son, Alex, and his grandchildren was his greatest joy. He will certainly  be missed by all who knew and loved him.  May  it be a comfort  to  the entire Mehran  family that so many share in their grief and  mourn along their side at this sad time. May  Masud Mehran’s life and memory forever be a  blessing to us all.  f  HONORING THE COLUMBUS EAST  HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM  HON.

She  died unexpectedly and  tragically on October  24, 2013. A memorial service for Sheila will be  held on Friday, December 6, 2013, at First  Baptist Church of Glenarden  in Landover,  Maryland. I want to remember the legacy Ms.  Stewart leaves behind.  Ms. Sheila Stewart had a long and distinguished career of more than 25 years in the  broadcasting  industry. She  epitomized  the  traits of a good citizen, serving our communities as an organizer of engagement and  charitable giving. I join all of the metropolitan  Washington area  in mourning  the  loss of a  great woman and unparalleled public citizen.  Ms. Stewart was born  in Fairfield County,  South Carolina, on February 28, 1969. She  graduated from Benedict College in Columbia,  South Carolina, with a Bachelor of Arts degree  in Broadcast Journalism, and also worked as  an adjunct Professor of Journalism at several  colleges.  Known by radio listeners as ‘ ‘Ms. Community, ’ ’ Ms. Stewart worked for years in Charlotte  at Power98, WPEG–FM, where  she  served as on-air-personality and news and  public affairs director. When she relocated to  the Washington, DC, area, Sheila worked as  the news and community affairs director  for  Radio One. She was at the helm of news programming at WKYS, Radio One’s DC station,  and  the company’s other affiliates,  including  Praise 104.1, WPRS–FM.

Magness Library began as a service  project  in July  1913 by Mrs. Mary  Cunningham  and  the McMinnville  Women’s  Civic League, with  benefactors Colonel Gentry Moffitt  and  W.H. Magness, to provide a rest stop  for families coming into town to sell  and trade. In 1917, the library moved to  its current location on the corner of  Chancery and Main Street, and in 1946,  Magness Library joined the Tennessee  State Library and Archives.  Thanks to generous donations from  thousands of patrons, the Magness Library flourished into one of the longest  running libraries in our State over the  years. The library provides invaluable  services to McMinnville,  including a  strong  summer  reading program  for  children and genealogy  research  for  adults.  Congratulations to the Magness Library on their centennial, and I look  forward to seeing their successful future endeavors.  f  IRAN INTERIM NUCLEAR  AGREEMENT  (Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.)

429,House,113,-0.341,9,2013-12-12,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, if the interim nuclear deal negotiated last month leads to a final  agreement, Iran can be prevented from  developing  a  nuclear weapon. This  would neutralize one of the greatest  threats  facing  the  United  States,  Israel, and the international community and could set the stage for a new  era of relations between Iran and the  West.  The unprecedented sanctions already  in place have brought the Iranian economy to its knees and the government  to the negotiating table. We are entering  these  talks  from a position of  strength; we have a strong hand to  play.  But if Congress rushes through another round of sanctions or takes other  action perceived as undermining the  negotiations, we will be giving up our  hand before we have a chance to play  it.

This legislation represents the best  path  forward  for the work that we  must do in order to support our men  and women  in uniform and our national security, and I applaud Chairman MCKEON and Ranking Member  SMITHfor their efforts to ensure that it  is enacted.  I am pleased that the bill continues  the strong support of the Virginia-class  submarine,  Ohio  Replacement  Program, and the Virginia Payload Module, all of which are critical to our future capabilities.  I am also pleased  that this measure improves on several  E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P V 4 K S D n o BERRY key aspects of the House-passed defense authorization, including a number of initiatives designed to confront  sexual assault in our military, policies  making progress towards the administration’s goal of closing the detention  facility at Guantanamo Bay, and improved provisions relating to the nuclear weapons enterprise and missile  defense.  I have been proud to work closely in  particular with Chairman MACTHORNon  the  numerous  provisions  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the Subcommittee on  Intelligence Emerging  Threats and Capabilities, where I am  proud to serve as ranking member. We  have prioritized resources for our Special Operations Forces and our cybersecurity efforts, as well as investments  in advanced technology and research  and development.  While more clearly must be done by  both DOD and the whole of government  to address the challenges our Nation  faces  in cyberspace, there are many  positive steps as well in this legislation, including incentivizing new cybersecurity  standards,  ensuring U.S.  Cyber Command has proper authorities  and personnel, and coordinating cybersecurity  efforts  with  related  disciplines.

There are those of us who are worried  about  regulations, who  are worried  about the exercise of power at the executive branch, who are worried about a  sense of less accountability among the  executive branch. We do lots of oversight hearings. We do dozens a week.  But  oversight  pales  in  comparison  when it doesn’t have any fiscal force  behind it. By reclaiming the power of  the purse, by having Congress write the  budgets and approve and decide the  budgets of the executive agencies, that  gives us a far stronger hand in effecting effective oversight and conducting  oversight. By using the power of the  purse, along with effective oversight,  we can do our jobs as the legislative  branch in conducting oversight of the  executive branch and setting priorities.  My friends have their priorities, and  we have our priorities, and sometimes  we meet and sometimes we don’t. At  least Congress gets to set the priorities  on how the money sent to us  from  hardworking taxpayers is spent. That  is one of the things that  is accomplished in this agreement. That, along  with all these other reasons, is why I  really encourage all of our Members to  support this agreement.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN.

Mr. Mandela stood for peace, for justice, and for a society that recognized  the equality of every human being.  After serving 27 years  in prison  for  challenging  the  apartheid-sanctioned  South African Government, Nelson  Mandela emerged with a powerful message of forgiveness and reconciliation,  a message that would transform his nation and unite the world.  In 1986, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the majority  of  the  U.S.  Congress  stood  with  Mandela  for peace and  justice, and  helped  force an end to apartheid  in  South Africa. Today, I leave you with  Nelson Mandela’s words:  What counts in life is not the mere fact  that we have lived. It is what difference we  have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.  South Africa and the world will forever  be  changed  because  Nelson  Mandela lived.

484,,113,0.633,429,2013-12-12,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  Bagdad, Florida Volunteer Fire Department  and recognize  the selfless service, sacrifice,  and dedication of  its members, past and  present, in protecting the citizens of the Northwest Florida community.  Formally established  in 1963,  the Bagdad  Volunteer Fire Department was initially founded in 1962 as a Fire Rescue team of ten men  led by Chief Dan Fowler. Despite having little  equipment and no firehouse, this team of dedicated individuals was inspired by the need for  a department to provide for the safety and rescue needs of Bagdad and  the surrounding  Santa Rosa County community. Bagdad Elementary School opened its doors as a meeting  place for the volunteers to discuss business  and other issues, while the Florida Department  of Forestry provided the team’s first truck that  was stationed at the Chief’s home. With the  continued support of the local community and  to meet the growing needs of its citizens, the  department built its first firehouse in 1965 on  donated land and acquired a second fire truck.  A third truck was acquired in 1975, and the  1980’s brought the deployment of a pager system and acquisition of a fourth and more modern  fire  truck. Today,  the department comprises 25 volunteers, 2 Class-A 1,000 gallon  pumpers, an E–1 rescue truck, an E–1 brush  attack truck and a 17.5-foot rescue boat.  Throughout the course of Bagdad Volunteer  Fire Department’s fifty-year history and transformation, what has remained constant is the  clear vision of the required capabilities needed  to successfully meet the safety needs of the  growing community, as well as,  the passion  and dedication of its numerous volunteers.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress, it gives me great pleasure to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Bagdad,  Florida Volunteer Fire Department. My wife  Vicki joins me in thanking all of the volunteers  for their faithful service and wishing them and  the department continued success.  f  HONORING EVAN JOSEPH  HERONEMUS  HON.

485,,113,0.284,436,2013-12-12,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Judge Thomas D. Horne, an  integral member of Loudoun County’s justice  system for more than three decades, who retired at the beginning of this month.  Judge Horne graduated  from Muhlenberg  College in 1965 and went on to attend William  and Mary Law School, where he earned his  law degree in 1969. He began his career as  a judge advocate for the Marines and in 1979,  his love of the courtroom led him to become  the county’s first elected commonwealth’s attorney.  In 1982, he was appointed  to  the  Loudoun Circuit Court and since  then has  heard  some of Loudoun ’s most prominent  cases, including the 2002 first-degree murder  trial of Claire Schwartz, who was found guilty  of killing her father, as well as the nation’s first  ‘spam’ ’ case involving email advertisements.  Although  he  is  one Virginia’s most  respected circuit court judges and described by  his colleagues a ‘ ‘the epitome of fairness’ —  his leadership extends far beyond the courtroom. He helped create a bench book  for  judges in Virginia, which has become an indispensable resource  for  those  involved  in  the  legal profession. Additionally, he spearheaded  the nation’s  first victim-witness program and  started a week-long law camp mentoring teenagers interested in law.  Outside of  the  legal  realm, Judge Horne  serves his community  in other ways.  In  the  1980 ’s he played an important role in the development  of  youth  soccer  programs  in  Loudoun and later formed the Loudoun County Youth Lacrosse League.  I have had the privilege of knowing Tom for  many years. I hope that he enjoys retirement  with his wife, Patricia, and their children, Rob  and Jennifer, and grandchildren, knowing that  he has been a pillar of the Loudoun community for decades. I wish him all the best and  thank him for his outstanding service, both inside and outside of the courtroom.  I submit the following Leesburg Today article on Judge Horne’s remarkable accomplishments.  [From the Leesburg Today, Dec. 5, 2013]  THEEPITOMEOFFAIRNESS’: HORNERETIRES,  AFTERTHREEDECADESONLOUDOUNBENCH  (By Erika Jacobson Moore)  Sitting in his office at the Loudoun County  Courthouse, Judge Thomas D. Horne is reminiscing about his high school football coach  in Baltimore. After being cut during tryouts  for other sports, Horne saw a flyer about a  meeting  for  football. So he went. There,  coach George Young—a future New York Giants general manager and NFL vice president—told  the group,  ‘‘I won’t  cut you.  You’ll cut yourself.’’ Horne joined the football team and Young became a mentor to the  teenager. Then, when it came time for Horne  to consider college, Young stepped up.  ‘‘I didn’t have any money, but every weekend he took me to see schools,’’ Horne remembered. That was when Horne  first  learned anything about Muhlenberg College  in Pennsylvania. ‘‘I didn’t know what it was.  I thought it must have been in Germany  somewhere. But he said, ‘This is the school  for you.’ So I went.’’  It was his time at Muhlenberg that put  Horne on the path that eventually led him to  Loudoun, where he spent more than three  decades as a cornerstone  in the county’s  legal system.  ‘‘The point is: you can make a difference in  someone else’s life. And you should,’’ he said.  It is with that philosophy that Horne has  approached his life and more than 30 years  on the bench in Loudoun’s courtrooms. This  week marks the first time since the late  1970s that Horne  is not a  formal part of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:27 Dec 14, 2013 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A12DE8.046 E12DEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t ‘ ’         ",2013

487,,113,0.492,443,2013-12-12,Mr. HULTGREN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw  attention to the regulatory war being waged by  this administration on American families, individuals, small businesses, states, cities and  towns.  The administration has developed a bad  habit of making endless rules and regulations,  with little regard for their negative effects on  Americans.  From writing confusing tax forms, to mandating what type of water comes out of fire hydrants,  the  vast  bureaucratic machine  in  Washington delights in determining how Americans should live and work.  The exponential  increase of government  rules and regulations poses a clear threat to  our freedom, for instance, the freedom of individuals to start their own businesses and pursue the American Dream.  But there is a solution.  I have introduced H.R. 309, the Regulatory  Sunset and Review Act of 2013, to break this  terrible habit.  I believe that reforms are needed to halt this  administration ’s practice of regulating beyond  the intent of the laws we pass, and to reduce  the burden these regulations place on Americans, especially American businesses.  Before talking more about the solution, allow  me to more fully illustrate the problem and its  impact on growing jobs and the economy.  Now, not all  regulation  is bad, and businesses are more than willing to follow commonsense regulations.  The U.S. Grade Standards  for  fruits and  vegetables, for instance, makes sense for grocers by defining the quality standards for fresh  produce.  If a dispute between buyer and seller arises,  the standards can then determine who is at  fault.  But many federal rules are duplicative, obsolete, unnecessary, conflicting or otherwise  inconsistent.  An analysis by the Government Accounting  Office found that in fiscal year 2013, $95 billion of the $3.6 trillion the federal government  spent was duplicative.  For instance, according to the GAO report,  there are 76 federal drug abuse and prevention treatment programs, spread among an astounding 17 different agencies.  Combined, they generate 6.1 million hours  of paperwork, almost $300 million  in costs,  and 122 forms to be filled out by individuals,  organizations and businesses.  This is an unacceptable waste of tax money  and resources.  The engine of our economy—our small businesses—need room to innovate and expand.  But burdensome and duplicative regulations  drain  resources  from  businesses—harming  their ability hire new workers and create jobs.  In Illinois’ 14th District, business owners tell  me this is the chief block to investing and hiring.  When it costs them more than $10,500 per  employee annually to comply with all federal  regulations, their concerns make sense.  But in 2012, the Obama administration piled  on $236 billion in new regulations.  It’s a little wonder we suffer from weak economic growth and still-too-high unemployment.  President Obama  has  pledged  a  comprehensive review of existing regulations.  But unfortunately, his administration has actually done little to get rid of regulations currently on the books.  In fact, he’s going to be adding many more  next year.  According to an American Action Forum report, upcoming  regulations  from  the Obama  administration in 2014 could cost the private  sector more than $143 billion.  That’s billion with a ‘ ‘b.’ ’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:27 Dec 14, 2013 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A12DE8.069 E12DEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2013

Currently serving her  fifth  term as Supervisor to Ventura County’s 3rd District, Kathy’s  dedication to the residents of Ventura County  is reflected in her extensive work as a public  servant. Since first being elected to the position in 1996, Kathy has made it her mission to  strengthen our economy, ensure a sustainable  environment, and create a safe community for  all families. Her lengthy career in public service shows her unwavering passion  for  representing Ventura County and its residents, as  well as always advocating for the region’s best  interests.  Kathy’s lifelong work has always embodied  the true definition of dedication, public service  and community. She currently serves as the  Board of Supervisor’s  representative on  the  Economic Development Collaborative of Ventura County where her efforts  focus on  the  economic  development  of Ventura County  through  the attraction, preservation and expansion of local businesses. Kathy was most  recently elected as  their Board of Directors  Chair for 2013.  Over her career of more than 16 years as  Supervisor, Kathy has taken on many leadership positions and has effectively represented  our community’s needs and prosperity. She  served as Chair of the Board of Supervisors in  2000, 2005, and 2010.  To honor all that she has done for Ventura  County including her extensive work and advocacy  for a strong and vital economy,  the  Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties Chambers of Commerce Alliance has  recognized  Kathy with the Lawmaker of the Year Award.  This  is a  fitting and well-deserved accolade  that represents the caliber of work that Kathy  performs on a daily basis. Kathy’s pledge to  the economic vitality of Ventura County and  the strengthening of our workforce makes her  a fitting recipient of this honorable recognition.  I have personally known Kathy  for many  years and I am pleased to join the Ventura  and Santa Barbara Counties Chambers of  Commerce Alliance in honoring my friend and  colleague, Supervisor Kathy Long.

491,Senate,113,-0.194,23,2013-12-20,Mr. WARNER.," Madam President, I  would like to call attention to a provision within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.  I would  like  to  thank Chairman  LEVIN, Ranking Member INHOFE, Chairman MCKEON, and Ranking Member  SMITH, for including in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act my  amendment, with Senators COLLINS,  KAINE, and GRASSLEY, to expand whistleblower and enhance protections for  servicemembers who alert authorities  to misconduct that includes sexual assaults and other sexual misconduct. I  would  like to thank my colleagues,  Senators COLLINS, KAINE and GRASSLEY, for their partnership in winning  this breakthrough  in newly-strengthened free speech rights for our troops  when they defend accountability in the  military services. It is important to be  clear  about  a  cornerstone  of  our  amendment, which is the guaranteed  right to an administrative due process  hearing in all whistleblower retaliation  cases. New subsection f(3)(B) provides  that if the Secretary does not make a  finding of illegal retaliation and order  corrective action, the case shall be forwarded to the appropriate Board for  Corrections of Military Records to receive a mandatory administrative due  process hearing,  ‘‘when appropriate.’’  There should not be any confusion. It  is always appropriate to forward the  case for hearing if jurisdiction exists  for whistleblower retaliation alleged in  the servicemember’s complaint. It  is  only inappropriate if another provision  of  law provides the relevant rights,  procedures and remedies to resolve the  complaint, such as when the alleged  misconduct is sexual harassment per se  as opposed to whistleblower retaliation  for disclosing sexual harassment.

492,Senate,113,-0.266,37,2013-12-20,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to introduce the Protecting Lands  Against  Narcotics  Trafficking  or  PLANT Act of 2013 with my colleague  and friend, Senator ORRINHATCH.  This bill, which is similar to House  legislation introduced by Representative JAREDHUFFMAN, will help curb the  severe environmental damage caused  by illegal marijuana grows. I thank my  friend  and  fellow Californian, Representative HUFFMAN,  for his  leadership on this issue.  Across our Nation, but especially in  California, drug traffickers cultivate  marijuana with zero regard for the environmental destruction it causes. Motivated solely by profits, these criminals  illegally divert streams, poison  wildlife, pollute watersheds and destroy  the natural heritage  that we  have worked so hard to protect.  Recognizing the destructive ecological impact of illegal marijuana cultivation, this legislation directs the United  States Sentencing Commission to review and amend Federal  sentencing  guidelines to account for the environmental crimes drug traffickers commit  on public and trespassed lands.  Specifically, the bill  instructs the  Sentencing Commission to put in place  sentencing  guidelines  that  increase  penalties for individuals who engage in  any of the following activities while  cultivating  illegal drugs on Federal  lands or while trespassing on another  person’s property:  Use of poisons or hazardous chemicals,  such  as  pesticides  and  rodenticides; the diversion, redirection,  obstruction, draining or impoundment  of local aquifers, rivers or bodies of  water; or significant removal of vegetation or clear cutting of timber.  In addition  to environmental concerns,  this  legislation addresses  the  safety of our public lands. It directs  the Sentencing Commission to provide  guidelines increasing penalties on drug  traffickers who use or possess a firearm  while producing illegal drugs on federal  or trespassed lands.  Last year alone, over 900,000 marijuana plants were eradicated at 471  sites on National Forest Lands. Sadly,  this represents only a fraction of the  total marijuana illegally grown in our  National Parks, Forests and other public lands. In California, Operation Pristine, a recent effort to combat the environmental damage caused by illegal  marijuana production, resulted in the  removal of over 8,700 tons of trash including pesticides, batteries, fertilizers  and  propane  tanks  from  environmentally sensitive lands.  Drug traffickers often use illegal pesticides smuggled in from Mexico, such  as carbofuran, which contaminate California’s water resources. They also use  pesticides and rodenticides in an illegal  manner,  often  on  protected  lands.  These poisons are having a devastating  impact on California’s wildlife, including the Pacific Fisher, a member of the  Weasel family being considered for listing as an endangered species.  Taxpayers are also being hit hard by  the millions of dollars needed to clean  up the environmental damage caused  by illegal marijuana grows. Estimates  put the cost of reclaiming land damaged by illicit marijuana growth at approximately $15,000 per acre. As you  might expect, drug traffickers are not  setting aside funds for this work, and  the cost is passed on to the American  people.  Illicit marijuana  cultivation  also  damages the economy and hurts legitimate businesses. Timber  companies,  farmers and ranchers have had their  operations  disrupted  by  criminals  growing marijuana illegally. Marijuana  growers on agricultural lands, particularly  in  the Central Valley, divert  thousands of gallons of scarce water  from  legitimate agriculture.  In  2013  alone, California has  identified over  1,800 grow sites in the Central Valley,  including 406 in Tulare County and 537  in Fresno as of November.  As Chairman of the Senate Caucus on  International Narcotics Control  and  also as a Senator who has worked to  safeguard our  country’s natural  resources, I believe that we cannot allow  drug traffickers to destroy our public  lands, pollute our waters and kill our  wildlife with impunity. It is time that  sentencing guidelines  take  into account the environmental damage that  drug traffickers all too often cause.  This  legislation, directing  the Sentencing Commission  to  review  and  amend its guidelines, will do just that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1889  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:39 Jan 08, 2014 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD13\RECFILES\DEC2013\S20DE3.REC S20DE3 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2013
