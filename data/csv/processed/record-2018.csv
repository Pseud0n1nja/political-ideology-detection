42,House,115,0.398,4,2018-01-22,Mr. GIANFORTE.," Mr. Speaker, last  week the House voted to keep the government open with legislation that, on  any other day, every Member would  have supported. It funded the government and it reauthorized CHIP for 6  years, a program that 24,000 Montana  children depend on for their healthcare  needs.  On any other day, these proposals  would pass with broad bipartisan support, but my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle in this Chamber opposed it and 44 Senate Democrats opposed it. And for what?  An unrelated immigration issue that  can be addressed before March.  What has been the result of these  misplaced priorities?  The  government  shutdown. More  than 2 million servicemen and -women  aren’t being paid; 9 million American  children, including 24,000 in Montana,  are losing their healthcare insurance.  My colleagues in the Senate will soon  consider reopening the government. I  urge them, particularly the 44 Senate  Democrats who voted for the Schumer  shutdown, to reopen the government,  pay our troops, and restore health insurance to children.  f  PASS  A  BILL  THAT  INCLUDES  FUNDING  FOR  COMMUNITY  HEALTH  CENTERS AND OTHER  HEALTH PROGRAMS  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2018
43,House,115,0.641,4,2018-01-22,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, during times  of strife and stagnation, the most powerful tool we have at our disposal is the  power of prayer.  It is with that in mind that I offer  my most heartfelt prayers for the men  and women serving in uniform who are  going without pay, and for the 9 million children forgoing access to critical  healthcare during this Schumer shutdown.  House Republicans  fulfilled our bipartisan mission to responsibly  fund  the government, support our troops,  and reauthorize CHIP for the children  who rely on the program. The reason  that  Senator  and  Senate  Democrats shut down the government  is plain and simple. They value the demands of illegal immigrants more than  they value the needs of American citizens.  It is now the third day of the Schumer shutdown and that is 3 days too  SCHUMER many in my book. I pray that the Senate Democrats who have shut down our  government will soon see reason and  will fund the government. Our citizens  deserve better.  End the Schumer shutdown.  f  REPUBLICANS NEED TO OFFER  MEDICAL EXTENDERS  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2018
44,House,115,-0.401,4,2018-01-22,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  not speak about Alabama winning the  national championship.  Mr. Speaker, the reason we are here  is because Republicans care more about  the extremely wealthy than they do  about average American citizens. They  got together and passed a tax scam bill  that gave 86 percent of the moneys to  the top 1 percent in our society.  They gave crumbs to the middle class  that will expire, unlike the corporate  cuts they gave that will not expire.  And then they come up with a children’s healthcare plan as a bargaining  chip to get what is not a clean CR  through, but a CR where they took  funds that will help the ACA continue  and take those down for 2 years so the  ACA is further crippled.  To hear the Republicans talk about  their care for healthcare is laughable.  They were never for Medicaid or Medicare or the Affordable Care Act. They  are not  for a permanent  children’s  healthcare plan. They are not for community health centers, where 40 percent of those CHIP children get their  healthcare.  If they wanted to bring the government back and get us open, they would  offer us the medical extenders like Mr.  PALLONEtalked about. This is unfortunate. We should get past this and we  should stop our mantra that the Republicans have learned.  f  PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker,  parliamentary inquiry.  ",2018

In addition,  the House will, once  again, take up legislation to fund the  Department of Defense  for  its  fiscal  year. This bill will be fully consistent  with the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed the House and  Senate last year on a bipartisan basis  and was signed into law by President  Trump.

SgtMaj Jobe enlisted  in April 1988 and attended the school of infantry at Camp Pendleton, California before reporting to 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. SgtMaj  Jobe served as a machine gunner, machine  gun  team  leader, Troop Handler, Recruiter,  and participated in several deployments before  earning the rank of Staff Sergeant.  After his promotion to Staff Sergeant, Jobe  served as Platoon Sergeant and Platoon Commander in Company K, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, completing deployment with  the 31st  Marine Expeditionary Unit. Post deployment,  Jobe served as the Chief Instructor and Faculty Advisor  for Career Course at  the Staff  Noncommissioned  Officer’s  Academy  in  Japan. As a Gunnery Sergeant, he was assigned the Future Operations Chief for III Marine Expeditionary Force before  reporting  to  1st Battalion, 7th Marines to serve as Company Gunnery Sergeant and  later First Sergeant. During  this assignment, Jobe participated in ‘ ‘The March Up’ ’ to Baghdad during  Operation Iraqi Freedom.  During  the  latter part of his career, Jobe  served as the Inspector & Instructor First Sergeant for Company B, 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion deploying to Iraq. After  selection  to Sergeant Major, Jobe served at  Recruiting Station Dallas until becoming  the  Regimental Sergeant Major for the Eight Marine Regiment at Camp Lejeune. While there,  Jobe deployed  to Afghanistan  in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom. Jobe was then  transferred to 1st Marine Division serving as  the Division Sergeant Major where he served  as the SgtMaj of the Blue Diamond.  SgtMaj  Jobe’s  decorations  include  the  Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal with  gold star, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat ‘ ‘V’ ’ and three  gold  stars,  the Navy  and Marine Corps  Achievement Medal with Combat  ‘V’ ’ and  three gold stars, and the Combat Action Ribbon with Gold Star.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in thanking SgtMaj Jobe and his  family  for  their 30  years of service to the nation. I wish Dave, his  wife, Kerri; and their sons DJ and Tyler, the  best of luck in their future endeavors.  f  REMARKS BY JOHN J. SULLIVAN  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 22, 2018  ",2018
50,,115,0.16,32,2018-01-22,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker, on  December 6, 2017, the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations held a hearing entitled  ‘Advancing Human Rights  to Combat  Extremism.’ ’ The hearing focused on ways soft  power and human rights diplomacy could effectively combat extremist ideology and policies. I had the privilege to sit down with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan recently  and discuss this issue with him in the context  of our ongoing dialogue with the Government  of Sudan. Mr. Speaker, Deputy Secretary Sullivan gave a speech at the Al-Neelain Mosque  in Sudan before a variety of faith leaders. In  the speech, he makes the case for a values-  based diplomacy, and holding countries accountable for violations of fundamental human  rights,  especially  religious  freedom.  I  am  pleased to include in the RECORD the speech  he gave with his permission:  Asalaam Alaikam. I am honored to join all  of you here today.  I would like to first thank the leaders of  the Al-Neelain Mosque for hosting us today  and for their gracious hospitality.  Many people from different faiths, backgrounds, and cultures have joined us here  today to talk about the important work they  are undertaking in Sudan to embrace tolerance and further the goal of mutual respect  among all citizens.  It was a great privilege to spend time with  many of you earlier this morning and to  learn about the many ways that interfaith  groups are working together to forge a new  path forward in Sudan and to move away  from divisions based on religion and culture.  Our discussion was particularly significant  as we continue to build a new relationship  between the United States and Sudan. I want  you to know that the U.S. government and  international community stand with you in  this important work.  THEU.S. COMMITMENT  This is my first visit to your beautiful  country. Secretary Tillerson asked me to  travel to Khartoum to speak with you and  your government about the growing importance of our bilateral relationship. I am here  today to underscore one key aspect of that  relationship: the shared values of mutual respect, tolerance, and religious freedom.  I would like to share a bit of my own personal history on these topics, as they are  central to who I am. I am the grandson of  Irish-Catholic  immigrants who arrived  in  Boston, Massachusetts in the 1880s. At the  time they arrived—and  for many decades  that  followed—Catholics  in  the  United  States faced widespread prejudice based on  their religion. When John F. Kennedy—another Catholic from my home state—ran for  President of the United States in 1960, he  even had to give a prominent speech to reassure the nation that his faith was compatible  with the duties of the office of President.  In the United States today, recalling such  history seems quaint. But it was not easy,  and it took many decades. Eventually divisions were narrowed  and mutual understanding between Catholics and Protestants  in the United States improved substantially.  Today, it is nearly unthinkable that one’s  status as a Catholic in the United States  would serve as a disadvantage to one’s ambitions for life.  The American experience in this regard underscores that respect for the human dignity  of every person—regardless of religious belief  or origin—is a key component of not only  protecting human rights, but also fostering a  society that can flourish, build upon each  other’s  strengths, and move  forward  together.  This brings me to one of the purposes of  my visit: to make clear that the United  States remains deeply committed to positive  engagement with Sudan on a wide range of  topics—including the protection of religious  freedom and the promotion of other human  rights throughout your country.  This path of closer engagement is new for  both of us.  In 2015, after decades of strained bilateral  relations, the United States began a measured engagement with your government to  urge greater progress in various peace processes and to seek positive changes for the  people  of  Sudan—regardless  of  religion,  class, or ethnic background.  In June 2016, Sudan and the United States  initiated a historic framework for the path  forward, the so-called Five Track Engagement Plan.  This plan outlined five priority areas for  constructive engagement, and required the  Sudanese government to:  (1) cease hostilities in conflict regions, including the aerial bombardment in Darfur  and the Two Areas of South Kordofan and  Blue Nile states;  (2) improve humanitarian access throughout Sudan so that aid groups could provide  vital resources and assistance needed by the  Sudanese people;  (3) refrain from interfering in South Sudan  and instead play a constructive role in regional peace efforts;  (4)  cooperate with  regional  efforts  counter the Lord’s Resistance Army, and;  (5)  build U.S.-Sudanese  cooperation  on  counter terrorism, and make both of our  countries safer. In each of those five areas,  the  Government  of  Sudan  has  made  measureable  progress. As  a  result,  last  month, the United States formally revoked  certain U.S. sanctions on Sudan to open a  new chapter in our bilateral relationship.  We hope that these positive developments  are emblematic of a positive trajectory for  the future of our bilateral relationship. But,  we also recognize that completion of the  Five Track Engagement Plan is only a first  step on a longer road toward fully normalizing our bilateral relations.  More hard work is required—from both of  our countries.  to  NEXTSTEPSINTHERELATIONSHIP  The United States is eager to see Sudan  make progress in a range of areas in the  months and years ahead, as we work towards  a new framework for bilateral engagement.  In short, the closer our countries become,  the higher our expectations for Sudan will  become.  This engagement will proceed on several  fronts.  For Sudan to become a full partner of the  United States, it must seek peace within its  borders and with its neighbors, and cooperate reliably with the international community to improve security and prosperity in  the region and adhere to long-standing international norms.  In addition, supporting human rights, including religious freedom, has been, and will  VerDate Sep 11 2014  01:15 Jan 23, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22JA8.003 E22JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 2 B H C X B B K S D n o r e c n e p S S ‘ ‘         ",2018
51,House,115,-0.368,4,2018-01-30,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise and stand in the well  of the Congress of the United States of  America to address the question of the  State of the Union.  What is the State of the Union?  Mr. Speaker, the State of the Union  is one of devolution. We are devolving  into the normalization of inequality;  inequality in a way that allows us to  pass a $1.5 trillion giveaway that will  reward the rich for being rich and punish the poor for being poor.  We are devolving into hyperpartisan  political events by the hijacking of a  Supreme Court Justice when Justice  Gorsuch was appointed to the Supreme  Court.  We are evolving and devolving into  the hijacking of justice itself because  we now find that there are those who  believe that there is a deep-state conspiracy within the Justice Department;  that somehow there is this belief that  the Justice Department should be assaulted and attacked; that it should be  demeaned; that it should be discredited.  We are devolving into, Mr. Speaker,  the normalization of disqualifying bigotry, as evidenced by some of the statements that have come from the Presidency;  statements  that would  normalize  language  such as:  there are  some ‘‘fine people’’ among those who  are bigots, racists, and persons perpetrating hate in Charlottesville, as evidenced by the notion that we can allow  people to say ugly things about other  countries and,  in a sense, develop a  race-based immigration policy.  Mr. Speaker, we are devolving into a  society that recognizes a rising stock  market as the acid test for everything  when,  in  fact,  it  is only proof that  some people are doing better while  many others are not.  There is a devolution taking place,  and I, Mr. Speaker, contend that there  is a solution to this devolution. The solution is the impeachment of an unfit  President.  ",2018
52,House,115,0.319,4,2018-01-30,Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, tonight I will have the privilege of hearing the State of the Union  Address that I have been waiting to  hear since I first came to Congress 7  years ago.  Tonight our entire country will hear  a confident message of undeniable good  news for all Americans—not based on  fantasy and hope, but on facts and undeniable success.  Tonight the President of the United  States will come to the people’s House  and speak to a nation that is far better  off today than we were just 1 year ago  in every measurable way.  Now, this success did not come by accident. Over the past year, by working  with  a  unified Congress, President  Trump was able to begin implementing  his agenda  to Make America Great  Again.  Let’s revisit what he has done when  it comes to accomplishments.  The signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act marked the  first time our Tax  Code was updated in over 31 years. It  lowered  tax  rates  for all  taxpayers  across the board, and it cut the corporate tax rate down from 35 percent to  21 percent which allows us to compete  globally.  It  permanently  repealed  ObamaCare’s  individual mandate.  It  opened up ANWR for drilling and brand  new energy exploration.  When it comes to deregulation, he  signed 15 CRA bills into law in less  than a year, imposed a groundbreaking  rule on the Federal bureaucracy to kill  two regulations for every new regulation written, and has rolled back more  job-killing red tape than every President before him combined.  When it comes to the courts, by appointing  conservatives  like  Neil  Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and a  historic  number  to  the  appellate  courts,  he  is  restoring  constitutionalism and common sense to our judiciary  system. These  appointments  will  reverberate  for  generations  to  come.  Now, when it comes to the outcomes,  the entire stock market is at an all-  time high. Contrary to what some people will speak, this affects the pensions  of all Americans. Female unemployment is at its lowest level since 2001.  Black and Hispanic unemployment are  at their lowest levels ever. For 13 different States, overall unemployment is  at its lowest rate since we first began  recording it.  New manufacturing orders are  increasing at their  fastest pace  in 14  years. Quarterly GDP is exceeding expectations and is on track for a 3 percent annual growth rate for the first  time in 13 years. Consumer confidence  is at its highest level since 2000. Job  market confidence  is at  its highest  level ever, and because of the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act alone, more than 3 million American workers—and  counting—are  receiving  $1,000 bonuses, or  more, wage increases, and/or benefit increases. Now, in my own city that I  live in, NexTier Bank gave over 250 of  its associates a $1,000 bonus. Those are  hardly crumbs when it comes to hardworking American taxpayers.  Abroad,  the  Islamic  State—once  thought  to  be  unstoppable—is  now  shattered. Military morale, recently at  rock  bottom,  is  now  soaring. Our  troops are currently  receiving  their  largest pay raise in 8 years.  When it comes to liberty and conscience issues, we ended the war on religious liberty. We tore up the so-called  HHS contraceptive mandate; no more  nuns fighting for their survival in the  Supreme Court; and we reinstated the  Mexico City policy the first weekend in  office.  When it comes to energy, we ended  the war on coal, we stopped the EPA’s  so-called Clean Power Plan, we approved both the Keystone XL and Dakota pipelines, and we have plans in  place to dramatically expand offshore  drilling.

53,House,115,0.538,11,2018-01-30,Mr. BYRNE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman for yielding, and I appreciate all of the work that she does  on behalf of our Nation’s military men  and women.  Mr. Speaker, here we are again. Once  again, this House will vote to  fully  fund our Nation’s military and critical  national security programs.  I have said this many times before,  but I will continue saying it because  the point  is so very  important: the  global threat environment facing the  United States today is greater than at  any time since the conclusion of World  War II.  North Korea is continuing to build  its nuclear weapon  program, which  poses a direct threat to the United  States and our  servicemembers  stationed abroad.  Terrorist groups, like ISIS and al-  Qaida, may be weakened in Iraq and  Syria, but their influence continues to  spread to other areas throughout the  Middle East and Africa.  The situation in Afghanistan is deeply concerning. Look no further than  the  recent wave of attacks by  the  Taliban in Kabul.  China is continuing to build up its  military and exert aggression in the  South China Sea.  Russia and Putin remain emboldened  as they take provocative actions  in  Ukraine, throughout Eastern Europe,  and even in the Pacific.  Other countries continue to catch up  to our Nation’s  capabilities  in  the  space domain.  Iran is showing more and more involvement in the Middle East and continues to support terrorist groups that  threaten our allies, like Israel.  Not to even mention the evolving and  serious threats posed to the United  States by state actors and rogue actors  when it comes to cybersecurity.  Despite so many real and wide-ranging threats, our military has not received the funding that is necessary to  keep up.  As the gentlewoman said, we have  the smallest Army since before World  War II, the smallest Navy since before  World War I, and the smallest and oldest Air Force we have ever had.  The military does not work like a  spigot. You can’t just turn it on when  a crisis happens and expect everything  to work and all of our servicemembers  to be ready. Training takes time, and  building equipment takes even more  time. We have to prepare now for the  crisis of tomorrow.  The  commandant  of  the Marine  Corps, General Robert Neller, put  it  best when he said:  VerDate Sep 11 2014  00:14 Jan 31, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K30JA7.021 H30JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 2 B H D F C B K S D n o r e t t o l         ",2018

55,House,115,0.332,39,2018-01-30,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of this fiscal year 2018 DOD Appropriations bill. Although I am proud to support this critical legislation, I will say  that I am disappointed to be here, yet  again, speaking in support of the DOD  Appropriations bill as we, again, seek  its passage in the House.  Despite Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN’s  Herculean efforts to complete all 12  bills on time and passing several packages that included the Defense bill, the  Senate refuses to act. We recently saw  the effects of this when the government shutdown put great stress on the  backs of our servicemembers and their  families.  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we push  aside partisanship and do what is right  for the country and for our national security by passing this bill. While it certainly represents the outcome of many  hard  choices,  it  prioritizes  funding  where our troops need it most. It wisely invests in readiness, training, maintenance,  and  procurement  of  new  equipment and technology to ensure  that our troops are prepared for the  tasks before them.  I am pleased that this bill takes care  of our troops and their  families at  home by granting them a long-awaited  2.4 percent pay raise. Our Nation has  been at war for nearly two decades, and  our  servicemembers have  put  their  lives on the line to ensure that we can  live our way of life. This raise represents just one small way for us to  honor their service.  Mr. Speaker, they say that the third  time  is the charm, and I hope this  holds true here. After the House passes  the bill, I urge the Senate to do so as  well so that the President can sign this  bill into law. According to the Constitution, it is the Congress’ responsibility to provide for our common defense. This bill does just that.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote ‘‘yes.’’  ",2018

57,House,115,-0.35,39,2018-01-30,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, Groundhog Day isn’t until Friday, but here we  are again, voting for the third time in  7 months on a Defense bill that will go  in the hole—nowhere. We are 9 days  out from the threat of another shutdown and 4 months into the fiscal year  of 2018, which started last October 1,  yet we still have no budget framework  from our Republican friends and their  so-called leadership, nothing to direct  appropriators on what numbers from  which to negotiate funding for the entirety of the government—not just Defense, not just this account.  Instead,  Republican  leadership  wastes important, precious time to debate a bill that has already passed this  Chamber twice before. Meanwhile, our  Republican colleagues force the entire  government to run on autopilot  for  over a third of the  fiscal year and  trumpet their claim that only they  prioritize the military.  How can anyone take this seriously?  Republicans have provided no overall  roadmap of a funding strategy for the  Federal Government. They  failed  to  agree within their own caucus on funding priorities, leaving them incapable  to even begin to negotiate with Democrats. As a result, law dictates a defense funding level of $549 billion. That  is a lot of money. Half a trillion. But  here we are debating,  for the third  time, an astounding $659 billion for defense. That is $110 billion more. Hmm.

61,Senate,115,-0.42,67,2018-01-30,Mr. BLUMENTHAL.," Mr. President,  we are here at a historic moment. The  President of  the United States will  come before us for his first State of the  Union tonight, at a time when there is  a credible case of obstruction of justice  against him and an overwhelming case  to show that the campaign that elected  him was aided and abetted by the Russians. But the immediate threat is even  more dire.  Yesterday was a new  low  for the  House  Intelligence  Committee. The  House Republicans, in an act of partisan gutter politics, voted to release a  four-page, misleading, deceptive characterization of warrants submitted to  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court. This partisan gutter politics  brings us to a dark day of character assassination much  like the McCarthy  days, when Members of this Chamber  were counted in history as to whether  they stood up and spoke out against  this kind of smear campaign.  Not only  is there character assassination at work here but also, equally  dangerous to our democracy, the potential compromising of sources and  methods vital to our national  intelligence and our national security. That  is the reason President Trump’s own  appointee at the Department of Justice, Stephen Boyd, stated that the release of this memo would be ‘‘extraordinarily reckless.’’  Those words come  from a  former  staffer  for  a Republican  Congresswoman  and  then-Senator  Jeff Sessions—hardly a Democratic partisan.  ‘‘Extraordinarily reckless.’’ Why? Because this memo, four pages long, summarizing a warrant that typically is  tens or hundreds of pages, will reveal  sources and methods vital to the continued operation of our  intelligence  community.

62,Senate,115,0.469,81,2018-01-30,Mrs. FISCHER.," Mr. President, I rise  this evening to call up and pass a resolution recognizing the commissioning  of the USS Omaha.  This weekend,  the USS Omaha  is  scheduled to be commissioned in the  United States Navy as one of our newest Independence Class Littoral Combat  Ships.  As the only triply landlocked State  in the union, you may not think of Nebraska when  you  think  about  the  world’s oceans.  And while we are proud of our heartland heritage, we are equally proud of  the ships that have carried the name  ‘‘USS Omaha’’ to the far corners of the  globe.  Just two years after Nebraska became a State, the USS Omaha, a screw  sloop, was launched in 1869, helping to  grow our young Nation’s navy.  The second USS Omaha, launched in  1923, served with distinction in World  War II, capturing a German blockade  runner a month before the war officially began.  And now this upcoming weekend, we  welcome the newest USS Omaha, LCS–  12, which carries  the distinction of  being among our Nation’s newest Littoral Combat Ships.  She will enter the navy as an agile  surface combatant, and one which I  know will prove to be a capable tool in  our Nation’s naval arsenal.  Though Nebraska may be far from  open water that has not stopped countless men and women from our State  from answering the call to serve in the  United States Navy.  Their service and sacrifice, both in  times of war and peace, have helped ensure that the United States continues  to enjoy freedom of navigation around  the world.  For that reason, I am honored to  know that now we will once again have  another USS Omaha carrying on this  proud  tradition,  and urge my  colleagues to join me in recognizing this  momentous occasion.  To the crew of the USS Omaha, I wish  you well in your mission and all the  years of distinguished service to come.  May you enjoy fair winds and following seas, and know that you have  the best wishes of the State of Nebraska behind you.  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the  floor.

63,,115,0.256,88,2018-01-30,Mr. JOYCE of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to recognize a great  leader of  the U.S.  fastener industry. He is one of the basic building blocks of virtually all manufacturing, Robert  J. Harris, Managing Director of the Industrial  Fasteners  Institute  (IFI) since 1995,  retired  from the Institute on December 31, 2017. Rob  brought financial stability and strategic leadership to IFI, the trade organization that has represented the U.S. fastener manufacturing industry since 1931. Under his guidance, the Institute became the recognized authority in the  development of all technical standards for fasteners, a critical component of ensuring capability and safety across all products.  Rob’s leadership was perhaps most visible  during the 1990s, when a pending regulatory  burden imposed by the well-intentioned but fatally flawed Fastener Quality Act (FQA) threatened to shut down the industry and place severe limits on production of automakers, aerospace manufacturers, and a host of other U.S.  and  international producers. Working with a  coalition of  IFI members, as well as,  representatives of  the auto, aerospace, heavy  equipment, appliance and other manufacturers, Rob developed and implemented a strategy  to  revamp  the decades-old FQA. Congress  approved  the  Fastener Quality Act  Amendments Act in 1998, and it has been a  great success in the twenty years since. Before joining IFI in 1995, Rob had already enjoyed a varied and successful career. A native  of Kentucky, he graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy  and  subsequently  earned a master ’s degree in International Finance from the College of William and Mary  and an MBA  from DePaul University. He  served in the U.S. Navy in Vietnam as a gunboat Captain.  Along with all of the residents of the 14th  Congressional District of Ohio, I congratulate  Rob on a well-deserved retirement.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP  ALEXIS THOMAS  HON. RUBEN GALLEGO  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 30, 2018  ",2018
64,,115,-0.461,88,2018-01-30,Mr. GALLEGO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the  life and work of Bishop Alexis  Thomas, who passed away on January 18,  2018.  Bishop Alexis Thomas was many things to  many people. He was a pastor, a leader, and  a friend. He was a father, a son and a brother.  He was a dynamic and passionate leader not  just  at Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church,  but  throughout our community in Phoenix.  Having received his  license  to preach  the  gospel at the young age of seven, it is perhaps unsurprising  that Bishop Thomas was  destined for a life in service of God and his  community. Before he was ordained as  the  Bishop of the State of Arizona in 2003, Bishop  Thomas served for eighteen years as the Senior Pastor of Pilgrim Rest, which grew by  leaps and bounds under his compassionate  leadership.  Bishop Thomas’ service extended well beyond Pilgrim West Baptist Church. Not only  did he serve on the Board of Directors of the  Greater Phoenix Black Chamber of Commerce, but he also founded the African American Christian Clergy Coalition in 2001 and co-  founded  the African American Strategic Alliance Coalition in Phoenix.  I want to take this opportunity not only to remember and celebrate Bishop Thomas’ many  accomplishments, but also  to share my sincere condolences with Bishop Thomas’ family  and friends, as well as with the broader Phoenix community mourning his loss.  I was  fortunate enough  to work alongside  Bishop Thomas on issues of social justice. We  served  together as a part of My Brother’s  Keeper, and I witnessed firsthand his boundless determination to make our community—  and our world —a better place. Bishop Thomas  will be recalled  fondly by many as a counselor, friend and mentor. He will also be remembered as a man with a sincere and remarkable vision for change. Through our work  together in support of the Congressional Black  Caucus, I feel incredibly fortunate that I was  able to witness Bishop Thomas’ inspiring leadership firsthand.  Bishop Thomas worked miracles large and  small every day. He touched more lives than  perhaps we will ever know.  Mr. Speaker, while we are devastated by his  loss, we know that Bishop Thomas’ legacy of  service and  love will  live on  forever  in our  community.  f  IN HONOR OF LEAH COSNER’S  100TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION  HON.

It is my privilege to recognize her and all  that she has overcome and accomplished in  just seven short years. On Saturday, February  3rd, 2018,  the American Heart Association’s  Southern Coast Heart Ball will  celebrate  Maggie’s life and the odds she has defied.  Albert Einstein once said  that  ‘there are  only  two ways  to  live your  life. One  is as  though nothing is a miracle. The other is as  though everything is a miracle. ’ ’ Maggie lives  every day as if it is a miracle and, in so doing,  inspires all who know her  to ask  the  larger  question of how they might make the most of  the miracle we have all been granted in life.  Before ever taking a breath, Maggie was diagnosed with Dandy-Walker Syndrome when  Renae, her mother, was just 26 weeks pregnant. Since then, Maggie has defied the odds  and shown  true grit She  lives with multiple  congenital heart defects, a malformation of the  cerebellum, and is completely dependent on a  pacemaker that was installed when she was  just an infant  What these things mean is that her ability to  see, walk,  jump, and dance are  things  the  doctors told her parents she would never be  capable of doing. Yet, she does. Maggie is indeed a miracle kid.  Even at such a young age, she is an inspiration to those around her. As said best by her  parents, she  is always smiling, even on  the  worst of days. With  that,  I would again ask  that you join me in honoring Maggie Maine on  this momentous occasion for the life she is living, her strength and calm, and for the way  she stands as an inspiration that should make  all of us smile.  f  REMEMBERING THE VOYAGE OF  THE ‘‘ORYOKU MARU’’  HON.

68,,115,0.26,95,2018-01-30,Mr. BOST.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues to pause to remember the American  POWs who arrived  in Japan 73 years ago  today. These heroes were survivors of the infamous  ‘death cruise’ ’ of  the  Oryoku Maru.  These men were prisoners since the American  territory fell to the Japanese in the spring of  1942. Of the over 1,600 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians who left Manila on  December 13, 1944, barely 400 arrived at the  port of Moji, Japan on January 30, 1945.  ‘Hell Ship’ ’  is simply  the only way  to describe the vessels and conditions the POWs  endured. These men were packed  in dark  holds of freighters, usually with coal or animal  waste. They were given little water, food, or  fresh air. Sanitation was non-existent. Men  driven insane were quickly and brutally quieted. I became familiar with this story by assisting my constituent, Ms. Jan Thompson, who is  the daughter of a survivor of the Oryoku Maru  journey and is the President of American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Memorial  Society. Her father, Robert E. Thompson, was  a Navy Pharmacist’s Mate who had been assigned to a submarine tender in Manila Bay,  the USS Canopus. He was surrendered on  Corregidor. It has been my honor to help preserve the memory of the American POWs of  Japan and of their experience aboard the Hell  Ships to Japan. The 400 –plus men who died  during the stop at Takao Harbor, Formosa are  currently buried in 20 graves marked simply  as ‘ ‘Unknowns’ ’ at Hawaii’s National Cemetery  of the Pacific. Soon there will be a memorial  plaque on the Memorial Walk at this Cemetery  to  these men who died aboard  the Enoura  Maru in Formosa on January 9, 1945, which  was one of the Hell Ships that took part in the  Oryoku Maru journey.  f  TRIBUTE TO KEVIN L.

Kevin has served as the Executive Director  at the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) since March 2002. As Executive  Director, Kevin manages approximately 230  MMSD employees and oversees a contract for  the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system with a private contractor.  As Executive Director, Kevin developed and  implemented  an Overflow Reduction Plan;  completed a watershed based regional water  quality management plan update;  initiated a  Green  Infrastructure Program  for  the Milwaukee region; helped to found a local nonprofit organization,  the Southeast Wisconsin  Watersheds Trust, and focused on water quality improvements.  Prior to joining the District, Mr. Shafer spent  10 years in private industry and six years with  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  in Fort  Worth, Texas. He is a past president of the  National Association of Clean Water Agencies.  Currently, Kevin is the Chair of the Water Environment Research Foundation and of  the  U.S. Water Alliance ’s Urban Water Sustainability Leadership Council. Mr. Shafer received  a bachelor ’s degree in science and civil engineering with a specialty  in water  resources  from the University of Illinois and a master’s in  civil engineering from the University of Texas.  In December 2017 he was named as one of  the Top 25 Global Water Leaders by Water &  Wastewater International Magazine. This designation is known as a barometer of the industry’s thought leaders. The selection was made  concentrating on active leaders who are driving companies  forward  into  the digital water  age with a focus on innovation.  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons I rise to pay  tribute and congratulate Kevin Shafer on his  award; I am proud that he resides and works  in the Fourth Congressional District.

Our entire  community  is grateful  for his dedication  to  keep our roads and highways safe. Today, I  would like to recognize his outstanding career  and years of service.  Day in and day out, we use our vehicles to  go to various places such as work, school, or  visit our loved ones, and we are able to mobilize safely because of the tireless efforts of individuals like Officer Quintero.  He is an esteemed member of our community and a resident of the City of Indio. He is  a devoted husband and father of six children.  He served as an inspiration for his daughter  Jacquelene to follow in his footsteps and become a CHP Officer. His colleagues look up to  him as an intelligent, hardworking man.  Officer Quintero began his career in traffic  law enforcement in South Los Angeles, where  he served for six years. During his early years,  he demonstrated a passion to protect our citizens and keep our streets safe, which earned  him  the Governor’s Employee Safety Award  for his efforts in vehicle theft. Officer Quintero  carries that passion in every task he undertakes, making him an exemplary leader.  Throughout his career, he has held numerous positions including Field Training Officer,  Emergency Medical Technician, Shift Supervisor, Drug Recognition Expert, Child Safety  Seat Technician, El Protector Hispanic Outreach Office, and Critical Incident Peer Supporter. Officer Quintero was also a member of  a Special Response Team, where he served  as protection  for  last year’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland.  His commitment to keeping our citizens on  the road safe  is exemplified by his  fast response  in saving  the  lives of  two residents  who had been shot while driving in the freeway. With  the strength  they had  left,  they  managed to park their vehicle in front of the  Indio CHP Office. Officer Quintero and his  daughter rapidly administered medical aid to  the male driver and  the  female passenger,  keeping them conscious until the paramedics  took them to the hospital. In the process, they  collected crucial  information about  the suspected shooter. After an  investigation was  conducted, the suspect was arrested. Officer  Quintera’s outstanding performance and courageous actions are truly commendable.  Officer Quintero has dedicated his life working  to ensure our community  is safe. Every  day, he was willing to sacrifice his life in service of others. His valuable contributions and  arduous work will be felt for years to come.  On behalf of the entire 36th Congressional  District,  I am honored  to  recognize Officer  John Quintero ’s achievements and years of  service. His arduous work and contributions to  our community will be felt for years to come.  I commend his public service and extend my  best wishes on his retirement.

71,,115,0.334,1,2018-02-07,Mr. LANCE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to thank and recognize the heroism of a constituent of New Jersey’s  Seventh Congressional District.  This past December, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey  came under attack by a terrorist set on  the destruction of American lives. One  of the officers responsible for thwarting the terrorist’s plot was Port Authority Officer Sean Gallagher. Many  lives were saved that day as a direct result of the quick and decisive actions  of  Officer Gallagher  of Hunterdon  County, New Jersey.  Those who know Sean Gallagher personally were not surprised when they  learned that he had played a decisive  role in foiling the attack and apprehending the Port Authority bomber. In  the aftermath of the attack, many of  Officer Gallagher’s  friends  and  acquaintances were asked what character  traits Officer Gallagher possessed, and  a common theme emerged: a strong  work ethic and a patriotic desire to  protect his community and Nation.  Mr. Gallagher will receive the Port  Authority PBA’s Cop of the Year award  this Friday. I cannot think of an officer more deserving than Officer Sean  Gallagher, and I congratulate him for  his heroism.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  325TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLLEGE OF  WILLIAM & MARY  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",2018
72,,115,-0.154,1,2018-02-07,Mrs. MURPHY of Florida.," Madam  Speaker, as a member of the class of  2000, I rise to celebrate the 325th anniversary of the College of William &  Mary.  William & Mary may be the second  oldest college in America, but it is first  in the hearts of its students and alumni. The college educated many of our  Nation’s Founding Fathers and continues to take pride in producing graduates who enter public service, including four current Members of Congress.  Like it has for so many others, William & Mary changed my life. As the  daughter of refugees from Vietnam who  became residents of Virginia, I was the  first woman in my family to attend  college. I arrived on campus feeling a  little alone and more  than a  little  nervous. Yet,  from  the moment  I  walked  through Wren Portico as a  freshman to the moment I rang the  Wren bell after my last class as a senior, William & Mary always made me  feel that I was part of a close-knit community, a tribe, if you will, bound together by pride and tradition.  I learned so much during my 4 years  on campus, creating  friendships and  making memories that have lasted a  lifetime. So, to William & Mary the institution and to those whose efforts  have made it such a special place, I  say, ‘‘Thank you, and happy birthday.’’  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

74,House,115,0.669,8,2018-02-07,Mr. NORMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to speak in favor of H.R. 1153, the  Mortgage Choice Act of 2017.  This bipartisan legislation is essential to help  low- and middle-income  families gain access to qualified mortgages.  I  commend  Chairman HENSARLINGand Congressman HUIZENGAfor  their work on  shepherding  this bill  through the legislative process.  Policymaking is complex, and Congress and Federal regulators do not always get it right. We need to sometimes make changes to address new  issues  and  unintended  consequences  that arise.  As we have seen  for the past  few  years, the Dodd-Frank Act—and let me  add that there are many of us in the  real estate business and on bank boards  who saw the effects of Dodd-Frank not  allowing banks to go into the communities that need them the most—contains certain provisions that fit one or  both of these categories and must be  changed through legislative action.  One of these policies is the CFPB’s  qualified mortgage, or QM, rule. The  QM rule is intended to protect lenders  from legal liability and provide compliance certainty for mortgage loans that  are low risk and meet certain criteria.  One of those criterion requires a mortgage loan’s total points and fees not to  be in excess of 3 percent of the loan’s  value.  Unfortunately, the points and  fees  rule often depends on who is making  the loan and how title insurance is obtained, which is confusing for both consumers and businesses providing these  services. Also, as has been mentioned,  insurance premiums held in escrow are  considered points and fees under the  QM rule, which is ridiculous. That is  like saying that a parent who puts  money in for a 529 savings plan for his  children’s education is a car payment  or a mortgage payment.  It doesn’t  make sense, but  it discourages consumers from using this important financial management tool.  H.R. 1153 would address these unintended consequences and provide clarity for borrowers and businesses. I am  also confident that the CFPB, under  the leadership of Mick Mulvaney, will  ensure that this clarification is effectively implemented if this bill is enacted into law.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this commonsense fix so that  we can get the policy right and address  the unintended consequences arising  from the future rule.  ",2018
75,House,115,-0.491,8,2018-02-07,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman  for yielding, and I  congratulate her on her extraordinary  leadership as the ranking Democrat on  the Financial Services Committee. She  has been a champion  for America’s  working  families,  protecting  consumers, protecting the taxpayer, and  doing so in a very balanced way, sensitive to the needs of all parties concerned. I am so proud of her leadership  and her service.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the bad bill for hardworking Americans  that is on the floor today. The cynically named Mortgage Choice Act provides anything but choice. Instead, it  raises costs on consumers who have few  alternatives. This is yet another attempt to stack the deck even further  against working families.  Mr. Speaker, this debate is another  waste of time. Every day, courageous,  patriotic DREAMers lose their status,  and, every day, the American dream  slips further out of reach. As Members  of Congress, we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect DREAMers, who are the pride of our Nation  and are American in every way but on  paper.  I use this occasion as opposing this  bill to speak further about social justice in America.

76,House,115,0.307,64,2018-02-07,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, earlier today, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced $17.5  million in emergency funding to stop  the spread of the spotted lanternfly in  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The spotted lanternfly is beautiful,  with its distinctive and colorful wings,  but it is an invasive and threatening  pest and its spread must be stopped.  The spotted lanternfly is originally  native to parts of China, India, Vietnam, and Eastern Asia. It was first discovered  in Berks County, Pennsylvania, but now has spread to 13 counties. It is a threat to apples and grapes  and peaches, stone fruits, and various  tree species throughout Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania’s  Agriculture  Secretary Russell Reading has been working to combat its spread, and this Federal  funding will only  increase  the  Commonwealth’s ability to fight this  pest.  As vice chair of  the House Agriculture Committee, I have been working with Congressman RYANCOSTELLO  and Congressman LLOYDSMUCKERand  all members of the Pennsylvania delegation to ensure that we have the resources  necessary  to  eradicate  the  spotted lanternfly.  I applaud Secretary Perdue’s swift  prevention  efforts  before  the  planthopper  starts  to  reemerge  this  spring.  f  b1930  SPACEX  (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

101,Senate,115,0.486,85,2018-02-07,Mr. YOUNG.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to speak in support of—and to  share a sample of—the positive results  my State of Indiana is already experiencing as a result of tax reform. Hoosiers like Chelsee Hatfield, who accompanied me at the State of the Union address last week, are already seeing the  benefits of this historic tax overhaul.  Chelsee is a young mother of three. She  is a teller at a rural branch of First  Farmers Bank & Trust Company  in  Tipton,  IN. Chelsee recently  learned  that she is going to receive a raise and  a bonus as a result of tax reform. This  additional income will help Chelsee go  back to school and earn her associate’s  degree. It is also going to enable her to  put money away for her children’s college education.  First Farmers Bank & Trust is also  investing $250,000 per year—per year—  in  community  development  in  the  small rural communities where they  serve businesses and individuals. Moreover, First Farmers is going to invest  $150,000 per year in employee development.  This  is  just  one  company  throughout the State of Indiana, and  we are seeing all sorts of stories like  this already emerging.  Chelsee and the employees of First  Farmers Bank & Trust represent so  many regular Hoosiers who work  in  small towns and in our large cities, and  they are going to see real benefits, substantial benefits,  for themselves and  their families. As a result, the entire  State and country, of course, will benefit as well.  Indiana, like so many States, is already seeing a steady stream of tax reform success stories  like these—and  has ever since we passed the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act. I will just go through a  number of these positive stories that  are emerging.  Anthem, an Indiana-based health insurance company, announced on Monday that more than 58,000 employees  and recent retirees will receive $1,000  contributions  to  their  retirements.  Now, in my family and in so many families around this country, $1,000 is a lot  of money. That is just in the here and  now. Moving forward, we can expect increased economic growth, a greater demand for workers, and for more wages  to increase. Just in the near term, we  know that Anthem has said it will give  retirees and employees $1,000 contributions to their retirements.  Family Express Convenience Stores,  out  of Valparaiso,  announced  it  is  boosting its starting wage for employees at their 70 locations throughout Indiana. Gus Olympidis is its CEO, and he  said: ‘‘We feel obligated to pass on a  significant portion of the tax savings  to our staff.’’ Of course, we have heard  this from a number of employers and  their leadership. They are passing on  tax savings to their employees because  they want to retain these employees.  This, of course, is a good way to do it.  Southwest Airlines announced that it  will be investing in a new fleet of airplanes, and the engines will be built by  Hoosiers in Lafayette.  FedEx is investing $1.5 billion in its  Indianapolis hub and is providing bonuses to its workers.  First Midwest Bank raised its minimum pay for hourly employees to $15  an hour at its 18 Northwest Indiana  branches.  These  are  real  results—real  compensation and  real benefits—already  being  experienced  by  rank-and-file  Hoosiers—the people who help keep  this economy humming.  I listened very carefully to Hoosier  voices when we were debating the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am glad to see  their voices were heard, in the end, by  a majority of my colleagues. Workers  at companies of all sizes are already  beginning to see the benefits of a tax  code that is simpler, that is fairer, and  that allows Hoosiers to keep more of  their hard-earned money.  I thank the Presiding Officer.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2018

103,Senate,115,0.585,92,2018-02-07,Mr. RUBIO.," Mr. President, I want to  add to Senator NELSON’s comments.  First, let me just say, in a time when  there is a lot of noise and news about  the divisions in American politics, despite differences of opinion on issues,  this  is what I believe the people of  Florida want us to do; that is, to come  here and work together on the issues  we can work together on. I must say,  the ability to work with Senator NELon this has been  invaluable, to  have two different Senators from two  different parties singing from the same  song sheet about the priorities that are  critical to our State.  What is unique about this storm and  disaster relief  is, the  impact wasn’t  just on Florida, it was also the impact  on Puerto Rico.  When  the House passed  its  relief  package at the end of December, it had  a lot of good things in it. The President  came out with his proposal, and it had  some good things, but it needed work.  The House  took  it, and  the House  added a few things to it.  Over the last 2 months, we have had  the ability to work in the Senate, not  in front of the cameras and not, obviously, through a series of press conferences, but in the way legislation is  put together. The way we worked together and our offices worked together,  we were able to come out with a concise, unified position on the needs of  both Florida and Puerto Rico, working  with the leadership of the Democratic  Party on his side and the Republican  Party on ours.  I have to tell you, in a place where it  is very hard to get 60 percent of what  SON you want—and that is a win—when you  start to go through some of the items  that are going to be in this relief package, it would be hard to complain.  With perhaps a small exception here  or there, virtually all of the things  that are critical for disaster relief for  Florida—and to a large extent as well  for Puerto Rico—are going to be included. I think, while a lot of us are  very  concerned  about  how  long  it  took—we should have done this 4 weeks  ago or 3 weeks ago—there are other  reasons why it was held up. It wasn’t  disaster relief that was holding it up, it  was the other issues at play that were  holding it up. In fact, this was being  held until the other things were agreed  upon.  Now we are able to move forward. I  have to state that while no one wants  to have a hurricane and no one wants  to have a natural disaster, this is a response we should be happy about. I  think it is a testament to the sorts of  things we can achieve in the Senate  when we can put aside our differences  on other issues and work together on  this.  By the way, I want to state, because  I don’t want anyone to read into what  I said about big differences, that although we may vote differently on a  lot of  issues, Senator NELSON and I  have cooperated on a host of things,  from judges to anything that impacts  Florida. I hope we can get to doing  that more as a Senate, not just for us  in Florida. Maybe Senator NELSONand  I are just always in a good mood because it doesn’t snow in Florida, and it  is warm when everybody else is cold,  but I think the people of Florida should  be pleased with our ability to work together.  Some highlights, and Senator NELSON touched on a lot of them. I will  start on the Puerto Rico part because  it is the one we still see the impact of  on a regular basis.  Let me just, as an aside, say that  the  Resident  Commissioner, who  is basically  the  Member of Congress representing Puerto Rico in the House, is an extraordinary advocate for Puerto Rico—not a  good one, not a great one, an extraordinary one. She is tireless, nonstop. I  am  talking about Sunday evenings,  Sunday nights, early Monday morning,  she is constantly working. She is an incredible partner in this endeavor, and  the  things  she  has  been  able  to  achieve—because even when we had  agreement on many items in the Senate, we had to go to JENNIFFER for her  help to make sure the leadership in the  House would be on board. The respect  that House leadership has for her was  instrumental.  In the end, the way this is now lined  up, no matter what we agreed to here,  if we send it over there, and they don’t  want it, we couldn’t do it. Her ability  to get the House to go along with these  changes is invaluable, and I just need  to say that publicly. So much of this is  due directly to her. She is the voice of  GONZA´LEZ,  JENNIFFER VerDate Sep 11 2014  03:31 Feb 08, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G07FE6.028 S07FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H D F C B K S D n o r e t t o l         ",2018

105,Senate,115,0.844,99,2018-02-07,Mr. CRUZ.," Mr. President, a few observations about the colloquy that has  occurred.  No. 1, we had two friends of ours from  the Democratic side of the aisle who  spoke energetically in support of this  nomination, but  I  found  it striking  that our Democratic friends had nothing to say to the union members who  are faced with the risk of losing their  jobs. Senate Democrats often portray  themselves  as  friends  of  organized  labor, friends of union members. Yet it  was striking that when they came to  the floor, they had no answer to union  members  in Philadelphia being  told  they are at risk of being unemployed  because of a broken regulatory system.  Instead, it is a conservative Republican  Texan who is fighting for the jobs of  those union members.  I would also note that my efforts in  this are not alone. Indeed, in December, I brought 12 Senators—12 Members  of this body—to the White House to  meet with the President, working to  find a solution to this problem. Those  Senators  included  Senator  Senator CASSIDY, Senator KENNEDY,  Senator ENZI, Senator BARRASSO, Senator LEE, Senator TOOMEY, Senator  INHOFE, and Senator LANKFORD. Those  are Senators from a wide geographic  array, all facing significant job losses,  potentially, and all  interested  in a  positive solution to this problem.  In the remarks we just heard on the  Senate floor, none of the Senators proposed any relief to the potentially hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers being driven out of work by a broken regulatory system—no relief whatsoever. Indeed, none of the Senators  disputed the fact that the RFS worked  and worked just fine when RINs were  selling for a penny.  This debate is not about the RFS—  should we continue it or not. When I  was a candidate for President, I campaigned on ending it. I didn’t win. I  CORNYN,  lost that election. This is not a fight  about ending the RFS. The current administration  is  committed  to  continuing the RFS. That is the prerogative of this administration. This is instead a  search  for a  solution  that  would save tens of thousands, if not  hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The senior Senator from Iowa said:  Gosh, it is not a free-market solution  to cap the price of RINs. Well, if RINs  were an actual commodity that existed  in the real world, I would agree with  that. I wouldn’t support capping the  price of corn or the price of gasoline or  the price of widgets or anything else  that people were making. But RINs are  an artificial, made-up government fix.  They don’t exist. No one manufactures  a RIN. It is a government ID number.  And it worked initially when they were  trading at 1 and 2 cents apiece. But  when it skyrocketed, going all the way  up to $1.40 each—it is now threatening  thousands upon thousands of blue-collar jobs.  The Senator  from  Iowa  suggested  that RINs are not the cause of the  bankruptcy of the Philadelphia Energy  Solutions refinery. Well, I would note  that  the explicit  text of  the bankruptcy filing is to the contrary. Indeed,  this is a quote from their bankruptcy  filing: ‘‘The effect of the RFS Program  on the Debtor’s business is the primary  driver behind the Debtor’s decision to  seek  relief  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code.’’ It does not say ‘‘is a factor’’ or  ‘‘is a problem’’ but  ‘‘is the primary  driver.’’ That is what they wrote in  their bankruptcy papers.  None of the Senators who spoke disputed that for that refinery, the price  of RINs went from $10 million in 2012 to  $300 million in 2017. That is unreasonable. That is broken.  The junior Senator from Iowa talked  about the need to pull back job-killing  regulations. Well, there is a job-killing  regulation that we need to pull back.  This is a very important thing for  those following this debate to understand: That $300 million—do you know  how much of it goes to Iowa farmers?  Zero. They are not getting that money.  Instead, it is going to speculators and  large—many  foreign—integrated  oil  companies. It is an odd thing to see  lobbyists for ethanol companies fighting for the profits of giant overseas oil  companies. That  doesn’t make  any  sense.  Unfortunately, the position of the  ethanol lobbyists has been: We are unwilling to speak. We are unwilling to  talk. We are unwilling to meet with  anyone on the refinery side. We are unwilling to defend our position. We will  not attend the meeting.  We have repeatedly extended that invitation to them, and they have said  no. That is blatantly unreasonable. Do  you know whom the ethanol lobbyists  are serving the  least? Corn  farmers.  Repeatedly in the course of this negotiation, I have sought to put on the  table policy options that would be a  win for corn farmers, that would result  in more corn being sold, more Iowa  corn being sold, more ethanol being  sold. The ethanol lobbyists are so unreasonable, they don’t want to win and  they don’t want to provide any relief  for thousands of blue-collar workers  being thrown out of work. That is not  a reasonable solution.  I hope Mr. Northey will be confirmed.  Indeed, I hope he is confirmed soon. He  could be confirmed as soon as next  week. In November, I laid out a very  clear path to Mr. Northey being confirmed. In December, I laid out a very  clear path to Mr. Northey being confirmed.  The  people  blocking  Mr.  Northey’s confirmation are the ethanol  lobbyists who have said: We are unwilling to have a win/win solution. The answer is, let thousands of people lose  their jobs even though doing so doesn’t  benefit Iowa corn farmers at all. That  doesn’t make any sense.  Here is a ray of sunshine, a ray of  hope. I believe the administration is  going to do the right thing. I believe  the President wants to see a win/win  solution—a solution that is good for  Iowa corn farmers. I want to see Iowa  corn farmers sell more corn, a solution  that results in Mr. Northey being confirmed, and a  solution  that doesn’t  bankrupt refineries and cost a bunch of  blue-collar union members their jobs.  That is a win for everybody. I believe  that is where the President and the administration want to go, and I think  that is where we will end up. I am  hopeful we will arrive on that solution,  which is consistent with the responsibilities of all of us.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",2018
106,Senate,115,0.109,106,2018-02-07,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I wish  to join my colleagues in expressing my  serious concern with the 5-year oil and  gas leasing plan released by the Interior Department that proposes opening  up vast portions of U.S. waters for possible oil exploration and development,  including along the Atlantic seaboard  and the coast of Maine.  I am opposed to any effort to open  waters off the coast of Maine or any  proximate area  to offshore drilling,  which  could  negatively  affect  the  health of Maine’s fisheries and other  coastal resources, threatening to harm  not  only  the  environment  but  the  State’s economy as well. The Maine  lobster industry, for example, has an  estimated $1.7 billion  impact to the  State’s economy annually, not to mention  the many other  fishing, aquaculture, and coastal tourism industries  that help to drive the State’s economy.  These critical industries are dependent  on Maine’s pristine waters, and even a  minor spill could damage irreparably  the ecosystem in the gulf of Maine and  create serious economic disruption.  I look forward to working with the  administration to ensure that the Interior Department’s plan  is revised to  pose no unnecessary  threats  to  the  economy and way of  life  in coastal  Maine.  f  DARPA’S 60TH ANNIVERSARY  ",2018
107,Senate,115,-0.383,106,2018-02-07,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, today I pay  tribute to DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, on  the 60th anniversary of its inception.  After the Soviet Union launched Sputnik  I, President Eisenhower  determined that the United States would  never again be caught off guard by  technological surprise. DARPA was established  to anticipate new  technological capabilities and pursue strategic  technological  surprise  for our  military forces.  DARPA works collaboratively with  academic  institutions, corporate and  government R&D labs, and small business  enterprise. While  the  primary  focus is to discover fundamental new  concepts  that  lead  to breakthrough  technologies  for  national  security,  many of DARPA’s advances also benefit greater society. Some well-known  examples  include  precision-guided  weapons  systems with miniaturized  GPS components also found on many  consumer products; the internet, used  initially  to  link DARPA with performer partners, now widely used in  commerce and  every aspect of our  lives; advanced antenna systems enabling more efficient warfighter communications and satellite signal reception  for consumers; new breakthroughs in  robotic technology for national security applications and the development  of advanced prosthetic arms for wounded warriors and civilians alike. The list  goes on.  By not accepting the parameters of  what is widely accepted as the known  possible,  DARPA  has  proven  that  amazing achievements can be had by  stretching to reach for what was once  deemed impossible. In the realm of national defense, DARPA has pursued  new systems, including unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles, hypersonic  flight research, and new frontiers in  biomedical research. From the giant  engines of the Saturn V rocket that  took Americans to the Moon to the  smallest microelectronics that populate our smartphones, DARPA has been  ahead of the cutting edge of technological innovation.  By focusing its efforts at the boundaries of fundamental research in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics,  materials science, electronics, and engineering, DARPA has helped create  new communities of scientists and engineers, both  inside and beyond the  traditional defense community. Along  the way, new businesses and sometimes  entire  industries have  sprung  from  DARPA-funded research, reflecting the  Agency’s commitment  to pursue  its  ideas all the way from initial concept  to demonstration of practical  feasibility through prototype development.  DARPA programs are led by program  managers who come from universities,  industry,  national  laboratories,  and  other parts of government for limited  postings  that  typically  last  3  to  5  years—a time  limit that helps drive  the Agency’s signature sense of urgency. Recognizing that some revolutionary  goals  inevitably  prove  unachievable, DARPA carefully manages risk by establishing appropriate  milestone procedures and redirecting  or discontinuing programs when  further advancement stalls.  I congratulate DARPA for its many  achievements over the past 60 years.  The true assets that enable this kind of  achievement are the men and women  who work to make the visions of tomorrow become today’s reality.  As DARPA moves into the future, I  encourage my colleagues to join with  me in recognizing this milestone and  VerDate Sep 11 2014  06:34 Feb 08, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G07FE6.053 S07FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H D F C B K S D n o r e t t o l         ",2018

109,,115,-0.281,204,2018-02-07,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, it is  with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance  that  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to a distinguished athlete, educator, spiritual leader, and  dear  friend of  longstanding, Reverend Earl  Williams, Jr. A memorial service will be held in  his honor on Thursday, February 7, 2018 at  11:00 a.m. at Disciples of Jesus Ministries located at 228 Augusta Avenue in Thomasville,  Georgia.  Earl was born  in Thomasville, Georgia  in  1931, to the late Billy and Flossie Adams-Williams. A product of Thomas County School  System, he graduated  from Douglass High  School in 1953 and went on to obtain a Bachelor’s Degree in Social Science from Fort Valley State University (then College) and a Master’s Degree  in Administration  from Valdosta  State University.  In 1953, he played baseball  in  the Negro  National League with Jacksonville Eagles before signing a professional contract with  the  Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955, and playing in both  the Mid-Western and Pennsylvania Leagues.  After retiring from baseball, he became the assistant baseball coach at Fort Valley State  University and a scout for the Baltimore Orioles.  In addition to being an admired athlete, Earl  was also an influential educator. In 1971, he  served as a teacher and later as the assistant  principal at Magnolia-Chappelle Middle School  (then Magnolia Junior High School), before  being promoted  to  the  role of principal  in  1972. After the closing of the campus in 1990,  he  transitioned  to Central Middle School,  where he served as the principal, until his retirement in 2000.  A trailblazer offirsts, Earl was the first African-American President of G.A.E.  (Georgia  Association of Educators) of Thomas County,  the first African-American City Commissioner  of Thomasville  in 1982 (re-elected  in 1984),  the first African-American Mayor of Thomasville in 1986 (re-elected in 1988) and the first  African-American Chairman of  the Salvation  Army. In addition to those milestones, when  he served our nation honorably in the United  States Marine  Corps  (USMC)  at  Camp  Lejeune, he continued  to play baseball and  became the first African-American to play on a  USMC Base traveling team. He was also the  Grand  Inspector General of  the S.P. Jones  Masonic Lodge No. 118 and a longtime member of  the Albany Alumni Chapter of Kappa  Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.  Furthermore, he received numerous awards  including G.A.E. Administrator of  the Year;  Salvation Army Man of the Year; an Honorary  Doctor of Law Degree  from Faith College;  NAACP;  inductions  into  the  Thomasville-  Thomas County Sports Hall of Fame, the Fort  Valley State University Alumni Hall of Fame; a  Distinguished Service Award  from Thomasville/Thomas County Chamber of Commerce  and Outstanding Service Award which I had  the pleasure of presenting to him.  Earl accomplished much throughout his life,  but none of  this would have been possible  without the love and support of his late wife,  Faye, his five children, his nine grandchildren,  and the countless others who impacted his life  over the years.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues  to  join  me, my wife Vivian,  and  the more  than  730,000  residents of  the Second Congressional District of Georgia in extending our gratitude for the life and legacy of Reverend Earl  Williams, Jr. and our sincere condolences to  his family and friends during this difficult time.  I pray  that we may all be comforted by an  abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days,  weeks and months ahead. He leaves behind a  great legacy in service to his beloved family  and  to all  those whose  lives he  touched  through his kindness and generosity.  f  RECOGNIZING ARLETTE GOMEZ  AND GISELLE TOVAR  HON.

110,,115,0.636,204,2018-02-07,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize Arlette Gomez and  Giselle Tovar, two students at Johnson High  School in my home of Gainesville. Recently,  these two young women put on an event for  local foster children in order to encourage foster children and families.  As members of  the Family, Career, and  Community Leaders of America Club in their  school, they wanted to take on a project that  would allow  them  to help  children  in  the  Gainesville area. After researching the county’s foster care system, these two students decided to work on a project that would prioritize  foster children.  On January 20, Arlette and Giselle hosted  ‘A Luau  to Foster Joy’ ’ at Johnson High  School, an event designed to cultivate friendships among the children in attendance . Additionally, the event helped raise awareness of  the county’s foster care system.  In Hall County, there are currently 270 children in foster care with only 60 families willing  to welcome them into their homes. By hosting  this event, Arlette and Giselle hope to inspire  more families to open their doors to children in  need.  Northeast Georgia is proud to have students  like Arlette and Giselle, who aspire to make a  difference in our corner of the world. I wish  these two young women the best as they continue  their studies and work  to highlight  the  local foster care system.  f  STRENGTHENING  PROTECTIONS  FOR  SOCIAL  SECURITY  BENEFICIARIES ACT OF 2018  SPEECHOF  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 5, 2018  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I strongly commend Ranking Member LARand Chairman JOHNSON on  their biparSON tisan bill  to dramatically  improve  the Social  Security Representative Payee program. We  have a responsibility to ensure that this system is strong and fair to protect our vulnerable  citizens.  In addition  to  the multiple  improvements in oversight and quality, I want to thank  Representatives LARSONand JOHNSON for including provisions to improve the Rep Payee  program  for  foster youth  for which  I advocated.  Currently, when foster youth receive Social  Security benefits because they are disabled or  their parent is deceased, disabled, or retired,  it is common practice for State child welfare  agencies  to  take  the children’s benefits  for  state  revenue  rather  than preserving  these  funds for the youth’ s current or future needs.  We have very poor understanding of who  serves as  representative payees  for  foster  youth and whether they conserve the funds for  these youth. This bill  requires  long-overdue  data coordination between the Social Security  Administration and state foster care programs.  Requiring  this data coordination  is critical  to  ensuring that we know who is serving in the  important fiduciary role for foster youth. Right  now, we have no clear understanding of the  number of  foster youth with  representative  payees, whether those payees are state agencies or  family members, and whether  the  funds are conserved for foster youth or used  to plug holes in state budgets.  Just last month, the Social Security Advisory  Board  recommended  improving  the  Representative Payee Program related  to  foster  youth. The Board pointed out that state foster  care agencies routinely are assigned automatically as the payee without any analysis if there  is a better choice available. The Board highlighted that there can be an inherent conflict of  interest in designating a state entity as payee  given  that  the  interests of  foster care programs may conflict with  the  interests of  the  foster youth. The data required by this bill will  help Social Security better focus on payee determination for foster youth to ensure that the  payee will act in the best interest of the child.  Further, it will provide data to help us understand how often state agencies are serving in  this capacity and how  they are using  these  funds. To advance this understanding, the bill  requires a GAO study on minor beneficiaries  in foster care and their representative payees.  In addition,  this bill protects  foster youth  from overpayment errors made by the state.  Under current law, if an overpayment occurs  and the state foster care agency is the beneficiary, the foster youth is responsible for repaying the overpayment. This bill includes a  protection so that if a state agency is the representative payee and an overpayment  is  made, the state and not the foster youth is responsible  for  the overpayment  the state received.  These improvements are critical to improving the representative payee program for vulnerable foster youth. I am grateful to Ranking  Member LARSONand Chairman JOHNSON for  working  to  strengthen  the Representative  Payee program to protect vulnerable citizens  and for including these significant protections  and transparency provisions to support foster  youth.

111,,115,0.494,8,2018-02-16,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to recognize  the 150th anniversary of  the founding of the Benevolent and Protective  Order of Elks.  As Chairman of  the House Committee on  Veterans’ Affairs, it is both a pleasure and an  honor for me to commemorate such an enormous milestone for an organization that does  so much for America’s veterans.  Founded by a small group of friends in New  York City on February 16, 1868, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks is an American fraternal society committed to the virtues  of charity, justice, brotherly love and fidelity.  Over the past 150 years, the Order has grown  to include nearly 1,000,000 Elks Members and  2,000 lodges across the country.  The Elks have a long and storied history of  supporting America ’s veterans. This is evident  through the century-old Elks pledge: ‘ ‘So long  as  there are veterans,  the Benevolent and  Protective Order of Elks will never  forget  them.’ ’  In fact, during World War I, at the behest of  General Pershing—who was an Elk, himself—  the Order donated over $2,000,000 to assist  U.S. soldiers going abroad; and organized,  constructed and equipped the first two American field hospitals in France.  Following World War I, the Elks empowered  nearly 50,000 disabled veterans by providing  rehabilitation, vocation and education loans. It  was this act of generosity that prompted the  federal government to offer the first ever G.I.  Bill for education benefits.  Every day, Elks across the country visit VA  medical facilities to provide support and friendship to the men and women who have borne  the battle for our freedoms. Last year alone,  the Elks provided over 1,000,000 hours of  service  to  veterans  and  donated  nearly  $41,000,000 worth of goods, supplies and  cash in support of America’s veterans.  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, it is an  absolute honor  for me  to commemorate  the  150th anniversary of this incredible and selfless organization, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. I would like to extend my  most sincere gratitude for their work over the  past 150 years and I wish them the absolute  best for 150 years to come.  f  TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN AND GAIL  BROCKMAN  HON.

113,,115,0.763,8,2018-02-16,Mr. GAETZ.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  to  recognize Heather Phillips, the Teacher of the  Year for Okaloosa County School District. For  many  years, Ms. Phillips  has  served  the  Okaloosa County School District with exceptional enthusiasm and an unwavering commitment to excellence.  Ms. Phillips  is a  fourth-grade  teacher at  Bluewater Elementary School in Niceville, FL.  Even though she has taught for 15 years, she  feels like she is just getting started.  Ms. Phillips  finds  the greatest  inspiration  from her faith in God and the support of her  family. She loves seeing the world through the  eyes of children and allowing their energy to  influence her focus on what truly matters.  Her  teaching experiences  in  Japan and  Hong Kong help her appreciate diversity. She  is also an active member of her church  in  Niceville and enjoys being part of the community where she teaches.  Ms. Phillips believes being an educator  is  never predictable, and she thrives on the everchanging nature of her profession.  Ms. Phillips’ many skills and wonderful character truly make her an invaluable and greatly  appreciated  resource. For all  these  reasons  and more, she has been selected as the 2018  Okaloosa County School District Teacher of  the Year.  She is honored to represent Bluewater Elementary and humbled to be considered among  such an  immensely  talented group of educators.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress,  I am privileged  to  recognize Ms.  Heather Phillips for her accomplishments and  her continued commitment  to  the Okaloosa  County School District.

I was  proud to work with you on this resolution honoring our Olympians. While I  have not yet  given my  first  floor  speech—which I plan to do in a couple  of weeks—I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to come down and talk about  our State’s amazing athletes.  As  I am  sure Senator KLOBUCHAR  knows, as you have just heard from  her, once a Minnesotan can walk, you  can bet that his or her parents will try  to get them on skis, skates, a sled, or  maybe even on the curling rink. That  early start—not to mention the fact  that Minnesotans  are  the  hardest  working and most resilient people I  know—helps explain why 23 of our athletes took part in this year’s Winter  Games. As Senator KLOBUCHAR said,  that is the third most of any State in  the country. And, boy, did they steal  the show. Minnesotans brought home  gold medals in women’s hockey, women’s cross-country skiing, men’s curling, and a bronze medal in women’s  downhill skiing.  I want to talk about Afton, Minnesota’s own Jessie Diggins, who carried the Olympic torch for Team USA  at the closing ceremony. As Senator  KLOBUCHARsaid, Jessie began skiing at  4 years old and started racing against  high schoolers at age 11. She earned  her spot on the Olympic cross-country  team and was the only woman to compete in all six women’s cross-country  events—and compete she did.  Along with her teammate, Kikkan  Randall, Jessie won the first Olympic  Gold Medal ever for the United States  in cross-country skiing—and  in dramatic fashion. Jessie came from behind  during the final stretch of the race,  inching out her competitor as they  crossed the finish line.  I am amazed, but not all that surprised, by the accomplishments of my  fellow Minnesotans.

116,Senate,115,0.543,26,2018-03-01,Mr. DAINES.," Mr. President,  this  week I have the honor of recognizing  the Ravalli County Sheriff’s Department and Sheriff Stephen Holton for  their work to prevent an attack on the  students and teachers of Darby School  District.  Just last week, on the heels of 17  tragic murders  in Parkland, FL, a  Darby High School  senior allegedly  made threatening comments and social  media posts directed at fellow students  and  faculty at Darby High School.  After receiving information about the  concerning  threats,  Sheriff  Holton  took action, and law enforcement arrested the student on felony charges.  While we will continue to investigate  the tragedy in Florida and the performance of law enforcement in that incident, it is important that we commend  students who speak up, school officials  who respond, and those law enforcement officers who bravely act to keep  our communities safe. The Darby students and school officials did the right  thing.  Sheriff Holton and  the quick  response of students and school officials  may have prevented a tragedy in Montana, and for that, we are very grateful.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  RECOGNIZING SOUTH GEORGIA  ∑",2018
117,Senate,115,0.403,26,2018-03-01,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. President, as the  senior Senator from Georgia, it is my  honor to pay tribute to South Georgia  on its selection as a ‘‘2018 Great American Defense Community’’ by the Association of Defense Communities.  Since 1941, this region of my State  has been the proud home of Moody Air  Force Base and some of the best airmen in the world.  I congratulate the outstanding South  Georgia  Military  Affairs  Council,  which is led by local chambers of commerce  in Berrien, Cook, Lanier, and  Lowndes Counties, and the many community members who work to support  Moody Air Force Base. They take great  pride in this installation, and they understand how important the brave men  and women who are based there are to  our national security and to America.  The Great American Defense Communities Program honoring these special  volunteers recognizes the overall support that communities and regions in  the U.S. provide to service members  and military families to help ensure  the highest quality of life possible. Selection for this honor is based on community building and integration, support and collaboration, educational and  employment opportunities, and veteran  and family support.  I have seen firsthand how strongly  the  airmen  and  families  associated  with Moody Air Force Base are supported and appreciated by the South  Georgia community. It is much more  than simply a place to live. For our  military members serving at Moody,  their community  is a place to call  home. It is family.  Moody Air Force Base is the home to  the 23rd Wing ‘‘Flying Tigers,’’ which  consists of the 23rd Fighter Group, the  Air Force’s largest A–10 fighter group,  the 347th Rescue Group, and the Avon  Park Air Force Range, among others.  From  close  air  support  to  combat  search and rescue, the dedicated airmen of Moody Air Force Base play a  critical role  in our national defense  and our ability to project power around  the globe.  Throughout Georgia, we are  fortunate to be home to welcoming communities for the servicemembers who are  stationed at military bases across our  State. South Georgia is a wonderful example of this spirit of service and patriotism. I congratulate this region and  Moody Air Force Base on this distinct  honor.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT  A message from the President of the  United States was communicated to  the Senate by Ms. Cuccia, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate a message from the President of the United  States submitting a nomination which  was referred to the Committee on the  Judiciary.

120,,115,-0.402,40,2018-03-01,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate  the 30th Anniversary of  the  Sumgait pogroms, one of the most horrific attacks against the Armenian people committed  at the hands of Azerbaijanis.  On February 27, 1988, up to 200 Armenian  civilians living in the city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan were  indiscriminately  killed,  raped,  maimed, and even burned alive for no reason  other than their ethnicity. This senseless violence was instigated by hostile, anti-Armenian  rhetoric from Azerbaijani citizens and officials  against these innocent individuals.  For  three decades, Azerbaijan has  taken  steps  to cover up  these crimes against humanity and dismiss the atrocities at Sumgait.  Even more disturbing  is  that perpetrators of  these events and similar violent attacks have  since been lauded as national heroes.  I condemn these horrific attacks. Tragically,  the Azerbaijani government’s approach toward  the Armenian people has not changed much  since these attacks were perpetrated. In 2018,  we hear the same violent rhetoric and witness  the intimidation tactics by the Azerbaijani government  against  the  people  of  Nagorno  Karabakh.  If we do not condemn crimes against humanity, we only strengthen  the  resolve of  those seeking  to perpetrate  these crimes  in  the future. The Armenian people have known  this for too long, as we prepare to commemorate  the 103rd Anniversary of  the Armenian  Genocide in April.  I will continue to work with my colleagues  on the Congressional Armenian Issues Caucus to remember the victims of the pogroms at  Sumgait and to condemn all acts of violence  against people who are  targeted simply because of their existence. I hope my colleagues  will join me in rejecting violent rhetoric and intimidation by  renewing our  commitment  to  achieving a collective and lasting peace.  commanding various infantry units on the East  German-Czech Border during  the Cold War.

Mazzuchelli of Orange Park, Florida, a  naval flight surgeon who passed away  on February 24 as the result of a tragic  accident that occurred while he was on  duty.  Lieutenant Mazzuchelli  graduated  from Clay High School in 2003, where  he served  in the Naval JROTC program. Upon graduation, he received a  full scholarship to Drexel University in  Pennsylvania, where he studied commerce and engineering.  After graduation from Drexel, he decided to follow in his parents’ footsteps  and join the Navy. He did so while attending medical school at Lake Erie  College of Osteopathic Medicine, and  received his naval officer’s commission  while finishing his studies.  Lieutenant Mazzuchelli served as a  flight surgeon with the Marine Light  Attack Helicopter Squadron 267 stationed out of Camp Pendleton, California, and was deployed to Japan as  part of the Marines’ Unit Deployment  Program in 2016.  Over his 7 years of service, Lieutenant Mazzuchelli  provided  exemplary  medical care to the brave men and  women who protect America. In fact, 2  weeks before his death, he completed  his aircrew syllabus and received his  aerial observer/aircrew wings, making  him one of the very few naval doctors  to have them.  He  is survived by his parents and  stepparents, as well as two sisters. I  know his family, his community, and  his squadron will miss him dearly.  Hailed by his fellow soldiers for his  enthusiasm and dedication, Lieutenant  Mazzuchelli’s  example  of  leadership  through service will continue to inspire  others.  We as a nation thank James and his  family for his dedication and service to  our great Nation. He will be missed,  but not forgotten.  f  LET’S NOT INCREASE TAXES AS A  WAY OF PROTECTING JOBS AND  CAPITAL IN THIS COUNTRY  ",2018
126,House,115,0.697,3,2018-03-07,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  encourage folks at home, folks in this  body, folks wherever they may be scattered across this country to speak out  against what the administration has  proposed with regard to raising tariffs  on steel and aluminum. At the end of  the day, I believe it would be disastrous not  just  for  the economy at  large, but, frankly, for every one of us  in the way that it would impact our  pocketbook or our wallet.  In short, what I guess I am saying is  that you don’t have to do stupid to find  that stupid is indeed stupid.  What I am getting at here is that we  have had real-world experiments about  once every 100 years in this country on  these kinds of policies.  It was in 1828 that you had the so-  called tariffs of abomination, and  it  was designed to supposedly protect jobs  and protect industry. It proved to do  neither. It actually proved to be disastrous for the South and, in particular,  South Carolina, where I am from.  About 100 years later, you had the  Smoot-Hawley tariffs that were equally disastrous  in not producing what  they were supposedly designed to do.  They didn’t protect jobs, didn’t protect  industry, and, in fact, world trade declined by about two-thirds during that  time period.  So as a country, what  I am suggesting  is  that we need  to  take a  breath, we need to look before we leap.  In life, I would say there is a value to  listening to the advice and counsel of  others. In this case, Gary Cohn, the  President’s chief economic person, who  is actually leaving based on this dispute, has said this is not a good idea.  Steelworkers unions have said this is  not a good idea for the way it will impact Canadian  steel and, by virtue,  American steel. The markets, which  are sort of the collective opinion of  what we all think is going to come  next economically, dropped 600 points  on Thursday and Friday, saying this is  not a good idea. In fact, the Prime Minister of Sweden was here yesterday,  and he was saying it was not a good  idea.  A lot of folks have spoken out and  said: This is a genuinely bad idea. Let’s  not move forward.  I would say further that, in negotiations, rescue teams shouldn’t be the  ones shooting the hostage.  In this case, we have our Cs mixed  up. The administration  talks about  doing something about China, but, in  fact, the group—the country—most impacted would be the Canadians. The Canadians  have  to  be  some  of  our  staunchest allies over a long period of  time, with us in war, with us in trade,  with us culturally; yet the bulk of all  steel that is imported to the United  States comes from Canada and 50 percent of what we export in steel goes to  Canada.  Let me put it this way: what I am  saying is that what we need to do here  is to trust our allies. If you walk into  a bar and somebody says, ‘‘If you take  one step closer, I am going to hit you  in the face,’’ we need to trust them  that they are telling the truth.

Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, Donald  John Trump decided to end the DACA  program, a program which gave hundreds  of  thousands  of  hardworking  young people hope for the future. He  gave Congress until March 5—that was  2 days ago—to pass a bill. Since then,  House Democrats have tried 23 times to  pass bipartisan legislation to fix this  problem. Donald  John Trump  even  tweeted: ‘‘Total inaction on DACA by  Dems. Where are you?’’  Well, Mr. President, where we are is  right here, waiting for this deal that  you say can be made. Yet, on 23 occasions, it was our friends on the other  side of the aisle who refused to make a  deal and rejected even considering the  bipartisan  Dream  Act  that  was  deadlined by you, Donald John Trump,  on March 5.  We need to address this vital issue  now. Approximately 120 Dreamers lose  their status each day. Over 22,000 have  lost their status since the administration ended the program.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  implore my  colleagues: Let’s do something now to lift  the cloud that hangs over these young  people who are American in every way  except on paper.  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer for  the 24th time an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will help solve the problem created by Donald John Trump’s decision  to end the DACA program.

130,House,115,-0.146,17,2018-03-07,Mr. PETERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of the BRICK Act,  particularly section 3, which includes  language from my bill to bring much-  needed regulatory relief to wood heater  manufacturers that are in my district  and also across the Nation.  Section 3 delays the second phase of  Federal emission regulations for wood  heaters by 3 years. It is important to  note that, since 2007, manufacturers  have  voluntarily  invested  in  technology to reduce the emissions to comply with the first phase of the regulations.  I had one situation in the north part  of my district where they spent I don’t  know how many hundreds of thousands  of dollars coming up with this 90 percent  reduction; and  6 months after  they accomplished  it, they came  in  with these new regulations to do another 90 percent, which can’t be done,  and it is going to put them out of business.  So these businessowners in my district and around the country have approached me and said, as I said, that  they will go out of business if this second phase is not delayed. Some of them  have already begun laying people off in  towns  like Greenbush, Minnesota,  in  my area. And in these small communities, these layoffs are devastating.  These  companies  already  produce  some of the cleanest wood heaters in  the Nation, and they are telling me  that the EPA has just gone too far. So  I wrote this  language to help these  businesses, these workers, these communities that depend on the production of these important appliances, and  I urge my colleagues to support the  BRICK Act.

132,House,115,0.428,17,2018-03-07,Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  the majority of U.S. brick and ceramic  plants are small,  family-owned operations, often located in rural communities that depend on the plant  for  their very livelihood, for the good-paying jobs. They have built some of the  most recognizable buildings, cities, and  towns in existence across America, including many within my district  in  eastern and southeastern Ohio.  Unfortunately, these industries have  borne the brunt of an unpredictable  regulatory process that is nearly two  decades  in the making. In 2003, the  EPA required brickmakers to install  expensive new equipment to comply  with the Agency’s Maximum Achievable  Control  Technology,  or  their  MACT rule.  In 2007, after companies spent millions to implement these controls, the  U.S. Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit vacated the rule. Our brickmakers  now find themselves in a very similar  situation today. In 2015, the EPA again  finalized a rule requiring the industry  to once again invest in similar control  equipment technologies.  Additionally,  this  new  regulation  uses the emission reductions achieved  under the vacated regulation as a baseline for further emission reductions. In  other words, the EPA, under the former  administration, chose not to recognize  the great strides this industry achieved  under the previously vacated rule. The  Agency neglected to take this past regulatory and compliance history  into  consideration.  Mr. Speaker,  that  is  simply not  right. The bill before us today, H.R.  1917, the BRICK Act, ensures history  does not repeat itself. This legislation  simply allows for the consideration and  completion of any judicial review regarding the 2015 regulation before requiring compliance.  Now, some of my colleagues across  the aisle say they are worried that this  legislation sets a dangerous precedent.  Many of these same colleagues are also  quick to recognize the very unique regulatory situation this  industry  finds  itself in. They even go so far as to say  they are sympathetic to the unique situation.  b1415  However, they are unwilling to support this bill that simply extends the  compliance  deadlines, which would  give the brick and tile industries a bit  of  regulatory  certainty  while  the  courts complete their work.  Mr. Speaker, that logic baffles me.  We need a bit of pragmatism when we  approach this situation. Because if you  really want to talk about a dangerous  precedent, consider this: this new regulation also caps the economic productivity of the clay ceramics industry.  While the  former administration admitted that this regulation will not reduce emissions emitted by the industry,  it decided to set new emission  standards through regulations anyway.  Regulating an industry for no immediate reason or environmental benefit?  Now that  is a dangerous precedent.  Brick manufacturers  have  suffered  heavy losses since the recession, shedding 45 percent of jobs between 2005 and  2012, and these  increased compliance  costs from EPA regulations are driving  more  job  losses  and  consolidations  within this primarily family-owned industry.  Brick plant owners already struggle  to obtain  financing  for plant modernization projects, and brick companies estimate that this rule will cost as  much as $100 million a year to comply.  Many are worried that the financing  needed to comply with this most recent  reiteration of  this  rule will not be  available, considering that the required  control equipment will not  improve  plant productivity, nor help the bottom line.  I urge all of my colleagues to support  this commonsense  legislation  today,  and I look forward to working with my  Senate colleagues to quickly address  this issue. I know some recent bipartisan progress has been made in the  Senate between Senator WICKER and  Senator DONNELLY, and I am very encouraged by that progress.  I am hopeful that this vote today will  help push the Senate to act and act  sooner  than  later. The  compliance  deadlines are quickly approaching, and  we need a solution now to this important issue. Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, we  are in danger of having to build buildings  in America out of  sticks and  straw, or, worse yet, out of bricks imported from foreign countries.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  ",2018

American  businesses  are  finding  themselves facing millions of dollars in  compliance costs due to burdensome  EPA regulations. It is estimated that  the EPA’s rules may cost the brick and  ceramics  industry millions annually,  with the cost of compliance for the average facility at over $4 million.  Industry won’t be able to meet the  requirement deadlines imposed by the  rule, which is currently being reviewed  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:08 Mar 08, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07MR7.033 H07MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 2 B H D F C B K S D n o r e t t o l         ",2018

135,House,115,-0.399,31,2018-03-07,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  for yielding, and  I  want to  just underscore a point he  made in his opening remarks.  This is fundamentally about a principle that we hold pretty dear in this  country, and, that is, our freedom. Our  freedom is rooted in the assumption  that our democratic systems actually  work, that the process of democracy  has integrity, and that the choices that  people make are not the subject of interference by some foreign power.  We know that Russia interfered in  our elections. There are only two people I can think of who have denied that  repeatedly. One of them is President  Trump;  the  other  one  is Vladimir  Putin. Everyone else, including our Republican  colleagues  and  our  intelligence community, acknowledges that  Mr. PERLMUTTER the Russians interfered with our elections.  Five people have acknowledged that  they committed crimes as a result of  the  investigations  taking  place;  12  other—15  others  indicted. Why  on  Earth would we not allow the investigation that is taking place right now  to determine the extent of that interference in order to prevent it from ever  happening again? Why would we not insist that we protect that principle of  democracy and that foundational principle of freedom by letting this process  complete? What are  they afraid of?  That is the question: What are they  afraid of?  That  is why I am glad Mr. PERLMUTTER initiated this effort, and I will  continue to stand with him as he does  it.  ",2018
136,Senate,115,0.43,45,2018-03-07,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. President, I want to  join my colleague from West Virginia,  as well as our friend from South Dakota, to say how much I appreciate the  effort that Senator CRAPOhas made to  put this bill together. It is exactly how  the Congress is supposed to work and  how the Senate is supposed to work—a  bipartisan bill. Frankly, I am sure it is  a bill that everyone who will vote for it  would have changed at least one thing  in it, but if we were to change all of  those things that all of us would have  changed, suddenly we wouldn’t have a  bill that could pass, a bill that would  do what this bill does, a bill that will  roll back the Dodd-Frank regulations,  which are one more attempt by the  Federal Government to make one size  fit all. If you have ever tried on any  one-size-fits-all things, you know that  one size almost never fits anybody, and  that has been the case that we have  seen now.  Credit unions and community banks  provide critical financial services for  families  and  for  small  businesses  across Missouri and across the country.  When the Dodd-Frank bill became law,  small  and medium-sized  banks  and  credit unions were faced with huge regulatory burdens. Big banks got bigger,  and small banks got bought and went  out of business way too often. There  was negative impact on their ability to  maintain service on Main Street in a  small community. You couldn’t put together a group that would just be the  compliance group, and if you did, that  had to come out of their ability to do  the kind of business that you wanted to  do and always had been doing.  According to the Independent Community Bankers of America, despite  holding less than 20 percent of the Nation’s  banking  assets,  community  banks  fund more than 60 percent of  small business loans and more than 80  percent of U.S. agricultural loans—all  in that 20 percent of the banking assets  of the country. Furthermore, they operate in many areas where other banks  don’t, where they are the only physical  banking presence, frankly. One out of  every five U.S. counties has only one  bank, and that one bank is a community bank, a small bank. The more  time, the more money, the more staff  that community lenders have to dedicate to complying with needless regulations, the less ability they have to  provide the kind of service they would  like to provide.  In talking about the bill that I am  pleased to be a cosponsor of, the president of the Missouri Bankers Association, Max Cook, said: ‘‘This common-  sense legislation will allow banks to  better serve the needs of customers and  businesses in our communities.’’  He went on to say  ‘‘that financial  regulatory reform will unleash America’s economic potential.’’ That is the  end of his quote, but I think you could  add to it that lots of good things are  happening in our economy right now—  the tax bill, the regulatory, commonsense regulations that are overcoming  regulations  that didn’t make much  sense. Access to capital is a critically  important part of what you have to  have to have a growing economy—access to capital in small communities,  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:59 Mar 08, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G07MR6.018 S07MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H C X B B K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2018

The bank has been  recognized for the support of its employees and exceptional customer service,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  local  involvement  through  volunteerism and support of charities.  Founded in 1867, Biddeford Savings  Bank has promoted  teamwork, personal growth, and good performance  amongst its employees for 150 years. In  addition to supporting their employees,  Biddeford Savings Bank values its customers as if they are owners. Biddeford  Savings Bank assists first-time homebuyers and works with  small businesses to ensure growth and success for  local owners. The bank also improves  its business practices by developing  new banking services for customers.  Biddeford Savings Bank is not only  committed to its customers, but also  to  its  neighbors  including  schools,  businesses,  and  organizations  that  share their desire to improve the community around them. Over the years,  the bank has hosted holiday food and  gift drives, as well as musical events to  raise money for organizations such as  the Community Bicycle Center in Biddeford, ME, and United Way. In January of 2017, the bank sponsored the Atlantic Plunge, a fundraiser hosted by  Caring Unlimited,  in which participants jumped into the ocean to raise  awareness for and support the end of  domestic  violence  in York County.

Commander Weech has made a career of defending our nation’s freedom on the high seas for  the past 34 years. Commander Weech was  born and attended school in Key West, Florida, the southernmost point of Florida ’s 26th  District and the United States. CDR Weech ’s  military service has taken him far and wide.  He has crossed  the Equator  four  times and  was initiated into the Solemn Mysteries of the  Ancient Order of Shellbacks on 9 October  1990. His commitment and dedication to serving  our  nation  have  earned Commander  Weech  the Meritorious Service Medal, Joint  Service Commendation Medal, Navy Commendation Medal (5 Gold Stars) and the Navy  Achievement Medal  (1 Gold  Star). CDR  Weech’s final assignment was as the Assistant Chief of Staff for Training and Exercises  on the staff of Commander, U.S. Fleet Cyber  Command/U.S. TENTH Fleet.  Now, after 34 years of service Commander  Weech has decided to retire from the Navy.  His leadership will certainly be missed, but we  look forward to Commander Weech becoming  an active part of the community as a civilian.  His wife Jennifer and two daughters Jenna  and Britain have a lot to be proud of. I am  honored to recognize individuals such as CDR  Weech who have given so much in service to  our nation.  f  RECOGNIZING SERGEANT FIRST  CLASS SAMMY L. DAVIS  HON.

The Sachem  Award, our state ’s highest honor, is given annually  to a Hoosier with a  lifetime of excellence and moral virtue that has brought credit  and honor to the state of Indiana.  Sergeant First Class Davis has certainly met  the criteria  for  this prestigious award. As a  cannoneer with the 4th Artillery Regiment of  the 9th  Infantry Division, Sammy was stationed in South Vietnam in 1967. One day, his  unit fell under heavy machine gun and mortar  fire  from  the Vietcong. Without hesitation,  Sammy manned a howitzer to provide cover  for his unit. The howitzer caught  fire and  Sammy was blown into a foxhole after being  struck by an enemy  rifle  round. Sergeant  Davis courageously returned to the burning artillery piece to continue returning fire on the  enemy. Although he sustained serious injuries  from an enemy mortar round, Sammy picked  up an air mattress and crossed a nearby river  to rescue his wounded comrades.  For his actions, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Sammy the Congressional Medal  of Honor for extraordinary heroism at the risk  of his life in 1968. Additionally, Sergeant First  Class Davis was awarded the Silver Star, Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal,  Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam  Gallantry Cross  and Republic  of Vietnam  Campaign Medal for his actions.  I would like to congratulate Sammy and his  wife, Dixie, on receiving this important award.  Hoosiers are proud of the accomplishments of  Sergeant First Class Sammy L. Davis and  thank him for his service to our nation.  f  HONORING MS. MONICA MALPASS  HON. ROBERT A. BRADY  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 7, 2018  ",2018

A leading figure in her industry and  inductee  to  the Broadcast Pioneers  Hall of Fame, Monica has been a vital contributor  to  the Philadelphia broadcasting world.  Since 1988, the people of my district have enjoyed watching her co-anchor the Action News  at 5 p.m. Throughout her time in Philadelphia,  Monica has been an active citizen in her community, raising her three kids in Center City.  With a BA  from UNC Chapel Hill  in  journalism and an MA  in Political Science  from  Villanova, Monica brings a wealth of knowledge to her interviews and roundtables. Just  as impressive, Monica was a Rotary Scholar  to the University of Puerto Rico, a graduate  from  the Brookings  Institute ’s  ‘Inside Washington’ ’ program and a member of the World  Affairs Council. This unique combination of  education and experience has made Monica a  distinguished and esteemed broadcaster.  Monica’s credibility has allowed her to interview some of  the most  important  leaders  in  our nation’s modem history. That list includes  President Barack Obama, President Gerald  Ford, Vice President  Joseph Biden, Vice  President George H. W. Bush, Secretary Clinton, and most astoundingly every U.S. senator, congressman, governor, state senator  and  representative  from Pennsylvania, New  Jersey, and Delaware for the past 30 years.  Beyond interviews, Monica has been involved  in conferences, panels and award shows and  has emceed the PA Conference for Women  numerous times.  Her leadership and skill will continue to be  a crucial asset not only  to  the Philadelphia  community, but to the entire media industry.  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Monica ’s years of service to the city of  Philadelphia.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL  MARFAN AWARENESS MONTH  HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 7, 2018  ",2018
143,,115,0.223,164,2018-03-07,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize February as National Marfan  Awareness Month with  the  hope  that  increased awareness of Marfan syndrome and  related heritable connective  tissue disorders  will save lives.  Marfan syndrome  is a rare genetic condition. About 1 in 5,000 Americans carries a mutation in a gene called fibrillin–l which results  in an overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor beta, or TGFB. The increased TGFB impacts connective tissue and,  since connective  tissue  is  found  throughout  the  body, Marfan  syndrome  features  can  manifest almost anywhere. Patients often have  disproportionately long limbs, a protruding or  indented chest bone, curved spine, and loose  joints. However,  it  is not  the outward signs  that concern Marfan syndrome patients, but  the effects the condition has on the body’s internal systems. Most notably, the aorta, which  is the large artery that carries blood away from  the heart, is weakened and prone to enlargement and potentially fatal rupture.  An early and accurate diagnosis,  regular  monitoring, and medical interventions are necessary to prevent cardiac events. This is why  I believe it is important to develop a program  to support, assist, and encourage states to incorporate Marfan syndrome testing into their  sports screening criteria for at-risk young athletes. Few states  include Marfan syndrome  testing in their sports screening for high school  athletes which leads to Marfan syndrome-related thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection,  claiming the lives of young athletes across the  country each year.  I am proud to know the nation’s foremost organization working to support the Marfan community, the Marfan Foundation, through their  strong advocacy work on Capitol Hill. The  Foundation was  founded  in 1981 and has  worked tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals affected by Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders by advancing  research,  raising awareness, and providing  support.  I urge my colleagues to stand with me and  reflect on the work that needs to be done to  ensure that patients with rare conditions can  expect  to see sustained and meaningful  improvements in their health and care over the  next 30 years. I urge my colleagues to stand  with me  and  recognize  National Marfan  Awareness Month.

144,House,115,-0.48,6,2018-03-14,Mr. JEFFRIES.," Mr. Speaker, exactly  1 month ago, 14 innocent students and  3 innocent teachers were massacred at  a high school in Parkland, Florida.  We are in the midst of a gun violence  epidemic in this country; mass shooting after mass  shooting after mass  shooting; massacre in the workplace in  San Bernardino, California; massacre  at a nightclub  in Orlando, Florida;  massacre at a concert in Las Vegas,  Nevada; massacre in churches down in  Charleston, South Carolina  and  in  Texas; massacre  in schools,  in Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida.  We are in the midst of a gun violence  epidemic in this country, yet the do-  nothing Republican Congress is missing in action.  The overwhelming majority of the  American  people  support  universal  background checks. The overwhelming  majority of the American people support limiting access to weapons of war.  The  overwhelming majority  of  the  American people support raising the  age of purchase from 18 to 21. Yet the  do-nothing  Republican  Congress  is  missing in action.  Our students should be able to go to  school and focus on reading, writing,  and arithmetic; but, instead, they are  often in school with their hands in the  air, participating  in active shooting  drills. Yet the do-nothing Republican  Congress is missing in action.  All throughout the country today,  tens of thousands of students in blue  States and  red States;  students  in  urban America,  rural America, and  suburban America;  students  in  the  North, the South, the East, and the  West, are walking out of class for 17  minutes to demand that Congress pass  commonsense gun violence prevention  legislation.  I salute your courage. I salute your  conviction. I salute your determination  to make a difference.  The students of this great country  have stepped up. Now it is time for  Congress to do the same. It is time for  Congress  to  choose. We  can  either  stand with the students, or you can  stand with the NRA. History will judge  us all.  The  students of  this  country are  being cut down in the classroom in cold  blood, yet the do-nothing Republican  Congress is missing in action.  We don’t work for the NRA. We don’t  work for the gun manufacturers. We  don’t work for the merchants of death.  We work for the American people, and  it is time for us to finally address the  gun violence epidemic in America.  Enough  is  enough. The American  people deserve a better deal.  ",2018
145,House,115,-0.337,6,2018-03-14,Mrs. DEMINGS.," Mr.  Speaker,  1  month ago today, a man brutally murdered  17  children and  educators  in  Parkland, Florida. He killed these innocent people using a semiautomatic,  assault-style weapon. These weapons,  designed for the battlefield, are easily  available across this country.  It has been 19 years since the Columbine school shooting. That massacre  shocked America. Our country debated  that  shooting  and  the  causes  for  months, for years. But in what has become an all-too-familiar pattern, Congress did nothing to address the factor  that makes these massacres so deadly,  the easy access to guns.  You see, after Columbine, the gun  lobby knew that they were in trouble,  so they put a whole lot of time and a  whole lot of money into confusing the  issue. They said:  ‘‘It’s not guns. It’s  bullying. It’s not guns. It’s the lack of  school security. It’s not guns. It’s our  violent  culture, music,  and  video  games.’’  Well, other  countries have all of  these things, but other countries do  not have mass shootings like ours because other countries have responsible  gun safety laws.  Today, 1 month after the Parkland  shooting, we  are,  once  again,  discussing  guns. Today,  as  after Columbine, the gun lobby knows that they  are in trouble because this time these  children who  survived  the Parkland  shooting are not trying to return to  the way life was before the shooting.  They are taking a stand. And, yes, we  do stand with them.  See, these children believe that they  can change the world. They should, and  they are. I mean, after all, isn’t that  what we taught them: that when they  see something wrong, they do something about it?  So the gun lobby is going back to  their same old tactics: It is not guns; it  is the fact that the teachers don’t have  guns.  b1045  How surprising that the gun lobby solution to school shootings is to buy  more guns. But as a former law enforcement officer who has been trained  in active shooter situations, I can tell  you that arming teachers  is a dangerous and disturbing idea. We should  prevent mass shootings and not complicate them.  I can tell you that having multiple  armed individuals present in an active  shooter situation only complicates the  response. Arming teachers would lead  to taxpayer-sponsored shootouts, endangering  outscaled  and  outgunned  teachers, putting our children at risk.  We already ask our overworked and  underpaid teachers to do too much. A  national survey of teachers found that,  if offered the choice to carry a firearm,  most would  refuse. Many have  said  they would quit.  The solution to gun violence is not  shootouts between teachers and school  shooters. Instead, we can finally take  serious but real measures addressing  gun safety.  We should stop this absurd idea before  it  becomes  reality.  Congress  should move swiftly to prevent the administration from shifting tax dollars  meant for antiterrorism programs to  buying guns for teachers. I had hoped  to incorporate this commonsense idea  in a bill scheduled to come before the  Homeland  Security  Committee  last  week, but I was blocked for doing so,  and that is why, last night, I introduced a new bill to put the idea into  law. Money  for  fighting  terrorism  should stay where it is, and our teachers should be allowed to teach.  We saw that in my own congressional  district in Orlando, Florida, the result  of lack of action where 49 people were  killed and 58 still suffer life-changing  injuries when they were gunned down  in a nightclub. See, everybody, living  in a country that we say is the greatest  country in the world should have the  right to go to church, to go to school,  to go to a mall, to go to a movie theater without being gunned down.  Mr. Speaker, we should take action  after this shooting and do our jobs to  protect our children and serve our communities.  f  TAKING A HARD LOOK AT GUN  VIOLENCE  ",2018

148,House,115,-0.265,13,2018-03-14,Mr. CORREA.," Mr. Speaker, I stand  on  this  floor  to  speak  about  our  Dreamers.  Again, I must ask very simply: What  happened?  For months, Washington refused to  pass a budget. We had many continuing  resolutions. Again, one of the issues  was Dreamers.  After spending caps were raised for  both military and nonmilitary expenditures, we got a budget and both Democrats and Republicans voted for that  budget. Yet, still, no action  for the  Dreamers.  Eighty percent of the public wants a  fix. We recognize that Dreamers are  soldiers, teachers, police officers. They  are our friends. They are our neighbors. The President has said he wants  also a fix to the Dreamer issue, yet  here we are again, one more time, and,  again, the Dreamers face a very uncertain future.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to stop using  Dreamers as pawns in a bigger political  chess game. At the State of the Union  Address here on this floor, my guest  was a Dreamer, a young lady studying  chemistry at one of my local universities. She wants to be a scientist, and  I know she is going to be a very good  scientist. That is what chemistry majors do.  You know, America is the land of immigrants, and we have many, many  hardworking immigrants. That is what  Dreamers are. They work hard. They  study hard. They pay taxes. They follow the law. They have been fully vetted. Yet, today, again, we ask: What  happened to the Dreamers?  I  ask my  colleagues,  let’s  give  Dreamers the opportunity to earn the  American Dream. Let’s give them the  opportunity to earn citizenship. And  let’s not live with regrets. Let’s not  look back 20, 30 years from now and  say what we could have, should have,  would have. Now is the time to act.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  vote against the previous question so  that we can immediately bring up the  Dream Act to the floor and give relief  to almost a million young people who  want nothing but to earn the American  Dream.

150,House,115,0.455,34,2018-03-14,Mr. TIPTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership on this issue, as well, and for considering  this  bipartisan  legislation  today.  Mr. Speaker, the ever-growing burden and complexity of financial regulations is creating an environment of difficult choices  for community banks  and credit unions. Often, they must  choose to incur the costs of complying  with a regulation or cease to offer the  financial product the regulation modifies. Whatever choice these community  institutions make, it is the local consumer and  the  local  economy  that  loses.  Burdensome regulations drive up the  costs of financial products and limit  choices for consumers, which decreases  a  community’s  access  to  financial  products and services that help their  families to be able to buy their first  home, to help small businesses grow.  In districts like mine in Colorado,  that amounts to real economic impact,  especially in towns where the community bank or credit union on the corner  is the only true access to credit that  the community has.  b 1615  When smaller institutions are unable  to absorb the costs of additional compliance, it is the small towns across  America  that are disproportionately  affected.  As one banker  from Colorado  recently wrote me: We have seen time  and again the impact of this regulatory  environment consume many hours and  resources of our compliance, credit,  and audit teams despite the relatively  simple business model that we follow.  Mr. Speaker, that is why the bipartisan TAILOR Act’s consideration on  the floor today is so important. The  TAILOR Act directs the Federal financial regulators to take  into account  the risk profile and business model of  institutions as they develop new regulations, making them more targeted,  more deliberate. The TAILOR Act also  instructs regulators to weigh the impact that new regulatory burdens will  have on smaller institutions, meaning  real relief from compliance burdens for  banks and credit unions.  To put the impact of regulations into  perspective, the Dodd-Frank Act alone  created 400 new rules and came with  30,000 pages of explanation. In my travels across Colorado, I have heard far  too often that community institutions  have been forced to stop making home  loans or loans to small businesses because they can’t afford to hire more  employees to manage the added compliance paperwork.  The TAILOR Act would make sure  that the compliance burdens are considered when new regulations are made  so that community financial institutions won’t have to choose between the  needs of their communities and complying with regulations out of Washington, D.C. Community banks and  credit  unions  need  to  be  able  to  prioritize  their  customers  and  the  needs of their communities instead of  prioritizing  compliance with heavy-  handed regulations.  One community banker  from Colorado brought this into focus when he  wrote me saying: Providing a real-time  view of risk and continual review of  such a risk applicable to each financial  institution allows regulators to direct  their attention  to developing  issues  that could have the most damaging effect. With the number of financial institutions declining to historically low  levels, the redeployment of focus based  on complexity makes sense.  Mr. Speaker, in Colorado, mortgages  haven’t been made,  loans to expand  small businesses have been denied, retirees and recently employed workers  have been turned away, and relationships between community bankers and  their neighbors have been discarded.  The one-size-fits-all approach to regulating the financial services industry  has  resulted  in decreased access  to  much-needed credit.  America is now in a position to be  able to address this. The trickle-down  effect of regulation intended to respond  to the culpable actions of the big banks  after the 2008 financial crisis is harming Main Street and the ability of everyday Americans to be able to realize  their financial goals. Directing the regulators  to  refocus  their  regulations  will help Americans  start achieving  their goals once again.  Once more, the regulators themselves  have acknowledged the need for tailored regulations. Both Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve  Chairman Powell have acknowledged  the significant need  for a return to  common sense in the financial regulatory  landscape. Mr. Speaker,  the  TAILOR Act, which passed out of the  Financial  Services  Committee with  broad  bipartisan  support,  does  just  that.  Mr. Speaker, I would again like to  thank Chairman HENSARLING for considering this measure here today.  ",2018

Again, just reminding, as the gentlewoman said, these are centers that provide true resources to women at a time  when they are very, very vulnerable. I  can’t imagine why a city council or a  State legislature, or any jurisdiction,  or any legislature would want to—what  amounts to—close these centers down,  because these are people who believe  abortion is wrong.  b1845  They are not going to refer people for  abortions. That  is  the bottom  line.  They will close their doors before they  will send someone to something that  they think  is morally reprehensible,  and the last thing the State should do  is compel them to ever do that. Why we  would want to close these centers down  that are so vital to our communities is  a puzzle to me.  Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as  he may consume  to  the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for  his comments.  ",2018
154,House,115,0.367,48,2018-03-14,Mr. NEWHOUSE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Maryland  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support  of  the First Amendment  free  speech rights of pro-life pregnancy centers across the Nation. I want to thank  my  colleagues,  Congressman  HARRISas well as Congressman DOUG  for  leading  this  Special  Order this evening.  Mr. Speaker, our Declaration of Independence proclaims that life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness are God-  given rights of all people. If we truly  believe that, then we must be consistent that the right to life is inherent  for every person, born or unborn.  National Institute of Family and Life  Advocates v. Becerra is a case before  the Supreme Court that centers on the  right of free speech of pro-life licensed  medical  centers. Under  California’s  LAMALFA,  ANDY  State law, these centers are forced to  violate their conscientious objections  and post written advertisements  for  free or low-cost abortions subsidized by  the State.  I would ask: What could be more  deeply offensive  to any person who  shares the strongly held belief that  abortion takes innocent lives?  I believe that this unjust law violates  First Amendment  protections under  our Constitution, and the ramifications  of  this Court decision will be  felt  across the Nation.  There are nearly a dozen crisis pregnancy centers in central Washington  State, and most are in the Fourth Congressional District, which I represent.  Life Choices Pregnancy Medical Center  in Yakima, which I recently visited, is  a pregnancy medical center that provides pregnancy testing, medical consultation, STD testing, and adoption  referrals for expectant mothers.  Crisis pregnancy centers exist to support mothers, fathers, and their children. Many provide free material resources for young families and ongoing  parental support. These centers exist  to further the progress and protection  of innocent life.  I signed onto the amicus brief supporting NIFLA with more than 140 colleagues because States do not have the  right to force private individuals or entities to compel speech that violates  their conscience.  I am proud of the House of Representatives’ work to protect the sanctity of  life, such as the Born-Alive  Abortion  Survivors Protection Act,  which I supported, to ensure that children who survive an abortion or an attempted  abortion  are  given  proper  medical treatment. Today I stand with  my colleagues to be a voice for the  voiceless and to stand for the right of  free speech of all who believe in the  sanctity of life.  ",2018

Senator VANHOLLENand I are on the  floor, proud of the Maryland students  who are here today to speak in solidarity with the students from Parkland, FL, in recognizing and remembering the 17 victims of that tragic episode. We also wish to point out that so  many others have lost their lives to  gun violence.  In the State of Maryland, we have  not been spared. Just Monday night, 10  people, including 2 teenage boys, were  wounded in 5 separate shootings in Baltimore. They are the lucky ones who  will likely survive their injuries.  Two men killed in separate shootings  on Monday were Montrel Rivers, age  20, and Ronald Preston, age 30, both  from East Baltimore.  On March  5,  23-year-old Devonte  Rhodes was lost to gun violence in Baltimore.  One  day  earlier,  Jashawn  Ivory, also of Baltimore, was the fatal  victim of a shooting.  In  February,  28-year-old  Jasmine  Chandler and her pregnant friend, Mia  Robinson, who was also 28, were shot as  they sat in a parked car in Northwest  Baltimore. Also last month, off-duty  Prince  George’s  County  Corporal  Mujahid Ramzziddin lost his life to gun  violence.  Fatal victims of gun violence  in  Maryland  include young people  like  Tre’Quan Bullock, age 18, the first of  seven students at Excel Academy in  West Baltimore shot and killed since  October 2016.  Lavar Douglas, age 18; Bryant Beverly, age 18; James Martin, age 55;  ‘‘Sonny’’ Buchanan, age 39; Prenkumar  Walekar, age 54; Sarah Ramos, age 34;  Laurie Ann Lewis-Rivera, age 25—the  list goes on and on and on.

158,Senate,115,-0.318,76,2018-03-14,Mr. WYDEN.," Madam President, first  of all, I wish to commend my Pacific  Northwest colleague Senator MURRAY  for  taking  this  time  to  talk about  these exceptionally important issues. I  had a chance to listen to the thoughtful remarks of our  friend  from New  Hampshire—3,000 miles away from the  Pacific Northwest—and she has been,  as usual, extraordinarily eloquent and  passionate about the cause of women’s  health, and it is great to be able to follow her.  We can sum up the healthcare policy  of the Trump administration in just  one word: discrimination. I am here  with my colleagues today to discuss a  particularly alarming example of the  Trump agenda of healthcare discrimination and an example of where the administration  is working overtime to  make women’s healthcare worse.  What  is  particularly  frustrating  about this is we are dealing with a bureaucracy run amok. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the  Department  of Health  and Human  Services, has made a critical judgment.  They will put ideology over the law of  the land when it comes to the medical  care available to the young women in  its custody.  Under Director Scott Lloyd, the office has attempted to block several immigrants from exercising their freedom  of choice with respect to reproductive  health. It has no legal right to do so.  This  issue  is  settled  law, but  this  hasn’t  stopped  the Director and  its  agency  from dragging young women  into prolonged, taxpayer-funded court  battles.  There are roughly 5,000 young people  in the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s  custody. Most of them are from Central  American  countries. Many  of  these  young women are survivors of sexual  violence. They are on their own, and  they didn’t come here to have somebody  else’s  ideology dictating  their  medical care. In my view, this office  ought to uphold its duty to provide all  the care these young women have a  right to receive, and it ought to check  the ideology at the door.  That is not how the Office of Refugee  Resettlement  is working under Mr.  Lloyd. According to a recent report  from VICE News, ‘‘Mr. Lloyd receives a  spreadsheet every week containing information on every pregnant teen in  their custody.’’  He reportedly sought to interfere in a  young woman’s medical procedure that  was actually already underway. In another case, the report says he put a  young woman at further risk by directing  staff  to  inform  her  parents—  against her wishes—that she had an  abortion.  Last fall, an HHS official was asked  about Mr. Lloyd’s direction of the office and the matter of interfering in  the medical care of young women. Here  is what that spokesman said: ‘‘He by  law has custody of these children, just  like a  foster parent, he knows that  that’s a lot of responsibility and he is  going to make choices that he thinks  are best for both the mother and the  child.’’  I say to my colleagues, that is just  rampant  government  paternalism  summed up in just one sentence.  Now, it ought to be no surprise, given  his background, that this is the direction the office is taking. This is a gentleman who has made a career out of  opposing the right of women to make  their own judgments about their own  healthcare choices. He has fought access to contraception and to a variety  of healthcare services that are important to women. His views are right in  line—right in line—with this administration’s  agenda  of  healthcare  discrimination against women.  Right out of the gate, the administration and Republicans  in Congress  pushed for legislation that would have  deprived  hundreds  of  thousands  of  women the right to see the doctor of  their choosing. They made it harder for  many of those women to obtain routine, vital medical care from providers  like Planned Parenthood,  including  cancer screenings, prenatal care, preventive services, physicals, and a whole  host of preventive services that have  absolutely nothing to do with abortion—nothing to do with abortion.  Then  the  Trump  administration  sought to deny women guaranteed, no-  cost  access  to  contraception. When  women have guaranteed access to contraception,  it means healthier pregnancies, healthier newborns, a  lower  risk of cancer, and, particularly, economic fairness for women of modest  means, but the Trump administration  wants to unravel that guarantee as  well.  Then, the Trump team is green-lighting junk insurance policies that drive  up the cost of healthcare for women  with preexisting conditions, and they  are involved in very elaborate—as my  colleague knows—discussions with the  State of Idaho. People ought to understand exactly what the Trump administration is saying to Idaho because they  are going to say it to other people. The  Trump  administration  is  saying  to  Idaho: You can discriminate, just don’t  be too obvious about it. That is their  position with respect to these junk insurance policies.  The administration is exploring ways  to place  lifetime  limits on the care  people can get from Medicaid, and that  is a frightful proposition for the millions of older women who count on  Medicaid to pick up the tab for their  nursing and home-based care.  These are serious healthcare problems around this country. By the way,  we never heard anything in the campaign of 2016 about how we were going  to turn back the clock on older women  for whom Medicaid is often a lifeline  for long-term care, but that is what we  are dealing with now. These are serious  healthcare  challenges  women  face  right now—on top of it, a raging epidemic of opioid misuse and abuse and  the skyrocketing cost of prescription  medicine. When we are talking about  the Office of Refugee Resettlement, as  my colleagues  talked about  so eloquently, there is also a lot to be done  to fix our broken immigration system.  Finally, it is important, as we get  into  these  issues,  to  recognize how  deep-seated this policy of healthcare  discrimination is. The example my colleagues are talking about here today is  an example of massive ideological overreach and paternalism. It is happening  at the Office of Refugee Resettlement,  but it is not the only example. This is  behavior that ought to stop.  I thank my colleague, Senator MURRAY, who has been our go-to person for  years  and  years  on  women’s  healthcare. I want her and our colleagues to know that I will be doing everything I can to be a part of their efforts to push back on these policies  that turn back the clock and particularly discriminate against the rights of  women.  I yield the floor.  ",2018
159,Senate,115,0.57,76,2018-03-14,Mr. LANKFORD.," Madam President,  when  I was  in college,  I  remember  watching a State of the Union speech  by President Reagan in which he took  a  43-pound  stack of papers and  set  them on the podium. As he was giving  his State of the Union Address, he said:  This is the budget bill that has been  given  to me—43  pounds  of  it,  all  stacked up. It was a famous moment  when the President said: Do not send  this to me again.  Republicans  and Democrats  alike  stood and cheered. They said: That is a  terrible way to do government.  For 5 of the next 6 years there were  no more Omnibus appropriations bills,  but that did not last. Since 1986, there  have been 22 Omnibus appropriations  bills. People may ask, what is that?  By law, Congress is to do 12 appropriations bills. Each part of that has a  section of the budget, and each one of  those is passed as a stand-alone. First,  they go through subcommittee, then  committee, then to the full floor, and  then they pass. But 17 times since 1998  and 22 times since 1986, all of those  bills were just looped together to make  one giant document—the 43-pound document that President Reagan dropped  in 1988.  What is going wrong? We have another one of those omnibus bills next  week, in which all of the appropriations bills have been looped together to  try to simplify the process, but this actually provides even less transparency.

160,Senate,115,0.434,90,2018-03-14,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today, as my colleague from North Dakota has just done, to speak in support  of Senate bill S. 2155, the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.  In response to the 2008 financial crisis, many  individuals overreacted to  the  role  that  smaller  institutions  played. In the rush to react, these institutions became overregulated. But  since the drafting and enactment of  Dodd-Frank nearly 10 years ago, Congress has looked for ways to lessen the  damaging effects it has had on our financial system in America. As a result  of the Dodd-Frank Act, thousands of  pages of Federal mandates were  imposed upon even the smallest of financial institutions.  Community  banks  all  across  the  country are the key source of lending  and other financial services on Main  Street throughout this Nation. I believe we should not, and must not, continue to require them to comply with  the same regulations as our largest financial institutions that are, perhaps,  subject to systemic risk.  This bill before us today fixes that by  offering a commonsense approach to  ensure that our small and medium-  sized  financial  institutions  are  no  longer subject to excessive regulation  that has choked the life from them in  the country.  Senate bill S. 2155 is a result of almost 10 years of negotiations among  Members of both parties. This legislation was negotiated in good faith between Republicans and Democrats to  find common ground. In a time when  partisan politics have derailed many  efforts,  the  bill  before  us moved  through regular order out of the Banking Committee, where a lengthy and  robust  amendment  debate  occurred.  Many of us in this body, including the  Presiding Officer, have  spent hours  upon hours negotiating since the enactment of Dodd-Frank to get to this  point today. This is a bipartisan bill.  This is a good product.  Time and again, I have advocated for  conducting thorough cost-benefit analysis on financial regulations. I believe  it is Congress’s role, when tasked with  oversight authority, to ensure that the  costs of rules from Washington do not  outweigh the benefits for consumers.  However, even a simple examination of  the activities of small and medium-  sized banks shows that their practices  provide no systemic risk to our financial system.  Many Dodd-Frank regulations are inappropriate  for these  institutions  in  the country. This has become abundantly clear to most of us. As regulatory overreach progressed, community banks and, in turn, local economies began to fall on hard times.  In the 115th Congress, I believe the  dynamics have shifted. Beginning with  our work to reform our Nation’s tax  system,  the economy has been performing  well.  Unemployment  has  dropped; the total number of individuals returning to the workforce has increased. In the Senate, we now have a  unique  opportunity  to  unlock  the  chains of stagnation that have halted  the growth of a lot of our small business.  Community  financial  institutions  provide more than 60 percent of small  business  loans  in this country. Too  often, it is easy to forget that the personalized touch of community banks  has been what started the process for  success of some of the most accomplished businesses in the United States  of America. I believe we must pass this  bill if we want that to continue—if we  want  to keep creating  jobs  in  this  country and opportunities for our people.  In response to my friends from the  other side of the aisle who oppose our  efforts here, I have one simple message: The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  Act—the bill we have before the Senate  now—is a thoughtful, bipartisan effort  to correct and  rightsize  regulations  that were hastily prepared. This product is designed to help Main Street, not  Wall Street.  This is a good bill. I hope my colleagues will join me and others in support of it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2018

162,Senate,115,0.382,104,2018-03-14,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, this new  law will also give children and youth  already in foster care new protections  by making sure children get the services they need in the setting best suited for them. It creates robust standards for foster care providers operating  group homes, congregate care, and residential treatment facilities. It will require these types of  facilities to be  equipped to meet children’s needs and  provide services that help address the  trauma they have faced so they can return to live with family or be placed  with a caring foster family as soon as  possible. It will also promote a model  where  children are placed  in  these  types of facilities only when they need  specific services that cannot be provided  in another setting. Too often,  children who can and should be living  in families end up in group care simply  because it is what is available, not because it is the best place for the child.  This law helps tip the scales toward  placing more children in family settings where children do best.  This new law amounts to the most  significant changes to our child welfare  system in decades, and it simply would  not have been possible without  the  hard work, dedication, perseverance,  education, and technical assistance of  so many advocates and experts across  the Nation.

Throughout the games, athletes raised in Vermont and those who  choose to train at Vermont’s world-  class winter academies and programs  showcased the very best of our winter  wonderland. Vermont, ranked 49th in  population among the States, sent the  most athletes per capita to the games.  While there, they showcased Vermont  values,  including  respect,  personal  achievement and excellence, civility  and good sportsmanship.  Vermont athletes were also incredibly  successful during  these games,  bringing  home  three  gold medals.  Montpelier native Amanda Pelkey and  the U.S. Women’s Hockey Team capped  a year battling for equal pay and treatment with a gold medal performance,  stunning Canada  in a thrilling  final  match. Burke Mountain Academy graduate Mikaela Schiffrin continued her  stunning success, bringing home gold  in the giant slalom and silver in the alpine combined. Jessie Diggins,  from  Stratton Mountain School’s T2 elite  team, lunged across the finish line in  an exciting end to the women’s cross-  country skiing team sprint to grab the  gold, the first cross-country gold medal  ever for the United States.  Between the golden moments of triumph, we also saw the grit and determination of Vermont athletes to simply compete at the highest levels of  their sport. In the slalom, Ryan Cochran-Siegle demonstrated his ability to  overcome injuries and the odds as he  enjoyed—and then gracefully ceded—  the  lead to his  fellow athletes. His  teammate, UVM alpine racer Tommy  Bisemeyer, had the courage to speak  honestly  about  the  profound  disappointment of suffering a training injury that cut short his second Olympic  attempt. Other Vermont Olympians include Sophie Caldwell, cross-country  skiing,  from Peru; Caroline Claire,  freestyle  skiing,  from Wilmington;  Kelly Clark, snowboarding, from West  Dover; Emily Dreissigacker, biathlon,  from  Morrisville;  Susan  Dunklee,  biathalon,  from  Barton;  Lindsey  Jacobellis, snowboarding, from Stratton; Nolan Kasper, alpine skiing, from  Warren; Devin Logan, freestyle skiing,  from West Dover; Kaitlynn Miller,  cross-country  skiing,  from  Elmore;  Andy Newell,  cross-country  skiing,  from Shaftsbury; Ida Sargent, cross-  country skiing, from Craftsbury Common; Emerson Smith, freestyle skiing,  from Dover; and Liz Stephen, cross-  country skiing, from Montpelier.

165,Senate,115,0.919,34,2018-03-20,Mr. LEE.," Mr. President, the issue we  are confronting today is one that deals  with the separation of powers outlined  in the U.S. Constitution.  Our system of government was set up  in such a way as to protect the people  from the dangers associated with the  excessive accumulation of power in the  hands of a few. We knew from our experience under British  rule  that  bad  things happen, especially at a national  level, when too few people exercise too  much of the power. Nowhere is this  more evident than in the case of the  war power. In fact, much of the Revolutionary struggle that led to the creation of our Nation resulted from wartime activities undertaken by a Monarch thousands of miles and an ocean  away. It is important today that we remember those same concerns and the  constraints placed in our Constitution  as we run our government nearly 21⁄2  centuries later.  I am happy to be here with my colleague, Senator SANDERS, to file a discharge motion for our resolution, S.J.  Res. 54.  Whether  you  are  present  in  the  Chamber today, physically with us, or  whether you are tuning in at home, I  hope you will listen closely so that we  can  fill you  in on the unauthorized  Middle East war  that your government—the government of the United  States of America—is supporting and  actively participating in as a cobelligerent.  This war in Yemen has killed tens of  thousands  of  innocent  civilians—  human beings, lest we forget—each one  of  them possessing  innate,  immeasurable worth and dignity. This war has  created refugees, orphans, widows; it  has cost millions of dollars; and, believe it or not, at the end of the day, it  actually has, quite arguably, undermined  our  fight  against  terrorist  threats such as ISIS. I will expand on  these unfortunate facts in a moment,  but for now, let’s just focus on one  thing. Our military’s involvement in  Yemen has not been authorized by Congress as required by the Constitution.  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution  states  that  the Congress  shall  have the power to declare war—Congress, not the President, not the Pentagon, not someone else within the executive branch of government, but Congress.  Yet  in  2015,  then-President  Obama initiated our military involvement in Yemen and did so without authorization from Congress.  The current administration has continued Obama’s war. Senator SANDERS,  Senator MURPHY, our cosponsors, and I  are now giving Congress a chance to fix  this error by debating and voting on  our Nation’s continued involvement in  this  unauthorized,  illegal  war  in  Yemen.  If, as our opponents claim, this war is  necessary, then surely they can defend  that argument before this body and before the House of Representatives and,  ultimately, secure authorization from  Congress, just as the Constitution demands under article I, section 8. But if,  on the other hand, they cannot defend  this war and they cannot persuade a  majority of the Members of this body  and a majority of the Members of the  House of Representatives that this is a  war that needs to be fought, then it  needs to end. Let’s have an honest  reckoning about this war today.  Before this debate gets underway in  earnest, there are a few points that I  would like to clarify.  First, let’s talk about Iran for just a  moment. Yes, the Houthis did fire on a  U.S. Navy vessel. This only reinforces  the fact that Yemenis view the United  States as a participant in this war, regardless of whether or not Congress  wants to acknowledge that participation or approve it, as the Constitution  requires. But overall, there are conflicting reports about the extent of Iranian support for the Houthi rebels.  What we  do  know  is  this: The  Houthis are a regional rebel group that  does not  itself  threaten  the United  States. While  the Houthis  are  no  friends of ours, neither are they a serious threat to American national security. The longer we fight against them,  the more reason we give them to hate  America and embrace the opportunists  who are our true enemy in the region—  Iran. And the more we prolong activities that destabilize the region, the  longer we harm our own interests in  terms of trade and broader regional security.  The bottom  line  is  this: We are  spending a great deal of time and treasure to defeat a regional rebel group  VerDate Sep 11 2014  00:53 Mar 21, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20MR6.008 S20MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H P B C B K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2018
166,Senate,115,0.394,41,2018-03-20,Mr. CORKER.," Mr. President, I wish  to thank the Senator from New Jersey,  my good friend, the ranking member of  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for his comments.  Today we met with the Crown Prince  of Saudi Arabia, a very  impressive  young man who  is transforming the  country. We talked about the importance of our relationship, no doubt, but  we strongly, strongly pushed back on  what is happening right now in Yemen  and asked them to take strong corrective action. I was there when this occurred, and I certainly expressed the  same.  We also talked about the enrichment  they are pursuing and some of the concerns that exist there. I want to thank  the ranking member for his leadership  and the words he just spoke.  Let me just speak to the debate we  are having on the floor. This is a very  MITCH YOUNG MCCONNELL entrepreneurial move. I don’t say that  to be pejorative. I know one of the  Members  is on  the Judiciary Committee that  is bringing this to the  floor. I can imagine some highly important  judicial  issue not being debated in the Judiciary Committee but  just being wafted to the floor for a debate. I know that is not the way the  Judiciary Committee operates.  One of the other Members is on the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I can imagine some complex  cap-and-trade bill being offered, and instead of it being worked through the  committee—or  some ethanol bill or  some other type of bill—instead of it  being worked through the committee,  somebody just decides to bring it directly to the floor. That is what is happening here today.  I certainly don’t shy away from this  debate.  I  appreciate  the  fact  that  understood  that  very few Members of our body—unless  they are on  the Foreign Relations  Committee,  Armed  Services  Committee, or happen to take a particular  interest—even know much about what  is happening in Yemen, and a lot is  happening there. So I appreciated the  briefing that took place last week to  give Members a sense as to what is occurring there, but the proper way to  deal with these issues is to deal with  them in committee.  One would think that maybe there is  some Yemen legislation that the committee is holding and not acting on.  That  is not the case. Any of these  Members could have offered Yemen legislation relative to this issue, and the  committee would take it up. That has  not occurred.  So let me tell my colleagues what is  happening in the committee. We have a  bill that is being worked on by Senator  and Senator SHAHEEN dealing  with this very issue. They are building  support. They are working with the administration to make sure the definitions are correct, and they have had  numbers of people involved with them.  We plan to have a Yemen hearing in  the next few weeks to deal with this  issue but also to take up appropriate  legislation. That is the way we typically deal with issues of such importance.  Let me say this: This is an issue of  great importance. It not only affects  the  tremendous humanitarian  crisis  that  is occurring  in Yemen and the  radicalization  of  the Houthis,  supported by Iran—a proxy of Iran—but  also Saudi Arabia’s own security. It  also affects the way we deal with other  countries. I think many people here  understand fully that right now, or recently, we have been involved in the  same kinds of activities with France,  as they have dealt with issues in Mali,  including refueling and helping them  some with intelligence issues.  So this is something, again, that we  need to take up in a serious way, and  the committee is committed to doing  so.  What I hope will happen today is that  Members of this body will let the Foreign Relations Committee do its job  and that we will bring a bill forward  that we  can  properly  debate  and  amend.  I am hoping that later today, when I  offer a tabling motion, Members of this  body will respect the members of the  Foreign Relations Committee who deal  with this issue and let it go back to  committee, with the commitment that  we plan to bring forth legislation to actually deal appropriately with many of  the  issues relative to Yemen, Saudi  Arabia, Iran, and ourselves.  Let me mention one other thing. We  have been working for some time to  deal with the authorization for the use  of military force. It has been an issue  that has been before us for many years.  It is the replacement and revision of  the 2001–2002 AUMF that many people  in this body have had concerns about  because it has been so long since they  were enacted. We have activities that  are taking place around the world still  based on those two authorizations. We  have a markup on an AUMF on April 19  scheduled to try to revise so we can  give people an opportunity to weigh in  on this issue on the floor.  By the way, the way the AUMF is  being constructed at present, when we  go into new countries, when we take on  new groups, the Senate would have the  ability to weigh in on those issues.  So I just would like to say to the  body and those who are looking in, we  are not shying away from this debate.  There has been no legislation whatsoever that has been held up on this  topic. Legislation is being introduced  soon in a bipartisan way to deal with  this terrible issue that is taking place  in Yemen.  We are going to have a hearing. We  will have a markup.  In addition to  that, we are going to have a markup on  a new AUMF to deal with the issues  our country is dealing with around the  world with al-Qaida, ISIS, and other  entities that have been associated parties.  With that, I just want to let people  know that is kind of the way we deal  with things around here. None of us is  happy with the current status, but I  think a better way for us to come up  with a prudent solution to what is happening there is to go through the normal committee process.  I hope  the  other Members of the body will respect  that.  I am glad that, by the way, the ranking member—by the way, this policy  has been taking place  in Yemen. It  started under the Obama administration, the same exact policy. The Senate  has acted on it by voting for appropriations, so it is not as if we have not  taken action ourselves. We have done  that through the NDAA. We have done  that  through various State Department authorizations. So we have acted  upon it. There are concerns about what  is happening there. Legislation is going  to be introduced to try to deal with  VerDate Sep 11 2014  00:53 Mar 21, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20MR6.017 S20MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H P B C B K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2018
167,,115,0.593,83,2018-03-20,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, on any  beautiful day down  in Houston, Texas, you  can find Shaun Linsey driving perfectly hit golf  balls down  the  range. His  father, Mark,  is  Shaun’s biggest fan and competitor. Mark and  Shaun have competitions between  the  two  from time to time, but it’s always in good fun.  At age three, Shaun’s parents were told he  was autistic and that he wouldn ’t ever be able  to speak. Shaun has defied the odds, and with  the help of his mom, Linda, Shaun is able to  both speak and compete in the sport he loves.  Shaun has since picked up the game of golf  and  has  become wildly  successful. Even  though his golf skills were impeccable, Shaun  found he wasn’t accepted in regular competitions. That ’s when he and his family turned toward the Special Olympics. The great program  gave the young golfer a chance to compete  and win. Shaun has done more than just compete in golf competitions. He and his dad have  won area, state, and even placed in national  competitions.  Shaun  is one of  the best golfers around,  and that’s a true testament to his determination in continually striving to better himself. Becoming a great golfer takes a lot of hard work  and it is evident Shaun has put in many hours  on the golf course to get to where he is today.  I am honored  to be able  to  speak of  Shaun’s accomplishments in his life. I am also  honored to say Shaun hails from our beloved  Houston. His tenacity and passion for life is incredible  and  he  truly  exemplifies what  it  means to be a Special Olympian.  Keep golfing Shaun. We can’t wait to see  what else he accomplishes down the road.  And that ’s just the way it is.  f  CHARITY GRIMSLEY  HON.

Dating back  to 1818,  the Baker’s Creek  Baptist Church is the second oldest church in  Spencer County. It has served not just as a  place of worship, but also as a  refuge  for  those  in  times of  trouble and means of encouragement for men and women of faith, including  influential Americans such as President Abraham Lincoln.  Through the Lord ’s grace and the devotion  of  leaders  like Pastor  James Carl  Jones,  Baker’s Creek Baptist Church has remained a  place  for  the congregation  to worship and  come together as a community.  I am grateful  for Baker’s Creek Baptist  Church’s rich history of service over the past  200 years and excited  for what  the  future  holds. Again, congratulations on achieving this  tremendous milestone.

169,,115,-0.515,8,2018-03-26,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public  servant, Evangelist Sarah Kimbrough Hall.  The weekend  of  September  15,  2017  marked the 30th year ministry celebration for  Evangelist Sarah Kimbrough Hall.  In 1987,  local Pastor Edward Shields became gravely ill. At the time, he had a weekly  radio broadcast. As he could not perform this  duty any longer, he asked Evangelist Hall to  take over his radio ministry.  She thought that she would just do the program as he recovered from his illness. However, Pastor Shields did not  recover, and  Evangelist Hall continued to do the broadcast.  Evangelist Hall said that she had no idea  that a door was being opened for her to minister on a national level.  As she assumed her new  role of  radio  broadcaster, Evangelist Hall began to expand  her ministry to include: nursing homes, donating to the homeless, visiting and ministering to  the sick and elderly, jailhouse ministry, issuing  school supplies to children, rendering support  and comfort to the bereaved, providing financial support to various charities and non-profits  and bringing local gospel musical artists to the  area, just to name a few.  Evangelist Hall was born in Indianola, Mississippi, to Pastor Sam and Eula Kimbrough.  At the age of nine, she began singing with  a gospel quartet and in her church’s choir. It  was at her father’s church that she began arranging and scheduling church programs.  She moved to Chicago in 1966. After completing high school, she earned certifications  in Business and Office Administration and  Cosmetology. Although Hall lived in Chicago,  she booked and arranged gospel artists  to  come to Indianola to perform. These programs  grew, received much acclaim and have continued until this day.  Over the years, Evangelist Hall has been instrumental in various community efforts, which  include raising money  for a number of non-  profit  organizations. One  of  her  crowning  achievements for the past 20 years has been  her work and  fundraising  for  the Mississippi  Region One Burn Center.  Under Evangelist Hall’s  leadership, an excess of $30,000 has been raised and donated  to help with the treatment and care of burn  victims, many of whom have no health insurance.  Over the years, Evangelist Hall has received  numerous accolades, to include: the Woman  of Influence by the American Gospel Quartet  Convention; selected as Nation ’s Best and  Most Blessed by Quartet Jamboree; was the  recipient  of  the Ruby Summerville Dixon  Award; was recognized by the Jackson Musical Association Award and the Annual Stellar  Gospel Award.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in  recognizing Evangelist Sarah Kimbrough  Hall for her dedication to serving others and  giving back to her community.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

170,,115,-0.428,8,2018-03-26,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, last week,  I voted against H.R. 1625, the fiscal year (FY)  2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Most  troubling,  the bill shortchanges our nation ’s  young people by failing to adequately address  the gun violence epidemic. The bill also dismisses  the urgent need  to provide greater  clarity  for Dreamers and  takes a cruel and  heartless approach  to  immigration  that does  not reflect our country’s values. It does all of  this while also failing to make tough decisions  about our defense priorities. It maintains a $78  billion increase in defense spending above last  year’s levels without dealing with wasteful and  unnecessary nuclear expenditures  that will  make our country less secure.  That said, I credit our negotiators for funding  key Democratic priorities and eliminating many  Republican ‘ ‘poison pill’ ’ policy provisions. The  omnibus included several key provisions that I  support. The  legislation  includes additional  funding to address our nation’s crumbling infrastructure,  including  transit grant programs  that I have long championed, and maintains  critical  funding  for our public broadcasters.  The bill also fully funds the Trade Enforcement  Trust Fund, includes a $4.6 billion increase for  our nation’s affordable housing programs, and  maintains full support for program to ensure  the U.S. continues increasing access to water,  sanitation, and hygiene for the world’s poorest  people.  This is a tough job, and I commend the negotiators for their hard work.  f  OPPOSITION TO H.R. 4296  HON. JARED POLIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018  ",2018
171,,115,-0.279,8,2018-03-26,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4296, a bill  that restricts how  federal  financial regulators  determine the amount of operational risk capital  large banks are required  to hold. Operational risk standards were put in place after  the financial crisis of 2008 and currently apply  to  the  largest  financial  firms  in  the country.  These capital  requirements are designed  to  ensure  that  large  financial  institutions have  enough money on-hand to protect consumers  and  taxpayers,  avoiding  another  taxpayer  funded bank bailout. At  the  time H.R. 4296  was brought to the floor, I voted in favor of  passage. However, this was a mistake and I  would like to reflect that I do not support this  legislation.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act was passed to ensure that the American taxpayers will not have  to pay for another Wall Street bailout. I am a  proud co-author and supporter of  the Dodd-  Frank Act and continue to believe that it is critical  to protect our nation ’s  financial stability.  Dodd-Frank put in place financial regulations  that protect the broader economy by mitigating  risk of large financial firms. Further, it enacted  much needed consumer protections to make  financial products offered to consumers safer  and easier to understand. Significant changes  to Dodd-Frank could undermine the stability of  the economy and our financial services sector  and  increase  the  likelihood  that predatory  lenders will return to prey on vulnerable consumers.  f  HONORING PFC MILTON LEE  OLIVE  HON.

174,Senate,115,-0.406,9,2018-04-09,Mr. SCHATZ.," Madam President,  I  thank Senator HIRONOfor her poignant  remarks, and I want to offer my condolences to the family.  Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka died  on Friday at the age of 93, leaving behind a legacy of integrity, kindness,  and service to Hawaii and to the Nation.  In Washington, Senator Akaka was  an ambassador of ‘‘aloha.’’ He showed  people kindness,  respect, and hospitality rarely seen  in this town. He  didn’t just represent Hawaii’s interests  in the Congress; he showed the world  what Hawaii represents; in the words of  President Kennedy,  ‘‘all that we are  and all that we hope to be.’’  He started that service as a welder in  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He  fought in World War II in the Pacific  arena, traveling to places like Tinian  and Saipan. When World War II ended,  he took advantage of the GI bill to attend the University of Hawaii to become  a  teacher—an  occupation  he  never fully left behind.  Senator Akaka served for 36 years in  Congress—14 years in the House and 22  in the U.S. Senate. He was loved by  colleagues in both parties because he  was kind to everyone. In fact, he never  said a bad word about anyone, not even  in private. The foundation for his kindness came  from his  faith, which he  learned from his mother Annie.  He was a  faithful attendee of the  weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast, where  he would lead Members singing hymns.  He always began with the history of  each song—a tradition he passed on to  our own Chaplain, Chaplain Black, who  continues it today.  Danny Akaka was also very humble.  There were times he didn’t get credit  for the work he did here because he  didn’t care about the credit. He cared  about the work, about making a difference  for  people,  especially  those  whom he represented.  He was deeply convinced that the  government  could  improve  people’s  lives because he had seen that in his  own life as a beneficiary of the GI bill.  He would become  the Senator who  modernized that bill, bringing it into  the  21st century. He always  fought  hard  for veterans—for their benefits  and their recognition, no matter the  color of their skin or their country of  origin. When someone once challenged  him on the cost of benefits for veterans, he answered by saying:  ‘‘The  price has already been paid, many  times over, by the service of the brave  men and women who wore our nation’s  uniform.’’  Senator Akaka never forgot the costs  of war on our country, and he did everything he could to make sure his colleagues didn’t either. He voted against  the Iraq war and advocated for peace  and nuclear nonproliferation throughout his career.  He was unrelenting when it came to  the causes that were most important  to him. As the only Native Hawaiian to  ever serve in the U.S. Senate, he never  stopped working to see Native Hawaiians recognized  in a government-to-  government  relationship  with  the  United States.  In his years on the Indian Affairs  Committee, including as the chairman,  he successfully sponsored the apology  resolution, which recognized that the  overthrow of the Queen—the only monarch in the United States—was illegal  and facilitated by agents of our own  Federal Government.  This was  the  theme  of  Senator  Akaka’s career—to advocate for people  who did not have power and for people  who were vulnerable. He was a champion for the Federal Government employees who, to this day, continue to  be a punching bag for some. He sponsored the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Act, which ensures that Federal  workers cannot be retaliated against if  they report waste,  fraud, and abuse.  That was just one of the many things  he did to make the Federal Government a better employer.  Senator Akaka also fought for consumers. He helped people who were trying to get out of credit card debt. He  made sure investors had an advocate at  the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he protected people who sent  remittances around the world so they  aren’t  swindled  out  of  their  hard-  earned money.  Every morning he would begin his  day by meeting visitors from Hawaii.  Those  connections  to  his  constituents—to home—drove his work and  kept him focused on helping Hawaii.  Much of his work was possible because of the bipartisanship relationships he built with other Senators.  Some of his best friends in the body—  Senators INHOFE, COCHRAN, and BARRASSO—were people with whom he did  not agree very often. Every Member of  this body—those who knew Senator  Akaka and those who didn’t—can learn  from his legacy—a legacy of quiet leadership, of treating others the way you  want to be treated, and focusing on the  things that matter to the people we are  here to represent.  I want to end with a few words from  Chaplain Black. This is what he had to  say about Senator Akaka:  There’s something called ethical congruence—it refers to when your actions back up  your rhetoric. And most of us struggle with  that, because it’s very easy to say something  but much more difficult to live it. There’s a  verse in Scripture that says, we are living  letters, so our lives should be something that  people should be able to read. Francis of Assisi said: preach the gospel everywhere you  go; when necessary, use words. Senator  Akaka preached the gospel everywhere he  went, and very rarely had to use words.  That’s the kind of ethical congruence that  he had.  VerDate Sep 11 2014  01:27 Apr 10, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09AP6.007 S09APPT1 ",2018
175,Senate,115,-0.3,23,2018-04-09,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President, today I  wish to honor Dr. William Tucker as he  celebrates his 90th birthday. Bill is an  entrepreneur and  former government  official and presently serves as president of Penn Century Corporation.  In 1951, Bill married the Honorable C.  Delores Tucker, who later went on to  become  the  first  African-American  woman to serve as Pennsylvania’s Secretary of State. As a young man, Bill  proudly served in the U.S. Army from  1951 to 1953. Shortly after, he attended  Lincoln University where he graduated  in 1960 with a bachelor of arts degree.  In May 2011, he received an honorary  doctorate in humane letters from Lincoln University.  Before  retiring  from  government  service in 1991, Bill served as a confidential assistant  to  the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the Carter  administration and later served as associate director of the U.S. Department  of Commerce’s Office of Business Liaison, working as an assistant to the secretary. Bill provided years of invaluable service to the Department and embodied what it means to be a public  servant.  Bill went on to become vice chair of  the Bethune DuBois Institute, and it  was in this role that he founded the annual  Children’s  Christmas  Dinner  Party for disadvantaged children, first  held  in Washington, DC.  In  2004,  through the Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Jr. Association  for Nonviolence, Inc., he orchestrated the first  Annual Children’s Christmas Dinner  Party  for underserved children  from  the Philadelphia and surrounding areas  at the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel,  which serviced over 3,800 children that  year.  As a committed community activist,  Bill has dedicated his life to defending  others. He has served as president of  the Associated Real Estate Brokers of  Philadelphia and a board member of  the National Negro Business League,  the Urban League of Philadelphia, the  Philadelphia  Chapter  NAACP,  and  many others. His commitment to helping shape his community has been an  inspiration to us all.  Bill set the prime example of leadership and courage during his life. His activism and many years of community  and public service are significant to  many who have been touched by his  work.

With Harbour Town’s  red and white striped lighthouse as a  backdrop,  a world-class  golf  tournament is held annually the week after  the Masters. Our tournament champions have included a notable number  of Hall of Fame golfers: Arnold Palmer,  Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, Hale Irwin,  Bernhard Langer, Johnny Miller, Greg  Norman, Nick Price, Tom Watson, and  Payne Stewart.  More than 1,200 volunteers staff the  tournament during  the week. Their  work is felt and seen by the more than  a hundred thousand people who attend  the tournament every year and the  millions more who watch  the  tournament  broadcast  in  226  countries.  Last year, the tournament infused over  $96 million  into the State of South  Carolina’s economy.  Even more notable than the golf is  the impact the Heritage Classic Foundation has on the local communities in  South Carolina and Georgia. Since 1987,  $38 million has been distributed  to  those  in need  in  these  two States.  Since 1993, 322 high school seniors have  received more than $4.1 million for 4-  year college scholarships. This fall, 34  Beaufort County collegians will receive  foundation grants at an expenditure of  $159,000.  Last year, the foundation helped facilitate more than $2.9 million in donations. The Heritage Champions Fore  Charity has produced more than $7.2  million  for  participating  nonprofit  groups. Last year, the Birdies for Charity  program  distributed  $216,000  in  pledge donations, bringing the total to  $5.7 million since it was created in 2000.  The nonprofit groups that staff the  tournament  concession  stands made  $247,706 for their charities in 2017.  On behalf of all South Carolinians, I  want to express my deep appreciation  and congratulations to the RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing Golf Tournament on the occasion of its 50th anniversary and wish them another successful tournament this week.∑  f  REMEMBERING SHANE QUILLING  ∑",2018
177,Senate,115,0.464,23,2018-04-09,Mr. HELLER.," Mr. President, today I  wish to memorialize Shane Quilling,  Carson High School’s  physical  education teacher and head football and  softball coach who unexpectedly passed  away at the age of 53.  Remembered  as  a  compassionate  teacher and coach, Mr. Quilling’s loss  will have a profound impact on Carson  High School and the greater Carson  community. As the Reno Gazette Journal recently noted, Coach Quilling’s  ‘‘main goal in life was to help make everybody a better person, to strive for  their best, no matter what they did in  life.’’  Born in Sidney, MT, Mr. Quilling attended Sidney High School, where he  was a football, track, and basketball  athlete. After graduating  from high  school, he studied at Montana State  University-Bozeman  on  a  football  scholarship where he helped lead the  VerDate Sep 11 2014  03:25 Apr 10, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A09AP6.023 S09APPT1 ",2018
