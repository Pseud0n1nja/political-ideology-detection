0,Senate,95,-0.204,41,3,Mr. SPARKMAN.," Mr. President, I con clude simply with this statement. I pre sume it is known that after the commit tee spent all of this time in getting all of  the evidence, hearing from all of  the  people interested in the canal treaties,  and considering all the arguments pro  and con, the committee voted 14 to 1 to  report the treaties. I will say this, Mr.  President it is recognbed, of course, that  treaties come under the jurisdiction of  the Foreign Relations Committee regard less of what other reports or what other  information may come out.  ExHIBIT 1  I. PANAMA CANAL TREATY  the  The United States of America and  Republic of Panama,  Acting in the spirit of the Joint Declara tion of April 3, 1964, by the Representatives  of the Governments of the United States of  America and the Republic of Panama, and  of the Joint Statement of Principles of Feb ruary 7, 1974, initialed by the Secretary of  State of the United States of America and  the Foreign Minister of  the Republic of  Panama, and  Acknowledging the Republic of Panama's  sovereignty over its territory,  Have decided to terminate the prior Trea ties pertaining to the Panama Canal and to  conclude a new Treaty to serve as the basis  for a new relationship between them and,  accordingly, have agreed upon  the  follow ing:  ARTICLE  I  ABROGATION OF PRIOR TREATIES AND ESTABLISH MENT OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP  this Treaty  1. Upon  its entry into force,  terminates and supersedes:  (a) The Isthmian Canal Convention be tween the United States of America and the  Republic of Panama, signed at Washington,  November 18, 1903;  (b) The Treaty of Friendship and Coop eration signed at Washington, March 2, 1936,  and  the Treaty of Mutual Understanding  and Cooperation  and  the  related Memo randum of Understandings Reached, signed  at Panama, January 25, 1955, between  the  United States of America and the Republic  of Panama;  (c) All other treaties, conventions, agree ments and exchanges of notes between the  United States of America and the Republic  of Panama, concerning  the Panama Canal  which were in force prior to the entry into  force of this Treaty; and  ( d)  Provisions  concerning  the Panama  Canal which appear in other treaties, con ventions, agreements and exchanges of notes  between the United States of America and  the Republic of Panama which were in force  prior to the entry into force of this Treaty.  2.  In accordance with  the  terms of this  Treaty and related agreements, the Republic  of Panama, as territorial sovereign, grants to  the United States of America, for the dura tion of this Treaty, the rights necessary to  regulate  the  transit of ships  through  the  Panama Canal,  and  to manage,  operate,  maintain,  improve, protect and defend  the  Canal. The Republic of Panama guarantees  to the United States of America the peaceful  use of the land and water areas which  it  has been granted the rights to use for such  purposes pursuant to this Treaty and related  agreements.  3. The Republic of Panama shall participate  increasingly in the management and protec tion and defense of the Canal, as provided in  this Treaty.  4. In view of the special relationship estab lished by this Treaty, the United States of  Am~rica and the Republic of Panama shall  cooperate  to assure  the uninterrupted and  efficient operation of the Panama Canal.  ARTICLE ll  RATIFICATION, ENTRY  INTO FORCE, AND  TERMINATION  1. This Treaty shall be subject to ratifica tion in accordance with  the constitutional  procedures of the  two Parties. The instru ments of ratification of this Treaty shall be  exchanged at Panama at the same time as the  instruments of ratification of the Treaty Con cerning the Permanent Neutrality and Oper ation of the Pana.ma Canal, signed this date,  are exchanged. This Treaty shall enter into  force, simultaneously with the Treaty Con cerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of  the Panama Canal,  six  calendar  months from the date of the exchange of the  instruments of ratification.  2. This Treaty shall  terminate at noon,  Panama time, December 31, 1999.  ARTICLE Ill  CANAL OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT  1. The Republic of Panama, as territorial  sovereign, grants  to  the United States of  America the rights to manage, operate, and  maintain the Panama Canal, its complemen tary works, installations and equipment and  to provide for the orderly transit of vessels  through  the Panama Canal. The United  States of America accepts the grant of such  rights and undertakes to exercise  them in  accordance with  this Treaty  and  related  agreements.  2. In carrying out the foregoing responsi b111ties, the United States of America may:  (a) Use for the aforementioned purposes,  without  cost  except  as provided  in  this  Treaty,  the various  installations and areas  (including the Panama Canal) and waters,  described in the Agreement in Implementa tion of this Article, signed this date, as well  as such other areas and installations as are  made available to the United States of Amer ica und_er this Treaty and related agreements,  and take the measures necessary to ensure  sanitation of such areas;  (b) Make such improvements and altera tions to the aforesaid installations and areas  as it deems appropriate, consistent with the  terms of this Treaty;  ( c) Make and enforce all rules pertaining  to the passage of vessels through the Canal  and other rules with respect to navigation  and maritime matters,  in accordance with  this Treaty and related agreements. The Re public of Panama will lend its cooperation,  when necessary, in the enforcement of such  rules;  ( d) Establish, modify, collect and retain  tolls for the use of the Panama Canal, and  other  charges,  and  establish  and modify  methods of their assessment;  ( e) Regulate relations with employees of  the United States Government;  (f) Provide supporting services to facl11tate the performance of its responsib111ties  under this Article;  (g)  Issue and enforce regulations for the  effective exercise of the rights and responsi b111ties  of  the United States of America  under this Treaty and related agreements.  The Republic of Panama will  lend its co operation, when necessary,  in the enforce ment of such rules; and  (h) Exercise any other right granted under  this Treaty, or otherwise agreed upon be tween the two Parties.  3. Pursuant to the foregoing grant of rights,  the United States of America shall, in ac cordance with the terms of this Treaty and  the provisions of United States  law, carry  out its responsib111ties by means of a United  States Government agency called the Pan ama Canal Commission, which shall be con stituted by and in conformity with the laws  of the United States of America.  (a) The Panama Canal Commission shall  be supervised by a Board composed of nine  members, five of whom shall be nationals of  the United States of America, and four of  whom shall be Panamanian nationals pro posed by the Republic of Pana.ma for ap pointment to such positions by the United  States of America in a timely manner.  (b) Should the Republic of Panama re quest the United States of America to re move a Panamanian national from member ship on  the Board,  the United States  t>f  America shall agree  to such a  request. In  that event,  the Republic of Pana.ma shall  propose another pana.manian national  for  appointment by the United States of Amer ica to such position in a  timely manner. In  ",1978
1,Senate,95,0.327,67,3,Mr. GRIFFIN.," Later on that same day  of October  for  example, General  Torrijos stated that the United States  would have the right to defend the canal  if it were attacked by ""a great power.''  Shortly thereafter, Ambassador Linowitz  replied  that  the United States had a  right to defend the canal against any  threat  or  aggression  from whatever  quarter. So the difference in interpreta tion quickly surf aced again even after  the Carter-Torrijos statement.  The situation was further complicated  when General Torrijos arrived back in  Panama and said, ""I haven't even signed  an autograph""-at least implicitly sug gesting that the unsigned statement was  of questionable legal validity.  When the Byrd-Baker amendments are  adopted, as I predict they will be,  the  Carter-Torrijos joint statement will ac tually be incorporated as part of the text  of the Neutrality Treaty that will be an  improvement but, unfortunately, this ac tion will not erase differences of inter.;.  pretation which persist, as underscored  by  the American Law Division of  the  Library of Congress in a  report which  . concluded:        It is not altogether clear that the  joint statement would permit  the United  States to intervene in the event that the ag gression or threat should result from Pan amanian action.  Following  the Carter-Torrijos  joint  statement and shortly before the vote by  the Panamanian people, General Torrijos  complicated an uncertain situation still  further when he told the Panamanian  people on radio and television that the  role of the United States under the Neu trality Treaty was to defend the canal  from foreign ~ggression if requested by  Panama. Not once but twice he said:    the United States is obligated to come  to our defense ... when we ring the bell here,  when we push the button ... (Emphasis sup     plied).  On the record, it is painfully obvious  that the United States and Panama have  been in disagreement--and still disagree,  despite  the October 14 Carter-Torrijos  joint statement--on at least two major  points:  Our administr>ation tells the American peo ple that the United States will have the right  to defend  the canal after  the  year  2000  against any threat to its neutrality, including  an internal threat from within Panama. But  spokesmen for Pana.ma. assert that the United  States wlll have such a. right only if the canal  is threatened by a foreign power.  Our administration tells the American peo ple that the United States can determine uni laterally when such a.  right to defend the  canal  can be  exercised. But Panamanian  spokesmen insist that U.S. forces oan come  in only when requested or when the action is  agreed to by Panama.  We would be living in a fool's paradise  to assume that these contradictory inter pretations will simply go away  if  this  treaty arrangement is ratified.  It is essential, Mr. President, that we  a void being placed in the dilemma which  such  differing  interpretations  would  create. Because it is by failing to reach a  real agreement with the people of Pan ama by trying to paper over serious de ficiencies and disagreements for short term political gain,  that we could be  buying ourselves a one-way ticket to an other Vietnam.  Mr. President, particularly, if we are  to consider  turning  t.he canal over  to  Panama in the year 2000, and if the se curity and economic  interests of  the  United States are to be protected, then  we should not relinquish our option to  negotiate for construction of a second  canal, possibly a sea-level canal,  in a  country other than Panama.  That  is  exactly what we would do  under article XII of the proposed canal  treaty, which reads in part:  During  the duration of this Treaty,  the  United States of America. shall not negotiate  with third States for the right to construct  a.n interoceanic canal on any other route in  the Western Hemisphere, except as the two  Parties may otherwise agree.  In exchange for such a clear and un equivocal commitment on our part not  to build a new canal in any other country,  surely it is reasonable to ask what would  we get in return under the treaty?  The administration says we get a com mitment in the treaty that Panama will  not collaborate with any other nation to  build a second canal in Panama. Whether  that would be a fair exchange is open  to serious questions. But beyond  that,  there are three important points to be  made: First,  the language of  the pro posed treaty does not say that; second,  we already have such a guarantee under  the existing 1903 treaty; and third, the  existing guarantee would be wiped out if  we were to ratify the proposed treaty be fore us.  In exchange for our clear and unam biguous commitment not to build a new  canal  in any other country; Panama  would be bound, and I put ""bound"" in  quotes,  by  the  following  language  in  article XII:        [D]uring the duration of the Treaty,  both parties commit  themselves  jointly the feasibility of a. sea. level canal in  the Republic of Panama., and in the event  they determine that such a. waterway is nec essary, they sha.11 negotiate t.erms agreeable  to both parties, for its construction.  to study  It is not necessary  to have  taken a  high school course  in business  law  to  understand that, under such language,  Panama would  be  obligated  only  to  ""study"" and to ""negotiate."" There is no  clear  and  unambiguous  commitment  there-or anywhere else in the treaty that would preclude Panama's joining  with a nation other  than  the United  States to construct a second, or sea level,  canal in Panama provided they complied  with the requirements of the treaty that  they first study and negotiate.  Mr. President, even though the exist ing canal is not obsolete, and will not be  obsolete in the near future, it is neces sary and  important  that we do  look  toward the day when the existing Pan ama Canal will no longer be adequate.  The dream of a sea-level canal, a canal  without  locks, ought to be more  than  just a dream in an era when men and  women are going to the moon.  It is true that studies have been made  and have  indicated that the least ex pensive place to build a second or sea level canal would be in Panama. But I  suggest that for political and other rea sons, it might be very wise to construct  such a second canal in another country,  even though it would cost a few billion  dollars more.  Furthermore, perhaps such a  second  canal should be built in another country  under the auspices of the Organization  of American States or some other ar rangement of international interests.  In a study published under the aus pices of the Council on Foreign Rela tions in 1967, Immanuel J. Klette ob-'  served:  Although  the cost of construction bee.rs  on the final choices, it should not be  the  prime factor in ma.king decisions on a. new  ca.na.l. A waterway which  is  less expensive  in dollars may be  the most expensive  political consequences.  in  As we move toward a new treaty rela tionship with Panama, we should not  ignore  the value of competition--eco nomic, political, and even diplomatic  competition.  Holding open even the possibility of  building a new canal outside of Pan ama-an option foreclosed by the pro posed  treaty-could provide very  im portant and useful leverage in our rela tions with Panama.  After all, for the foreseeable future,  Panama's economic survival is depend ent on the Panama Canal. As Prof. Ed win C. Hoyt observed several years ago  in the Virginia Journal of International  Law:  If Pana.ma. is too intransigent, she may lose  the  (sea. level) ca.na.l  to one of these other  countries. This would be a.n economic dis aster for Pana.ma..  Furthermore, if a second canal were  constructed elsewhere in Latin America,  Panama would be forced to keep its own  tolls competitive or risk losing most of  the traffic to its almost certainly more  modern rival.  A major conference on Panama spon sored by Georgetown University's Cen ter for Strategic Studies in 1967 reached  this key conclusion:  Though  the Republic of Pana.ma.  seems  technically to be the best place for a. future  canal facility, the United States should not  abandon the right to approach other coun tries for possible ca.na.l location in the event  that future political conditions exclude the  project from Panama.  Under  the circumstances,  it is very  difficult for me to see how article XII of  the proposed canal treaty serves the in terests of the United States.  In my minority views, Mr. President, I  also speak to certain economic concerns  that trouble me and many of my col leagues, and indeed many Americans. I  will only state here in these remarks that  the  soothing  assurances by President  Carter and others speaking for the ad ministration that these treaties, if rati",1978
2,Senate,95,0.631,80,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, as we enter  this historic debate, I would like to call  attention to the hearings of the Senate  Armed Services Committee,  to which I  alluded earlier, and to urge all my col leagues  to peruse  them carefully. As  many are doubtless aware,  these hear ings were held on January 24 and 31,  and February 1. For some reason,  the  news media saw fit to ignore those hear ings for the most part. Except for cover age of  the February 1 hearing by  the  Washington Star,  little attention was  paid to some of the extraordinary testi mony that was developed at those hear ings.  Because of the volume of material re lating  to  the Panama Canal, and  the  haste with which consideration of  the  treaties was brought to the floor, special  burdens have been imposed on Senators  in their attempt to give judicious scru tiny to the issue. Although the treaties  were signed on September 7, the 354-page  report of the Foreign Relations Commit tee was not available Friday as hoped. I  am  informed  that a  few  copies were  available on Saturday, when the Senate  was not in session. For all practical pur poses, it was not available until Monday,  when the Senator from North Carolina,  returning from a meeting with the Gov ernor of his State, was stranded in the  worst blizzard to hit the east coast in 40  years, along with  thousands of  fell ow  citizens. While I am delighted to begin  debate on an issue vital to the American  people, let the record show the circum stances in which the debate has begun.  Similarly, the armed services hearings  are available just today, about noon time.  The committee staff is  to be congratu lated for  the speed and diligence with  which  the hearings were  edited  and  printed. Let the record show that this  was accomplished in only 4 working days.  Needless  to say,  the other Members of  the Senate have hardly had time to be come acquainted with their contents.  Coming at the end of a long period of  public deliberation and discussion,  the  hearings of  the  committee,  although  brief,  indisputably  established  two  points:  First,  the decision  to give away  the  Panama Canal was based upon purely  political pressures in total disregard of  the defense and economic consequences  of that decision;  Second, the outward rationale of the  political decision is demonstrably false.  Whether there was a hidden rationale,  undisclosed to the public or to the Sen ate, was beyond the scope of the hear ings conducted by  the Armed Services  Committee.  The hearings were notable  for  the  quality of the testimony and the integ rity of the witnesses, most of whom hold  high offices under the U.S. Constitution,  or did hold them in the past, and par ticipated in historic events. Thus, in a  very short space of time, the committee  was able to amass an important set of  facts, hitherto undisclosed, which de serves to have a profound influence as  the Senate works  its will  on  these  treaties.  The questioning of  expert military  witnesses,  both  those who  favor  the  treaties and those who oppose them, re vealed that the Panama Canal still plays  a vital role as a catalyst in our defense  planning, and  that role  is placed  in  jeopardy by the treaties, especially the  lack of authority for unilateral military  decision and the requirement that our  military forces leave after the year 2000.  The economic aspects of the treaties are  still in total disarray, with little agree ment on future projections, except that  it is going  to cost the American  tax payer untold billions  in  appropriated  funds. Indeed, certain fundamental eco nomic  issues yet  remain  to be nego tiated. Let us  take up each aspect  in  turn.  THE MILITARY VALUE OF THE CANAL  The testimony of both Admiral Hollo way and Admiral Moorer was significant  for understanding the military value of  the canal. Admiral Moorer summed  up in one sentence:  it.  In fact, there is no feasible war plan for  the United States, taking into account our  reduced forces and extended commitments,  that does not assume that the Panama Canal  will be available for full time priority use.  Admiral Holloway's testimony pointed  out  that denial of  the canal  to  the  United States would require additional  naval forces to fulfill our defense mis sion, and those forces would have to cir cumnavigate South America, a trip that  would add 3 to 3 % weeks and 8,000 miles  to the transit. He pointed out that this  ",1978
3,Senate,95,0.304,145,3,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I would  like to take this opportunity to comment  on an important measure now pending  before the Senate Banking Committee,  and to commend my distinguished col league  from  New  Hampshire  <Mr.  McINTYRE)  for his efforts  in bringing  this legislation to the floor of the Senate.  As chairman of  the Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions, he has provided  a clear signal to all interested parties of  the continuing intention of the Federal  Government to bring about order, cer tainty, and equity in the area of State  taxation of interstate transactions being  carried out by depository  institutions.  Before  I became a Member of  this  body, I was made aware of the complex  State tax problems which arose as de pository institutions of all sizes began to  engage to a far greater degree in inter state  transactions.  I was privileged  to  serve as the vice chairman of the Ad visory Commission on Intergovernmen tal Relations while it was studying State  and local taxation of out-of-State finan cial  depositories.  From  that  vantage  point, I was able to appreciate the im portance of not discouraging the inter state flow of capital and the absolute  necessity for comprehensive Federal leg islation.  As  the demand for capital has in creased, many institutions following his toric  trade rules which allow the free  flow of commerce acroos State lines, have  participated  in lending and borrowing  activities virtually without  regard  to  State boundaries. With this great expan sion has grown a need to assure that  these activities not be subject to dupli cative or inequitable State or local taxes.  To  tolerate a patchwork of State tax  laws would allow the creation of artifl cial tariff barriers along State bound aries, a concept repugnant to our fore fathers and wholly inconsistent with the  economical and efficient growth of inter state capital markets. The concern in  the immediate sense is being expressed  by  :financial  institutions of  all  sizes  whooe lending activities go across State  lines because of their ability to supply  capital to a multistate market or due to  their  geographic  service areas which  naturally include portions of adjoining  States. As determined by the Advisory  Commission  and other  informed  ob servers, it is clear that Federal legislation  is necessary if multistate taxation is to  be carried out on an equitable and uni form basis.  Recognizing the need for national co ordination, Congress passed  in 1973 a  moratorium on State taxation to allow  our Advisory Commission  to examine  this question in detail. On May 30, 1975,  we submitted a  :final report which in cluded our :findings, the history and legal  background of the study, and our rec ommendations for a program  to deal  with multistate taxation. While that re port and supplemental information have  been under active study, the moratorium  on multistate taxation has expired. It  had been my  intention to  introduce a  bill to extend the moratorium in order  to assure that no State incorrectly as sumed that there would not be Federal  legislation in this area. I have decided  not to introduce such legislation, how ever, in light of the substantial progress  on the pending bill,  introduced, by re quest, by Senator McINTYRE.  Mr. President, I commend my distin guished colleague for his strong interest  in  this area, and  in announcing and  holding hearings on S. 1900, which is now  pending  in  the Financial  Institutions  Subcommittee of the Banking Commit tee. I  look forward to working actively  with him in an attempt to bring this bill  to the floor for early action by the full  Senate.  ",1978
4,House,95,-0.33,158,3,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Chairman, I am  offering a precautionary amendment to  this bill, H.R. 9718. I want to make ~t  clear that I do not wish to weaken this  legislation as I support the creation of  this Office ~f Consumer Representation ! am only seeking to assure that the re sponsibilities of the Congress in govern ing  the possession and use of firearms  and ammunition  remain with elected  representatives.  This amendment would prohibit the  OCR from  taking any action with the  intent or effect of restricting the manu facture, sale, or distribution of firearms,  ammunition, or components.  Most of my colleagues should recall the  problems we encountered when a Federal  court ordered  the Consumer Product  Safety Commission to consider a petition  to ban handgun ammunition as a ""haz ardous substance."" While we had spe cifically excluded firearms and ammuni tion from the definition of a ""consumer  product"" when we passed the Consumer  Product Safety Act, we had failed to ex tend this exclusion from the CPSC's ju risdiction when we charged the Commis sion with the administration of the Haz ardous Substances Act. To clarify this  predicament, the Congress was forced to  take special action in 1975 when we voted  overwhelmingly to prohibit the Commis sion from having any authority over fire arms, ammunition, and components. The  CPSC controversy was resolved.  We do not want to find ourselves in a  similar situation once the Office of Con sumer Representation is established. Ap proval of my amendment will preclude  our having to come back at a later date  to clarify our intent.  If this body desires to enact new gun  controls-which I believe it does not then it is the responsibility of Members  to stand on this floor and be r.ecorded on  their position. That responsibility should  not be circumvented by any government  action or agency. We should not have  back door gun control.  The  consumer  advocacy  legislation  that has been reported in the other body  already contains precautionary language  similar to this amendment.  I believe that my colleagues recognize  their  responsibilities as elected  repre sentatives and I urge adoption of my  amendment.  ",1978

8,House,95,-0.562,158,3,Mr. ROSENTHAL.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman,  I  sense  that  this  amendment is going to carry; and I am  very much aware that the chairman of  the committee, who has expressed his  own personal  interest in the principal  subject, is going to accept the amend ment.  However, Mr. Chairman, I would hope  that in reading the legislative history of  this bill-and it may well be that with in  the  intervening  responsibility  and  mandate of the consumer advocate that  this is not one of the subjects which they  ought to be interested in-I would cer tainly hope that no one reading the leg islative history  in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD would assume that the House en gaged in a public-policy debate on this  issue and made a  judgment as to fire arms so as to exclude responsibility here.  I think what we are trying to do, on  the assumption that this amendment is  going to carry, is to narrowly interpret  the role and responsibility of the consu mer advocate, so that firearms is not one  of the areas in which they would inter vene, on the theory that there are hun dreds of other issues bearing on health,  economic interests, and safety that would  take a higher priority.  But at the same time the House has  made no judgment or decision as to the  wisdom or lack of wisdom of individual  citizens being engaged in some sort of  use of firearms.  ",1978

10,House,95,0.3,158,3,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman,  those who deal in Government excess at  the expense of the taxpayer-and of the  consumer-have asked us  to consider  again  the  old  consumer  protection  agency bill. I hope  the House will see  that it is a bad idea whose time still has  not come, and hopefully never will.  It is true that we have a new wrinkle  this time, a substitute bill which the bill's  most ardent supporters have brought us  in circumvention of the committee proc ess. Among other things, the substitute  gives the proposed agency a new name,  Office of Consumer Representation.  I  suppose  that  the  deescalation  from  ""agency"" to ""office'' is supposed to fool  us into thinking that the ambitions of  the sponsors has attenuated. I do not  think the House is quite that naive.  But the name change does have  its  advantages. I have always felt the term,  Agency for Consumer Protection, was a  misnomer. The proposed agency has no thing to do with protecting consumers  from unfair treatment by private busi ness-a kind of Government Better Busi ness Bureau to which consumers could  take their complaints. It is instead a new  superagency empowered  to  take other  Federal agencies to court in the alleged  consumer interest. As such,  the name,  Office of Consumer Representation,  is  more appropriate. But it would suffer  from the same inherent difficulty of sort ing out one overriding consumer interest  from the multiple interests of all con sumers. Some of us want economy, while  others prefer luxury, safety, durability,  or style. I do not believe we can create an  agency that can replace the free market  in catering to these varied tastes.  The  proponents  of  this  substitute  proudly note that they would save $7  million by eliminating the existing con sumer offices which now serve each agen cy by watching for consumer concerru;.  But none of us are so naive as to believe  that the $15 million first year cost will  remain at that level for long. If this new  agency does not grow more quickly than  Government revenues and the gross na tional product, it will be the first that  did not. Besides, are we sure that elimi nating the existing consumer offices  is  the best way to serve the American con sumer? We are now considering, by way  of a bill <H.R. 8588)  reported by  the  Committee on Government Operations,  creation of an Office of Inspector General  of each Federal department,  following  the theory that ferreting out fraud the  abuse should be of continuing concern in  each department. The same logic may  apply as well to the consumer offices. I  am not sure we want to take concern for  the consumer out of the hands of each  department. That should be their con tinuing responsibility as well.  ",1978

12,House,95,0.315,171,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I am just going to take  a moment to comment on the observa tion of the gentleman from Texas th.alt  the National Labor Relations Board does  not have the authority to involve itself  in determining wages, hours, or terms  and conditions of employment.  That may traditionally have been true.  I hope it will continue to be true. The  gentleman has not recalled to the mem bers of the committee the fact that this  House  just  recently passed  a  bill  change the traditional role of the Na tional Labor Relations Board under the  NLRA;  and  the bill  that passed  this  House, if it becomes law, gives the Nato  tional Labor Relations Board the very au thority that is involved here, the setting  of wages, hours, and fringe benefits.  Mr. Chairman, I would say, in light of  what this House has done to possibly in volve the National Labor Relations Board  in directly setting wages and hours that  directly affect the consumer and the cost  of production, we ought to have the con sumer representative in there to be heard.

14,House,95,-0.422,184,3,Mr. DRINAN.," Mr. Chairman, as  a  member of the Government Operations  Committee, I rise in enthusiastic support  of the Brooks substitute to H.R. 6805. The  Consumer Representation  and Reor ganization Act of 1977, H.R. 9718, was  introduced by the gentleman from Tex as <Mr. BROOKS)  as a compromise sub stitute  for H.R.  6805,  the Consumer  Protection Act of 1977. H.R. 9718 meets  the major objections raised by critics of  the original bill, without sacrificing the  principle of giving consumers an estab lished and eft'ective voice in the Federal  Government. Passage of this legislation  would be a major landmark in the his tory of the consumer protection move ment.  H.R. 9718 would establish an omce of  Consumer Representation as an  inde pendent executive agency. This agency  would be delegated several  tasks,  in cluding  study  of  consumer  interests,  needs,  and problems;  support of  re search into consumer products and serv ices; dissemination of consumer  inf or mation;  submission of annual  recom mendations to Congress and the Presi dent; and, most importantly, represen tation of the interests of consumers in  the proceedings of Federal agencies and  courts.  Simple  justice  requires  that such a  consumer advocate be created. Numer ous studies have shown that businesses  are thoroughly represented before Fed eral agencies, while all too often con sumers  lack  the organization and re sources to press their own interests ef fectively. Because of this imbalance of  influence, regulatory agencies frequently  fail  to adequately  consider  consumer  needs---in fact, they are often dominated  by the very industries they were meant  to regulate. The result can be reduced  competition, higher prices, and danger ous products.  We would not think of denying repre sentation to one party in a judicial pro ceeding; and if they cannot provide their  own advocate, the Government supplies  one. The proposed Oftlce of Consumer  Representation is no more radical than  the system of public defenders in crim inal cases. It would simply extend the  same  basic  equity  to  administrative  proceedings.  The concept of an  institutionalized  consumer advocate is not untested, either.  Twenty-six States already have estab lished such offices. In my own Common wealth of Massachusetts,  the attorney  general's oftlce contains a utilities sec tion which represents consumers before  State regulatory commissions and can  seek judicial review of decisions harmful  to them. Partly as a result of these ef forts, the Massachusetts Department of  Public Utilities awarded rate increases  almost $190 million less than had been  requested over the past 2 % years. The  Ofllce of Consumer Protection, which  would have powers similar to the Massa chusetts body, could yield even more im pressive results at the Federal level.  In fact,  there is already a dramatic  example of the eft'ectiveness of consumer  advocacy at the national level. The Gen eral Services Administration represents  the U.S. Government's own interest as a  consumer in certain State and Federal  proceedings. The cost of this interven tion during fiscal year 1977 was $882,000.  The estimated savings that have resulted  from these activities since 1975 are $104  million.  Many of the criticisms of the original  bill have been met in  the compromise  substitute. The Ofllce of Consumer Rep resentation's powers of discovery before  Federal agencies and judicial review of  their decisions would be no greater than  those of any private business. It would  not have the power to compel businesses  to respond to written interrogatories. It  would also have no authority to create  product testing laboratories or regional  offices.  The OCR would be authorized to rep resent the interests of small businesses  as well as consumers, and would be re quired to report to Congress on the eft'ect  which its intervention has on the efll ciency of regulatory agencies.  Those who charge that the Ofllce of  Consumer Representation would become  a huge bureaucracy burdening the tax payer are simply mistaken. The OCR's  $15 million budget  is very modest. In  fact, $11.6 million of that will be trans ferred from other agencies which already  have consumer ofllces, and the Oftlce of  Management and Budget will be required  to cut an additional $10 million from  existing programs which would duplicate  the functions of the OCR. Therefore, pas sage of  this  legislation would actually  result in a net saving of several million  dollars annually.  There is also no reason to believe the  Office of Consumer Representation would  inevitably grow to massive proportions,  as some have charged. The largest agen cies are generally those which regulate,  grant money, or contract out-the OCR  would have none of  these powers. It  would function as an advocate only-and  an advocate need not be large to be eft'ec tive. In addition,  this bill contains an  innovative ""sunset"" clause, -which means  that the OCR would end after 5 years  unless specifically extended by Congress  after a review of its performance.  Those who consider the Office of Con sumer Representation to be simply an other regulatory agency are turning its  purpose on its head. It would actually  function as a watchdog over regulatory  agencies, seeking to influence their deci sions and reporting to Congress on regu lations which conflict with each other or  with legislative intent. This service would  reduce bureaucratic ""red tape,"" not add  to it.  Some have suggested  that consumer  interests would be served just as well by  creating special omces within Federal  agencies, rather than one central ofllce  for the entire Government. However, no  employee can be purely objective in over seeing his or her employer-only  the  presence of an independent advocate can  insure the fairness of agency proceedings.  It has also been suggested that con sumers should rely on private represen tation just as businesses do, rather than  having a government agency provided for  them. Such an argument neglects  the  reality that consumers rarely have the  financial and organizational resources to  compete eft'ectively with large corpora tions. It also overlooks the fact that the  Federal Government already has a $1. 7  ",1978
15,House,95,-0.35,197,3,Mr. ASHLEY.," Mr. Speaker, as many  of our colleagues know, the White House  Conference  on  Balanced  National  Growth and Economic Development has  just concluded here in Washington, D.C.  For 4  days,  citizens  from  across  the  country-and observers from other na tions-gathered to discuss the basic is sues of growth and development and  their effect on American society. Par ticipating were representatives of State,  local,  and  the  Federal Government,.  business and  industry, women, minor ity and underprivileged groups. Perhaps  most important, however, was  that,  in  their totality, these individuals became  a homogenous cross section of America  itself.  Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris of  the Department of Housing and Urban  Development addressed the Conference  participants on Wednesday, February 1,  Recognizing the diversity of backgrounds  of Conference participants, and the fact  that there was not even a common defi nition of the phrase ""balanced national  growth and economic development,"" Sec retary Harris discussed certain basic con cepts which must form the core of any  discussion of these issues. Among these  are that we cannot ignore  the special  needs of minorities, of women, and of  urban areas.  She related the work of the Confer ence  to President Carter's Urban and  Regional Policy Group, which she chairs,  and to the five fundamental policy ob jectives developed by the Secretary and  Assistant to the President Stuart Eizen stat and recently signed off on by the  President. These are:  First. To meet emergency needs of  communities md people in distress-par ticularly the job requirements of young  unemployed persons in central cities;  Second. To stabilize or strengthen the  private sector economic base for all ur ban areas;  Third. To make cities more livable by  curbing the deterioration of capital in frastructure,  improving and expanding  housing  stock,  and better addressing  street crime:  Fourth. To improve the fiscal condition  o! urban areas to increase the competi ti.vc attractiveness; and  Fifth. To strengthen efforts to elimi nate discrimination and encourage equal  opportunity.  These objectives should be the prin ciples upon which  balanced national  growth and economic development are  founded. Perhaps Secretary Harris said  it best when she asked the Conference  delegates to resist the temptation to view  our urban problems, our growth problems  and our social problems narrowly and  simply  in  terms of economic develop ment, an approach which assumes that  this one section of our incredibly com plex society is capable of providing the  ""fuel to make the social engine move.""  The Secretary is con-ect in stating that  the neighborhood and community values  we hold dearest require more  than a  nearby factory or office building to give  them  life. As  the Secretary said,  the  great challenge  to this administration  and to Congress ""is to bring into har mony the interests of the business sector  driven by profit and  the competitive  E:thic, and the interests of the commu nity, motivated by a search for stability  and concerns about the quality of neigh borhood life.""  Mr. Speaker, we can all benefit from  what I hope will be a continuing discus sion of balanced national growth and  economic development. While the White  House Conference has concluded, I would  like to see its recommendations thought fully considered as Congress begins its  cc;nsideration of an urban policy.  Secretary Harris has done much  to  focus our attention on these matters, and  I am inserting her speech in the RECORD:  REMARKS OF PATRICIA RoBERTS HARRIS  Mr. Chairman and Delegates,  I welcome  this opportunity to address President Car ter's town meeting on National Growth and  Economic Development.  Balanced National Growth and Economic  Development are concepts with broad  im plications affecting a wide variety of critical  issues. There is no agreed upon definition  of what these concepts mean and the diver sity of backgrounds of the delegates to this  Convention suggest that these concepts, in  fact, have different meanings to the different  people in this town meeting.  Today, I would like to address the needs  of an often forgotten constituency and  I  would like to request that their special needs  not be overlooked as you proceed with your  work and help this Administration develop  National Economic Policies that will provide  healthy and sustained economic growth for  this country.  Today, I would like to speak of the special  needs of minorities, of women, and of urban  areas, and I want  to underscore  the fact  that balanced growth must mean that these  special groups in these specific areas will re ceive a fair share of the benefits that result  from sustained economic development.  Let me first address the topic of balanced  national growth as  I  see  it  through my  Housing and Urban Development lenses.  The  tie between  the way  in which we  address the overall growth and development  of the Nation and its effect on the present  health and future prospects for the Nation's  urban pla.ces---especially our major cities--is  evident. I believe  the viability o! the Na tion's cities is a critical factor-perhaps the  most critical !actor-in assuring  the con tinuation of this Nation's economic vitality  and the quality o! life !or its people.  Yet, many of America's larger, older cities  are far from healthy. They are experiencing  the severe problems---of physical decay, en vironmental  pollution,  crime,  population  and  job  loss, economic decline, disinvest ment, and deteriorating neighborhoods.  These are problems which affect the lives  of us all, no matter where we choose to live.  They are related significantly  to  the fact  that this Nation is growing-and that in the  absence of a coherent national growth pol icy-that growth is having a negative effect  on the areas which are left behind by the  market.  All existing urban pla.ces--whether Frost belt or Sunbelt, large or small-are caught  in the wake of the dynamic growth forces  of the last two decades.  Many of our lagging cities in the North east and industrial midwest can trace their  urban problems to the massive post World  War II migration of rural and unskilled pop ulations from the rural South, accompanied  by an outmigration of largely middle class  residents.  This  dramatizes  the  doubled barreled impact of unbalanced growth and  development, and underscores the need for  a national policy perspective on this ques tion  before  the  conditions  become  too  extreme.  Our Nation ls a network intricately linked  by  its diverse urban places and commu nities-and, the cities are the central glue  which hold our complex  society  together.  Each of the urban places along this network  also is complex in its human, physical, eco nomic and political dimensions. The sound ness of America's health will depend on the  strength of  this urban network and  the  health of each of its urban places.  Clearly, there are significant urban prob lems  along  this network which must be  addressed., by  this conference and by  this  Administration.  I am pleased to inform you that initial  action has been taken and that the Presi dent has approved the statement of principle  and objectives developed by the Urban and  Regional Polley Group.  This represents the Carter Administration's  downpayment on a  cohesive and rational  urban policy.  The  five  interrelated  policy  objectives  which were approved by the President are:  To meet emergency needs of communities  and people in distress--partlcularly the job  requirements of young unemployed persons  in central cities;  To stabilize or strengthen the private sec tor economic base for all urban areas;  To make cities more  livable by curbing  the deterioration of capital  infrastructure,  improving and expanding housing stock, and  better addressing street crime;  To improve the fiscal condition of urban  areas to increase their competitive attractive ness; and  To strengthen efforts to eliminate discrimi nation and encourage equal opportunity.  In the coming months, we will articulate  these objectives in greater detail, present the  principals underlying them, and, most im portantly, outline the specific programs to  meet the objectives.  The Carter Administration recognizes both  the severity of the problems of urban areas  and the real limitation of the Federal Gov ernment's resources. This understanding has  led to the recognition that Federal aid must  be properly targeted to the areas of greatest  need.  It is clear that this Conference must also  address these concerns, and it must ask and  answer numerous questions relating to the  Federal Government's role  in creating Job  opportunity and assisting specific popula tions and specific areas which are currently  excluded  from  the  benefits  of  economic  growth.  It is instructive to ask what is the public  attitude toward  these questions.  ",1978
16,,95,0.269,210,3,Mr. BROYHILL.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to call the attention of my colleagues  to a bill I have introduced to help in crease the flow of venture capital into  small,.  growth-oriented  enterprises  throughout the country. H.R. 10717, in troduced Thursday, February 2, with  the cosponsorship of three of my col leagues on the Consumer Protection and  Finance Subcommittee, would  amend  the Securities Act of 1933 and the In vestment Company Act of 1940 so as to  encourage investments in small business  concerns. The  shortage of  funds  for  small, growing businesses  is something  about which I am very concerned since  it is  the venture enterprises of  today  that will offer price competition, prod uct innovation and employment which  will be so vitally needed  to keep our  economy healthy in years to come.  To illustrate the gravity of the prob lem,  I . quote  from  the January 1977  ""Report of the SBA Task Force on Ven ture and Equity Capital for Small Busi ness"" which was  chaired  by  former  Securities  and Exchange Commission  Chairman, Bill Casey:  It is alarming that venture and expansion  capital for new and growing businesses has  become almost  invisible  in America  today.  In 1972  there were 418 underwritings  for  companies with a net worth of  less  than  $5,000,000.  In  1975  there were  four  such  underwritings. The 1972 offerings raised $918  million. The 1975 offerings brought in $16  million. Over  that  same period of  time,  smaller offerings under  the Securities and  Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation A  fell  from $256 million  to $49 million and  many of them were unsuccessful. While this  catastrophic  decline  was  occurring,  the  money  raised  for  all  corporations  in  the  public security markets increased almost 50  percent from $28 billion to over $41 billion.  My bill would do four things to help  reduce existing  impediments  to  small  company financing. First, the SEC reg ulation A small offering ceiling would be  raised from $500,000 to $3,000,000. Cur rently, given high  fixed costs-mostly  legal fees-it is not economic to make  an offering at $500,000 so that regula tion A is of very little use.  H.R. 10717 would also amend SEC rules  144 and 146 so that venture capitalists  and small off erors would be able to oper ate with greater certainty and flexibil ity. Rule 144 currently allows a venture  capital inventor to sell a  total, in each  6-month period, of only 1 percent of the  outstanding shares of that type. Since  a venture investor may hold a large share  of a small company, the ""trickle-out"" pe riod under the Rule 144 provision can be  very great. <For example, if an investor  holds 20 percent of the common stock of  a portfolio C'OIIlpany, the complete sale of  ",1978
17,,95,0.533,223,3,Mr. BAUMAN.," Mr. Speaker, as all of  my colleagues in this body are well aware,  the debate in the other body over the  ratification of the Panama Canal treaties  is scheduled to begin today. Unfortunate ly, in my opinion, the public debate lead ing up to the final consideration of these  treaties has been distorted and made con fused by a number of misrepresentations  and exaggerated claims by  those who  support the treaties. These parties are so  eager to insure the ratification of these  treaties that they are willing to overlook  or to risk the very grave dangers these  treaties represent to the economic vital ity of all American port cities.  Under the administration of the United  States, the Panama Canal has offered a  vital service to all shipping nations with out political discrimination and at a quite  reasonable charge. This service has been  so  important  to all port communities  throughout the world and to the .people  who gain their livelihoods as a result of  the international shipping trade that it  would be extremely difficult to imagine  the true level of its value. The Maryland  Port Authority, in my home State, has  stated recently that ""the importance of  the Panama Canal  the  continued  growth and viability of the port of Balti more cannot be overstated."" The very  real concern in Baltimore and, indeed, in  all east coast port cities, is that an un stable operation in the canal or an arbi trary increase in the toll charges would  divert Far East shipping away from the  canal to alternative routes and methods  of transportation.  These concerns are well justified when  considering  the  treaties. The probable  consequences of the ratification of these  treaties were discussed  recently by  a  to  ",1978

I highly commend him for his  efforts in that respect.  ",1978
19,House,95,-0.387,249,3,Mr. UDALL.," Madam Chairman, I am  here to join in supporting H.R. 3813a bill to expand the Redwood National  Park in the State of California.  As you undoubtedly know, since the  Redwood National Park was created in  theit I  tained  1968, there has been a great deal of con cern about the effect of timbering activi ties in areas upstream and adjacent to  the park. It is generally agreed that what  takes place on these lands can, and does,  directly affect the values for which the  park was created.  ,,  H.R. 3813 addresses this issue by pro viding for the expansion of the existing  park to include some of the remaining  unprotected prime redwood lands. It also  attempts  to  assure protection of  the  park against activities that would seri ously impair the preservation of this out standing virgin forest.  The Committee on Interior and Insular  Affairs,  in  response  to  a  tremendous  effort by our colleague from California  (Mr. PHILLIP BURTON)' has attempted to  take all  factors  into consideration.  I  cannot give too much credit to the un tiring efforts of Mr. BURTON who has  spent countless days and hundreds of  hours in trying to resolve all of the ditn cult problems involved.  The bill provides for  the acquisition  of the best remaining virgin redwoods  and for the purchase of such lands as  are deemed essential to the preservation  of the park. Altogether it provides for  the purchase of 48,000 acres. In addition,  another 30,000 acres of critical concern  are subject  to secretarial scrutiny so  that if any particular parcels are threat ened with activities which would jeop ardize the future of the park, then the  Secretary can take steps to acquire those  areas and manage them in accordance  with multiple use principles taking into  consideration protection of park values.  To relieve the pressures on the local  economies, the bill makes a special effort  to assure employment and compensation  to workers directly affected by the ex pansion. We owe  the gentleman from  California a  real debt of gratitude for  developing  solutions  to  these difficult  aspects of the problem.  In short, Madam Chairman, we have  attempted to bring forth a bill which can  assure the people of America of having  a Redwood National Park worthy of the  name. We think it is a good effort and a  worthwhile  cause. Everyone may not  agree with all details of the legislation,  but it certainly warrants your careful  consideration and, I believe, your sup port.

The Clerk read as follows:  Mr. McCLoRY moves that the Managers on  the part of the House at the conference on  the disagreeing vote of the two Houses on  H.R. 7843 be instructed to insist on retaining  section 6 of the bill as passed by the House,  which relates to the merit selection of dis trict judges.  The SPEAKER. The gentleman from  Illinois <Mr. McCLORY)  is recognized for  1 hour.  Mr. McCLORY. Mr.  Speaker,  last  Tuesday we agreed to a motion to suspend  the rules and pass H.R. 7843 by a vote  of 319 to 80. In the main the arguments  against  the bill were procedural-that  the bill should not have been brought to  the :floor under the suspension procedure.  The purpose of my motion is not to re open the entire bill but to permit the  Members of  this body  to express their  views with regard  to  the sole  issue of  merit selection of district judges. Since  a separate vote was not permitted under  last Tuesday's procedure, it is not incon ceivable that some Senators might sug gest that the overwhelming vote in favor  of the bill was actually a vote in favor  of judgeships and not a vote in favor of  merit selection. I have made my prefer ential motion in order to anticipate that  argument.  The merit  selection  amendment  to  H.R. 7843 was authorized by the gentle man from Ohio <Mr. SEIBERLING)' the  gentleman  from Kentucky  <Mr. MAz zou), and myself. In fact even before  the judgeship bill had been introduced,  I introduced H.R. 7471, a bill to provide  for merit selection of Federal judges.  This provision of the omnibus judge ship bill  is of paramount  importance.  The bill augments the Federal judiciary  by 30 percent and district courts by over  25 percent. Never before in our history  have we  in one bill created so many  judgeships. The men and women ap pointed to these positions will alter the  course of justice in this country for years  to come. Can we  trust so awesome a  responsibility  to  cronies and political  hacks?  I  think not. Lifetime appoint ments should deserve greater care than  ""politics as usual"" allows.  I think it is time to give the President  some backbone in fulfilling his campaign  promise of 1976:  All  federal  judges .  .  . should  be  ap pointed strictly on the basis of merit with out any consideration of political aspect or  influence. We can no longer afford to treat  the  administration of  justice as political  patronage.  I could not have said it better. If the  House holds fast to this provision, the  only losers will be  the campaign man agers and buddies of U.S. Senators who  all too often have the inside track. Can didates of true merit who have no politi cal pull will no longer be embarrassed  into silence. When they come forward,  the beneficiaries will be all the American  people.  I  think the issue is clear. We debated  the matter last Tuesday. But if other  Members wish to comment further, I will  be happy  to yield but for purposes of  debate only.  Mr. Speaker,  I yield  to  the distin guished gentleman  from New  Jersey,  the chairman of  the committee  (Mr.  Ronrno), for debate only.  ",1978

27,House,95,0.218,327,3,Mr. CLEVELAND.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday the House defeated by a vote of  189  to 227  legislation which sought to  create a new Federal Consumer Protec tion Agency. I joined with a majority of  my  colleagues  in voting  against  the  measure.  First of all, my position on this issue  stems from a belief that we can improve  the existing Government structure  to  provide consumers with the representa tion they need, rather than resorting to  the reflex action of adding another Fed eral agency as a panacea for every prob lem. Allegations that pressure from big  business was the impetus behind the op position are absolutely unfounded as far  as I am concerned. As a matter of fact,  the most intense lobbying pressures I en countered were from  the White House  and  from Ralph Nader's nickel cam paign.  Secondly, H.R. 9718 contained broad  exemptions  for  labor and agriculture  proceedings. These issues can substan tially affect consumer interests. Consum ers adversely affected by labor disputes  would have no  recourse  through  this  agency. Although  exemptions  for na tional security are well justified, the la bor and agriculture exclusions violate  concepts of fundamental fairness.  Furthermore, a single consumer agen cy would be limited in its ability to act in  all administrative proceedings affecting  consumers and would have to select ma jor causes and concentrate on them.  The Glickman-Leach substitute, al though rejected by the House, had the  virtue of providing consumer representa tion  in Government proceedings with out creating another Federal agency.  For this reason, I voted in favor of this  substitute. It would have established in dividual  consumer  counsels  in  each  agency which could intervene in agency  actions on behalf of consumer interests.  This type of decentralization would re tain the consumer focal point in each  agency and permit  the utilization of  agency expertise, enabling a variety of  consumer issues to be addressed, rather  than a few major ones. In addition, since  the substitute sought to build on exist ing consumer offices, it hac! the advan tage of being more economical than H.R.  9718.

28,House,95,0.167,327,3,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker, the sky rocketing costs of our children's educa tion has created a very real problem for  the future of American education. As a  result. I am introducing legislation de signed to allow taxpayer's to deduct one half of the tuition they pay up to $300  for any elementary or secondary school,  vocational school, college or university.  There is no more important goal in the  United States than providing broad ed ucational opportunities to our children.  But, spiraling costs threaten to put ed ucation out of the reach of many. The  hardest hit are middle income families.  They are unable to pay the high costs  and seldom do they qualify for Federal  financial aid.  A tax credit for tuition expense is one  of the most effective ways to get financial  relief to middle-income families. Under  my bill, a  tax credit, a sum subtracted  from income taxes to be paid, is available  for 50 percent of tuition costs up to a  maximum of $300 per year for each stu dent.  In addition to being a most effective  method, a  tax credit approach will be  easy to administer and will not require  heavy  administrative  expenses which  take away from the assistance itself.  Nonpublic elementary and secondary  schools will also benefit from the tuition  tax credit. As private institutions have  shrinking enrollments, it places an in creasing burden upon our public educa tion  system. Furthermore,  this  trend  threatens  to disrupt  the  freedom of  choice of the American people. A look  at the day school enrollment in Kent  County and Ionia County, Mich., dem onstrates  the great burden  to be ab sorbed by all taxpayers should private  schools disappear:  1977 day school enrollment, K-12  Public Nonpublic  Kent County _____________ 99, 347  Ionia County ____________ 13, 083  17,252  954  President Carter recently announced  his program for student assistance but it  did not go far enough in helping middle income families keep pace with the soar ing costs of college  tuition. The plan  which Carter outlined would  lead  to  further  administrative  nightmares,  would include parents who pay tuition  for their children to attend K-12 classes  at nonpublic schools and would do noth ing  to alleviate  the heavy tax burden  being placed on middle-income Ameri caru; by the Carter administration.  Finally, as a father who put four chil dren through college, I know first hand  of a parent's desire to provide their chil dren with meaningful education oppor tunities. The tax credit will benefit par ents, students and it should also make  our schools better and  the quality of  education which they give.  I look forward to actively working for  passage of tuition relief in 1978.  LEGISLATION RESTRICTING UNSO LICITED  COMMERCIAL  PHONE  CALLS TO INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIB ERS  ",1978
29,House,95,-0.139,327,3,Mr. WHALEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to  join with more  than 80 of  my colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 9505.  This bill seeks to give individual residen tial  telephone subscribers  the right  to  restrict  unsolicited  commercial  tele phone calls from entering their homes.  In a  letter from San Jose, Calif.,  the author of the bill, Congressman As PIN, a citizen wrote:  to  Today, for  the first a.nd, your legislation  permitting, I hope Ia.st time, I wa.s a.wakened  from  a.  plea.sa.nt afternoon na.p  to hea.r  a.  telephoned voice command:  ""Please,  listen  carefully! This  is a.  recorded message  .  .  .  a.nd we wa.nt you  this point.  enraged, I slammed down the phone. Wha.t  a.n utterly obnoxious,  rude,  incredible  trusion into a.n afternoon! The idea. tha.t I  should be a.wakened to listen to a. ma.chine  is really the la.st straw .... ""  to .... "" At  in This  is  just one of several hundred  comments concerned citizens have been  ma.king  in regard  to unsolocited com mercial telephone calls. According to the  U.S.  Institute of Marketing, about 12  million phone numbers are dialed com mercially each day. Of  the 7 million  reached, 4.2 million people immediately  hang up, without listening to the spiel.  Thus, only about 2.8 million listen, of  which only 460,000 buy the product being  advertised <at an average order cost of  $60) . This means that each day 1 out  of every 16 homes is objecting to unso licited commercial calls.  In terms of money being spent in this  industry, Senator WENDELL ANDERSON has  estimated that ""at least $4 billion of the  $17.5 billion business spends annually for  telephone service  involves calls  to sell  or buy."" Also, Mr. AsPIN has suggested  that to imagine the scale of this intrusion  into our home lives, count the number of  pieces of unsolocited mail received each  day. Then imagine being called to the  telephone that many times to be greeted  by an unsolicited advertising pitch.  ",1978

",1978
34,Senate,95,0.322,366,3,Mr. DOLE.," I  think the second ques tion is-and I know it has been very dif ficult. There are some political overtones.  I have read about what will happen to  senator BAKER and Senator DOLE, what  will happen to the treaties. We are all  aware of that. But I think the Senator  from Tennessee has addressed the ques tion in the proper way. Our responsibility  is to the American people, not to a polit ical party. Our responsibility is to make  a determination. And it is a very close  call, as the Senator from Tennessee has  indicated.  I guess the Senator from Kansas, hav ing made some suggestions and having  still others to suggest during the course  of the debate, would hope, and he has  no reason not to hope, that the distin guished minority leader, as well as the  distinguished majority  leader-because  I know both men struggled mightily with  the decision. It is not an easy decision.  As  the distinguished majority  leader  said earlier, if we  took a poll, it would  be a very easy decision. But we are called  upon to do more than tabulate.  I commend both the leaders for arriv ing at that decision. I may not agree with  it totally, but I agree with it. They have  struggled and they have tried and they  have made their decision.  I guess the question, then, is if other  amendments are offered that have merit  and that would improve the treaties in  the interest of this country and the Re public of Panama, would  the minority  leader be in a position to support those  amendment.s?

37,Senate,95,-0.216,418,3,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, on  numerous occasions I have stated that  there are a number of questions raised  the Panama Canal  treaties which  have not been satisfactorily answered.  National security concerns which have  rightly been given  the most attention  are now being addressed  through  the  amendment process. Some of the flaws  so apparent in the ambiguous language  of the Neutrality Treaty are now the ob ject of remedial action, although these  corrective measures may still be insuffi cient.  But there are other issues that have  emerged from the debate. Some of those  involve the ultimate cost of the Panama  Canal treaties to the American taxpayer.  Testimony last week before the ArmP.d  Services Committee was  particularly  troublesome for it suggested that con trary to the repeated assertions of the  administration, American citizens might  be saddled with heretofore unsuspected  and unjustifiable costs over the next 22  years, a.nd beyond.  Let us consider for a moment the value  of the asset we are giving to the Repub lic of Panama. A very conservative valu ation  for  interest purposes places  the  value at $319 million. The tota1 replace ment value, however, is $8.5 billion. Pan ama will also receive anywhere from $50  to $70 million per year from a combina tion of increased tolls and annuity pay ments. Finally-although it is not a for mal part of the treaty-Panama will re ceive loan guarantees and credit of up  to $295 million. This is above and beyond  the $331.5 million in economic foreign  aid Panama has already received from  the United States.  The  information  presented  at  the  Armed Services hearings,  particularly  from Governor Parfitt,  suggests  that  there may be some hidden costs about  which we have not been informed. More  importantly, he pointed out  that  the  United States may be unwittingly accept ing substantial further financial obliga tions.  I was particularly disturbed to discover  that some Panamanian officials believe  that the $10 million optional payment to  Panama provided for in article XIII of  the Panama Canal Treaty which is sup i:;.osed to come from surplus revenues, will  actually accumulate so that on the date  we are supposed to leave their country, we  shall owe them a $220 million lump sum  payment. I find this incredible. The ad ministration assures us that this inter pretation is incorrect. If so, surely they  can support the clarifying amendment  which  I  now  offer.  Simply  put,  the  amendment  adds  language  to  article  XIII to the effect that the United States  is not committed to any lump sum pay ment to Panama at the expiration of the  Panama Canal Treaty. I do not believe  that the American people are in a mood  to pay more millions of their tax dollars  for the privilege of giving up the canal.  I hope my colleagues agree that '.ve need  to guard against this eventuality.  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi dent, to have the text of the amendment  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the amend ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  AMENDMENT No. 32  At  the end of paragraph 4(c) of article  XIII, add  the following:  ""Nothing  in  this  subparagraph may be construed to commit  the United States of America  to make any  payment to the Republic of Panama after t!-ie  date of the terminatio::i of this Treaty."".

TRIBUTE TO CLIFTON UTLEY  ",1978
41,Senate,95,0.099,431,3,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, Clifton  Utley, a  truly gifted and accomplished  news broadcaster and commentator who  passed away recently in Hawaii, will be  long-remembered by his many friends  and admirers in Chicago and through out the Nation.  His long career as a radio and televi sion newsman made him a mainstay of  the Chicago journalistic community. He  was well-liked and well-known to count less Chicagoans who looked to him for  interpretation as well as facts about the  news of the day.  Most  of  all, Clifton Utley  ranked  among that select group of  journalists  who achieve notoriety and  respect as  commentators. He was  an  extremely  well-educated and well-informed citizen.  His voice of reason and insight, which  he expressed especially well in the field  of foreign affairs, brought a special di mension to broadcasting in Chicago.  As we pay tribute to this outstanding  professional and valued friend, we extend  our deepest sympathy to Clifton Utley's  gifted and beloved wife, Frayn, and the  entire Utley family.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that articles about Clifton Utley  from the Chicago Tribune and the Chi ca.go Daily News  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the articles  were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  to  [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 21, 1978)  NEWSCASTER CLIFTON UTLEY DIES AT 73  Clifton Utley, one of the first newscasters  and  commentators on Chicago  television,  died Friday in Hawaii at the age of 73.  Utley, who was born in Chicago and spent  most of his working  life here, moved  Hawaii in 1971.  He died  in Maui Memorial Hospital  in  Kahului on the island of Maui. He was ad mitted there on Jan. 7 suffering from a heart  condition.  Utley's son Garrick  is a  newsman with  NBC  television. His daughter-in-law Carol  Marin is a news anchorwoman with WSM TV, an NBC affiliate in Nashville.  Utley's wife, Frayn, was also an NBC com mentator in Chicago and was a member of  the Chicago Board of Education  in  the  1940s and 1950s.  Besides being a newscaster and commen tator, Utley was considered an authority on  foreign affairs. He served as a director of the  Chicago Council on Foreign Relations  for  11 years and was active as a  lecturer on  foreign affairs.  Utley also helped campaign for  local in dependent and Republican candidates during  the 1950s. He  supported  !und-raising ef forts for independent Ald. Leon Depres [5th]  and later endorsed Robert Merriam, Republi can candidate for mayor of Chicago in 1955.  In 1952 he attempted unsuccessfully  mediate a conc111ation between feuding Sen.  Paul Douglas  [D.,  Ill.]  and Gov. Adlai  Stevenson.  Before going into radio, Utley worked for  the Chicago City News Bureau, the Chicago  Daily News, and the Associated Press.  His radio career began in 1932 at WMAQ.  the city's NBC affiliate.  Utley  left  television  in 1953 because of  illness, but returned  to radio  in 1956 and  to tele;ision the following year.  He retired in 1959, but during his last year  in television he figured in a controversy over  r:::placement of local television programming  with network shows.  .  In 1958, station officials decided to cancel  Utley and other programs to extend the NBC  network's Jack Paar program.  Less  than a month later station officials  backed down and restored Utley's program,  though in an earlier time slot.  Utley is survived by his widow and three  sons, Garrick, David, and Johnathan.  to  [From the Chicago Daily News, Jan. 20, 1978]  EX-LOCAL NEWSMAN CLIFTON UTLEY DIES  Radio and  television news commentator  Clifton Utley, whose  crisp,  authoritative  voice and learned enunciation were staples  of broadcast journalism for many years, died  Thursday in a hospital in Kahului, Hawaii.

42,,95,-0.456,444,3,Mrs. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  I  would like to take special notice of the  President's decision  yesterday  to  in crease storage payments for grains held  in the farmer-owned grain reserve pro gram from 20  to 25 cents a bushel for  the major grains for the 3-year life of  the reserve.  This program is of great interest to me.  As Members of this body may know, my  husband authored the legislation which  created  the authority for  the farmer held grain reserve program. He believed  that  this program would benefit both  farmers and consumers by smoothing out  the  radical  fluctuations  that cause so  much chaos in our grain markets.  So far, farmers have not been coming  into this program as fast as hoped, pri marily because the storage payment has  not been as much as storage costs. The  5-cent increase should be adequate, giv ing our farmers sufficient reason to par ticipate in this important program.  This  seemingly  small  increase will  mean an additional $25 million yearly  for  the  farmers of Minnesota and  in  excess of $200 million for the farmers of  America-if they choose  to participate  in this program to the maximum extent  possible.  Again, I would  like to commend the  President and Secretary Bergland  for  this very constructive step.  RESOLUTION OF SOUTH CAROLINA  STATE LEGISLATURE ON LABOR  LAW REFORM (S. 1883)  ",1978
43,,95,-0.293,444,3,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, I had  the privilege earlier  today of hosting,  along with my colleague Senator THUR MOND,  a  delegation  from  the South  Carolina State Legislature which had  come to the U.S. Senate out of a sense  of alarm over a particular piece of leg islation.  That legislation is S. 1883,  the labor  law reform bill, and our State legislative  delegation delivered  to Senator THUR MOND and myself a concurrent resolution  of the South Carolina House and Senate  memorializing the U.S. Congress to re ject this bill.  I  concur  in  the  judgment of  these  elected  legislators  from  across South  Carolina  that S. 1883 would adversely  affect the economy and capital expan sion of the State of South Carolina and  other so-called Sunbelt States. The labor  law reform bill, in my opinion, would se riously  imbalance  the relationship be tween management and labor. It would  deprive workers  of  their  rights  and  would have a chilling effect on the eco nomic  development  of many  States  which are struggling  today  to expand  their industrial facilities and so improve  the well-being of all their citizens.  I appreciate the wisdom of the South  Carolina Legislature and ask unanimous  consent that its concurrent resolution to  the U.S. Congress be  included  in  the  RECORD for the benefit of my colleagues.  There being no objection, the resolu tion was ordered  to be printed in  the  RECORD, as follows:  RESOLUTION  Whereas, legislation currently pending in  the United States Senate (8-1883) would im pede the ft.ow. of capital expansion into the  Sunbelt States,  including South Carolina;  and  Whereas, the South Carolina General As sembly is vitally concerned about industrial  expansion which brings additional payrolls  for our citizens and additional tax revenues  for state and local governments; and  Whereas, the members of the General As sembly believe  that 8-1883 should not be  enacted into law as its provisions could have  the effect of hindering the economic growth  of South Carolina and other neighboring  states.  Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House  of Representatives,  the Senate concurring:  That the members of the General Assem bly hereby express their opposition to 8-1883.  Be it further resolved that copies of this  resolution be sent  to each United States  Senator from South Carolina and  to each  member of the House of Representatives of  Congress from South Carolina.  STATEMENT ON MERIT SELECTION  OF FEDERAL JUDICIAL OFFICERS  ",1978
44,,95,0.304,444,3,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, this after noon,  the House  of Representatives  passed, by a vote of 321 to 19, a motion  to instruct the House conferees on the  omnibus judgeship bill to insist on the  merit selection provision of the House  passed bill.  The House  language conditions  the  effective date of the bill on the Presi dent's  establishing  procedures  and  guidelines for the merit selection of dis trict court  judges whose positions are  created in the bill. The adoption of this  language by  the Senate-House Confer ence is a critical first step in the institu tion of merit selection procedures for all  Federal judicial officers.  In light of this House vote, I take this  occasion, once again, to invite my col leagues to cosponsor Senate Resolution  353, which I introduced on January 19,  and which has been cospansored by Sen ators STEVENS, WALLOP' and GARN. This  resolution would require the establish ment of merit selection commissions for  selection of U.S. district court  judges,  attorneys and marshals. It would set  minimum standards for  the establish ment and operation of these commis sions, while allowing much flexibility in  the tailoring of selection mechanisms by  each State's commissions.  The House vote on its merit selection  provision is proof of the overwhelming  public support for  the merit selection  concept. n should now be clear to all  concerned that the vast majority of the  American people favor  the removal of  partisanship in the appointment of Fed eral judicial officers.  I commend the House of Representa tives for this bold action, and off er spe cial tribute to Representatives RODINO,  SEIBERLING, MCCLORY, and MAZZOLI for  their outstanding leadership in this im partant matter.

48,,95,0.508,496,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. Speaker,  a  recent Denver Post editorial pinpointed  a  disturbing  irony  surrounding Colo rado farmers' income: their pay for hard  work,  long hours and intensive capital  investment is about half that of almost  anyone else in the food delivery chain  supplying the American consumer.  To gain a more thorough understand ing of why farmers are bitter about the  prices they receive for their crops, I urge  my  colleagues  to  read  this  sobering  analysis of Colorado  farmers' income:  [From  the Denver Post, October 17, 1977)  FARMERS' DWINDLING  INCOME  The true dimensions of the farmer's 1977  losses become apparent when you compa!e  incomes along the food delivery chain sup plying the American consumer.  Consider:  In 1976  the average Colorado  farmer netted $8,992  before  income  taxes.  But this year the farmer's income dropped  by about 8 per cent to near the $8,000 level.  Almost everyone else  in  the food chain  makes much more than that. Thousands of  unionized workers in the so-called ""middle man"" and retail ranks make more than twice  as much as the average farmer who grows  the food.  A  fulltime  supermarket checker  is paid  about $14,000 annually on a 40-hour-week  basis. Crank in fringe benefits and the check  er's income  is substantially greater.  The ""basic wage""  in a Denver slaughter  house, a  classification  just above common  laborer,  is $13,875 annually for 40 hours a  week. Put in fringe benefits of 30 per cent  and that basic wage comes out at $17,875double what  the  farmer  gets. And  this  doesn't include overtime, of which there is a  good deal.  Truckers hauling meat, grain and other ag ricultural products make $20,000 ""easy,"" ac cording to one industry estimate. Truckers in  the $17,000  range might be more common.  But some trucker incomes go to $30,000.  This comparison is inexact, of course. Most  wage-earners have no investment to speak of  in their occupations. A farmer  is  likely  to  have a huge capital investment in equipment  and land. In fact,  in many cases it is the  rising value of his land that enables a farmer  to keep going.  It is difficult to compare farmers' benefits  with those received by others. Farm housing  costs are likely to be lower than in an urban  area. And farmers don't get medical fringe  benefits, which brings up one of the reasons  for rising prices of food.  ""Fuel costs are staggering,"" says the man ager of a Denver food processing plant. ""But  another thing driving up prices is the fringes.  Union contracts in our plant require medical  coverage, dental coverage, vision coverage and  pensions. Legal coverage is on the way. It all  mounts up. Meanwhile, the farmer gets so cial security-and that's it.""  Middlemen under  those  contracts have  been getting raises of about 7 per cent as an  inflation allowance every year.  That must be an extremely painful sta tistic  to  the  farmer, whose  income  has  dropped this year by about 8 per cent. This  means that, in total, the farmer has fallen  behind by 15 per cent in relation to what a  supermarket butcher or checker is earning.  It doesn't really solve the inequity by say ing the farmer doesn't complain in good years  when he has it better than some other people  so why should he complain in the bad ones?  SOVIET CIVIL DEFENSE  HON. JOHN P. MURTHA  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 9, 1978  ",1978
49,,95,-0.265,496,3,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I believe  it is important to note the Soviet Union  is expanding its civil defense plan sub stantially as the following article from  Reader's Digest indicates. I insert it into  the RECORD  for the information of the  Members:  SOVIET CIVIL DEFENSE: THE GRIM REALITIES  (By John G. Hubbell)  The evidence  is unmistakable and omi nous. The Soviets have added a major civil defense component  to  their m111tary pos ture-an addition which,  in a  superpower  showdown, could prove decisive.  Item: U.S. intelligence has located, at 75  points adjacent  to  the beltway encircling  Moscow, huge steel spheres-each containing  communications centers,  emergency power  sources, sleeping areas, food and water stor age. Reserved  for  the Politburo, military  general staff and high-level Soviet bureauc racy, they have been sunk 600 feet into the  ground,  then covered with earth and  re inforced concrete. Similar shelters have been  built in and around major cities throughout  the U.S.S.R.  Item: Since the early 1960s,  the Soviets  have been dispersing  their new  industrial  complexes in widely scattered locations over  the length and breadth of Russia. Even single  factories, which in the United States would  be housed under one roof for efficiency's sake,  are divided into many buildings so separated  from one another and with machinery so  protected  that destruction would  require  numerous nuclear warheads. And every fac tory in Russia now has blast-resistant under ground shelters sufficient  to accommodate  its largest work shift.  Item: All Soviet factory workers devote at  leas'; two to four hours per month to civil defense training. Moreover, civil-defense ed ucation begins in the second grade and con tinues on a compulsory basis up to age 60.

50,,95,-0.552,509,3,Mrs. COLLINS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I wish to clarify my intentions with re spect to a resolution with which I have  become  identified as a cosponsor. This  resolution, House Concurrent Resolution  467, calls for the House to render a judg ment with respect to proper division of  the constitutional authority vested  in  the Congress ""to dispose of and make all  needful rules and regulations respecting  the territory or other property belong ing to the United States,"" with specific  reference to U.S. Government property  located within the Panama Canal Zone.  While there is no question but that the  United States does own property in the  Panama Canal Zone,  there is consider able controversy over whether the dis position of this property requires action  on the part of both Houses of the Con gress or whether the treaty ratification  procedure,  limited  to  the Senate,  by  article II, section 2 of the Constitution,  is sufficient. Without going into the com plex legal arguments, it is sufficient to  note that there are precedents to support  both interpretations, but that their ap plication to the specific case of the proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  posed Panama Canal treaties is still far  from clear.  I wish, therefore, to dissociate myself  from House Concurrent Resolution 467,  and with all due respect to my colleague,  Representative HANSEN, reserve my judg ment on this controversial issue for an other occasion.  FIVE CITED FOR EXCELLENCE BY  CUYAHOGA  COUNTY  BAR  AS SOCIATION  HON. LOUIS STOKES  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 9, 1978  ",1978
51,,95,-0.578,509,3,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to bring to  your attention and to the attention of  my colleagues in the House, five individ uals in Cleveland, Ohio, who have given  freely of their time and talents for the  betterment of our city.  These  committed  individuals  have  been selected by the Cuyahoga County  Bar Association to receive recognition at  the  association's  32d  annual  Public  Servants Merit Award  luncheon  on  February  22,  1978,  at  the Cleveland  Plaza Hotel.  The awardees are Lucille Geraci Abbot,  probation officer, Cleveland Municipal  Court; Joseph C. Brentar, deputy chief  probation officer, common pleas court;  Alex Carlino, Torrens Master,  county  recorder; Dorothy L. Englehart, secre tary,  legal  service  director,  juvenile  court; and Mary A. Oravec, chief clerk,  order department, probate court.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues  to  join me in commending these outstand ing public servants for  their dedicated  service to this community. I also take this  opportunity to single each of them out  for their accomplishments:  Mrs. Abbott joined the Cleveland Law  Department as an aide  in 1941. From  1942 to 1948 she served as a policewoman  in the city police department. Since 1950  she has served the city as a probation  officer  specializing  in  counseling  of  alcoholics. Lucille Geraci Abbott  took  certificated courses in psychology, drugs,  alcoholism and human problems and also  earned  a  law  degree  in  1941  from  Cleveland Law School. She  is married  to  John Abbott,  and has  a married  daughter, Mrs. Lucille Ann White, a  former  employee  of  the Ohio Adult  Parole Authority.  Joseph Brentar tegan hi::; public serv ice full time following receipt of degrees  from Michigan State, 1950, and Western  Reserve University, 1951. From 1948  to  1952  he had  been  employed  at  the  juvenile  court  detention  home  as  a  supervisor and as a probation officer. In  November 1952, he transferred his proba tion duties to the common pleas court  where he later advanced to position of a  supervisor.  Brentar served in the U.S. Air Force  3169  from 1943 to 1945, and was awarded an  Air Medal  for his bombing missions.  Brentar has published a book on ""Dis placed Persons"" and  is a member of  many national and international correc tional  and  probation  organizations.  Brentar is married. He and his wife, Ann,  are the parents of Joanne, 24, Gerald C.,  22, and Joseph C. Jr., 17.  Alex Carlino has been a deputy county  recorder since July 1, 1946. For the past  18 years he has assisted lawyers in solv ing the complexities of the State's torrens  laws. When Chief Deputy Recorder Wil lard Klinite became ill some 5 years ago.  County Recorder Mark McElroy elevated  Carlino to the honored position of the  County's Torrens Master. Carlino earned  4 years of military credits in World War  n through service with the 82d Division  Airborne, and the lOlst Division Gliders  for 1 year, and for 3 years as a Counter  Intelligence Corps Agent  in Australia,  New Guinea, Japan, and the Philippine  Islands.  Carlino and his wife, Antonia, are par ents of Leo, 29, Thomas, 27, Alex, 25, an('.I  Susan, 22.  Mary Oravec, chief clerk, order de partment of probate court, began her af filiation with the court upon graduation  from East High School in June 1954. She  was thoroughly trained in every detail  of the journal order division under the  tutelage of a 50-year employee, Anne.  Neeson, now retired. Her nomination by  Presiding Judge Francis J. Talty referred  to her as a ""conscientious and willing  employee of the probate court worthy of  selection for merit honors.""  Dorothy L. Englehart, a graduate of  West Tech High School, attended Cleve land College,  and began her  service  oriented career as a stenographer in the  social  service unit of Metro General  Hospital in 1941, and 1 year later was  advanced  staff  secretary  in  the  psychiatric service department. In 1945,  she began her long association with the  juvenile court as a medical secretary in  the court's detention home. In 1950, she  was promoted to a secretarial Position  with the court's criminal branch proba tion office. In 1955, she began her service  the private secretary of the court's  legal  director,  including working  for  Judge Walter Whitlatch, Judge Patrick  Gallagher, Leo Chimo, and the current  director, John J. Sweeney. Miss Engle hart has also been pressed into service as  a clerk or secretary for the courtroom  transcripts and at referee hearings.  Miss Englehart's hobbies are  travel,  photography,  the  theater, and histor ical research. She is active in the charit able programs of the Eastern Star and  the Methodist Church. She feels that her  work keeps her ""in tune"" with the real ities of life in Cuyahoga County.  Mr. Speaker,  the Cuyahoga County  Bar  Association  will  present  each  awardee with an engraved silver bowl  and a certificate of appreciation.

53,,95,0.377,548,3,Mr. SCHMITT.," While the Senate has  not been asked to consider possible alter natives to the proposed treaties, nor do I  suspect that it will be by the adminis tration, the situation presents a unique  opportunity for  this body  to step into  the future; to guide the hand of the ex ecutive  branch  toward  something  of  higher purpose and utility. My discus sions of ""Intersea"" with Americans and  Latin Americans over  the  last several  months have convinced me that the con cept of international management is also  politically acceptable and in fact would  be preferred by a majority of people here  and abroad.  The ""Intersea"" concept is a concept of  the space age and of an age of growing  awareness of certain common interna tional resources on this spaceship Earth.  We have only to think of the growing  interest  in  the deep sea  resources, of  the Antarctic resources, of the problem  of the disposal of nuclear waste, of the  potential of  tapping  the  resources of  outer space, to realize that the concept  of international management is not only  here, but may well be mandatory if we  are to move safely into the future.  ""Intersea"" would provide management  of the canal by a regional organization  for the benefit of all hemispheric nations.  It recognizes  the canal as an interna tional resource with the common heri tage of all nations. It provides for all  users of the canal to have representa tion  in decisions affecting  its use, de fense and expansion. ""Intersea"" would  be an organization tailored  to manage  the canal through a sharing of sover eignty rather than unilateral control by  any nation.  International management,  such as  ""Intersea,"" would serve as a viable an swer to one of the most complex tech nical, international, and political ques tions of our time,  the question of  the  future of the Panama Canal.  As  I pointed out earlier,  there  is a  deep concern on the part of the Ameri can people about the future of the United  States and,  in fact,  the future of  the  world. The actions we  take here with  regard to the Panama Canal are impor tant components of the future makeup  of the world. Will the United States re main  the  strong  bastion  of  freedom  that we always have been? The decision  we make on these treaties, in part, are  related  to  finding an answer  to  that  question.  Mr. President, a more detailed de scription of this concept was placed in  the RECORD on January 19, 1978. I hope  my colleagues who have not yet studied  this material will do so.  Later in the debate on these treaties,  I shall propose reservations to the trea ties to require that future discussions on  major new facilities such as railroads or  pipelines or,  in fact, a sea-level canal,  be conducted with  the hemisphere  in  mind, and that, in fact, those negotiations include representatives of the rest  of the hemisphere that are interested.  If, by some chance, a stalemate devel ops,  then we  shall  consider  offering  amendments to provide for hemispheric  negotiations that may be the necessary  compromise  to break any such stale mate in the Senate over the treaties re lated to the Panama Canal.  I yield the floor to the Senator from  Idaho.  ",1978
54,,95,-0.384,548,3,Mr. CHURCH.," Mr. President, in the  long and heated debate  that has oc curred thus far over the Panama Canal  treaties, both sides have focused almost  exclusively on their disagreements. Few  participants have noted  the extent  to  which both sides agree---that the present  treaty with Panama is outmoded, that a  new one is needed, and that its central  feature must be to keep the canal open  and running smoothly. There are, I think,  several  reasons  underlying  this  con sensus.  First, the present arrangement is 75  years old. When we took over the digging  of the canal from the French in 1903, the  United States had only  recently com menced reaching out any distance from  its shores. Traveling to Panama to in spect the excavation, Theodore Roose velt became the first American President  ever to leave the United States while in  office.  The most  effective means  of  achieving national goals in the year of  the Kitty Hawk flight are simply not the  same in the era of the space shuttle.  Second, the people of Panama want a  new treaty. They have been our staunch  friends, as loyal as any of our allies. Their  desires are important, and to ignore them  on this issue, about which they feel so  passionately, would be  to destroy that  friendship.  Third, we have  learned a  lot about  the nationalist impulse of other people.  We have found, through a painful, mis taken war in Southeast Asia, that citi zens of small countries feel pride and  patriotism just as much as we do. The  Canal Zone is virtually the only remain ing area in the world in which any coun try  retains  the vestiges of extraterri torial  rights. What  this  arrangement  means, by way of example,  is  that a  Panamanian  arrested  in  the  Canal  Zone-perhaps  only  blocks  from  his  house-will be tried by a foreign court,  under a  foreign law,  in a foreign lan guage. No patriot anywhere has ever will ingly accepted such humiliation. Those  who fought at Lexington and Concord re pudiated  the  authority  of  a  distant  throne, exercised  in a  form  far  less  severe.  Fourth, in the event force were ever  required  to uphold  the present anti quated arrangement, the United States  would stand alone in the community of  nations. The evidence is plain. For ex ample,  the United Nations  Security  Council in 1973 considered a resolution  condemning the perpetuation of Ameri can  jurisdiction over  the Canal Zone.  Not one nation-not even our closest al lies-voted for our position, and we were  forced to veto the resolution to prevent  its passage.  This is not to say that we should per mit our national prerogatives to be de",1978

56,Senate,95,0.084,587,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, this year  has been ref erred to by some as the most  important year for Federal decisions on  transportation since 1956, the year the  Highway Trust Fund was created. I hope  we will have the ability to weigh our al ternatives with an eye to the future. The  Transportation Subcommittee of the En vironment and Public Works Committee  is in the process of holding hearings and  drafting comprehensive legislation. We  have the administration's bill, S. 2440,  before us,  along with numerous  less  sweeping proposals. Other committees  are also doing extensive work on trans portation issues.  Mr. President, the bill I am introduc ing modifies the Federal assistance pro gram for highways. My proposal is one  which, I believe, suggests the direction  future assistance should  take. In par ticular, my bill recognizes the ongoing  Federal interest in maintaining an ade quate level of service on the Interstate  System and provides States greater flex ibility  in meeting  their most pressing  highway needs.  The 1976 Federal-Aid Highway Act for  the first time provided special funds for  rehabilitation, restoration and resurfac ing of interstate routes. I propose to give  the Secretary of. Transportation per manent authority to approve these so called interstate ""3 R"" projects as eligi ble for Federal-aid funds. But I would  provide  for  their  financing out of a  State's primary system apportionment.  This will, of course,  require that such  authorized for the primary system be in creased.  Current law requires annual expendi tures in specific categories, whether or  not these outlays address a State's high est priorities. My bill gives greater dis cretion to States in determining where  funds should be spent.  For example, one State's Interstate  System may be in relatively good condi tion for several years while extensive  rehabilitation may be required. At that  time a large share of the State's primary  apportionment might be devoted to in terstate work.  Just as an historical note,  I  should  point out that the Interstate System is  defined in law as part of the Nation's  primary system. What I am proposing,  then,  is  to provide for  the upkeep of  our main  interstate and  interregional  highways in a single program.  One concern with combining interstate  rehabilitation and other primary system  money is that States may neglect inter state work, allowing that system to dete riorate. Some have even raised the specter of the interstate system's ""going the  way of the railroads.""  While I do not necessarily believe that  States would permit such deterioration,  I do think a special safeguard for the  90 percent Federal investment in the in terstate system is desirable.  Existing law requires States to prop erly maintain all highways which were  constructed with Federal assistance. If  the Secretary finds  a State's mainte nance to be inadequate, he is required by  law  to stop approving all Federal-aid  projects in the State until the State be gins proper maintenance.  The Secretary has never invoked that  sanction although studies by the Federal  Highway Administration and the Gen eral Accounting Office show accelerating  deterioration of the Federal-aid system.  One reason may be the difficulty of in specting the extensive mileage which is  part of all Federal-aid systems. Another  reason may be the limited funds avail able to States to meet the multitude of  highway needs. Finally, the GAO study  shows a failure of the Secretary to adopt  criteria  for determining  adequacy of  maintenance.  My propo.sal  requires  the Secretary  to establish a Federal  inspection pro gram and to establish criteria for deter mining adequate maintenance. Highway  administration employees would be re quired  to  inspect annually  interstate  mileage more than 5 years old. If defi ciencies are found,  the State would be  notified and given a year to come for ward with a commitment to correct the  problems. If such commitments were not  forthcoming,  the Secretary would sus pend approval of all Federal-aid primary  system projects if the State gave ade quate assurances.  The Interstate System at completion  will comprise only 42,500 miles. It is not  unrealistic to require Federal inspection  of a portion of that mileage each year.  If these inspections add modestly to the  cost of administering  the Federal-aid  highway program, the additional money  can be provided by increasing slightly  administrative  deductions  from  total  program authority authorizations. This  process is already authorized.  Mr. President, the bill I am introduc ing today addresses one facet of the high way program which  I  am  convinced  should be a Federal responsibility for a  long  time  to come: Adequate mainte nance of this Nation's major arteries.  There are other facets of the Federal aid program about which I am less cer tain. We must, in the course of our de liberations, attempt to determine what  the Federal role should be in supporting  road systems. I hope to explore whether  there is a  justifiable Federal interest in  assisting any  road system other than  those which serve  regional and  inter state  transportation.  I  think we must  consider the budgetary implications of  involving  the Federal Government  in  what are essentially local road or trans portation problems.  I think we must ascertain if there are  highway-related  problems--like  high way  safety-which  are  likely  to  be  ",1978
57,Senate,95,-0.211,600,3,Mr. CANNON.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing, by request of the De partment of Transportation, a bill  to  amend the Highway Safety Act of 1966.  This legislation is an outgrowth of the  highway safety  recommendations pre sented to the Congress by  the Depart ment of Transportation pursuant to the  Highway Safety Act of 1976.  The Department of Transportaticm  states that this legislation is a  flign:fi cant departure  from  earlier hiiJhway  safety legislation, which relied on man datory standards as the nucleus of the  highway safety program. The Depart ment of Transportation notes that this  legislation  is designed  to provide  the  States far greater flexibilit~r to identify  their own priorities, while providing ade quate uniformity in the collection and  analysis of needed highway safety data.  Increased attention  to  the  improve ment of highway safety is an absolute  necessity in light of the continued serious  safety dangers on our Nation's highways.  I can assure you, Mr. President, that the  critical subject matter of  this  legisla tion will be given full consideration by  the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation. The committee re cently has received greater jurisdiction  in the area of highway safety as a con sequence of  the  reorganization of  the  Senate, and we  intend to exercise this  jurisdiction vigorously.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that this legislation and the Depart ment of Transportation's letter of re quest together with a section-by-section  analysis and justification be printed in  full at this point in the RECORD. I would  also like to request unanimous consent  that in addition  to  the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation  that this bill also be jointly referred to  the  Senate Environment  and Public  Works Committee for the purpo'se of re viewing section 3 of the bill relating to  the enforcement of the 55-mile-per-hour  national speed limit requirements.  There being no objection, the bill and  material were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  s. 2541  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives  of  the United States  of  America  in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as the ""Highway Safety Act  cf 1978"".

Mr. Speaker, this rule provides 1 hour  of general debate for the consideration  of H.R. 2637, a bill  to provide greater  cargo aircraft capacity for national de fense. Under  the rule,  the bill will be  open to amendment.  There are two waivers of points of or der provided in the rule. First, section  401 (a) of the Budget Act is waived. This  is  the section of the Budget Act which  bars the consideration of any bill which  provides contract or borrowing authority  unless the authority is subject to the ap propriation process. The introduced bill  provides contract authority, not subject  to  appropriation  and,  therefore,  the  waiver is required. The chairman of the  Budget Committee has  indicated  in a  letter that he has no objection to this  waiver,  because of his understanding  that  the Armed  Services Committee  adopted an amendment in the nature of  a substitute curing the violation by mak ing the contract authority subject to the  appropriations process.  In addition to waiving section 401(a)  of the Budget Act, this rule waives the  requirement for a committee cost esti mate, clause 7 of rule XIII. This is a tech nical requirement, because the commit tee  report  includes a Defense Depart ment cost estimate and a Congressional  Budget Office cost estimate, but there is  no cost estimate endorsed by the com mittee. Since the rule technically requires  an estimate made by  the committee, a  waiver is required in this case.  Mr. Speaker, this bill would authorize  federal  financial support  for not only  the acquisition of new commercial air craft that incorporate military features,  such as  large cargo doors and heavy  f!ooring, but also  the modification of  existing passenger aircraft  to provide  such military features. The bill would  give  the Defense Department  the au thority  to enter into  long-term agree ments providing funds for the acquisi tion or modification of aircraft and an nual payments to compensate for the re duced performance of modified aircraft  in commercial operations. These annual  payments  are  required  to  cover  in creased  fuel  consumption  and  lower  maximum commercial payload of an air craft with  the desired military cargo  features.  A Defense Department witness esti mated that the cost of this bill would  be approximately $570,000,000 over a 5year period.  The Congressional Budget Office, on  the other hand, estimates a cost totalling  $218,300,000 over the next 5 years.  ",1978

69,,95,0.297,730,3,Mr. BEARD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  the problems facing the domestic steel in dustry have been the subject of a great  deal of discussion recently. Steel produc ers have established a continuous dia log with many Members of Congress in  hopes of receiving some type of assistance  in combating the unfair trade practices  of foreign producers. In addition, domes tic steel industry representatives have re quested that the administration take ac tion under the antidumping and coun tervailing duty laws already on the books.  However,  instead of receiving assur ances from  the President that he will  make every effort to enforce trade laws as  the Congress intended, the steel industry  instead received from the Carter admin istration a proposal to establish a compli cated new system for regulating the price  of foreign and domestic steel. This system  which is called ""reference pricing"" is just  another nail in the coffin of free enter prise.  At best, it may prove to be ineffective,  since foreign producers could easily avoid  its consequences in any number of ways.  For  instance,  foreign producers  could  undercut domestic markets by discount ing high-priced steel to the entry price,  or could simply ship in mG:.:e fabricated  steel products and parts  to which  the  new regulations would not apply. Addi tionally,  reference pricing  is  likely  to  cause foreign producers to form ""captive""  distributorships  in  the United States,  which would then sell steel below the do mestic prices.  One further danger in the Carter pro posal is that the administration could set  reference prices artificially low _in an at tempt to control domestic manufacturers'  prices. In a time in which our economy  is under tremendous stress due to infla tion, I can understand the temptation  which steel regulation would present as a  possible anti-inflationary tool. However,  the more the marketplace is left to its  own devices, the more efficiently it will  operate. As such, reference pricing as a  regulatory tool should be discouraged.  Mr. Speaker, antidumping and coun tervailing duty laws have been in effect  for 57 years now, and have been imple mented with great success. Investigations  to determine whether violations of these  laws are occurring are always  lengthy  and complicated. It is not always easy to  gather  the  information  necessary  to  make determinations. However, the ad ministration will need the same type of  information  to  set  sensible  reference  prices that would be needed in order to  enforce antidumping and countervailing  duty laws. As su~h. if the administration  believes  reference pricing will be any  easier to apply, it must be because the  new system will be designed to be less ac curate, less efficient, and less equitable.  The Congress should not  tolerate  this  kind of regulatory meddling with con gressional prerogatives, and circumven tion of carefully considered trade laws.  The House concurrent resolution which  I am introducing today is a vehicle for  Congress to express its will that present  trade laws are to be enforced. This may  be difficult under present circumstances,  but it is by no means impossible. Once  again, President Carter should be  in formed that a ""quick-fix"" remedy usually  offers an  inadequate solution  to  long term problems.  DEATH OF LOUISE STONE STOKES  HON.

70,,95,-0.4,730,3,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, it is with a  profound sense of sorrow  that  I  an nounce the death this past Sunday of  Louise Stone Stokes, mother of Louis  STOKES, my distinguished colleague, and  Carl Stokes, former mayor of Cleveland.  This good woman lived out a life filled  with love and giving and enriched the  lives of everyone who came to know her.  The humility of her spirit always in spired the generosity of her heart. She  grew up on a  farm  in Georgia and  matured into a sense of responsibility at  an early age. Even as a child, she re vealed  the one trait that would char acterize  her  life  through  adulthood:  Unselfish love in the service of others.  When her husband died, leaving her the  sole support of  two young sons. Mrs.  Stokes went to work and saved enough  money to provide her sons with the kind  of education she never had.  Even the most painful disruption and  personal hardship caused by  the De pression could not destroy her courage  and determination  to provide  for her  family nor diminish her faith in God.  Not just Louis and Carl S~okes have  lost their beloved mother, but all of us  have  lost a good woman, because she  lived those aualities that too many of us  only  talk about: Love,  faith, courage,  humility, and selflessness.  The obituary follows:  LOUISE STOKES, MOTHER OF Two POLITICAL  FIGURES  Louise Stone Stokes, mother of Rep. Louis  Stokes, D-21, and former Cleveland Mayor  Carl B. Stokes, never let the fame of her sons  change her from a  sweet, gentle,  thankful  woman who cared about her neighbors and  her community.  Asked how it felt to be the mother of both  a mayor and a congressman, she said, ""Peo ple ask me that, but I don't feel any differ ent. I  feel proud for  them, but for me-I  don't feel any difi'erent.""  Mrs. Stokes, 82, died at 3: 10 p.m. yester day in the emergency room of St. Vincent  Charity Hospital from cardiac arrest.

71,,95,-0.397,743,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. Speaker, I noted with  great interest the discussion of structural  unemployment in the economic report of  the President. The section entitled ""Side  Effects of Other Programs,"" points to the  possible contribution of  the minimum  wage and other wage floors to youth un employment, especially among blacks.  The report notes that the major im pact of minimum wages is on teenagers.  By saying that the evidence is not con clusive on ""how much"" of youth unem ployment is directly attributable to the  minimum wage,  the report clearly im plies that there  is such a  relationship  to some degree. That minimum wages  contribute to black youth unemployment  is judged to be ""quite possible.""  During last year's debate on the min imum wage bill, Congressman CORNELL  and I offered an amendment  to allow  employers to pay youths under 19 85 per cent of  the minimum wage  for a  6month period. We presented extensive  economic evidence supporting our posi tion that this would reduce youth un employment without adversely affecting  adult unemployment. The administra tion and organized  labor opposed our  amendment, and it was defeated 211  to  210.  The economic report of the President  now adds additional support for our ar gument. It notes, as we did, that many  employers pref er  to hire workers who  have had prior experience and a history  of job stability. One of the major rea sons for this tendency is listed as ""the  existence of wage floors or other barriers  to hiring the inexperienced."" The report  then goes on to say that one approach  to reducing unemployment is  to ""pro vide incentives for private employers to  hire from among those groups with the  most severe incidence of structural un employment."" A youth differential would  be such a policy.  Perhaps the most persuasive criticism  of the youth differential amendment was  that it would cause the substitution of  low-skilled  youths  for more  highly  skilled adults,  thereby  increasing  the  adult male unemployment rate. The ec onomic  report of  the President notes  that this criticism of incentives for hir ing the most severe victims of structural  unemployment ""ignores  the  fact  that  such a program, if successful, could in duce a greater increase in aggregate de mand and thus lower the overall unem ployment rate.""  The administration is not now sup porting the youth differential which it  opposed last year. But I find it encour aging that it is willing to admit the va lidity of such an approach. The econom ic report says that the administration is  now designing a set of program options  to provide  incentives  to employers  to  hire people with ""severe economic diffi culties.""  I hope  that in  its consideration of  such policies,  the administration will  consider carefully the merits of a youth  differential  along  the  lines  of  the  amendment Congressman CORNELL and  I  introduced last year, which we have  now amended and introduced as H.R.  10452.  I am inserting into the RECORD a few  relevant paragraphs from the economic  report of the President:  MAJOR EcONOMIC POLICY  ISSUES OF 1977  In 1977,  the new administration  intro duced  a  number of  legislative  initiatives  whose economic impacts wm be far reach ing-energy, agriculture, social security, and  welfare reform. The Administration is now  proposing that the Congress consider a series  of  fundamental  tax  reforms.  In addition,  there have been a number of proposed re forms to improve the efficiency of our regu latory programs. The present chapter ana lyzes  these programs. Although the details  differ, the central theme that runs through  these programs is the same-enhancing the  effectiveness of Federal programs and reduc ing their costs, while improving the fairness  of our economic system.  ENERGY DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY  is  The economic consequences of the 1973 oil  embargo and the quadrupling of world oil  prices by the Organization of Petroleum Ex porting Countries (OPEC) have dramatically  demonstrated the  importance of energy to  the U.S. and world economies. In the United  States, higher prices of imported crude oil  prompted major  increases in the prices of  all domestic  fuels, aggravated  inflationary  pressures, and contributed  to  the deepest  recession  since  the Depression. Moreover,  mounting oil  import payments have con stituted an enormous drain on domestic in comes, causing a  severe  imbalance  in our  external deficit.  Nonetheless, U.S. dependence on foreign  sources of energy has continued to grow. 011  imports  in 1977 nearly doubled  those of  1972 and supplied almost half of domestic  petroleum demand. Unless we adopt effec tive policies to reverse underlying forces, still  further growth in oil imports is likely over  the coming decades.  How did this situation arise? Although the  answer is by no means simple, an important  element is that the current economic infra structure-buildings,  factories,  machines,  and automobiles-was largely designed for  an era of low-cost oil and natural gas. Sig nificant changes in patterns of energy use  will occur only when more energy-effi.cient  capital has been installed and as the existing  capital stock  replaced. This  is a  time consumtng process, and only modest progress  has been made in the last 4 years.  The major impact of minimum wages is on  the employment of teenagers. for the market  wages of ,most adults are considerably above  the legislated minimum. There is, however,  no conclusive evidence on how much of the  youth unemployment problem is directly at tributable to FLSA. As pointed out earlier in  the chapter, most of the unemployment of  white  teenagers during periods of prosper ity is caused by their high rates of labor force  turnover. But it is quite possible that mini mum wages are a c~ntributing ca.use of the  black youth unemployment problem ....  Some demographic groups have high unem ployment rates, even 1n perioas of generally  tight labor markets, because many employ ers seek  to hire new employees only from  among those applicants with prior experience  and a history of job stab111ty. The high cost  of labor turnover to business firms and the  existence of wage floors or other barriers to  hiring the  inexperienced are major factors  behind this tendency. Accordingly, one ap proach to reducing unemployment is to pro vide incentives for private employers to hire  from among those groups with the most se vere  incidence of structural unemployment.  This approach is sometimes criticized because  it would cause a substitution of low-skilled  youths for highly skilled adults and thus raise  the unemployment rates of adult males. This  criticism, however, ignores the fact that such  a program, if successful, could induce a great er  increase  in aggregate demand and thus  lower the overall unemployment rate. More",1978
72,,95,-0.44,756,3,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  this  year, February 14 is being celebrated as  ""Love Carefully Day"" to call attention to  the alarming increase in teenage preg nancies. Last year an estimated 1 mil lion  teenagers became pregnant. One  out of every five infants born in 1977 was  born to a teenager.  ""Love Carefully Day"" events have been  scheduled by affiliates and chapters of  Planned Parenthood, National Organiza tion of Non-Parents, and Zero Popula tion Growth. Among  these events are  forums in which teenagers can discuss  the repercussions of early childbearing  and responsibilities of parenthood. ZPG,  which has orchestrated Love Carefully  Day since 1976, this year has made avail able a questionnaire to be administered  to high school students. Entitled ""Twelve  Misconceptions About Contraception,"" it  aims to debunk the myths surrounding  reproduction and contraception. By dis pelling these misconceptions, ZPG hopes  to begin the long road toward reducing  the hundreds of thousands of unwanted  pregnancies that will occur in 1978.  In addition to these events, ZPG has  designed a special valentine. The card  humorously offers some serious advice:  ""Love ... Carefully."" The back of the  card plainly states  that  teenagers are  trying sex at earlier ages, and that over  half the Nation's 21 million young people  aged 15 to 19 are believed to be sexually  experienced. Yet millions don't have the  knowledge  or  contraceptive  services  needed to prevent pregnancy.  It is with a sense of urgency that I  speak  to  the need  to prevent  teenage  pregnancy and  the concomitant social  and economic problems for the children  who bear children.  Current Government  funding  serves  only 1.1 million  teenagers. Of the $18  million  increase  for  family  planning  services proposed in next year's budget,  $8 million would be taken away from on going  family planning programs. This  leaves only $10 million, a far cry from  the $35 million needed to serve just an  additional 500,000 adolescents.  I encourage Congress to study HEW's  proposed budget for  its  teenage preg nancy program  in  light of  the  issues  raised in the following report published  by ZPG in August 1977, ""Teenage Preg nancy: A Major Problem for Minors"":  TEENAGE PREGNANCY: A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR  MINORS  Teenage pregnancy has reached epidemic  proportions in the United States. Ea.ch year,  more  than one million  teenagers  become  pregnant. In comparison, 24,374 Americans  contracted measles and 59,647 had mumps  in 1975, the most recent year for which sta tistics are available. By the age of 20, three  in 10 American women have borne at least  one child.  Early childbearing poses  serious health,  social, a.nd economic consequences for teen age mothers and their children. In addition  to facing higher health risks both for them selves and  their children,  teenage mothers  are often forced to leave school and to forego  job training and other opporftunities for eco nomic  advancement. Unmarried mothers  face  social disapproval,  financial hardship,  and difficulty in finding work and child ca.re  facilities. If they marry, teenage mothers a.re  more likely to have unstable marriages and  financial problems than others of the same  age and socio-economic ,status. Women who  have their first child in their teen yea.rs tend  to have more children in quicker succession  than their peers.  In the past, pregnant teenagers were pres sured  to get married or have  their babies  secretly and put them up for adoption. In  addition, they were routinely expelled from  school. Today  teen mothers are  asserting  their  right  to an  education,  and  special  classes and programs have been started in  many communities.  While older women's fertility has been de clining during the past five yea.rs, teenagers  aged 14  and younger have had  increasing  numbers of children, a.nd  the fert111ty rate  of teens a.ged 15-16 ha.s remained about the  same. The proportion of U.S. births attrib uted to teenagers has been increasing; one  in five U.S. births is to a teenager. Also, the  number of out-of-wedlock births  to  teen agers is rising; teenagers account for ha.If of  all  out-of-wedlock  births  in  the United  States. Most  teenage pregnancies a.re un wanted, as is indicated by the fa.ct that one  in three U.S. abortions is to a. teenager.  Experts attribute the epidemic of teenage  pregnancies to increased sexual activity, non use or ineffective use of contraceptives, a.nd  lack of contraceptive information and serv ices  for  teenagers. More  than four million  teenage women aged 15-19 a.re sexually active  and at risk of unwanted pregnancy. Only  half of  them are currently  receiving con traceptive services. Of the estimated 420,000  to 630,000 teenage females under 15 who are  sexually active, only 7 percent are receiving  contraceptive services even though this age  group  is most vulnerable to health risks if  they become pregnant.  Studies  show  that most  teenagers  seek  contraceptive services after  they have be come sexually active; many of them come to  clinics  initially for pregnancy tests. Tradi tional sanctions against premarital sex have  not kept teena!!ers celibate but rather appear  to have contributed  to  the non-use and  sporadic use of contraceptives as well a.s the  tendency  to select unreliable contraceptive  methods.  TEEN SEXUAL ACTIVITY INCREASING  experienced~almost  More  than half of the 21 million young  people a.ged 15-19 are estimated to be sex ually  seven  million  young men and four million women. In ad dition, a.bout one-fifth of the eight million  13-14-year-olds have had sex. A 1976 na tional survey confirmed that a growing pro portion of teenagers are sexually active a.nd  that they are beginning their sexual activity  at earlier ages. The study found tha.t 35 per cent of the single female teenagers had ex perienced intercourse in 1976 compared with  27 percent  in 1971-a 30 percent  increase.  The proportion of sexually-experienced fe males rises. from 18 percent a.t a.ge 15 to 55  percent atage 19.  Most fjtudies indicate that teenage sexual  activity  is sporadic. The 1976 study found  that nearly half of the sexually experienced  teenagers surveyed had not had intercourse  in the month prior to the survey. The pro portion  of  sexually  experienced  blacks  (63%)  is  twice that of whites  (31 % ) , the  survey found, but the rate of increase for  whites from 1971 to 1976 is more than twice  the rate for blacks.  Along with  increasing sexual experience,  teenagers are also contracting venereal dis eases  in growing numbers. Teenagers aged  15-19 are three times more likely to contract  ",1978

76,House,95,0.194,769,3,Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of the confer ence report accompanying H.R. 4544, the  Black Lung Benefits Reform Act.  Since the black lung benefits program  began in 1969, it has evolved to the point  where it compensates 500,000 benefici aries almost $1 billion annually for res piratory diseases contracted as a result  of prolonged exposure to coal dust. H.R.  4544 seeks  to build on our experience  with the program over the past 8 years  by improving the claims process and by  clarifying the role of medical evidence  in establishing a claimant's eligibility.  H.R. 4544 directs the Department of  Labor and  the Department of Health,  Education,  and Welfare  to  develop  means  to  inform potential claimants  about the program and assist in the fil ing of claims. The effectiveness of this  I  worthwhile program would be dimin ished if positive steps were not taken to  reach out and inform the public about  the existence of  the black lung bene fits  program.  Another  noteworthy  change  involves  the definition of  the  type of work which makes a person eligi ble for benefits. The bill would expand  the term ""miner"" to include persons who  work in the vicinity of a coal mine, such  as processors, to the extent they are ex posed to coal dust.  The revenue legislation necessary to  pay the benefits provided in this bill has  already passed the Congress. H.R. 5322  established an excise  tax on each ton  of coal mined in order to fund the bene fits. The compensation of victims of in dustrial diseases by the industries which  occasioned those diseases is a fair and  reasonable approach to follow. I believe  the excise  tax approach  is  the best  means available to carry out the funding  of benefits. It can be administered in a  straightforward way and can take ad vantage of the Treasury Department's  experience to assure its efficient collec tion.  Mr. Speaker, I support the conference  report accompanying H.R. 4544.  ",1978
77,House,95,0.612,769,3,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong opposition to the conference re port on H.R. 4544, the Black Lung Bene fits Reform Act. This legislation would  unduly expand the Federal responsibil ity for black lung compensation. It would  also establish a bad precedent for han dling other  occupational  diseases.  It  seems especially inappropriate to be con sidering the conference report at a time  the eventual beneficiaries of this legis lation are disrupting the national health  and safety by their actions which show  no regard for any other citizens.  When the Federal black lung benefits  program was enacted in 1969, the spon sors of the bill assured us that Federal  involvement would be a one-time affair.  We were told that in no way was the goal  to federalize the compensation program  for the coal industry.  Let me quote what congressman DENT  said at that time:  This is a one-shot effort. This is not a con tinuing compensation arrangement to estab lish Federal based compensation for this or  any other industry. We are only taking on  those who a.re now a.filleted with pneumo coniosis  in  its  fourth  stage-complicated  pneumoconiosis.  The conference report before us today  would  change all  that. The promises  made in 1969 have been discarded. In stead of a ""one-shot effort"" H.R. 4544, in  conjunction with the Black Lung Bene fits Revenue Act of 1977, would make  Federal  black  lung  compensation  a  permanent Federal program. We  are  being given  the permanent  ""Federal based compensation"" for the coal indus try that we were assured would never  happen.  I cannot understand why State work men's compensation funds should not be  exclusively resnonsible for paving black  lung benefits. This, after all, is how work ers injured or disabled in other indus tries are compensated.  ",1978

Mr. Chairman, I rise to  strongly support the legislation that is  before us.  I only wish  to make a  few  remarks in its behalf. What this bill rep resents is a small step, but a significant  step  to prepare  the United States for  the immense food production needs we  are going to need in the years to come.  It attempts to enable the United States  to turn to the sea as a major source of  food.  It is not simply a question of preparing  for the future. Even today we have some  important needs in this area. The aver age American's diet has been shown to  be nutritionally disastrous  today. The  Senate Select Committee on Nutrition  and Human Needs issued a report in 1977  which  sets  specific national goals  for  improved nutrition and health. One of  those major national goals was a sub stantial increase in the amount of fish  served on American dinner tables today.  This is an immediate need and one in  which we can move forward positively  and with  imagination,  if we begin  to  turn to the sea and begin to farm the  sea as a source of food.  In longer  terms, I  think we need to  see that agriculture alone will not meet  our own  country's food needs  indefi nitely and that it cannot solve the prob lems we have in our own country, or for  that matter, the problems of hunger for  the world.  I  think one needs only  to consider  these facts to see the truth of that state ment. At current growth  rates, more  than 75 million people are added to the  human family every single year. Every 3  years more people are added than now  live in the United States. Asia alone is  adding a new Japan every second year.  Latin America, now  the most  rapidly  growing area in the world, is expected to  add more than 350 million people by the  year 2000.  The totals are alarming, too. Mankind  did not reach its first billion in popula tion until 1850. The number doubled  in our own century, just 80 years later.  Still accelerating, the population added  its third billion in 1960, and its fourth  billion 15 years later in 1975.  Experts expect the world population  to double between  the years 1975 and  2000. That means  the hunger gap can  be removed only by trebling food produc tion during the next 25 years.  This bill is one way to provide a small  part of the solution to this problem. It  takes much time to prepare aquaculture  and Oregon-Aquafoods, which  is  the  venture in Oregon that has already been  referred to as an example of this. It be gan in a very small way in the 1960's  and only now is beginning to realize i~  ",1978

85,House,95,-0.306,808,3,Mr. HANLEY.," Mr. Speaker, last week,  I  spoke about  the alternative delivery  symposium sponsored by  the Magazine  Publishers Association. Following is an other discussion of the symposium writ ten by Mr. Lou Zlovinsky of Time, Inc.  Mr. Zlovinsky does an excellent job of  capturing both the flavor and facts of  the meeting:  More  than 200 people convened at New  York's Plaza Hotel to participate in an all day symposium on private delivery systems  as alternatives to the U.S. Postal Service for  their publications and other products. The  group was predominantly comprised of mag azine publishers, but also  included news paper  publishers,  book  and  record  club  executives, direct mail marketers, national  retailers, private distributors, academics, gov ernment officials and other observers.  The magazine publishers registered for the  symposium represented an annual volume of  1.9 billion magazines, or almost 40 percent of  the  total Postal Service second class mail  volume. It was estimated that users of ap proximately 70 percent of all  fourth class  mail and perhaps 33 percent of all third class  mail were at the gathering as well.  Sounding the  theme for  the symposium,  Magazine Publishers Association President  Stephen E. Kelly noted that since the pas sage of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970,  second class postal rates will exceed 400 per cent by July 1979. As a result, he said, pub lishers are reaching the ""crossover point"" the point at which private carrier rates cost  less than Postal Service rates.  For Better Homes & Gardens,  the cross over point has already been reached, accord ing to Robert A. Burnett, President of Mer edith Corporation, the magazine's publisher.  Experimenting with alternative delivery since  1971, Better Homes & Gardens has recently  employed a  technique born out by the ""im perative  of  survival""  called  ""distribution  marketing""-that  is,  the delivery of other  materials to offset the cost of magazine de livery. In a Kansas City test, the technique  brought the net cost of magazine delivery  down to one cent a copy. He announced that  it was a  ""very practical objective""  in  the  strategic planning for Better Homes & Gar dens ""to reach the point that 60 percent of  subscriber copies of that magazine will be  delivered through private delivery."" The mag azine has a current circulation of 8 million.  Four private distributors  discussed  the  formation and goals of the National Associa tion of Selective Distributors, Inc.  (NASD),  asserting  that alternative distribution had  surpassed the ""test"" stage and was fast be coming  a  national  business which  could  serve both large and smaller circulation pub lishers. NASD's nine member private distrib utors covered 106 ZIP codes as of Jan. 1,  1977, a figure that grew to 160 at the start of  this year and  is projected  to reach 244  in  1979.  NASD officials suggested that the crossover  point would be reached by nearly all pub lishers, irrespective of size. In the main, the  bigger publishers have led in alternative de velopment programs. However, by merging  delivery of  smaller magazines with  larger  publications, a cost-efficient delivery density  could be achieved. Standardization of  the  procedures and  relationships between dis tributors and publishers should reduce the  costs of entry  into alternate delivery  for  smaller publishers. Also, smaller specialized  magazines could offset costs by marketing  their demographic  characteristics  to  local  advertisers.  According to Harry C. Bird, General Man ager of the Racine Journal Times, ""more and  more newspapers are getting into alternate  delivery as a source of additional revenue.""  He estimated that there are approximately  765 daily newspapers that have the capability  to deliver to 90% of the homes in the U.S. As  to the potential of alternate delivery, NASD  projected that by 1983 private carriers will  be handling 750 million copies of magazines  each year.  Magazine Publishers Association economist  James 0. Edwards, who  is a principal and  director of  ICF  Inc.,  a Washington-based  consulting firm, reviewed a cost analysis he  prepared  for a hypothetical private-carrier  system  in  the nation's capital. This was a  recapitulation of testimony he gave before  the Postal Rate Commission on January 9. He  concluded that private delivery systems dis tributing magazines plus advertising mate rials appear to be economically attractive in  competition with  the  1979 Postal Service  rates. He suggested that the pace of private  delivery development has begun to accelerate  because ""the cumulative effect of the Postal  Service  rate  increases ... are  only  now  being fully recognized by second-, third-and  fouth-class mailers."" Earlier alternate distri bution  tests, he said,  failed  to  take  into  account the need for a multiple product mix  to cover the fixed costs involved in establish ing a delivery network.  Extrapolating from ""reasonably conserva tive  assumptions,"" Mr. Edwards predicted  that as a result of the proposed 1979 postal  rate increases, the Postal Service could lose  about $200 million  in revenues  to private  carriers. Add to that assumptions about the  rate differentials for third class and fourth  class mail and the Postal Services' revenue  loss could be  ""several  times  larger""  than  $200 million.  Alternative delivery is not without draw backs,  such  as  the  inabiUty  to  ..lse  the  mail box, Mr. Edwards said. Nevertheless, he  added, ""competing with the quality of de livery of the U.S. Postal Service should not  be an  insuperable problem.""

86,House,95,0.342,821,3,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  just  about this time last year our Nation par ticularly the Midwest and Northeast re gions, were confronted with a  severe  natural gas shortage. Curtailing service  to homes was a very real and present  danger. Commercial establishments were  forced to reduce hours. Factories closed  with the result that thousands of work ers were idled. The people, and our econ omy, suffered.  Many Members of the House and Sen ate took to the floor and addressed the  problem; not a few fixed the blame on  oil and gas producers who allegedly were  withholding vital product from the mar ket. Conscientious readers of the CON GRESSIONAL  RECORD  were  told,  and  I  quote:  We must blow  the whistle on these few  producers and conscienceless officials of giant  corporations who have been willing to visit  widespread suffering among the people from  the severest and coldest winter  in modern  history, force thousands of schools, factories,  and  industries across  the Nation  to close  cause far-reaching unemployment and bring  the economy of the Nation to its knees ...  Another of my colleagues observed:  Producers have been telling the American  people that there is no gas being hidden for  the right price and timing. If gas begins to  flow we will know that the producers in the  intrastate market have withheld supplies in  the hopes of exacerbating  the crisis. They  will have withheld supplies until the short fall between demand and supply was so great  that factories, offices, schools, and even homes  would be without heat.  On February 4,  ;.977, a Senator who  later was to achieve prominence for fili bustering against  the deregulation of  natural gas pricing, stated, and again I  quote:  Some people think that you cannot blame  the oil companies for the cold winter-that  the shortage is a result of weather conditions  that no one can control. They are wrong.  The oil companies are  to blame for  the  situation that turned the cold weather from  a nuisance into a near disaster for people  throughout the South,  the lower Midwest,  and parts of the East.  This year we have a coal shortage in  just about the same area of the United  States. Utility  companies  are  taking  to  steps  drastically cut back on  the  amount of power available to everyone homeowners, businesses, and  As  several manufacturing  industry.  result,  a  plants, employing hundreds of thousands  of workers, have announced that unless  the coal strike is resolved they will sus pend operations. It goes without saying  that this will have disastrous  implica tions for the people of the region. The  economic disruption will, eventually, be  felt across the length and breadth of the  United States.  Now,  last year  the Americ:an people  were  repeatedly  told-jm;t  glance  through  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD that  the oil and gas companies were  withholding these fuels from the market.  Their greed and avarice caused the natu ral gas shortage. Members waxed elo quent in their indignation and condem nation of  such  alleged withholding never mind that the allegations were not  and have not been substantiated.  What I would like to know is who is to  blame for the situation that turned the  cold weather from a nuisance into a near  disaster this year. Who is responsible for  the  suffering  being visited  upon  the  American people? I wonder if we might  look to the United Mine Worker's bar gaining council that last Sunday rejected  a settlement which would have ended the  longest coal strike in our Nation's his tory. And how about the coal miners who  just last fall cluttered congressional of fices and corridors lobbying in favor of  their Black Lung Benefits Reform Act?  It seems to me that these individuals  could justifiably be accused of withhold ing coal from the powerplants and fac tories of the Midwest. It would seem that  my colleagues who were so vocal last year  in deploring alleged withholding of nat ural gas might have a word or two to say  regarding the coal strike. I wonder where  they are now that we need them?  The Congress does not have to pass  any new emergency legislation  to deal  with this crisis. We already have a law  designed to reckon with situations where  individual greed and avarice by a  few  take priority over the health and well being of the people. The President might  want to consider seeking an injunction  against  the continuation of  the strike  pursuant to the provisions of the Taft Hartley Act. That is the very least that  could be done under the circumstances.  Meanwhile, I will be listening with inter est for a good explanation as to why a  different standard is applied to the with holding of coal-which is a proven fact than to spurious claims of oil and natural  gas withholding.  PROPOSED TV COVERAGE OF  HOUSE PROCEEDINGS  <Mr. STEIGER asked and was given  permission to extend his remarks at this  point in the Record and to include ex traneous matter.)  ",1978
87,,95,0.422,925,3,Mr. RUDD.," Mr. Speaker, the adminis tration has been caught  lying  to  the  American people about the cost of the  proposed new Panama Canal  treaties,  but the truth is slowly beginning to come  out.  '  President Carter has  repeatedly  in sisted that the treaties would not cost  the American taxpayers a single dollar.  We have known that this is not true.  Now  the  administration has  reluc tantly acknowledged in a letter to Mem bers of the U.S. Senate that the treaties  will require $633 million in appropriated  funds and lost revenue to the taxpayers.  This letter was signed by Secretary of  State Cyrus Vance, Secretary of Defense  Harold Brown,  and Secretary of  the  Army Clifford Alexander.  The $633 million in direct costs to the  taxpayers would include:  The sum of $350 million to pay for  merger of canal administration and de fense activities, assumption of nonreim bursable health, education, and other  support functions in the Canal Zone, and  early retirement forced by the treaties  for many U.S. employees;  The sum of $240 million in lost interest  payments to the U.S. Treasury once the  U.S. Panama Canal Company is abol ished and  replaced by  a Government  agency to run the canal. This interest is  for the continuing U.S. investment in the  company, apart from the cost of canal  construction, amounting to about $319  million.  The sum of $43 million for relocation  of certain defense  installations, which  the United States will be forced to aban don under the treaties, over the next 3  years.  Mr. Speaker,  these direct  taxpayer  costs of the proposed new Panama Canal  Treaties  do not  include  the  following  other costs to the American people:  The sum of $10 billion for giveaway of  the canal and its facilities. <This is the  estimated replacement value of the U.S.  property to be turned over to Panama if  the treaties are ratified> ;  An additional $454 million in planned  U.S. capital improvements to the canal  and Canal Zone after U.S. sovereignty  and control of the canal has been given  to Panama;  Another $345 million in U.S. foreign  aid, military sales, and credits that the  administration has promised to Panama  Dictator Omar Torrijos as a side agree ment to the treaties;  Between $15  to $30 million of addi tional  costs  to American  consumers,  3585  forced by the anticipated 30 to 60 per cent increase in canal tolls for shippers  of goods to American markets if Panama  ever takes over the waterway.  I believe that administration estimates  of higher tolls and higher consumer costs  because of increased canal tolls are way  low. The Torrijos regime has a giant  shopping list of projects that they hope  to pay for from canal revenue if Panama  takes over the canal. I believe tolls would  have to be increased a minimum of 60  percent to pay for  these projects and  keep the canal maintained and operating  efficiently.  Mr. Speaker, these estimated costs of  the proposed Panama Canal Treaties add  up to $11.5 billion. That is a substantial  cost to the American taxpayer. This cost  amounts to $53.58 for every man, woman,  and child in the United States, and about  $110 for every taxpayer.  It is a far cry from not costing ""a sin gle dollar,'' as  the President has per sistently maintained, and costing every  taxpayer an average of $110 to give away  the Panama Canal.  The truth is that the proposed Panama  Canal Treaties, aside from threatening  our Nation's strategic well-being, will hit  our taxpayers right in the pocketbook.  It is a shame that the administration  was not honest about this economic im pact of the proposed treaties from the  very beginning.  The  administration's deception  and  misstatement  in  its propaganda cam paign to win approval of these question able  treaties has been a  black mark  against our Government's credibility and  the public's belief in the integrity of our  national leaders.  I hope that we can alleviate this seri ous problem by making the truth known  to the American people. We must face  up to the economic realities of the pro posed  Panama  Canal  Treaties--not  sweep them under the rug as the Presi dent and other treaty proponents have  tried to do.

89,,95,-0.154,938,3,Mr. GUDGER.," Mr. Speaker, the rights  of the citizens of  this country are in solubly linked to the responsibilities that  each citizen must exercise to maintain a  free society. The Veterans of Foreign  Wars and its ladies auxiliary have, in  their ""Voice of Democracy"" contest, made  a point of developing this spirit in the  youth of America by selecting as  this  year's  theme  ""My Responsibility  to  America.""  I am pleased that the winner of our  State competition is Claire Colleen Heck,  a resident of Hendersonville, N.C., and a  junior at Hendersonville High School.  She exemplifies the quality of the youth  of the 11th Congressional District which  I represent, and I am sure that the qual ities of leadership which she possesses  will be of great service to her community,  State, and Nation. I  therefore wish to  share with you her formula for a strong  and secure America through respansible  involvement:  VFW VOICE OF DEMOCRACY ScHOLARSHIP PRO GRAM,  CAROLINA WINNER  1977-78, NORTH  (By Claire Colleen Heck)  While struggling with writing a Declara tion of Independence and our Constitution,  our forefathers were careful with the word ing of the documents. These men foresaw  the  importance of  these compositions and  knew they would be the basis !or all law in  the young Nation. Thus, they carefully estab lished our privileges in writing so that they  could not arbitrarily be usurped. When the  citizens of the new United States accepted  the Declaration and Constitution, they also  took upon  themselves the responsibility of  exercising and defending their rights.  Unfortunately, in the 200 years that have  passed, many have forgotten that rights and  responsibilities are  inseparable. As you flip  through any popular magazine nowadays, you  will invariably find a quiz that will tell you  if you think young, have a large vocabulary  or something of that nature.  See how you do on the test I have devised  about a citizen's responsib1lities to America.  First,  if eligible, do you vote? Casting a.  ballot is the most important way that you  let your ideas a.bout government be known.  Through this medium, one can rai~e or lower  taxes, reject or re-elect an incumbent and  help make many decisions  through bond  issues as well as referendums. The concept of  one man, one vote, distinguishes us from  many nations. Looking at  those countries  makes us realize how valuable an i'ndividual  vote is and one understands the need for all  citizens to vote.  Secondly, are you well informed, not only  at election  time but also  throughout  the  year? To make an intelligent decision, listen  to all sides on the matter, gather as much  information as possible,  then choose your  stand on the issue. Throughout the year lt  ls necessary to remain well versed on cur rent  events  because  your  representatives  will be making decisions on your behalf and  need to hear many opinions.  Third, do you try to create a positive at titude about America? It is very easy to com plain about a problem and t.hen think no  more of it. But it is  just as easy to make  constructive criticism. The next time you are  disturbed about politics, for instance, try to  offer a solution, too. During the past decade,  it was popular to be anti-America. Happily,  the pendulum has swung the other way and  our people are cognizant that the most ef fective way to remedy problems ls to work on  them ourselves instead of relying on others  to do the job.  Next, do you work at the grass roots level?  Choose an issue of concern, support a. candi date,  join a party, but  just get  involved.  You'll find that working in politics is good  mental exercise and  interesting. Once you  start, you'll discover  the work so exciting  you will stay with it.  Lastly,  do you work  through  the  sys tem? When you have a complaint, do you  take it to your public officials? If they don't  listen, run for office yourself. Start a citi zen's group  to work  for  good  legislation.  When you take the conventional route, you  win support  to your side and accomplish  more. Even if you didn't pass the test, I hope  that we have some of  the same  ideas on  responsibility. And certainly  the youth of  our country should be included. The youth  of  today can be the leaders of  today,  too.  They can join a student government group  or attend City Council meetings.  we young people have a unique ""I Can""  attitude that helps achieve our goals. Thus,  when we devote ourselves to exercising our  rights by voting, being well informed, creat ing a  positive attitude, participating and  working through the system, we know that  our Nation will always promise strength and  security for all.  REMARKS AT A SANITARY  LANDFILL  HON. DAVID F. EMERY  OF MAINE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 15, 1978  ",1978
90,,95,0.155,938,3,Mr. EMERY.," Mr. Speaker, many of us  in Congress are aware of the prolifera tion of Federal  regulations  in nearly  every aspect of our lives. Our constitu ents, for  the most part, are frustrated  over  these sometimes burdensome and  often  ridiculous Federal  interventions,  especially in municipal affairs.  I have long supported rules and regu lations which promote high  environ mental standards. Among these are bills  such as  the Federal Water Pollution  Control Act amendments, the Clean Air  Act  amendments,  controls  over  strip  mining, the Black Lung Benefits Reform  Act, and I commend much of the work  done by EPA, especially in region I where  my district lies.  Even I have to ponder the results of  all the recent legislation, however, when  I  listen to the comments of people like  Mr. Peter Burbank, first selectman of  Wayne, Maine. In his  remarks at the  opening of the Wayne sanitary landfill  site, he effectively pokes fun at Federal  regulations which seemingly are much  ado about nothing. I offer the following  remarks by Mr. Burbank as an example  of the mood which many people in our  country are in. I expect the reader will  find them humorous yet succinct.  REMARKS AT THE OPENING OF THE WAYNE  SANITARY LANDFILL  (By Peter H. Burbank)  It is with great pleasure that I accepted  the  invitation of  a. group of  taxpayers  to  participate  in  this grand opening of  the  Wayne Sanitary Landfill. Any project which  has cost the taxpayers this much money de serves recognition.  For a moment,  let us pause in honoring  the old dump. It was a place where the citi zenry could gather, where friendships could  be renewed, where something of value could  be found and retrieved. But alas, these quali ties are passed now as so much has in the  name of progress. We liked our old dump but  we were told that it wasn't nice.  However, now is the time to take a deep  breath and look to the !'uture. Yes, we wlll  adjust to the inconvenience. There wlll even  be those who wm say that this dump is bet ter. We are  thankful on this day that we  could find a hole in the ground befitting a  dump ln the Town of Wayne. Such holes are  at a premium as several town'3 have inquired  whether we had any more to sell. Solid Waste  Management has become a household word  in the State of Maine and we are fortunate,  I  suppose,  that we can participate at the  ""ground  level""  ln establishing a new bu reaucracy-a model if you wm, of regulation  and control of local communities.  This bag of refuse which I hold  in my  hand wm be symbolically placed in the new  land fill area. It meet::: the specifications of  ""Bags, refuse"" found ln the soon to be pub lished booklet,  ""Solid Waste and You.""  I  have heard that this is a new government  publication which  specifies  among other  things,  the material,  thickness,  tear-point,  etc. for garbage bags. We all look forward to  receiving a copy. It ls publication number  143A, as amended July, 1977, Government  Printing Office, please enclose 25¢.  So now we must move on each to their  own  tasks  for  the day. We  return  to our  homes secure in the knowledge that we now  have a place for brush. a place for metal  goods, and a place for all other refuse--each  never to be mixed with the other. It ls a good  feeling, one of which we can all be proud, to  know that our notices of overdue bills wm  be under six inches of earth. This is a new  beginning, a new era for the town. The day  that solid waste was finally conquered.  IS THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION  PREPARING TO SELL OUT FREE  CHINA?  HON. JOHN M.

Representing, as we do, districts in which  a.gricul ture ls of major economic concern, we  have long been cognizant of the fa.ct  that  the  farmer has been caught  tightly  in a  squeeze between rapidly increasing costs for  his land, his seed, fertmzer, chemicals, ma chinery and equipment, fuel and other ne cessities, while prices for his produce remain  constant or even diminished. We realize that  no one can long survive at a loss of even at  breaking even. The farmer should at least  have a  fighting chance to realize a fair re turn on his investment and reasonable com pensation for his labors.  We  endorse  the  basic  concept of  the  American  agriculture movement  that  the  Federal Government can and should take  action to see that prices on basic agricul tural comodities are maintained at a sum clent level to insure that a  farmer at least  will recover  the reasonable cost of produc tion.  We belleve  that every effort should be  made  to  increase our agricultural exports  and to insure that our import pollcy is fair  and reasonable.  We will support  legislation designed  to  improve assistance for serious disaster losses.  We concur in the proposition that all pol icies and announcements by the Department  of Agriculture relevant to a particular crop  be made and publlcized on a timely basis to  afford  farmers ample opportunity  to plan  their operations accordingly.  We belleve that a sound and viable agri to  cultural economy  is essential  being of our Nation and  that not only  farmers but every American will be well served by a policy which insures a continued  supply of essentl~l food and fiber by provid ing farmers with economic opportunity com parable to that available to other Americans.  the well LIST OF SIGNATURES  Charlie Whitley, Walter B.

PAUL FINDLEY  OF n.LINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 15, 1978  ",1978
93,,95,0.246,951,3,Mr. FINDLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  with 17 new cosponsors I am reintroduc ing  legislation  to provide  for  special  equipment  to be  installed in both the  Senate and the House to enable deaf and  hearing impaired individuals to commu nicate with Members of Congress. This  brings to 36 the number of Members who  have cosponsored this measure.  One of the unique problems faced by  hearing impaired individuals is their in ability to use a conventional telephone.  Two million deaf Americans and millions  more with hearing impairments, were de nied the opportunity to use a telephone  until recently.  Now, a device, called a teletypewriter  or TTY, can give hearing impaired indi viduals the freedom to communicate with  other  individuals over  long distances.  This machine, coupled with a  regular  telephone receiver, can  transmit mes sages to a similar device anyplace in the  country.  This bill authorizes the installation of  TTY equipment in the Senate and the  House to enable hearing impaired con stituents to communicate with their Rep resentatives on Capitol Hill. Certainly,  deaf and hearing impaired  individuals  should have the same ability to call their  Representatives as do people with no  hearing handicap.  These devices are already in service  at the Department of Health, Education,  and Welfare, the Internal Revenue Serv ice, the General Accounting Office, and  the Bureau of Standards. Congress, the  people's branch of Government, should  not be allowed to fall behind in this pro gressive trend.

AKAKA  OF HAWAII  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVF.S  Wednesday, February 15, 1978  ",1978
94,,95,-0.419,951,3,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, Cl:airman  John M. Murphy of the House Committee  on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, my self, and a number of our colleagues will  soon be introducing a resolution designed  to protect Hawaii and Alaska from a po tentially disastrous, discriminatory Gov ernment program.  The Department of Defense is propos ing to expand its competitive rate pro gram for the movement of DOD person nel's household goods to these two States.  The basic premise behind our objection  to this action is that the CRP will be  implemented only in foreign countries,  Guam, Hawaii, and Alaska-it will not be  used in the other 48 States where the  carrier  evaluation  rating  system  is  utilized.  Hawaii and Alaska are State::; of the  Union. My Congressional colleagues and  I ft.nd this proposal a grievous, arrogant  and injurious affront. There is no con ceivable justification for applying one set  of standards to Hawaii and Alaska and  another to the rest of America.  Hawaii and Alaska have been States  for 20 years. We are under the regula tion of the Interstate Commerce Com mission.  Additionally,  movezr.ent  of  household goods is further regulated by  the Alaska Transportation Committee  and  the Hawaii Public Utilities Com mission. The ICC sets what it considers  to  be adequately compensatory  rates.  Companies  conducting  business with  DOD cannot charge rates higher than  those permitted by the ICC. In fact, they  rarely charge rates that are even equal.  Certainly, there is no need for yet an other program to ensure that unreason able profits are not being made by the  household goods moving and storage in dustry.  The Department of Defense first in itiated the CRP with the commendable  goal of achieving cost savings. However,  there are several points to consider:  First. For the May-October 1978 CRP  bidding cycle, 937 out of 1,275 area-to area traffic channels <73.5 percent> will  award the low-bidding household goods  forwarded 100 percent of all military  business.  Second. Agents, those companies who  actually do the trucking and storage un der contract from forwarders, would go  through 6-month stretches without par ticipation in DOD movement if the for warder they work for were not the low  bidder. <In Hawaii, agents count on the  military for an average of 80 percent of  their contracts.>  Third. In Okinawa, before CRP was  implemented, there were 12 agents pro viding service. Currently, there are only  three.  Fourth. DOD made no effort to consult  with the moving and storage industry in  either Hawaii or Alaska. Meetings with  industry representatives were in the form  of briefings, merely explaining the me",1978
95,,95,-0.1,964,3,Mr. STEERS.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to urge that the House of Represent atives take prompt action to reduce and  simplify the present tax code. As Presi dent Carter expressed in his campaign,  the present code is truly a disgrace.-It  unfairly penalizes  the middle-income  family  that depends mainly on wages  and salaries, who cannot &.ff ord the tax  loopholes  used  primarily  by  the  wealthy-and it unfairly penalizes  the  elderly and retired persons living on a  fixed income.  My basic view-on how  to solve  the  problem of unfair taxation can be sum marized by the phrase ""true and signifi ca._nt  reduction  for  the middle-income  person."" I believe that the individual who  makes between $10,000 and $30,000 .is the  backbone  of  this  country's economic  health, and should be treated more fairly.  Without giving this group of people a  real incentive to save and to consume by allowing  them more disposible  in come-the problem of insumcient capital  investment will also continue to become  worse.  I would strongly urge my colleagues  in the Hous.e of Representatives to sup port and fight  for  tax  reduction and  simplification. I believe  that two bills  which I have cosponsored, H.R. 6808 and  H.R. 10136, would be especially bene ficial for the middle-income AmP.rican.  As an optimal solution,  the  indexing  solution which is employed in H.R. 6808  would be the best long-term tax policy  which Congress could enact. This bill  would  prevent  taxpayers  from  being  pushed  into  higher  and  higher  tax  brackets by tying the income tax rates  themselves  to  the cost-of-living  index.  As  people  receive  increased wages merely as a  result of  infiation-tbey  would not have to pay the taxes of the  higher brackets but would keep in the  same percentage bracket. This would  help middle-income people retain their  real purchasing power.  As a second-best alternative. I would  favor a drastic cut in the income  tax  rates at this time. As my colleagues may  recall, I voted for a substantial tax cut  during the House's consideration of H.R.  3477. This bill, as voted out of the Ways  and Means Committee, provided for a  moderate tax cut. I voted for the unsuc cessful attempt to substantially increase  the tax cuts provided by the committee.  Unfortunately,  this prop0sal  failed.  I  have also been one of the sp0nsors of  H.R. 10136, a bill  introduced by Con gressman JACK KEMP to reduce individ ual  tax burdens by an average of 33  percent. If Congress fails to enact some  version of  the  indexation  concept,  I  would fervently hope that Congress will,  at least, act.favorably on this tax reduc tion approach during its consideration of  President Carter's tax program.  ",1978
96,,95,-0.366,964,3,Mr. VANIK.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to express a few thoughts on the passing  of a great woman who helped make both  the City of Cleveland and our Nation a  better place. Mrs. Louise Stone Stokes,  widowed at an early age, and without  benefit of a formal education, managed  to instill in her sons, Louis and Carl, a  -sense of public duty and compassion to ward  their fellow man,  leading  them  both to seek public omce.  In these times, when family ties are  too often disrupted and broken by the  realities of our urban, mobile society, it  took a special type of woman to raise  two sons who rose  to national recog nition as public servants.  Louise Stokes  lived  in times of dy namic change and  transition.  In her  own  lifetime she witnessed  the entire  movement  toward  racial equality and  justice. She was a women of love and  compassion. Louis and Carl Stokes lost  a beloved mother, and in a real sense we  share their loss.  The following article of  interest on  Mrs. Stokes appeared in the Plain Deal er, on Monday, Feb. 13, 1978:  LOUISE STOKES, MOTHER OF Two POLITICAL  FIGURES  Louise Stone, Stokes, mother of Rep. Louis  Stokes, D-21, and former Cleveland Mayor  Carl B. Stokes, never let the fame of her sons  change her from a  sweet, gentle,  thankful  woman who cared about her neighbors and  her community.  Asked how  it felt  to be  the mother of  both a mayor and a congressman, she said,  ""People ask me that, but I don't feel any  different. I feel proud for them, but for me I don't feel any different.""  Mrs. Stokes, 82, died at 3: 10 p.m. yester day in the emergency room of St. Vincent  Charity Hospital from cardiac arrest.  She became ill after leaving the service at  Olivet  Institutional Baptist Church, 8712  Quincy Ave., and was taken to the hospital  by the emergency squad. The congressman  attended the service with his mother and  was with her when she died.  Mrs. Stokes was born on a farm at Wrens,  Ga., near Augusta. She was the eighth of 11  children of a Methodist minister.  She used to recall that she ""did a little bit  of everything that was to be done on a farm.""  That included milking cows before break fast,  gardening  and  cleaning.  In  recent  years, her interest in gardening continued  and she grew a few tomatoes in the backyard  of her former home at 3718 Lindholm Rd.,  Shaker Heights, along with her  roses and  other flowers.  Mrs. Stokes sold  that home about four  years ago and moved downtown  to Bohn  Towers, a Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing  Authority project. She tended many plants  in her suite and did her own cooking.  When she was growing up, Sunday school  and church were the main interests of the  Stone family. Her own ideas about educa tion were formulated by her father. ""It was  his whole heart,"" she recalled years later.  Her two older sisters managed to complete  a  couple of  terms of college, but young  Louise was not  so  fortunate. Her  formal  education ended in the eighth grade.  When she was 18 she went to Jacksonville,  Fla .. to help her married older sister. Later,  when another sister and her family moved  to Cleveland, Louise went along. That was  1918.  In Cleveland she met Charles Stokes, a  handsome young man who worked in a laun . dry. They were married in 1923.  Her husband died when Louis was 2¥2 and  ,JJarl was 13 months old.  Mrs:  Sto.kes' widowed mother,  Fannie  Stone, came to look after the children while  Mrs. Stokes worked as a domestic  for 40  years. Mrs. Stone died in 1941.   She worked for the Union Club, the for me~ Doanbrook and Cleveland hotels and  private familles at $2.50 an hour.  ""I had to work with my hands,"" she said  of  those years. ""It made me all  the more  concerned that my sons have the kind of  education I  lacked.""  Religion continued to be a part of life for  the Stokes family, as it had been for Louise  Stone in her childhood. If her sons made  excuses about attending church and Sunday  school,  they were  told ""No Sunday school,  no shows!""  In 1929 when  the Depression came,  the  family had to go on mothers' pension relief,  a forerunner of the Aid to Dependent Chil dren program. ""We got $25 a month,"" Mrs.  Stokes recalled.  ""Of course, I worked, too, since that wasn't  even rent money.""  Other lessons to her sons involved money.  ""When the boys got their first jobs, I asked  a certain amount of their earnings as room  rent. I wanted them to feel some responsi bility for their home. I didn't let on to them  but I always saved what they gave me and  put it aside for  them for a nest egg,"" she  recalled.  Besides sons Louis and Carl, now an NBC TV news commentator  in New York City,  survivors  include  seven  grandchildren;  brother, Pughsley Stone, 75, of Cleveland;  and sister, Estella Freeir...i.lii, 95, of Wrens, Ga.  Services are pending and will be conducted  jointly by the House of Wills and C. B. Miller  funeral home.  HOUSE ADMIN DOES IT A'.GIN  HON.

97,,95,0.204,964,3,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, as you  know, last fall the House voted itself an  increase  in the annual  allowance  for  district  office  rentals. This measure,  House Resolution 687, was brought to the  ftoor as a privileged resolution bypass ing the scrutiny of the Rules Committee  and preventing fioor amendments. This  increase went into effect as of January  1978. In addition, the House Administra tion Committee reorganized  the allow ance structure into two categories: clerk  hire and an official expenses account into  which 9 of  the 10 existing allowances  would be consolidated. In order to ease  the pain of changing our books, the com mittee authorized an increase in the offi cial expense account to $5,000 effective  January 1978. These  increases prompt  the following remarks:    I know it may seem incidental,  But about your district oftlce rental You now may spend a princely sum  For many oftlces instead of one.

98,,95,0.49,977,3,Mr. DORNAN.," Mr. Speaker, on Janu ary 31, 1.978, I entered into the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD an editorial which apCXXIV--229-Part 3  pea.red in the January 29 Kanadi ?dag yarsag,  the  largest Hungarian weeklY  publication ill the free world. This edi torial was entitled: ""Carter's Handling  of the Hungarian Crown-New Water gate Scandal. State Department's Per jured Testimony decided Court's Deci sion."" This editorial impugned the mo- .  tives of the administration in surrender ing the crown and the credibility of the  press in reporting the administration's  actions.  Today,  I  am writing  to President  Carter, Secretary of State Vance, Su preme Court Justice White, and Federal  Judge O'Connor, informing them of these  charges and asking  them  to  institute  such measures as  they may  consider  necessary to clarify the public record as  to what actually transpired.  Because  of.  the  seriousness of  the  charges made, I am urging the fullest  revelation of all facts surrounding the  incident. I shall of course report the an swers I receive to the full House of Rep resentatives. I believe that it is impera tive  that the record of  the executive,  judiciary, and  legislature be  clarified  for the public.  ALUMINUM wmING  HON. NEWTON I. STEERS, JR.  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 15, 1978  ",1978
99,House,95,0.347,990,3,Mr. MARTIN.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the Chair, and I will not take the full  time that is usually allotted.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday  I  received a  delayed Valentine message  from  our  friends at Common Cause. Their vice  president demonstrated a  :flair for im pugning the motives of others when he  reportedly said:  For those who stm wonder whether politi cal contributions can affect  congressional  action, we  recommend  that they carefully  follow  the  upcoming  procedures  in  the  Health Subcommittee.  That pearl of wisdom, Mr. Speaker,  refers to the Health Subcommittee of the  Ways and Means Committee, on which  it has heretofore been my pleasure  to  serve. He apparently objects to his own  assertion that campaign contributions to  me and some of my colleagues will in his  opinion determine  the outcome of our  vote on President Carter's nobly intended  hospital cost control legislation.  Since  I  am  normally  thin-skinned  about ad hominem attacks on my integ rity,  and  since Common Cause  cites  me  as  receiving $15,332  from health  groups in the 1974 and 1976 elections,  thereby outdistancing my colleagues, it  is in order that I reply. There are three  points  that I want to make: First,  to  clarify the record about my campaign  contributions; second, to discuss the rel ative merits and demerits of the legis lation  in question since  that properly  determines how I will vote; and :finally  to return their ftre by reminding col leagues about the true motives of Com mon Cause.  First, I did receive $15,332 from three  health-related political action commit tees in 1974 and 1976 combined, all of  which was properly reported at the time.  Of  that amount $10,000 was  received  during the 1974 campaign when I was not  a member of the Ways and Means Com mittee. Obviously, using simple subtrac tion, I  received less after I went onto  Ways and Means, a fact that would be of  no importance to an organization that  cares not who gets impugned.  What  is more,  that $10,000  in 1974  and another $1,666  in 1976 came from  the North Carolina Medical Society _i,o litlical action committee. known as MED  PAC. As a former chemistry professor in  real life, having taught many premedir.al  students, and knowing that most share  my fairly conservative political philoso phy, I was delighted to have their sup port, which I still welcome.  . The vote on this hospital cost legisla tion, however, should be based on its mer its, so let me turn to my second point.  While President Carter  commendably  wants to do something to hold down ris ing hospital costs, his legislation and sub sequent versions of it are not only ill conceived, but probably hazardous  to  you:-health. In its simplest form a law  to limit costs charged by a hospita.'i with out limiting costs charged to a hosoital  can only  result  in  reduced quality of  health care in its community. Any un controlled overhead cost which rises by  mor~ than 9 percent will  require new  surgical or diagnostic  improvements to  be eliminated. That hardly serves  the  health interests of the thousands of constituents who contributed 93 percent of  my campaign :finances in those 2 years.  What is more, the scheme before us is  not simple. It is very complex and con voluted. A hospital administration will  probably not know until 1980 or 1984  whether their 1979 operations were  in  compliance with this law, or in violation.  Mr. Speaker, thiS  is a demerit. It will  have a chilling effect on administrators  who would like to improve health service  but would forgo that in order to avoid  the risk of  inadvertently becoming an  outlaw. That consequence hardly serves  the health interest of the public.  In my opinion,  if we want to assist  hospitals in controlling costs, then let us  assist them, providing counsel and ad visers  from HEW and other hospitals.  There is no justi:fieation for punishing  people for trying to serve their neighbors.  As for President Carter, if he wants  to control costs let him start with some thing he runs, the Federal Government.  Let him bend his efforts  to clamp an  8-or 9-percent ;imit on the exponential  growth of Government.  If he succeeds, and I will do my best  to help him, then he will have earned the  privilege of advising others. If he fails,  if he signs appropriations which exceed  his budget, then we will hear no more out  of him about other administrators.  Now, let us take a good look at Com mon Cause. It is evident that hospital  administration  is not  their bag. They  are not expert on cost control legislation  or health needs. No, they are after other  game. What they want is to get Federal  funding for congressional elections. They  want us  to raid the U.S. Treasury,  to  make taxpayers shell out to pay for cam paigns of candidates they do not sup port as well as those they do support. If  that serves the public interest, it is ob vious the public has not caught on yet,  so 'Common Cause has to rattle a  few  cages. They have been beaten on  this  their real agenda, and now they resort to  impugning the motives of my subcom. mittee in hopes of intimidating us to sup port their scheme to get Federal funding.  Along the way, if they intimidate us into  supporting  this  ill-conceived, well-in tended  legislation  they could not care  less.  I believe  they have singled out this  issue only as a  fortuitous example. If  they recognize that the cost control legis lation lacks merit and will be defeated,  then so much the better for  them be cause they can attribute that deserved  def eat to other darker motives.  in the third place, Mr. Speaker,  let us not lose sight of  the motives of  Common Cause.  Meanwhile,  let us not  let  this mis chievous distraction they have presented  cause us  to lose sight of the fact that  the last thing the public health interest  needs  is  for Government  to dictate a  freeze on health care improvements.  ",1978
100,,95,-0.298,1003,3,Mr. FISHER.," Mr. Speaker, I have long  been interested in the problems and ben efits of citizens band <CB>  radios. The  following article appeared in the North ern Virginia Sun, a newspaper located in  my  congressional  district,  and was  brought to my attention by Edward F.  Sayle, one of my constituents. The arti cle points out the public service that a  CB radio can perform and I believe it  is worth reading:  A CB MAY  SAVE Youa LIFE  With an estimated one out of four motor  vehicles  in the Washington area equipped  with citizen band radios,  the value of the  radios as safety devices for use in emergen cies  is receiving greater interest than ever  before. Gone is the image of the trucker, the  eighteen wheeler,"" as using the radio pri marily  for  ""smokey  reports,"" CB parlance  for warnings of police vehicles and radar  units.  With  the  truckers accounting  for only  four per cent of CB radios in present use,  the concept of a  ""citizens"" personal com munications system, envisaged when the cit izens band radio frequencies were first au thorized by the government, has become a  reality.  With some 30 million CB radios currently  in use, and no-cost licenses being issued by  the Federal Communications Commission at  almost one million a month, motorists re porting emergencies or seeking highway as sistance have little difficulty in making radio  contact with another broadcaster willing to  telephone  the  request  to  public  safety  authorities.  In addition to a number of volunteer or ganizations montoring  the national emer gency channel, CB channel nine, increasing  numbers of police and fire units are also pro viding quick response to emergency calls over  the channel as a result of a federally-funded  National  Emergency Aid  Radio  which stresses  that ""help  is NEAR to the  monitoring public through use of the citi zens radio service.""  The government program, administered by  the National Highway Traftlc Safety Admin istration, hopes to reduce the response time  (NEAR)  3663  re an  will  the  the  to emergencies by u tllizing the popular CB  radio as another means for the citizen to call  for help, as well as to report problems related  to tramc safety and to receive other forms of  assistance .  Hundreds of area volunteers staff several  organizations dedicated to the monitoring of  channel nine and the rendering of assistance  when requested, be it the reporting of an ac cident or fire, arranging for emergency road  service, or giving directions to lost motorists.  One such local organization primarily serves  mariners on the Potomac River.  The name ""REACT"" has become synony mous with the word ""help"" in seeking such  assistance on  the emergency channel, be cause  that organization, Radio Emergency  Associated Citizens Tea.ms, in the largest and  oldest of the monitoring organizations.  Yet, other organizations  also  serve  same purpose without affilfatlon with  national  REACT  organization,  and  respond to emergency calls on channel nine.  Thus, an emergency monitor should be within  receiving distance for a motorist ""breaking""  on  channel  nine  for  ""REACT,""  ""for an  emergency,"" or ""for assistance,""  the most used phrases in seeking help.  Locally, Fairfax REACT and Nova REACT  serve as independent units within the area wide National  Capitol  REACT. Herndon  REACT fulfills the same role in a state-wide  amalgamation. Another emergency monitor ing organization, Affiliated League of Emer gency Radio Teams (ALERT), headquartered  in the National Press Building in Washing ton, has teams active in the area, as does  the Virginia State Emergency Radlp,  affiliate of the national U.S. Emergency As sistance Radio System (U.S. EARS).  Amateur  radio  operators  providing  sponse to emergency calls on channel nine,  call  their organization HAM, standing  for  Highway Assistance Modulators.  Civil Air Patrol units in Northern Virginia  assist  with  emergency  monitoring.  Arlington-based national organization, Radio  Emergency Safety Teams, known as REST  Marine, monitor the channel for assistance  to mariners on  the nation's seacoast end  iI.a.land waterways,  relaying emergency calls  to the Coast Guard.  Each  of  the  volunteer  organizations  named, with the exception of the Virginia  State  Emergency  Radio,  fields  mobile  monitoring units  to  render on-the-scene  motorist  assistance. Virginia State Emer gency Radio, an off-shoot of the California  State Emergency Radio which was organized  in conjunction with the California Highway  Patrol, permits  its members  to.operate as  base station monitors only.  The importance of such volunteer emer gency monitors ls seen in recent surveys con ducted by state highway patrols in Missouri  and Florida. Both found  that notification  time for a highway emergency by telephone  and other conventional means averaged u;  minutes.  When  the emergency was broadcast by  citizens band  radio, Missouri  found  the  average notification time to be nine minutes.  and Florida found it to be seven and one half minutes. They also noted that in many  cases, CBers were able to accurately describe  the situation at an accident scene so proper  emergency vehicles and personnel could be  dispatched  immediately, a.nd could  report  back from the scene on changing conditions  and emergency requirements.  Spokesmen for the emergency monitors are  unanimous in asking that requests for ns sistance on CB Chanel 9 adhere to a system  of priorities, with those making calls on the  lesser priorities  to ""stand by"" if a higher  priority request is being handled or must in terrupt  their  request  for  assistance. The  priorities, which also define the types of as sistance available on CB Chanel 9, a.re:  Priority One-Communications relating to  an existing situation dangerous to  lUe or  An  ",1978

105,House,95,-0.339,1211,3,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, as a co sponsor of this measure, I rise to urge its  swift approval by the House. Passage of  H.R. 10569 will permit this Nation to con tinue and expand its commitment to the  reduction and elimination of alcohol and  drug abuse among our young people .  I participated at hearings on this leg islation and was greatly impressed with  the accomplishments of the ADEA in re ducing alcohol and drug abuse  in our  schools. The most startling fact is that  they have achieved this success with a  paltry budget of $2 million per year.  Armed with this impressive record of  accomplishment, our subcommittee has  recommended that the program be ex tended through fiscal year 1983. I advo cated that the funding levels for this pro gram be significantly increased and am  pleased to note that H.R. 10569 author izes a three-fold increase in funding for  fiscal year 1978, and some $60 million for  fiscal years 1980-83.  The result of  this  legislation will be  measured in terms of continued reduc tions in the numbers of alcohol and drug  abuse victims in our schools. A related  and essential benefit will be a reduction  in crime and vandalism which today, are  ravaging schools throughout this Nation.  The emphasis which this program places  on prevention is proper.  We all seek cost-efficiency and results  in our Federal programs, yet all too often,  these goals are not realized. The Alco hol and Drug Abuse Education Act is an  outstanding program which has worked.  Its reward will be  the passage of H.R.  10569 by the House.  We must  take action  to insure that  our schools are not the feeding grounds  for alcohol and drug abuse. Education  programs must respond to the realities  of  the environment found  in many of  this Nation's schools. H.R. 10569 address es a very serious educational need and  its passage will be an important step in  the right direction.  ",1978
106,House,95,0.043,1211,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding and rise in  support of  the motion  to suspend the  rules on H.R. 10569, extending the Alco hol and Drug Abuse Education Act to  provide $67.6 million during the next 5  fiscal years-ranging from $6 million for  fiscal year 1978 to $18.4 million for fiscal  1976  1983. The alcohol and drug abuse educa ation program, which is administered by  the Department of Health, Education,  and Welfare, is designed to prevent drug  abuse by this Nation's school-age youth.  Mr. Speaker, under the leadership of  the distinguished chairman of the Select  Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Con trol <Mr. WOLFF) and the distinguished  gentleman from New York <Mr. RAN GELL), the Select Committee on Narcot ics Abuse and Control, of which I am a  member, held a  series of hearings  in  Sep.tember and November of  in  New York City regarding the rampant  use and abuse of drugs  in New York  City's school system. The ease by which  teenagers can obtain heroin,  cocaine,  PCP and marihuana was particularly  disturbing to members of the select com mittee, and H.R. 10569 can in my opinion,  help educate our teenagers on the dan gers of drug abuse.  The report by the Committee on Edu cation and Labor accompanying H.R.  10569 stated that the Alcohol and Drug  Abuse Education Act of 1970 ""empha sizes prevention, deterring our youth  from socially and personally destructive  behavior rather than mopping up  the  casualties when it is often too late."" This  is precisely what is needed if this Nation  is to educate its citizens, particularly our  youth, regarding the physiological and  emotional destructiveness that  accom panies drug abuse.  In its hearings and investigations, the  select committee has found that nearly  5,000 individuals, again, mostly the youth  of our Nation, annually succumb to drug  abuse.  In its ""Preliminary Staff Study-Drug  Abuse in New York City Schools,"" Jan uary 1977, the select committee's study  stated:  More than 41.1 percent of the students in  grades 7-12 who were users of drugs more  serious than marijuana during the 1974-75  school year received no exposure  to either  prevention or intervention services indicat ing a serious unmet need for such programs.  Although the users of such substances did  receive  the highest percentage of exposure  to both prevention and intervention, it is this  population that is most seriously  in need  of scme type of service. The fact that only  58.9 percent of  these  students who were  users of drugs more serious than marijuana  have been exposed to school-based drug pro grams underscores the critical need for in creasing prevention and  intervention serv ices  to  these students.  Mr. Speaker, the urgency for enacting  legislation to prevent alcohol and drug  abuse for all Americans should be obvious  to all of us. Accordingly I urge that my  colleagues support the motion offered by  the gentleman from Indiana <Mr. BRAn EMAs)  to suspend the rules and pass this  vitally significant measure.  ",1978

108,House,95,-0.479,1224,3,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker, February  16, 1978, marked the 60th anniversary of  the Declaration  of  Independence  of  Lithuania. In 1918, at the end of World  War I, the Lithuanian people proclaimed  their  independence and established a  free government. Today, we commemo rate this people's struggle for freedom  and self-determination.  The  long  history  of  Lithuania's  struggle for freedom goes back  to the  13th century when Lithuanians united  under King Mindaugas to defeat Rus sian aggression against their homeland.  Between  1350  and  1795,  Lithuania  formed an alliance with Poland. During  this period, Lithuania fought attempts  by Germany to dominate Russia and by  the Mongols and Tartars  to dominate  Europe. After  the partition of Poland,  Russia gained possession of Lithuania's  territory. During this period, the Lithu anians resisted attempts of the tsarist  government  to  thwart  their national  identity  by  political  and  economic  oppression.  Lithuania reestablished its territorial  independence in 1918, following World  War  I  and  the Bolshevik  revolution.  With the aid of allies, the Lithuanians  drove out the Bolshevik army. During  the next 20 years, they initiated a period  of reconstruction which resulted in un precedented  prosperity.  Lithuanians  were also free to speak their own lan guage and develop their own culture. As  a member of the League of Nations, its  autonomy and sovereignty were  inter nationally recognized.  Lithuania's freedom was  interrupted  by the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the par tition of Poland between Germany and  the Soviet Union in 1938. Shortly there afer,  the Soviet Union moved against  Lithuania by demanding permission to  station 20,000 troops in the country and  establish military bases. By June 1940  the Soviets had begun to establish a puppet government which requested entry  into the U.S.S.R. as a republic. In re sponse to popular resistance, the Rus sians deported dissidents and  further  implemented  repressive  measures  against the population. The severity of  this repression has never abated, but dis sent to Soviet rule over Lithuania con tinues to exist.  Mr. Speaker,  the Soviet Union con tinues  to suppress Lithuanian dissent  in violation of the Helsinki Accords and  basic human rights. The United States  must defend the human rights of Lith uanians at the Belgrade Conference. Ac cordingly, world opinion will encourage  Lithuania to continue her struggle for  national identity. Today, I join all Amer icans of Lithuanian descent in recog nizing and encouraging Lithuania's :fight  for  justice and the reestablishment of  freedom.  ",1978
109,House,95,0.277,1224,3,Mr. WYDLER.," Mr. Speaker, recently  the American people had the opportu nity to see an excellent documentary on  the attempted defection, brutal capture  and imprisonment by Soviet authorities,  and ultimate emigration to the United  States of the brave Lithuanian seaman,  Simas  Kudirka.  This  documentary  brought the dry words ""Soviet oppres sion"" to life for many Americans.  On the immediate and personal level,  Simas Kudirka's story had a happy end ing. He and his family are now  living  in  freedom  in  this country. But un fortunately,  for  the approximately 3 %  million of his Lithuanian countrymen,  the nightmare of repression continues.  The Kudirkas are undoubtedly glad to  be out of that vast prison camp that is  the U .S.S.R. But who can be really happy  while one's homeland remains enslaved?  Lithuania remains a captive nation, and  this is a sorrow not only for the many  Americans of Lithuanian descent, but  ",1978

137,,95,0.347,1354,3,Mr. MARTIN.," Mr. Speaker, faced with  a confusing and anxious array of charges  that saccharin, hair dyes, coffee, natural  foods, and even anxiety itself can cause  greater cancer incidence in test animals,  the public and the Congress are under standably bewildered. Are we helplessly  overexposed to a carcinogenic environ ment? Must we ban the food supply and  all other chemicals to protect ourselves?  Will it help to ban the relatively trivial  hazards while neglecting more potent  substances on the grounds that industry  can be controlled and agriculture can not-or vice versa?  Or, should we just look the other way?  Amid all this confusion and complex ity, one voice of leadership within the  Consumer Product Safety Commission is  beginning to be heard and heeded na tionally. Commission vice chairman Bar bara Hackman Franklin has called on  the President, the Congress, and all allied  regulatory agencies to frame a sensible,  reasonable approach to the regulation of  substances suspected of causing cancer.  Her approach is sound. She recognizes  that there is, after all, a great danger  from some substances. She recognizes, as  well, that absolute safety, the basic prin ciple of the Delaney Clause that threat ened to ban saccharin, is impossible. She  recognizes that the public is best served  by an approach which considers the rela tive risk of a substance and also its rela tive benefits.  It is  to acquaint our colleagues, Mr.  Speaker, with her sensible philosophy  that I submit for the RECORD, the text of  an address given  in December by vice  chairman Franklin to the Town Hall of  California:  REMARKS OF HON. BARBARA HACKMAN  FRANKLIN  CHEMICALS AND CANCER-A GOVERNMENT  SNAFU?  So  I am very honored to be your guest today  and appreciate the gracious welcome.  Town Hall,  for many years, has been a  barometer of national economic, political and  social  thought. More  frequently  than not,  the seeds planted here have sprouted broader  public discussions, even new directions of  considerable significance.  I  approached  this occasion carefully,  sorting  through many  subjects  to  decide  which I should devote these moments to.  I started out with  two good possibilities  and immediately narrowed the list down to  five.  One prime candidate was the economy. So  as a Harvard Business School ""faithful,""  I  consulted with several economists on what  they thought I should say. They said there  may be a downtun.  to  the upturn in  the  making, a slowdown of the speed-up and that  while  the confidence of the business com munity is shaky, this uncertainty could be  replaced with an upturn if only a series of  major adjustments and readjustments are  made. Hence, I decided not to concentrate  today on the economy.  Next, I thought about regulatory reform another  topic of  intense concern  to  this  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  February 21, 1978  audience and  to me. But I  scrapped  this  theme too, since it was only last week that  Rona.Id Reagan reminded radio listeners that  it was the Consumer Product Safety Com mission which once  recalled our own  toy  safety buttons due to sharp edges and a. high  level of lead-in-paint.  More seriously, the economy and regulatory  reform a.re timely and important issues, to be  sure. But there is another one, equally signif icant, which I chose to discuss today.  It is the little-understood, thorny dilemma  of chemicals and cancer-a problem that may  have a devastating  impact on millions of  people,  a  problem  increasingly central  to  your own businesses. My contention is that  we must find more rational, responsible ways  to deal with the issues in pretty short order.  In a real-life twist to what was science fic tion,  some  substances  have  surfaced  as  potential hazards not only to the environ ment but to human life as well.  The rallying cry  is cancer,  the six-letter  word that probably summons more dread and  fear in the minds of American people than  any other disease.  And with good reason.  In the U.S., Cancer is the second leading  cause of death. Among developed nations, it  also ranks number two. This year in the U.S.  alone, some 900,000 new cases will be diag nosed.  Looking a.head,  the situation may be no  better. Indeed, it may worsen, due to the long  incubation period of the disease and its in clination  to strike middle-aged and older  Americans, our fastest growing population.  Expectations are that we must deal with high  ilncidence rates for years to come, even if  cures (such as those developed for many vic tims of Hodgkin's disease  and  childhood  leukemia.) wero announced as we meet here  today.  Eventually,  according  to  the American  Cancer Society, one in every four of us will  develop cancer, and about two-thirds of those  who get it are likely to die.  With this background, it is understandable  why as a nation, we must make the best pos sible efforts  to get at the root causes and  cures  and  to  insist on better  diagnosis,  treatment and  rehabllitation. Three  suc cessive Presidents and  the Congress have  recognized the importance of this work, they  have boosted, for example, the budget of the  National Cancer Institute,  the ""Pentagon""  of the effort, from $180 million in 1970 to $815  million this year.  It is an expensive proposition. The program  is big. But the stakes are high too.  And like so many areas of public health  e.nd safety that seem to cost a  lot and rely  heavily on research, controversy mounts in  direct proportion to the rate at which con clusive answers and miraculous cures reem  outside our grasp.  One controversy  ts whether the strategy  aimed more at cures than at prevention is  lopsided, in view of accumulating evidence  that most cancers-perhaps as many as 60 to  90 percent of them-are environmental in  origin.  Sixty to ninety percent? It's an astonishing  figure, based on the best estimates available.  What are environmental factors? They in clude smoking, alcohol consumption, diet,  exposure to radiation-and a range of chem ical and other substances.  What does this mean? It means that more  and more,  the concern  is over potentially  dangerous substances in the air we breathe,  the food we eat, the products we use and the  manufacturing processes we depend upon.  And, more and more, a target of the con cern is chemicals.  It was the 1959 cranberry scare which first  arou9~d the public consciousness about en vironmental hazards. Others followed. Con gressional hearings over passage of the new  Toxic Substances Control Act sparked some  of the current debate. But for most Ameri cans, it was the proposed ban on saccharin  earlier this year which brought the messag~  home. With President Carter's recent signing  of legislation to delay the ban pending the  outcome of  further  testing,  I  believe we  should expect even more public attention.  Developments along this line are changing  the thrust of the battle against cancer. The  developments are sending scientists scurrying  back to their labs and lawyers back to law  libraries. They are provoking Congressional  hearings and  regulatory proposals  in  the  Federal Register at a rapid clip, and are fill ing the nation's newspaper columns and air  waves with what cynics call the ""cancer of  the week"" syndrome.  Across the board, chemicals and cancer are  escalating into a major issue headed toward  a full-blown crisis. Public confusion, and the  pressures on government and business ""to do  something"" are running at about 75 decibels.  Will this situation result in a government  snafu? Frankly, it is too soon to tell.  But it is not too early  to make another  prediction.  As a nation, we must come to grips with  all of the issues and seek solutions that in dustry can  live with, government can  live  with and most  importantly  the American  people can live with. If we don't, we may well  have a bureaucratic snafu. But we w111 have  far more on our hands that that. We will be  courting a crisis, even a calamity whose con sequences stretch far beyond  the banks of  the Potomac and into virtually every home,  community and workplace.  Why do I say this?  Because what is at stake is the very real  posstb111ty that we stand on the threshold of  reducing the ominous threat of cancer. At  the same time, we face  the possib111ty that  havoc is at hand for the $100-b1llion-a-year  chemical  industry and for countless other  industries which use chemical compounds in  a variety of ways-with distinct benefits to  consumers.  The hard, cold reality is that even this rep resents only the tip of the iceberg.  Beneath the surface are technical, political  and ethical questions that are highly com plex and intricate.  At our agency, the point has been boldly  underscored time and time again through out our first four years. With a staff of 890  and a $40 million budget to deal with far  more than chronic hazards, the Commission  already has addressed fluorocarbons, lead-in paint, vinyl chloride, asbestos, acrylonitrlle,  benzene, and Tris.  It is our struggle over children's sleepware  that particularly illustrates the difficulties.  Some years ago,  the Federal Government  ordered  that children's sleepwear be made  flame retardant to protect children from se rious burn injuries. So it was, with the re sult  that  the severity of childhood burns  has been reduced.  But concern suddenly arose with charges  that Tris, one of the chemicals which in dustry used  to make children's sleepwear  meet  the Federal regulation, was carcino genic.  After presentation of substantial evidence  (including linking the results of long-range  animal tests to human experience) and after  serious economic, social, and legal considera tions were weighed, the Commission banned  Tris last April.  Today, the debate rages on.  Inside the courtrooms and outside, there  are those who maintain too much was done  by the government and those who complain  of too little. Some object to the procedures  followed. Others find  fault with  the sub stance of the ban; still others, with its im plementation.  Judges still are wrestling with questions  like these : In proceeding under one section  ",1978

After being judged the fin est in the State in content, originality,  and delivery, Miss Story has brought  her speech to the national competition,  here in Washington.  Special achievements are a way of life  for this fine young Tennessean. Among  her honors are a 1975 ""most .outstanding  youth"" award, 1977 ""business education  award"" and ""American history award,""  and listings on her school's honor rolls.  She has been named to ""Who's Who""  and  the  Society  of American High  School Students.  In her speech, Miss Story states with  pride  that  ""America  Is Mine""-com plete with beauties and flaws given her  by each of her citizens: her sentiment  that ""America will be what I make it""  could well serve as the slogan for each  of us in this Nation, and particularly, in  this Congress.  Therefore,  it  is with pride  in Lisa  Kathryn's story, her accomplishments,  and her ideals, that I commend to you  the winning speech for  the Tennessee  VFW Voice of Democracy scholarship  program:  VOICE OF DEMOCRACY ESSAY  (By Lisa Kathryn Story)  Recently, America celebrated her bicen tennial. The festivities which followed stood  for 200 years of love and labor on the pa.rt of  millions of men and women;  labor that was  both good and bad. Since  the Mayfiower  Compact of 1620, Americans have strived to  work together ""for our better Ordering and  Preservation."" As an American citizen, it ls  my responsibility to be a. worthy representative of this historic nation.    Granted, there are times when the nation  does not seem worthy of being represented,  due to corrupt or unfair government, but I  must remember that ""we the people"" have  elected and put them in otnce. As a. voting  citizen, it will be my responsibility to take  all elections seriously, choose the best man,  and see that he ls elected. I! I do not do my  part by voting, I cannot complain later 1!  the wrong or unjust candidate wins the elec tion. There .ls no excuse for not voting.  As far as obeying the laws, it ls quite a  temptation to go a.head and do something  because ""everybody""  is doing  it, but as  a.  good American citizen and as a. Christian,  I cannot. The Apostle Paul is noted in his  letter to the Romans to say, ""Obey the gov ernment, for God ls the one who has put it  there. There ls no government anywhere that  God has not placed in power."" So with me, it  ls not just a matter of choice to respect my  country  and  her  government;  it  is  a.  commandment.  But America is more than documents and  declarations; it ls a country of people, work ing together to make a. better world. A coun try has to be more than just the land and  the government. Without the people, without  love and concern, a country would be noth ing. America will be what I work to to make  it.  As a child, I was taught to respect Amer ica. Being the daughter of a man who had  served in the Armed Forces, I often heard  the phrase, ""love  it or  leave  it.""  I whole  heartedly support this statement now, as a.  young adult. After America offers her citizens  so much, they could at least respect her. This  is not to say that one cannot find fault in  the country, but in finding fault, the resoect  should not be lost. Discovering weak points,  taking a positive look and approach to them  and correcting  them actually strengthens  the country.  Freedom-it is a big word. Some foreign  visitors have no concept of it, and it ls my  responsibility to show those visitors and im migrants who do make it to America., a. good  America. I must show them the love and care  and patriotism our ancestors had, to start  the country. A phrase familiar to students at  my school applies also to American citizens.  It says, ""Remember who you are and what  you represent."" Every time I meet a non American, I try to remind myself that I may  be the only American they see. and I want  them to have a. picture of which I can be  proud.  Many people today, as part of the bicen tennial, have been asked if they would have  signed the Declaration of Independence. Al most as many of them said no as yes. Ques tioning myself after rereading the Declara tion, I have decided I would. True, it is a  very radical document, but it was necessary.  The strong W')rds of Thomas Jefferson in the  Declaration, would have been the words to  persuade me to sign and join forces to create  the United States of America. These men did  not expect immediate peace: most of them  did not even foresee peace in their life times.  What they did see was their children. All too  often, I take the easy way out of responsibil ities by saying,  ""Why should  I worry? It  won't affect me.  I won't even be around  then."" But when I really stop to think about  it, I want to build a good America and a good  world for my children. I realize now that it  is my responsibility.  Now that I have given all these other rea sons for being responsible to America, I have  come to my final and most important reason:  America  is mine. I was born here;  I am a  native, a natural citizen. No one can take  this honor away from me, for it ls not a ma terial possession. With all her faults. with  all her flaws, with all her people and their  love, she is mine. I cannot really exolain why  I feel the way I do, for love cannot be defined.  As my thoughts collect, I  realize just what  America does mean to me, and just what re sponsibilities I do have as an American.  My responsibility to America is to serve her  proudly. I serve her because I must, and I  serve her because she served me first. I serve  her for my children and because I want a  better world. I serve her because she ls Inine.  It is my hope that my ancestors could be  proud of me and of the country they fought  so hard for. What they began more than 200  year5 ago has continued, grown, and prospered to be the United States of America as  we know it today.

CDU/CSU GROUP IN THE GERMAN  BUNDESTAG ""WHITE PAPER"" ON  THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION  IN GERMANY AND OF THE GER MANS IN EASTERN EUROPE  HON. JACK F. KEMP  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 21, 1978  conferences~  ",1978
139,,95,0.3,1367,3,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, one of the  most significant initiatives taken by the  Carter administration has been to en courage the totalitarian states of East ern Europe to extend fundamental hu man rights to their citizens. The subject  of human rights has been widely dis cussed in the public media as well as in  international  diplomatic  Perhaps  the most  important  interna tional discussions of the question of hu man rights has been in the context of  the initial review conference of the Final  Act of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe.  One of the most valuable reports pre sented to the Review Conference in Bel grade, Yugoslavia was a White Paper  prepared by the CDU/CSU Group in the  West German Bundestag on the human  rights situation  in Germany. The ac count of the gross violations of human  rights by the East German regime un derscores  the odious character of  the  present government. The  report pre pared by the CDU/CSU group performs  a valuable service for America because it  calls attention to an aspect of the human  rights situation in Eastern Europe which  is likely to be overlooked in our empha sis upon violations of human rights by  the Soviet Union. The behavior of the  East German  regime  toward  its own  citizens is worthy of the worst aspects of  the Gulag Archipelago  in  the Soviet  Union.  I have appended the text of the con clusions and  recommendations of  the  White Paper which summarizes the find ings of the report at this point:  [CDU/CSU Group in the German Bundestag]  WHITE PAPER ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN GERMANY AND OF THE GERMANS IN  EASTERN EUROPE  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  In the Final Act of the CSCE all signatory  States have explicitly undertaken to respect  and allow the exercise of the human rights  and fundamental freedoms of their citizens  as an essential factor in the development of  friendly relations among them. This obliga tion has made  their domestic conduct a  yardstick for their good intentions as regards  friendly relations. Now, therefore, the realisa tion of human rights deserves the same status  as respect for national sovereignty or the ob ligation not to resort to force, including th~  inviolability of frontiers.  The Belgrade review meeting will  there fore be the first test of this solemn pledge.  As experience since H~lsinki has shown, vio lations of human rights considerably weaken  mutual truBt. They thus hamper co-operation  between the signatory States and jeopardise  the process of real detente in Europe.  ",1978
140,,95,-0.422,1380,3,Mr. DRINAN.," Mr. Speaker, the House  will soon consider H.R. 9622, the bill to  eliminate diversity of citizenship as a  basis  for  jurisdiction  in  the Federal  courts. Under the diversity jurisdiction,  Federal courts have  the authority  to  adjudicate disputes between citizens of  different States even if the controversy  involves only questions of State or local  law. The Constitution provides for such  jurisdiction  because,  in  1789,  it was  feared that State courts might discrimi nate against out-of-State residents. The  Constitution also, however, gives to Con gress  the ultimate authority to decide  whether and to what degree the diversity  jurisdiction  should  be  exercised.  In  reporting favorably on H.R. 9622,  the  Judiciary Committee determined  that  the essentially ""protective"" role of diver sity jurisdiction is no longer needed.  A few weeks ago, I had the occasion,  along with other colleagues on the Judi ciary Committee,  to participate  in  a  seminar on the administration of jus tice held in Williamsburg, Va. Altering  the diversity jurisdiction was one of the  topics examined. Judge Elmo B. Hunter,  of the western district of Missouri, pre sented a very cogent statement on the  necessity to eliminate diversity jurisdic tion. As background to and in support of  the pending  legislation <H.R. 9622),  I  insert in the RECORD at this point the  thoughtful remarks of Judge Hunter:  FEDERAL DIVERSITY JURISDICTION Is No  LONGER JUSTIFIABLE  (By Judge Elmo B. Hunter)  From what you have heard  from prior  speakers you }{now there is an ongoing need  to examine anew  the purpose  the  federal  court.s serve and should serve in our democ racy if those courts are to fulfill their con stitutional function. This examination must  include as a  top priority a proper jurisdic tional balance between the federal and state  court systems, and an as.signmen t  to each  system those cases most appropriate to that  system in the light of the basic principles of  federalism. The guiding principle  is  that  that there should be federal court jurisdic tion where federal questions are at stake, and  state court jurisdiction where state questions  are at stake and state courts are available  to provide an adequate forum.  My assignment is to briefly but specifically  review the subject of federal diversity juris diction to determine how it came to be, the  purposes  it serves, and whether or not it  should remain as a basis for federal jurisdic tion. Such a review must include a recogni tion of  the burden placed on  the federal  court.s by diversity jurisdiction and consid eration of the ability of the state courts to  take it over.  Federal diversity jurisdiction is made pos sible by Article III of our Constitution which  was drafted so as to permit but not to man date federal court jurisdiction based on ""con troversies between citizens of different states  and between a state or the citizens thereof  and foreign states, citizens or subjects."" The  grant was not self executing.  Thus,  the Constitution gave  to Congress  the power and duty to decide if there should  be federal diversity jurisdiction, and to what  extent, if any.  At  that early hour of our history our  Courts were quite different from today. In  our nation's First Judiciary Act, passed in  1789, Congress created not just one set of  inferior courts, but two. Each of the twelve  states was given at least one district court.  Only a handful of Judges were needed to man  those few district courts. Congress also cre ated three Circuit Courts. Judges were pro vided for the Supreme Court, five in number,  and for the District Courts, but the Circuit  Courts were given no judges of their own. In stead the Circuit Courts were  to hold two  sessions each year within the circuit, with  the Circuit Court consisting of two justices  of the Supreme Court and the District Judge  of the district. Population was sparse; travel  very  limited;  and  interstate business was  minimal. It was in this setting that, in the  First Judiciary Act, Congress created diver sity jurisdiction. The grant of such jurisdic tion had a de minimis result as indications  are that few cases were filed on that basis.  To this day there is no consensus as to why  diversity jurisdiction was made a permissive  basis of federal court  jurisdiction; or why  Congress opted for it. It was simply not de bated or explained at the time.  Scholars, and others, over the years, have  endeavored to come up with explanations for  the Congressional action taken in 1789. The  traditional explanation  is a  fear that state  courts  in  those early days would be prej udiced against  those  litigants from out of  state. Mr. Justice Marshall mentioned this as  a possible explanation in an opinion in Bank  of  the United States v. Deveaux  in 1809  (3 L. Ed. 38).  Whatever  such  prejudice  as may  have  existed in 1789, it is acknowledged today to  be either de minimis or nonexistent. Today  our people travel much and freely. They re side first in one state and then in another.  They move  as  their business or personal  convenience dictates. Their  families,  rela tions, business associates and  friends also  move often and  frequently  live  in other  states. There is no longer any real risk of  prejudice based on state of residence.  And today it is generally recognized that  it  is unrealistic  to believe  that prejudice  against a  litigant merely because he or she  is a citizen or resident of a different state is  a significant factor in arriving at justice in a  case. Today's mOdern state courts, with their  stress on objectivity and fairness, and with  their sensitive appellate reviews can be re lied on to be free of that type of prejudice.  Moreover, since federal juries are now drawn  from the same registration or voter lists as  state jurors, although from a wider area with64  in the state, there is no advantage prejudice wise in having a  federal  jury over a state  jury.  Often federal  judges have earlier served  as state court  judges. If a personal  testi monial is permitted-it is strange to me as  one who has been a state court judge for  13Y:! years and one who has sat on all the  courts of record of his state-trial, appellate  and supreme court-that I may have been  susceptible of such prejudice then but have  been purged of it for  the 12 years I have  been a federal judge.  A second reason occasionally suggested for  retention of federal diversity jurisdiction is  that it may provide a forum for cases over  which no state court could obtain jurisdic tion. This  is a  rare possibility in view of  modern-day state service statutes, and state  interpleader statutes. And that possibility be comes meaningless since the federal  inter pleader statute (28 U.S.C.A. 1335) and federal  question statutes remain and provide federal  jurisdiction. These assure that a forum will  always be available, even in the absence of  federal diversity jurisdiction.  A  third  reason  sometimes mentioned  is  that it is a function of federal diversity ju risdiction to assure a high level of justice to  the  traveler or visitor from another state.  Since the Supreme Court's landmark deci sion in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.  (1938), the federal courts are required to  apply state law in diversity cases.  The federal courts in such cases do not,  however, authoritatively determine state law;  only state courts do so. Thus, the diversion  of state law litigation to federal tribune both  delays the authoritative development of state  law and  imposes upon  federal  courts  the  risky,  laborious and wasteful  task of pre dicting what the state law may be on issues  upon which only the state courts may speak  with authority. Often the federal courts an ticipate  differently  from what  the  state  courts later decide. This is not the way to  assure justice to the traveler or visitor from  another state;  it  is counter-productive  to  the process of justice and is an undesirable  and needless interference with state auton omy. Nor is diversity jurisdiction justified in  order to encourage free movement and busi ness activity throughout the country. Aboli tion of diversity jurisdiction in 1978 is irrele vant to free  trade and free movement and  would not create any impediments to citi zens' travel and business.  Even  so,  some  believe  that  the  federal  courts  are  superior-Le., better  than  the  state courts, and, hence, should be given ju risdiction. Certainly this attitude is unsup portable as applied  to state  law problems  where state  law controls. Such a belief,  if  carried to its logical conclusion, would result  in the placing of all litigation in the federal  court system, and would abolish  the state  courts of this nation. Our state courts have  exclusive jurisdiction over murder cases with  the death penalty applicable; they have ju risdiction over crimes calling for sentences  up to and including life; they have jurisdic tion over our property rights, our marital  rights,  inheritance  rights,  etc. Historically  they have performed capably. To say they are  not to be trusted with the trial of an auto mobile collision event because of the hap penchance  of  diversity  of  citizenship  shocking and illogical.  Actually,  in modern society diversity ju risdiction simply provides a  tactical weapon  for lawyers, without advancing the cause of  justice. Ingenious attorneys have invented a  number of devices both to create and to de feat diversity  jurisdiction, as it suits their  tactical interests in the particular suit. Such  things as transferring causes of action, as signments  for  collection  purposes  only;  transferring small  interests;  changing  the  state of  incorporation;  appointing out-of state administrators and guardians, selecting  out-of-state class action representatives are  illustrative of tactical or collusive efforts to  is  ",1978

142,Senate,95,-0.124,12,7,Mr. JAVITS.," Mr. President, there are  a number of other questions in this re spect that I wish to go into now.

144,Senate,95,-0.362,64,7,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, today  I introduce a bill to designate the build ing known as the Ozark National Forest  Headquarters Building  in Russellville,  Ark., as the ""Henry R. Koen Forest Serv ice Building.""  The mayor of Russellville, the Honor able M. J.

Born at Bellefonte, Ark., in the heart  of  the Ozarks,  the son of Thomas S.  Koen and Tennessee Breece Koen, his  active career  in conservation spanned  four critical decades, from 1913 to 1943.  Subsequent to his retirement from the  Forest Service in 1943, he still maintained  an active  interest in conservation.

145,Senate,95,-0.1,77,7,Mr. BROOKE.," Mr. President,  I am  introducing amendments to the bills be ginning markup by the Banking Commit tee which establish consumer protections  and  responsibilities  in electronic  fund  transfer  systems.  These  amendments  address some of the objections to EFT  consumer legislation raised by financial  institutions and others while  insuring  that basic consumer protections are pro vided in new electronic banking services.  Many representatives of the financial  industry urge  the Banking Committee  to delay action on any EFT consumer  protections  because  restrictions  will  stifle  innovative competition  for  cus tomers of new banking  services  and  hinder  further  development  of  elec tronic banking. They further argue that  EFT systems can increase payment con venience and security for consumers and  reduce the cost and time of fund trans fers  for  financial  institutions  and  merchants and, thus, should be allowed  to develop in an unrestricted fashion. I  agree with this assessment of potential  benefits from EFT, but also  recognize  that increasing numbers of fund trans fers are made electronically and  that  consumers must be assured they will not  lose the protections now provided in the  check and credit card payment systems.  I  believe  the Banking Committee  should proceed to mark up S. 2470 and  S. 2546 in order to preserve basic con sumer  protections  as payments  shift  from check and credit card systems to  electronic  fund  transfers.  In  several  areas where these bills differ, I am pro posing compromise amendments to in sure  that  consumer  protections  are  maintained  but  without  imposing  unnecessary hindrances on EFT serv ices. Compromises may be appropriate in  other areas which the committee agenda  identifies  as  outstanding  issues. My  amendments  are  offered,  though,  to  begin the process of maintaining con sumer protections while recognizing le gitimate concerns of financial  institu tions and others  involved  in providing  electronic fund transfer systems.  ANALYSIS OF THE AMENDMENTS  Amendment No. 1747 will require the  Federal Reserve Board  to  issue model  clauses for disclosure of EFT terms and  conditions. By using appropriat~ model  disclosure clauses financial institutions  will be assured of meeting the disclosure  requirements and consumers will be in formed  in readily understandable lan guage of their rights and responsibili ties and other account terms relating to  electronic banking services.  Flexibility in disclosure requirements  will  be provided  by  amendment No.  1748. First, the Federal Reserve Board  is authorized  to determine when dis closures are made. Generally full dis closure o~ EFT rights anC. responsibili ties would be made when a consumer  signs up for a ne~; electronic banking  service. However, when a consumer au thorizes  his  employer  to  deposit  his  salary electronically, disclosures by the  bank may be practical only after  the  first electronic  fund dP.posit  is made.  Second, this amendment will not require  disclosure of limitations on EFT account  usage that would compromise EFT sys tem security. Consumers should be in formed of most limitations on account  usage so  they would not, for example,  discover  late at night or in an emer gency  situation  that  only  a  limited  amount of cash can be withdrawn from  an automate1 teller machine. The Board  however is given flexibility tc waive dis closure of  the details of limitations if  their  confidentiality  is  necessary  for  system security. This could include the  particular usage patterns  that would  trigger  a  security  system  to  suspect  fraudulent use and freeze further use of  the EFT card. Finally, this amendment  permits changes in an EFT system with out prior disclosure to consumers if those  changes must be  implemented quickly  to maintain or  restore  the  system's  security.  Amendment No. 1749  recognizes  the  legitimate point that many savings as sociations are not equipped to prepare  regular account statements and are now  receiving electronic deposits of salary  and social security benefits with pass books providing  the documentation of  account transfers. This amendment will  allow continued use of passbooks for ac counts which only receive deposits elec tronically. Where electronic payments  are made  from an account,  periodic  statements are  required so consumers  will have clear and frequent records of  funds withdrawn from their account.  A highly controversial  issue  in elec tronic fund  transfers  is whether con sumers should be able to withhold pay ment from a merchant if there is a dis pute about the goods or services. Con sumers can now  stop payment on a  check or withhold payment on certain  credit card purchases for over $50 and  they  seek  similar  protection  against  faulty merchandise  if purchases  are  made  through EFT. FinancieJ  institu tions and retailers argue that electronic  fund transfers will be instantaneous and  should be treated like final payments in  cash. Furthermore, the proposed reversal  provision of S. 2546  is seen as inviting  abuse of  the system by allowing con sumers  to reverse a  transfer over $50  within 3 days even if there is no dispute  with the merchant and then leaving the  merchant without recourse to settle the  dispute and get paid or to have the pur chase returned.  Finally it is argued that EFT systems  will not be accepted by merchants if even  a limited reversal procedure is required.  The evidence speaks against this. Credit  cards are widely accepted even with pro vision for consumers to withhold pay ment on disputed purchases for over $50.  No evidence has been presented that con sumers abuse the protection afforded by  withholding  credit card payments or  stopping payment on checks, and only  an infinitesimal percentage of purchases  are the subject of disputes which require  use of these features.  Amendment No.  1750 provides  that  consumers can reverse a  transfer over  $50 within 3 days of the purchase if the  reversal is based on a dispute about the  amount of the transfer or the goods or  .services. Written confirmation of  the  dispute from  the consumer can be re quired by the financial institutior. and  provided to the merchant. The reversal  would not affect the underlying purchase  agreement between  the merchant and  the consumer. This amendment is very  similar to the current Federal law about  withholding payment on certain credit  card purchases. Finally, the Federal Re serve Board is authorized to provide for  value dating or other mechanisms which  provide  the same consumer protection  ",1978
146,Senate,95,-0.456,116,7,Mrs. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  I  want to bring to the attention of my col leagues an editorial and article from the  Des Moines Register on the reform of  foreign aid. One of Hubert's last major  initiatives was a bill to rethink and reor ganize U.S. foreign assistance efforts. He  felt that social and economic injustice poverty, ignorance, and disease-present  a growing threat to our security in an  interdependent world. He cared deeply  about these issues and spent the last few  weeks of his life working on this bill.  Senator CLARK has been a strong sup porter of the legislation. As the article  points out, Senator CLARK ""has made -a  name for himself in both foreign affairs  and agricultural policy."" The increasing  importance of U.S. agricultural exports  and the growing gap in food production  in the developing countries emphasize  the close  links between foreign policy  and agriculture.  Iowa is  fortunate  to  have a Senator whose expertise bridges  these crucially important areas.  Senator CLARK and Hubert shared a  common concern and dedication to im proving the U.S. capacity to respond to  the needs of people  in the developing  countries. They discussed this legislation  and collaborated on its drafting prior to  Hubert's death. I am pleased that Sen ator CLARK is working to enact Hubert's  last challenge.  Mr. President, I submit these articles  be printed in the RECORD.  [From the Des Moines Register, Mar. 11, 19781  HUMPHREY'S LEGACY ON Am  The United States was one of the first and  for a  time the most generous of nations in  giving help to the underdeveloped world, but  in recent years the U.S. has slipped to one  of the least generous of advanced nations.  Scandalous, and a clear future danger to the  country.  President Carter wants a 7.5 percent boost  in funds for foreign aid in fiscal 1979, and  continued boosts for five years. He's right.  Frequent  tinkering with  foreign aid by  each new president and each new Congress  left its administration in a mess. President  Carter's administrator,  John G1lligan, bas  been trying to hammer into shape the major  foreign aid outfit, the Agency for Interna tional Development for nearly a year.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  wants expansion of aid, but also a shakeup of  the whole organization. A subcommittee long  chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey spent  months working on the project, and a col league from both houses and both parties  introduced  a  blll  embodying Humphrey's  ideas on Jan. 25. An article elsewhere on this  page describes  the proposal. Senator Dick  Clark  (Dem.,  Ia.)  is a  supporter-and we  hope he becomes a leader in the fight for the  bill.  The administration should get behind the  bill, a.nd Congress should pass it-plus the  increase in funds the president seeks.  [From the Des Moines Register, Mar. 11, 1978]  REFORM OF FOREIGN AID: WILL WE RISE TO  HHH's LAST CHALLENGE?  il (By Lauren Soth)  Every once  in a while during his  long  career in the U.S. Senate, Hubert Humphrey  forced his fellow Americans to sit back from  the daily grind, look beyond their immediate  problems and think. He was provocative that  way. It's bard work  to  think, and Hubert  is still making us do it.  In his  last  few months, he was deeply  concerned with America's future in a world  be thought was entering an era of upheaval.  He felt  that conditions of social and eco nomic  injustice  in  the world-poverty,  literacy, disease-were a growing  threat to  our security.  Demand for change, he said,  taking an  expression from Churchill, is like a gathering  storm. He was talking, of course, about the  demands of the poor countries in the United  Nations and in other international forums  for a ""new international economic order.""  Humphrey was working on legislation to  reorganize  the foreign aid agencies of  the  U.S. government almost up  to the day he  died. His bill, the International Development  Cooperation Act of 1978, was introduced by  Sena.tors John Sparkman  (Dem., Ala.) and  Clifford P. Case  (Rep., N.J.) of the Foreign  Relations Committee, but always will  be  known as the Humphrey bill.  Americans have been  so worried  about  energy, pollution of the environment, water,  infiation, high  food prices and  low  farm  prices  (at the same time!), unemployment  and other domestic matters that they have  ignored foreign aid.  The sad m111tary experience in Vietnam,  plus evidence that economic aid (including  Food  for  Peace)  was handled  corruptly,  soured many Americans on the whole  idea  of foreign programs.  Leave  it  to  the Happy Warrior, Hubert  Humphrey,  to bring us out of our dream  world and remind us about the real one.  ""World hunger,"" he saJ.d  in a  statement  accompanying his bill,  ""cannot be solved  merely by American charity. It requires the  application of  technology ... disease can  be conquered or at least its ravages mini mized. The modern world knows how to do  this  if we have  the will and provide  the  means.""  The Humphrey bill proposes to combine  all  the many  economic-development  and  fund-transfer agencies of the U.S. govern ment  into one  International Development  Cooperation Administration. The bill makes  clear that the purpose is to assist the poor est countries, to overcome the worst aspects  of poverty. It would remove the various lim iting clauses and restrictions that now ham per a full-scale effort to help the poor.  Such a resbuffiing would meet fierce resist ance  in the bureaucracy, of course. There  have been many reorganizations and renam ings of foreign aid agencies in the last quar ter centurv-but always the fragmentation  persisted. The Departments of State, Treas ury, Agriculture, the Peace Corps, etc., re tained their own domains.  Humprey's bill would  create  an  inde pendent  a11:ency,  reporting directly  to  the  president. The administrator would be the  single spokesman on foreign aid, other than  the president.  The proposed legislation does not call for  new or added spending. Humphrey and other  senators  sponsoring  the blll believed effi ciency could be so increased as to get a lot  more mileage out of present aid.  Two-thirds of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee are sponsors. The new head of  the Agency for International Development,  John Gilligan,  and Sam Brown, head of  Peace Corps,  favor  the reform. The White  House and  the chief Cabinet officers have  not committed themselves.  The Humphrey bill would carry on and  enhance the 1973 reform in foreign aid. This  ""new direction"" reform was essentially a re action to the blending of economic aid and  mllitary aid  in Vietnam and elsewhere. It  set a new standard for bilateral assistance ""people's"" programs  instead of big capital  projects, agricultural development in place  of fancy hotels and airports.  Humphrey wanted  to make  foreign  aid  genuine development aid, not a Cold War  tool, not a  supplement  to m111tary grants  and not just softheaded humanitarianism but an essential investment in world politi cal stabllity.  Who will carry the ball now that Humphrey  is gone? Some politician of vision, guts and  abllity could make a name for himself as a  statesman by conducting this reform measure  through to enactment. The times call for a  new move  in world economic affairs com parable  to  the Marshall Plan after World  War II.  Someone needs to jar President Carter on  this. It is directly in line with his promisea  of government reorganization and efficiency.  It is a ""natural"" component of his human  rights theme in international relations.  To drift along with  the old setup-with  AID under  the State Department dishing.  out grants, USDA handling food aid, Treas ury dealing with world  financial  institu tions-is not enough.  It is true that the United States lags far  behind other rich countries in the amount  of aid given in relation to capacity-we are  12th in a  list of 17 industrialized countries  in aid, giving only a quarter of 1 per cent of  our gross national product. But Humphrey  was right, I believe, in calling for reorganiza tion and more efficiency in aiding develop ment before asking for more money.  Iowa Senator Dick Clark, a member of the  Agriculture Committee as well as the Foreign  Relations Committee, is a strong backer of  the Humphrey b111. As a first-term senator,  he already has made a name for himself in  both foreign affairs and agricultural pollcy.  He has shown impressive leadership on poli cies toward Africa. In his statement support ing  the Humphrey  bill,  he  said:  ""The  Humphrey bill provides  the administrative  framework  for a global attack on poverty.  Senator Humphrey knew  that  this could  only be undertaken  in concert with other  nations . ... [This] is almost impossible . ..  where policymaking on international devel opment is fragmented among a number of  competing agencies.""  Foreign aid does not stir much popular  enthusiasm right now. Let us hope that the  senators  sponsoring  this  last Humphrey  initiative can  rise  above current political  tendencies.  The best instincts of the American people  and their wisdom in looking to the future  can be challenged by courageous statesman ship. Sometimes  the people  recognize  this  sooner than the politicians expect.e  THE FARM ECONOMY  e ",1978

148,Senate,95,0.377,181,7,Mr. SCHMITT.," They certainly seem to  be hard to fool, at least in this Senator's  judgment.  One issue that has been more and more  talked about in New Mexico, and I am  not exactly sure why, because it has not  been talked about much on the floor of  the Senate, is whether the transporta tion mechanism of the Panama Canal  across the isthmus is going to be obso lete at some time in the future.  It is hard for anyone who has grown  up in our school systems, at least school  systems with a course or two in geog raphy, to understand how a passageway  between oceans now separated by a con tinent  or  two  can  become  obsolete.  World commerce would seem to require  an economical passageway across  the  backbone of those continents. I frankly  have  trouble explaining that to  them,  because I, for one, cannot see how any one could claim that world commerce  would prefer  to go around  the  tip of  South America or try to find a north ,west passage, rather than have an eco nomically viable, assured, nondiscrimi natory route across Central America.  I think we are going to find, no matte::o  what happens to these treaties, that in  the very near future  the issue will be  joined again, because it is a fact of ma jor importance to world commerce that  there be access across the canal area, the  Central American area, and that is not  going to decrease, it is going to increase,  because world commerce is on the in crease. I believe  in the future we are  going  to  find much more  inventive,  much  larger, much more economically  viable techniques by which to cross that  isthmus. I  think it is only a matter of  time, as I have said, before we discover  that, not only here in the Senate but  maybe in the hemisphere as a whole.  ",1978

150,House,95,0.189,259,7,Mr. SKUBITZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 10984, a bill to establish  the Friendship Hill National Historic Site  in the State of Pennsylvania.  This site will preserve the home and  commemorate  the  life of a  dedicated  patriot, Albert Gallatin, who served this  country well during its formative years.  Gallatin's distinguished career began  as a Member of this body in 1795 and  continued in 1801 as Secretary of  the  Treasury under Thomas Jefferson.  During the War of 1812, he was the  primary U.S. negotiator for the Treaty  of Ghent.  Later he was an able statesman as  minister to France and Great Britain.  This legislation provides a lasting trib ute to Albert Gallatin and his contribu tion  to our country's early history.  I  therefore urge my colleagues to support  its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Penn sylvania has related to the Members the  positions  which Mr.  Gallatin  held  throughout the early days of our history,  first as Secretary of the Treasury and  later as a negotiator after the War of  1812. What he failed  to point out was  that it was Mr. Gallatin who really saved  us from having a second revolution in  the western part of Pennsylvania by the  tremendous  job he did  in getting  the  forces together during the Whiskey In surrection of 1793.

153,House,95,-0.418,285,7,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  join my distinguished  colleague  from  Florida <Mr. PEPPER)  in placing in the  RECORD  collected statements by State  banking commissioners expressing their  concern over section 5 of the Interna tional Banking Act <H.R. 10899).  As the Senator has explained, this pro vision would restrict virtually all future  international banking to  the island of  Manhattan. Yet the New York banking  commissioner opposes  this provision as  a dangerous and shortsighted precedent.  When  this  legislation comes  the  fioor,  the gentleman from Dllnois <Mr.  ANNUNZIO) will seek to defeat the com mittee amendment. If the gentleman's  position is sustained, the effect will be to  adopt  the subcommittee version which  would permit each State legislature to  invite international banks to branch into  their State.  It should be noted  that  branching could occur only at the amr mative invitation of the State govern ment. Any or all States could bar inter national bank branching simply by tak ing no action.  This seems a far fairer approach than  the outright prohibition on international  banking embodied in t..lte committee sub stitute. I hope that my colleagues will  review the statements of State omcials  which the Senator and I are inserting in  the RECORD.  I hope my colleagues will  support the effort of the gentleman from  illinois in defeating the committee sub stitute and letting State government de cide how  to manage  their own  local  economies.  I  strongly support the International  Banking Act and the reforms it will pro duce. But I agree with the State bank  commissioners that the bill will be greatly  improved by  rejecting  the committee  amendment to section 5.

154,,95,-0.35,311,7,Mr. ROONEY.," Mr. Speaker, on March  10, 1978, one of my constituents sub mitted testimony  to two subcommittees  of the House Committee on Public Works  and Transportation. These two subcom mittees, Economic Development and In vestigations and Review, were holding  oversight hearings on the local public  works program of the Economic Develop ment Administration. Mr. H. Robert  Daws, chairman of the board of super visors of Palmer Township, Northampton  County, Pa., was asked by the National  Association of Towns and Townships  (NATaT)  to submit this testimony be cause he serves as chairman of the exec utive  committee of  the Pennsylvania  State Association of Township Supervis ors. Mr. Daws was accompanied by Mr.  Barton D. Russell, NATaT's executive  director.  NATaT is a  federation which repre sents public officials  from over 13,000  communities  around  the  country.  Through its national support center in  Washington, NATaT provides assistance  to local governments on a wide variety  of public management matters.  The National Association of Towns  and Townships is unique among Wash ington-based public  interest groups  in  that it is the only one comprised predom inantly of smaller communities.  those  under 50.000 in population. Considering  that well over one-half of all Americans  live in such localities, NATaT provides  the focus for a vital intergovernmental  perspective.  The  following  mony:  is Mr. Daws'  testi My township of Palmer, located in eastern  Pennsylvania, has a combination of urban,  suburban and rural characteristics, and a  rapidly growing population of 15,000. Palmer  is the site of nearly 300 businesses and has  the second largest industrial concentration  in Northampton County.  We are honored to have been invited to  these hearings by Chairman Roe to provide  the Subcommittees with the perspective of  smaller communities in general, and town ships  in particular, concerning  the Local  Public Works Program. We would  like  to  thank both Chairman Roe and Chairman  Ginn for the opportunity to comment on this  very important subject.  8517  LOCAL PUBLIC WORKS-ROUND  I  Needless  to  say,  the  administration  of  Round I of the LPW Program did not enjoy  a favorable review during the oversight hear ings last year. The record showed a clear dis satisfaction on  the part of many public  officials concerning, among other things, the  eligib111ty criteria which allowed some local  governments  to use  the higher unemploy ment data of a neighboring jurisdiction to  improve  their own chances of  receiving a  grant. Another widely criticized provision  was  the 70%-30% split of Round I  funds.  These two aspects of the program are not now  really significant, since the Economic Devel opment Administration revised its Round II  procedures and eliminated both provisions  from the allocation formula.  One point related to the administration of  Round I which is worth focusing on, how ever, is the charge by many big city officials  that smaller communities received a dispro portionately high level of funding. While it  is acknowledged that some localities did re ceive substantial grants in consideration of  their relatively small population, a  look at  figures provided by EDA officials in January  1977 shows that, on a national scale, urban  areas were not shortchanged. Sixty-five per cent of the Round I funds went to localities  within  Standard Metropolitan  Statistical  Areas  (SMSAs). In my own state of Penn sylvania, 28.9 percent of the total allocation  went to the cities of Philadelphia and Pitts burgh, while only 6.9 percent went  to 12  rural counties. These non-metropolitan areas  received $5.8 million to alleviate an unem ployment rate of 7.39 percent and to lower  the number of unemployed workers from a  total of 51,079. Pittsburgh, by comparison,  received $11 million to cope with a similar  unemployment rate of 7.16 percent and 45,532  unemployed workers.  An examination of the Round I program  nationally shows similar findings. However,  the objections of the big city mayors about  the supposed small-town bias, and the at tendant media coverage which they received,  had a profound effect on the administration  of Round II.  ABSOLUTE NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED  As  indicated in testimony presented last  year to the Economic Development Subcom mittee by a  representative of the National  Association of Towns and Townships, NATaT  voiced its opposition to EDA's project selec tion criteria  for Round  II, which empha sized  the absolute number of unemployed  people living within an applicant's jurisdic tion. This  ranking  factor provided  for an  obvious urban  tilt and discriminated un fairly against smaller, less densely populated  communities.  We recognize that a system which places  total emphasis on an applicant's unemploy ment rate would not be equitable either, and  if there is to be another round in the LPW  Program, we urge EDA officials to develop an  appropriate and  fairer mid-point between  these  two major application rating factors.  PROJECT LOCATION ERRORS  One  serious problem with  the adminis tration of Round II of  the LPW program  related to EDA's inability in some cases to  distinguish certain units of  local govern ment, such as townships, from-other munici palities within the same county which had  a similar name or a different postal address.  As Congressman Roe knows, this caused prob lems  in his own state of New  Jersey,  as  well as in the states of Michigan, Ohio, New  York and,  indeed, in my state of Pennsyl vania.  In  fact,  this problem  affected my  township of Palmer directly.  Palmer Township  filed  two  applications  under Round I, both of which were ""shelved""  until Round II. Because our township does  not have  its own post office,  the mailing  address  listed on our application was Eas",1978
155,Senate,95,-0.384,363,7,Mr. CHURCH.," Mr. President, within  the last few minutes, I have heard the  Foreign Relations Committee labeled in competent, charged with foisting mis representations on the Senate, accused of  falsehoods, and  indicted  tor issuing a  gnarled, twisted and distorted report.  Mr. President, I happen to be proud  of my membership on th'e Foreign Rela tions Committee. I have served on that  committee for nearly 19 years. Through out the history of the Senate, the For eign Relations Committee has long been  regarded as highly competent, skillful,  and knowledgeable in the work it per forms and the service it renders to the  Senate as a whole.  I think it is rather sad that a fresh man Senator should attack the commit tee in so unrestrained a manner.  The Senator from Utah reminds me of  a bumblebee, biggest when first born.  He argues that the Foreign Relations  Committee  report  completely  ignores  the precedents distinguishing  self-ex ecuting treaties from those that are not  self-executing. He says:  The committee's report makes no men tion of the rules that have traditionally been  followed by Congress, by our courts and  by past Presidents' rules that must be con sulted in order to determine the character  of this treaty. The report simply assumes,  without discusssion, without even acknowl edging  the  existence of  these precedents,  that this is a self-executing treaty.  Mr. President, the reason the commit tee's report does not discuss the specific  issue of whether this treaty is self-ex ecuting and the reason why the Attor ney General, the State Department legal  adviser  and other administration wit nesses 'did not address  that  issue as  such, is that it begs the question to say  that the treaty is self-executing.  The very question in dispute is whether  a treaty provision disposing of property  belonging  to the United States can be  self-executing. The entire committee re port is directed at discussing this ques tion as is the testimony of each of the  adn{inistration witnesses who  testified  on it. The committee and the adminis tration-and the overwhelming majority  of  legal scholars who have expressed  themselves on the issue-all believe that  such a treaty can be self-executing.  The Senator from Utah seems to as sume however, that this is simply one  additional question to be debated with  all the others. He seems to believe that  the question  is whether  the  treaty  is   intended  to  be  self-executing.  Of  course, it is intended to be self-execut ing;  it  is not necessary  to apply any  court-formulated test to conclude that.  The language of  the treaty,  the testi mony of  the administration, and  the  report of the committee all make clear  beyond question that the treaty is  in tended to be self-executing. That is why  we are having this debate. The kinds of  tests that Senator HATCH cites are ap plied by the courts only for the purpose  of determining whether the agreement  was intended to be self-executing. Said  Prof. Louis Henkin in his authoritative  treaties ""Foreign A1fairs and the Con stitution"":  The courts have considered that to be a  matter of interpretation of the agreement,  but agreements  have often been drafted  without attention to that question so that  it may be difficult  contemplated.  to determine what was  I suggest to the Senator that anyone  following  this debate knows precisely  what  is contemplated  in  the Panama  Canal Treaty.  It is my intention, Mr. President,  to  directly rebut  the extended arguments  of  the Senator from Utah by referring  to  three self -executing  treaties of  the  past which conveyed U.S. Government  owned property to foreign governments  without benefit of any legislation by Con gress. Before doing so, I note that the  distinguished Senator from New York is  on the :floor. I have spoken with him in  committee conferences during the day  and I know he has come  to  the :floor  several times expecting to address this  issue. I propose to him that we divide the  time remaining to our side between us.  ",1978

Not only  in the South, but all across the Nation,  black Americans made significant politi cal and social gains under Dr. King's  leadership. Dr. King's powerful weapon  was the manner in which he appealed  to the conscience of America, saying that  ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere.""  The powerful persuasion of his non violent movement encouraged the pass age of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and  the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Radical  changes improved the standing of blacks  in America--changes accomplished by  the moral force generated by Dr. King.  When Martin Luther King became the  youngest man ever to win the Nobel Peace  Prize, he said:  Nonviolence  is the answer to the crucial  political and moral questions of our  time;  the need for man  to overcome oppression  and violence without resorting to oppression  and violence. Man must evolve for all human  conflict a method which rejects revenge, ag gression, and retaliation. The foundation of  such a method is love.  Ten years ago today, Americans lost  the moral force embodied in Dr. King.  But that does not mean that the goals  and dreams of Martin Luther King are  forgotten. His legacy can inspire us to  take up the cause to which Dr. King was  increasingly  focusing  his  attention economic injustice.  I have walked the streets of Memphis  where Martin Luther King led his last  march prior to his tragic death. I have  visited with  the Memphis  sanitation  workers with whom Dr. King spent his  last days.  I have seen the debilitating effects of  economic  inequality  in Memphis  and  other cities and towns across the coun try-and  the despair  reflected  in  the  faces of millions of jobless young people,  many of whom have little hope for the  future.  So there is plenty of work to be done.  But Dr. King demonstrated the leader ship necessary  to  succeed  in difficult  times, and we can all benefit from his  example.  Martin Luther King  offered  every  American hope that our country would  allow every individual to live a decent  and fulfilling life. Today, a decade after  his death, we must renew our commit ment to those dreams which he inspired  us to believe.   CAN THE CONGRESS CATCH UP  WITH THE COUNTRY?  e ",1978
157,Senate,95,-0.443,415,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr.  President,  in  hearings held last month by the Joint  Economic Committee's Subcommittee on  Energy, for which I serve as chairman,  it became clear that solar, wind, and  other renewable energy sources provide  opportunities for employment and en ergy production which are not being fully  utilized by  the Federal Government.  Now,  in an article  in  the New York  Times for April 1, David Morris, director  for the Institute for Local Self-Reliance  in Washington, tells us about many of  the initiatives around the country which  are running ahead of the Federal Gov ernment in demonstrating how we can  save and produce energy.  Instead of increasing electrical energy,  Davis, Calif., intends to cut its electricity  bill in half in 1985. Ocala, Fla., is rapidly  going to solar energy through a unique  new  financing system. Builders  in At lanta  and Eugene, Oreg.,  have  con structed energy-efficient houses which  reduce by 60 percent the energy con sumption  required under  the Federal  Housing Administration's new minimum  standards.  Mr. Morris' article is an invitation for  the Federal Government to begin learn ing  from  the  remarkable  innovations  taking place throughout the country. I  intend  to  learn about,  recognize, and  encourage energy innovation at the local  level and am pleased to ask that his arti cle,  ""Looking  to Localities  for Energy  Policy  Insights,""  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  The article follows:  LOOKING TO LoCALITIES FOR ENERGY POLICY  INSIGHTS  (By David Morris)  WASHINGTON.-The public has moved far  beyond the Federal Government in dealing  with the energy crisis. The creativity of our  50 states and more  than 6,000  cities and  counties should be  the basis  for national  policy. To date, it has not.  While the National Energy Plan has pro jected a 50 percent increase in electric gen eration by 1985, the city of Davis, Calif., has  adopted a goal of reducing by 50 percent its  electricity usage by  that year. While  the  National Energy Plan projects a 300 percent  increase in nuclear reactors by 1990, the pub licly owned Seattle city  light and power  utility has  refused  to participate  in new  nuclear construction. Its calculations show  that energy conservation is a far more bene ficial investment than new construction. The  Tennessee Valley Authority has -discovered  that it ts economical to provide zero-interest  loans for energy conservation.  After  three years,  the Federal solar  tax  credit is still languishing in Congress. Since  it::; introduction, California has implemented,  not one but two tax credits, raising the cred it from 10 percent to 55 percent. It is still  unc:ear whether the Congressional tax credit  will contain a  refund provision. If it does  not, it will lessen the chances of our work ing class entering  the  solar age,  for  this  group may not be able to take advantage of  the entire credit  in one year. New Mexico  has a refund provision, and California's tax  credit can be carried over until fully used.  Most  energy professionals  have  learned  that  it can be more efficient  to design a  home that acts like a collector and storage  system than to add on a solar collector. This  is done by increasing the amount of south facing glass and using floor and wa!l mate rial that collects and stores heat. While the  nationiltax-credit legisTatio~silent on  the eligibility of these so-called passive solar  systems, New Mexico  already has  several  year::;'  experience  in  developing workable  regulations in this area.  Local creativity goes still further. There  is almost no chance that the Federal Gov ernment will enact a  low-interest loan pro gram for solar technology this session, even  though everyone in the solar field recognizes  that financing is the key to rapid commer cialization, Santa Clara, Calif., has, through  its water and power department, been leas ing solar systems. Ocala, Fla., has author ized its publicly owned utility to become the  billing and bookkeeping agent for any pri vate solar company that can install solar energy systems that can be paid for through  energy savings.  The Federal Department of Energy's small scale energy programs are just beginning. Al tbough they are but a speck in the budget,  even that little has been a  reaction to the  successes of small wind-generator companies  a~d small hydroelectric  producers, which  have successfully demonstrated the economic  viability of home systems.  The final draft of the National Energy Plan  deleted a prohibition on utilities' discrimi nating against solar-energy systeins through  their rate structures, believing it was unnec essary. Yet  legal controversies, such as the  Public Service Commission litigation in New  York State concerning  the rate to be paid  by Con Edison to purchase electricity pumped  back in to the grid system from home wind  generators, are occurring regularly.  The Federal Government's energy-conser vation  sta;ndards may already be obsolete.  There are localities that have surpassed the  standards significantly. Builders in Atlanta  and Eugene, Ore.,  have constructed  fast selling energy-efficient houses that reduce by  60 percent the energy consumption required  under the Federal Housing Administration's  new minimum standards.  It may be understandable that the Federal  Government should be behind the rest of the  country. The Government's huge size makes  any program development a  tortuous proc ess. And the relative newness of the energy  crisis means that the rest of the country is  learning at an accelerated pace.  Yet I am constantly amazed at the-lack  of knowledge by Federal Administrators and  Congressional staff members about what  is  going on in the rest of the country. It will be  extremely unfortunate  if  the Government  should wind up enacting minimal legislation  rather  than encouraging states, cities and  communities to go as far as has been proved  feasible in attaining energy self-reliance.  We need a national program that can spot light those innovations that have proved suc cessful and can learn from the failures. The  rich diversity of experimentation is hearten ing. It is problematic whether the Federal  Government is learning from the people.e  ",1978

GUS Y ATRON  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 1978  in  e ",1978
162,,95,-0.174,467,7,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take a moment to pay tribute to  a man who I am proud to represent in  the Congress, Mr. Charles R. Kramer ..  Mr. Kramer, a guidance counselor m  the Oley Valley  School District  Pennsylvania for the last 26 years, has  been named counselor of the year by the  Pennsylvania School Counselors Asso cation and the Pennsylvania Association  of Private School Administrators.  As I have always believed that efforts  to better educate our young are an in vestment in the future of our Nation, it  is with great pleasure that I congratulate  Charles Kramer, whose efforts are so  typical of the long history of dedicated  educators in Berks County. In fact, an other constituent of mine, and long-time  friend, Mr. Dennis E. Fiant of the Ham burg Area School District, has served as  president of  the Pennsylvania School  Counselors Association, which presented  this award to Mr. Kramer.  There  is no question  that Charles  Kramer was an excellent choice to re ceive the Ben Franklin Award, an en graved pewter bowl. During his years of  dedicated  service, Mr.  Kramer  has  teamed with Anthony Fredicine,  an other counselor in the Oley district, to  establish a student tutoring program. He  has also been active in setting up career  day programs and has developed a sys tem  to  select  students  for  vocational  technical training. Mr. Kramer haJ co authored  articles  published  in  ""The  School Counselor"" and ""Pennsylvania  School Counselor"" and  served  as co chairman of  the exhibits at the coun selors association conference.  He also has served as treasurer of the  Berks Area Counselors Association for  the last 10 years. He has distinguished  himself by his efforts  to assist handi capped students who preferred school  programs to home study. Once, he helped  carry a girl wearing 50-pound braces up  and down stairs so she could attend class.  There have been many other instances.  but Mr. Kramer minimizes those efforts  as part of my job.  The counselor also is active in the com munity. He was an active volunteer fire man for many years, is the scorer and  timer for wrestling matches and basket ball games, helps the track coach, and  runs the night school extension classes  for  the  Reading  Area  Community  College.  Throughout our history,  it has been  the kind of selfless dedication and com mitment  to  excellence  typified  by  Charles Kramer that have made Amer ica's educational system the finest in the  world. We are  truly fortunate  to have  men like Charles Kramer serving in our  schools. Our childrens' future is in good  hands.   ",1978
163,,95,-0.479,480,7,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker, a dinner  and dance honoring Mr. Charles J. Flem ing, Sr., past president of the Mahoning  Valley Gaelic Society will be held on Sat urday, April 15, 1978. The dinner will  commemorate Mr. Fleming's outstand ing contribution to Irish culture in the  Mahoning Valley of Ohio.  A millwright at Packard Electric, Mr.  Fleming and his wife of 24 years, Patri cia, reside in Girard, Ohio. The couple  belongs to the St. Rose Parish, and they  have seven children and one grandchild.  Mr. Fleming's involvement with Irish  culture spans many years. During his  14-year membership  in  the Mahoning  Valley Gaelic Society, he has worked on  many committees, served as recording  secretary, and, most recently, as presi dent during 1976 and 1977.  In addition  to his  involvement with  Irish culture on the local level, Mr. Flem ing  is aftlliated with nationwide Irish  groups. For 2 years he was a trustee for  the  Irish Arts and Historical Society.  Currently, he is a member of the Irish  National Caucus.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Fleming's involve ment with Irish heritage, both on the  local and on the national levels, is to be  commended. We are now just beginning  to appreciate the richness and diversity  of our  respective ethnic backgrounds,  and Mr. Fleming has been contributing  to this appreciation for years.  I want to congratulate Mr. Fleming  for his many years of dedicated work in  the field of preserving the Irish-Ameri can heritage. May he continue his in  volvement for many years to come.   ""ONE'S RESPONSIBILITY""  HON. CHARLES THONE  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 1978   ",1978
164,,95,0.192,480,7,Mr. THONE.," Mr. Speaker, the Veter ans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Aux iliary have bettered America  through  their 16 years of sponsoring an annual  ""Voice of Democracy"" program.  As a life member of Hartington, Nebr.,  VFW Post No. 5283, I am very proud of  the accomplishments of the 1978 winner  from Nebraska. He is Thomas Lyon, a  junior at Lincoln East High School. All  contestants this year spoke on the sub ject, ""My Responsibility to America.""  Mr. Speaker and fellow Members of  the House, I believe you can gain much  from Mr. Lyon's remarks on that theme:  One man, one vote. This may seem insig nificant to any one man who sees the millions  upon millions of other men, each with one  vote, too: Probably, to explorers of old, the  land on which we  live  looked  insignificant  as well, considering the hundreds upon hun dreds of other countries.  But to the creators of our country, it was  not the land that made the difference; it was  the  thought behind  it. The  thought  that  freedom must be preserved. Our forefathers  were not concerned with the seeming trivial ity of making so much fuss over so much  forest. Rather they only worried that people  later on would believe it trivial, and let the  philosophy die.  Freedom  is an  integral part of our na tion's founders and our views today. With out it, the documents, the people, and the  country would be but one empty commit ment to an unrealistic goal. And it is our  responsibility to keep the philosophy going.  But to do  that, we must look at how our  forefathers expected to make it last.  Naturally they considered many alterna tives. Perhaps  they seriously contemplated  having one man  rule above all others;  a  leader to uphold the guarantees and promises  of the country's beliefs. If they did, it is not  unlikely that this idea was quickly discarded,  for it would be too easy to let one bad apple  slip in, and spoil the whole bunch. Then, of  course, a group of leaders all coordinating  the nation's goals would be the best solution.  But even with this answer, other questions  arise: Who shall choose those leaders? Who  shall replace them when they die? And who  will insure that those leaders do in fact lead  correctly?  The answer to our forefathers and to us  is us. With the gift that our country's creat ors gave us, came an added dose of responsi bllity. Responsibllity to keep freedom, and to  choose others to represent us in furthering  that goal.  Obviously each of us cannot individually  April 4, 1978  make the decisions in the upper echelons of  government. But in no way should that make  us  feel  less  powerful,  or  less  important.  Rather it should make us realize  the  im mense  importance of getting gootl  leaders.  And we can only transform that realization  into action by our vote.  Without voting we are nothing, and even  less  to put on a  respectabllity  to the  idle  ballot. As famous American poet Ogden Nash  put it, ""(Non-voters) are uncitizens in citi zens clothing.""  As of now I still cannot cast a ballot. But  I can cast my lot to democracy by asking all  of you to prove that democracy does work,  through electing others  to make  it work.  Never for one minute think of it as an indi cation of how insignificant you are, only of  how insignificant you would be if you didn't  join with others to choose responsibly.  For where would we be if every soldier who  ever  fought  said ""I'm but one"" and put  down his arms? or  if every contemporary  human rights leader said ""I'm but one"" and  gave up the fight?  It's not only a right to choose our leaders,  but a responsibility. And any shirking of that  responsibility  is a  shirking of  the country  itself. Not just its leaders, not just its elec tion  system, but  its whole philosophy. A  philosophy of government by the people, not  in spite of the people.  My responsibility to America is far reach ing and too important for words alone. But  through speech and participation we can all  choose our leaders, and continue to choose  our words.  One man, one vote, may not seem  like  much. But one country, 200 million votes,  makes it all worthwhile.e  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,  REMEMBERED  HON. PETER W. RODINO, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 1978   ",1978
165,,95,-0.435,480,7,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, 10 years  ago today Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  was assassinated in Memphis, and many  people believed that his dream of social  justice in America would die with him.  However,  this did not happen,  largely  because of the faith and determination  he  instilled in his  followers. Although  we cannot say that Dr. King's goals have  been fulfilled, I believe that if he were  alive today he would be pleased by many  of the changes which have taken place  as a  result of the movement he set in  motion.  While one-quarter of all black Ameri can citizens are still dependent on wel fare, their upward mobility has increased  tremendously along with  their oppor tunities  for  better  housing  and  education.  Mr. Speaker, it is a tribute to Dr. !-{ing  that we continue to regard his ideas as  the guide for our policies toward social  change and the measuring stick for our  achievements.  In 1975,  I  shared my  thoughts  about Dr. King with  the  Southern Christian Leadership Confer ence. I  told them:  They shot down the man and they snuffed  out his  life and  the man died. But they  could not shoot down his dream. For his  dream was stronger than life and more pow erful  than death and  the dream  lives on.  ",1978
166,House,95,0.378,649,7,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the  Simon amendment. This amendment will  prevent postal management from setting  destructively rates for parcel post.  I use the term ""destruction"" advisedly,  because no private business can with stand a rate war launched by a Govern ment agency that has unlimited funds to  reduce service charges.  The  subsidy  appropriations  the  Postal Service contained in this bill are  three times greater than the total reve nue that is derived from parcel post.  It would riot take a very large diver sion of these funds to parcel post to make  the position of private companies unten able.  Postal management has said publicly  that rates are the basic element of com petition for package volume.  We cannot expect that they will resist  the  temptation  that we place before  them in this bill.  to  ",1978
167,House,95,-0.41,662,7,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Chairman,  while  the public outcry for  reform of  the U.S. Postal Service may have di minished, a close examination of USPS  operations indicates that one of the prob lems continuing to plague this agency is  that of poor management.  The bill  before us  today  seeks  to  remedy that problem. However, it fails  in one major respect. H.R. 7700 provides  for an  increase  in  the public  service  subsidy for  the Postal Service, an in crease with no strings attached.  I believe one way  to cure the man agement ills of the Postal Service is to  make that agency and its top managers  totally accountable to the Congress and  to the American people. Such account ability can be accomplished through an nual or biennial authorization and ap propriation of the Postal Service budget.  In fiscal year 1977, the Postal Service  reported a deficit of over $688 million.  continuing a trend of deficits since postal  reorganization in 1970. Such deficits will  continue until USPS is made to answer  for its management decisions.  Mr. Chairman, I do not oppose a sub sidy for  the Postal Service. But I do  oppose a subsidy that gives  top postal  management little or no incentive to in crease efflciency and productivity.  Until such time as Postal Service ac ..  countability is restored, I am constrained  to oppose postal reform legislation.    ",1978
168,House,95,-0.128,662,7,Mr. SIKES.," Mr. Chairman, I support  H.R. 7700, which is designed to resolve  major problems which have developed  and have remained unsolved since  the  enactment of the Postal Reorganization  Act of 1970. It was generally believed that  postal reorganization would result in im proved service,  stabilized postal  rates,  improved  productivity,  and  efficiency  achieved  through modernization  and  mechanization. Unfortunately, this goal  has not been achieved. Since the enact ment of that law 7 years ago, experience  has  demonstrated  that  the  actual  achievements of postal  reorganization  have fallen  far short of expectations.  This conclusion  is supported by postal  managers, supervisors, postmasters, busi ness  leaders, union  leaders and  large  mail users. The high  level of service  promised has not been achieved.  Despite  three  substantial  rate  in creases in 5 years, supplemental appro priations of $1.2 billion, and large bor rowings to meet operating expenses, the  Postal Service, at the end of fiscal year  1977, had a deficit of $1.2 billion. The  Postal Service's equity of $1.7 billion in  1971 plummeted to minus $429 million by  the end of 1976. The bulk mail system,  costing nearly $1 billion and originally  estimated to earn a return investment in  excess of 30 percent, now may earn a  return of only 3 percent. The future of  the bulk mail system remains very doubt ful. Postal productivity has slightly im proved-fewer employees are handling  more mail-but since postal costs have  increased from $9.2 billion  in 1971  to  approximately $17 billion in 1978, dollar  efficiency-piece of mail handled per dol lar spent-has declined sharply. Future  productivity improvements will be more  difficult because the productivity gains  otfered  by  new  mechanization  are  limited.  Three areas which have presented the  most difficult and continuing problems  since postal reorganization are:  First, maintaining a nationwide postal  system which provides adequate service  to the American people and, from a fi nancial standpoint, achieves a fair bal ance between the costs paid by mail users.  and the costs paid by taxpayers;  Second, postal rate policy, which has  been construed by judicial and adminis trative bodies in: a manner which, if left  uncorrected, will  cause  reductions  in  postal services,  loss of jobs, and either  higher postal rates or greater appropria tions  (or both) ; and  Third,  the role and function of  the  Board of Governors of the Postal Service  and the independent status of the Post master General have proven to be defi cient.  The purpose of the bill before us today  is to correct these inequities and hope fully  restore public confidence  in  the  Postal Service. I believe H.R. 7700 will  return to Congress and the people of this  ",1978

While I did not serve in the Congress  with Congressman Santangelo, having  come to the Congress myself in the 89th  Congress, I had the pleasure of meeting  him during the 89th Congress on one of  his many visits to the city of Washing ton. From 1964 to this date, I had occa sion  to meet with Congressman San tangelo on many civic problems in which  he was so keenly interested.  AI Santangelo began his career of  leadership in New York as an assistant  district attorney in 1945, and went on to  become a New York State Senator dur ing the years 1947-50 and 1953-56. He  served as a member of the Committee  on Labor and  Industry, a member of  the Temporary State Commission on  Youth  and Delinquency,  also  on  the  Joint Legislative Committee on Labor  and Industrial Conditions, and on  the  Statewide Building Codes Commission.  When he arrived in the U.S. Congress  in 1957, AI Santangelo served on the im portant House Appropriations Commit tee, and his outstanding dedication  to  high standards was an inspiration to his  fiiends and fellow citizens. His record of  excellence and creative accomplishment  was most commendable.

As a member of the House Appropria tions Committee, he spent much energy,  though not always successful for it was  not fashionable at the time, in cutting  waste from military contracts.  And, he was known as the congres sional watchdog of the municipal gov ernment of the District of Columbia. For  these services, he was awarded a  testi monial  by  the District  of Columbia  Commissioner.  Because of his exemplary work and  courageous efforts in Congress, our Na tion is a better place in which to live.  His work will be his legacy to America.

174,House,95,0.355,675,7,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. Speaker, re ports that the President has decided to  scuttle plans for development of the neu tron bomb are, indeed, distressing. At a  time when Soviet-American  relations  are on fragile ground,  the President's  decision must carefully consider our po sition in the face of an untrustworthy  Warsaw Pact Alliance.  We've heard the arguments that the  neutron warhead  is  inhumane because  it kills people and leaves property rela tively unscathed. We've heard the con tention that deployment of this weapon  would only add to our existing nuclear  overkill capabilities-and set back diplo matic  efforts  to  achieve  among the world's powers. We'vf! heard  the critics of this nndertaking cite an in creased danger of nuclear war. And, of  course,  there are  the complaints  that  N-bomb  development  economically  unsound.  A  rational, calculated evaluation by  the President of  enhanced  radiation  technology will convince him that de ployment is the only sensible course of  action.  To those who find it immoral to deploy  a weapon which kills people and leaves  buildings intact, I ask if it is any more  moral to kill the same people and de molish those very buildings? That is like  comparing  the moral  values  of  the  spear to those of the catapult, or the bow and-arrow to the cannon. The neutron  bomb actually  restricts blast and fire  damage to a small area-a radius of 200  yards or so-as opposed to existing hy drogen bombs which have effects that far  exceed the range of the confined neu trons.  Discussion of an escalating arms race  is founded on misinformation. Consis tent with NATO policy, development of  the neutron bomb would be a defensive  tactical weapon. It will, if anything, serve  as an essential deterrent to nuclear arms  buildup.  Experts in the area of military diplo matic strategy assure us that the danger  of nuclear war will, by no means, be en hanced by development of theN-bomb.  The consequenses are simply too severe.  And neutron warheads are actually more  economically feasible  than comparable  H-bombs. The neutron bomb requires a  smaller amount of the expensive, hard to-obtain nuclear material needed  to  trigger a detonation.  Have we not been sold short enough  already?

182,House,95,-0.318,870,7,Mr. GIAIMO.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word. I rise in opposi tion to  this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I am opposed  to the  committee amendment. I am opposed to  the bill.  This is a bad proposal. It guarantees  increased and contin:ted taxpayer sub sidies, primarily to business mailers, and  Federal  bailout  of  inefficient  postal  management.  The authorization  for appropriation  of $800 million additional for fiscal years  1979, 1980, and 1981-a total of $2.4 bil lion  right  there-is only part of  the  story. This proposal would also cut out  of the existing law those provisions that  look toward a steadily declining public service postal subsidy. It would fix  the  existing public-service subsidy at $920  million each year. This action would  eliminate  the existing schedule which  reduces the $920 million to $460 million  by fiscal year 1984 and requires a plan  for further reduction after 1984.  Add up  just the obvious  long-range  costs of this bill: A $2.4 billion cost for  the overt increase in subsidy plus $1.4  billion added cost from striking the re duction schedule-a total of $3.8 billion.  What are going  to be  the effects of  such a proposal?  All incentives for sound management  of the Postal Service are destroyed. What  postal management is going  to take a  hard line on costs if a handout from the  Federal Treasury is assured? How can  postal management insist on reasonable  labor contract terms if all parties know  that Uncle Sam is standing ready to ante  up more cash? In what way are the con sequences of management action-or in actions-to be 'brought home  to  those  responsible  if  those  consequences are  merely transferred to the Treasury and  the general taxpayer?  This proposal strikes at the heart of  the concept that those who use the mails  should pay for the mails. That was the  whole point of the Postal Reorganization  Act of 1970. That act provided an ex tended period for adjusting to its finan cial consequence-at least 12 years-and  Congress has already granted a further  phasing-in period for certain classes of  mailers. If this proposal is enacted, we  can say goodby  to hopes  for an effi cient, effective, and financially responsi ble postal service. We can say goodby to  hopes that business mail users will pay  the costs of the service  they demand,  knowing that the taxpayer will subsidize  them.  Mr. Chairman, this proposal by itself  is not a ""spending bill."" It is an authori zation  for  subsequent  appropriation.  Thus, the impact of this bill on the budg et is not finally determined by our action  today. Appropriation of these funds-if  they should be authorized-is not man datory in any sense. We should insist  that every dollar actually appropriated  in  the future under  this  ill-conceived  authorization be intensively scrutinized.  I can say in all candor that I would  be more reassured about this point if I  thought that we would have the courage  to take a good hard look at postal re quirements through the appropriations  process.  One final word about our budget prob lems. Members are certainly aware of the  multitude of contingencies that we are  going to have to face in connection with  the 1979 budget. The House Budget Com mittee is presently working up the first  budget resolution for fiscal year 1979. I  ",1978
183,House,95,-0.481,896,7,Mr. REUSS.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in  opposition to the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. WYLIE).  Mr. Chairman, once again this amend ment comes from one of  the most in dustrious,  intelligent, and hardworking  members of our committee, and I  re gret having  to oppose  it. But,  really,  the language is so carefully crafted in  the committee bill before us  that the  so-called committee amendment I be lieve ought to stand.  The gentleman from Ohio <Mr. WYLIE)  is apparently disturbed because of our  effort to meld the dual banking system  to allow the matter of regulation basi cally to the State regulatory authorities,  with some residual surveillance by  the  Federal Reserve, and then to lodge the  vital power of money creation and re serve requirements in the only body in  which it can be lodged, the Federal Re serve Board System.  Now,  true, the statement says, and I  am quoting from the committee amend ment, that the Federal Reserve Board  would  impose  reserve  requirements  ""after consultation and  in cooperation  with  the State bank  supervisory au thorities.""  That is in there because we want to  give  the State supervisory authorities  their day in court. But subsequent lan guage makes it doubly clear, and the re J:Ort on page 12 makes it trebly clear,  and here again I read from the report:  If the cooperation on the part of the State  banking authorities were not forthcoming in  any instance, that would in no way dimin ish the power conferred on the Board to im pose reasonable reserve requirements, or the  legal obligation  imposed on  the branches,  agencies, and commercial lending companies  to comply therewith.  So the net of it is that there has been  fashioned here a reasonable compromise  whereby  the ultimate money creation  power is in the only place where it can  be, in the Federal Reserve Board, but we  allow the State regulatory authorities to  put in their advice, their input.  I think it is a good compromise.  ",1978

186,House,95,-0.153,909,7,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker, I feel that  the House of Representatives has just  passed a most worthwhile bill-one that  is designed to improve both the opera tions and service of the U.S. Postal Serv ice.  Seven years ago, Congress embarked  on an experiment designed to make the  Postal Service a self-sustaining opera tion. The general feeling at the time was  that  an  independent  Postal  Service  would mean increased efficiency, and im proved service to millions of American  homes and businesses.  Unfortunately,  this  innovative pro gram has failed to live up to its expec tations.  In the 7 years that this experiment  has been carried out, we have experi enced a  steady decline in the level of  quality of mail service. Promises of bet ter service have given way to outrageous  proposals to close hundreds of small post  offices, and to eliminate Saturday mail  deliveries. Promises of stabilized postage  rates have been replaced by postage rate  increases which threaten to price many  Americans right out of the mail system.  America needs mail services that is re liable, not infrequent and expensive. A  totally independent Postal Service, in my  opinion, is not capable of providing the  level of service which the American pub lic wants and deserves.  Equally troublesome to me is the way  the Postal Service has drifted away from  its basic goals in recent years. Mail con tinues to be a vital link in our commu nication system. However, I honestly be lieve  that  the Postal Service has  lost  sight of the fact that it is primarily a  service, not a moneymaking operation.  The Postal Service has charged forward  with one plan after another to cut costs,  often in total disregard of the real needs  of the public. The balance between fiscal  constraints and legitimate service needs  has become enormously onesided, with  the American people constantly coming  out on the short end.  Let me  just give you one brief ex ample which occurred in my congres sional district.  Three years ago,  the Postal Service  announced  its plans  to close  the mail  processing facility  in Toms River and  consolidate it with a new facility being  built near Trenton.  In making that shortsighted decision,  the Postal Service totally ignored anum ber of basic facts. First, Ocean County,  which includes Toms River, is one of the  fastest growing counties  in  the entire  Nation. There is no question but that  the county will need its own mail proc essing facility in the future.  Second, a county referendum was con ducted in 1976, and the residents voted  overwhelmingly in favor of keeping the  processing center open.  Third,  the Special Commission on  Postal Service, which Congress estab lished  last year  to  review  the Postal  Service, visited the Toms River facility,  and three of the four Commission mem bers subsequently recommended that it  be kept open.  Do you think that the Postal Service  gave any consideration to these facts?  Of course not. It is difficult to infiuence  Postal Service policy when there is no  public accountability. Since public funds  will be necessary to maintain mail serv ice, the public must be assured of a role  in setting policy. H.R. 7700, with  its  many reforms, will do just that. It will  insure that the Postal Service is once  again accountable to the public.  Accountability guarantees better serv ice to all classes of mail users, whether  they are large commercial operations or  individuals using the mails for private  communications.  Accountability  also  means  that workable  procedures de signed  to promote more efficient han dling and delivery of the mail will result.  Perhaps this will permit us to get back  to the real reason why we have a postal  system in the first place-to serve the  business and personal communication  needs of us all in a reasonable and eco nomical fashion.

188,,95,-0.357,948,7,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, in these  times of advanced, computerized eco nomic  forecasting, every congressional  office is literally deluged by highly statis tical analyses of the future course of the  economy. This flood usually reaches its  high point immediately after the sub mission of the administration's budget  requests for the coming fiscal year. The  present time is such a period of cascading  economic forecasts.  The most bewildering aspects about  these predictions, besides their virtual in comprehensibility, are their stubborn re fusal to agree and their uncanny ability  to mislead. Despite  their complex and  highly sophisticated computers, their in genious models and  their unparalleled  statistical methodologies, one is left with  the nagging suspicion that the ancient  and medieval soothsayers, who foretold  events on the basis of the stars, the en trails of birds, and the patterns of cards,  could easily rival the modern forecaster.  I would like to share with my colleagues  a possible explanation of this embarrass ing phenomenon entitled ""The Future  Hustle"" by James Henry, which appeared  in the New Republic on February 4, 1978:  THE FuTuRE HUSTLE  (By James Henry)  Economic forecasting is one of the hottest  fields  in the US economy, along with  law,  medicine, evangellcal rellgion, astrology and  pornography. In some ways it resembles these  other  industries. It has  the pretension  to  technical rigor of legal analysis, the thera peutic  swank of medicine,  the  irrational  claims to authority of evangellcal  rellgion  and astrology and, alas, pornography's in satiable audience of subscribers. Like these  other services, economic forecasting  thrives  on human weakness, and acquires a stake in  the vices it proposes  to cure. In a  stable,  growing economy with full employment and  steady prices, there is not much need for the  economic  forecaster's  art. Uncertainty  is  what puts bread on his table, and the increase  in economic uncertainty over the past decade  explains much of  the  rising demand  for  economic forecasting. But this uncertainty is  itself partly the result of bad pollcies based  on poor economic forecasts. In the past few  years economic forecasting has  joined  law  and medicine and similar mysterious arts to  form a corner of the modern economy where  Say's law actually works: supply creates its  own demand, and the forecasters grow richer  as their forecasts do worse.  The leader of the economic forecasting in dustry is a company called Data Resources,  Tnc. DR! was founded in 1968 by Otto Eck stein, a Harvard professor and former mem ber of  the Council of Economic Advisors  under Lyndon Johnson. Eckstein is a fairly  orthodox Keynesian and until age 40 he was  a. fairly typical academic economist. Now he  is rich. DRI's revenues have grown more than  30 percent each year for the past 10 years,  even during the severe 1974-75 bust. Sales  reached two million dollars in 1977. Profits  have grown even faster. The company went  public in November 1976; Professor Eckstein  owns about 10 percent of  it now. DRI's  clients include two-thirds of the nation's 100  largest manufacturing firms, 32 of the top 50  banks, nine of the top 25  insurance com panies,  two dozen  federal agencies, several  state agencies and a. growing number of forEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  eign buyers. DRI has two principal competi tors in the economic forecasting field: Chase  Econometrics, a spin-off of the Chase Man hattan Bank, and a ""non-profit"" organiza tion affillated with the Wharton School of  Finance at the University of Pennsylvania.  They have enjoyed similar, if not quite equiv alent, success.  What are these businesses and government  agencies getting for their money? Eckstein  and his competitors are selllng exactly what  prophets, seers, diviners, oracles, soothsayers,  haruspices  and  geomancers  have  sold  throughout the ages: a vision of the future.  To make this product claim convincing re quires a gimmick, something to create the  necessary  air  of mystery  and  to  explain  why the prophet can see what ordinary mor tals cannot. The economic forecasters' gim mick is the computer. Inside the computer  is a ""model"" of the world economy in the  form of a series of mathematical equations.  The claim  is  that  these equations permit  the computer to take information about the  present and divine patterns in it that the  ordinary eye cannot see. These patterns then  are used  to predict the future. Each fore caster has his own model, which he naturally  claims is the best. Lawrence Klein of Whar ton, who has been selllng predictions for five  years longer than Eckstein, believes that at  least 50 equations are necessary for a  re spectable model. DRI's model has 900 equa tions, but there is one in Canada that has  1500.  Earlier forecasters had different gimmicks.  The ancient Chinese used I Ching hexagrams  to predict harvests and pestilence. The He brew prophets occasionally made economic  predictions, but they usually worked gratui tously,  supported by  charitable  contribu tions. Probably  the oldest  antecedents of  our modern  private  forecasters were  the  Greek chresmologists of the 6th century BC,  itinerant salesmen who consulted the oracles  and  then sold  their  insights  to kings and  mere citizens. Since then there has been a  long  line of palmisters, necromancers, nu merologists and other varieties of diviners for-profit. Merlin and Nostradamus were the  most celebrated practitioners of these arts.  The  astronomers Tycho Brahe and  John  Kepler both cast individual horoscopes for  rather high  fees  in  the 16th century  to  supplement their meager incomes as serious  scientists; Kepler felt ashamed of this side line, which he described as ""scarcely more  respectable than begging.""  Prophets enjoy the great advantage that  correct predictions tend to be remembered  long after incorrect ones have been forgot ten. Guicciardini, the Italian historian, re marked in 1592, ""How happy are the astrol ogers, who are believed 1! they tell one truth  to a hundred lles, while other people lose all  credit  if they  tell one  lie  to a  hundred  truths."" It is remembered, for example, that  in 1651  the English astrologer William Lilly  correctly forecast both the great plague of  1655 and the great fire of London in 1666.  But this was trivial; Nostradamus had pre dicted both events in a book published in  1577  in Amsterdam, whlle Tycho Brahe  is  said to have predicted them in 1563, when  only 17 years old. But such accuracy was  not always highly rewarded, any more than  inaccuracy was  always punished. Willtam  Lllly was hauled before a Parliamentary in quiry after his prophecies about the plague  and the fire had come true. In 1634 the Lady  Eleanor Davies was sent to prison for ""the  assumption of the gift of prophecy,"" because  she had correctly predicted the death of her  husband, the Lord Chief Justice of England,  in  1626,  and-thus  encouraged-had  set  about predicting the deaths of other impor tant people.  Many diviners, however, have been able to  live quite comfortably from their practices,  especially in times of social crisis. This ap  pears to be a second vital ingredient in the  persistence of these arts: private forecasting  April 6, 1978  is parasitic on chaos and  insecurity. It is  most in demand when, objectively, the fu ture is least predictable. Regular procedures  for  receiving  oracles  from  Delphi  and  Dodona emerged  in  the  fifth century BC,  just as Greece came under increased military  pressures.  The most  important Hebrew  prophets  turned up when Israel was most  threatened by  its enemies. The burgeoning  demand  for  astrologers peeked during  the  Puritan Revolution of the 1640s, which also  saw the worst economic disruption of that  century in England. The coincidence of bad  times and rampant prophecy supports Con dorcet's observation  that prophecy  is  im portant not so much because of what it tena  us about the future, but because of what lt  tells us about the present. This coincidence  also helps  to account for  the deep ambiv alence  that  the public has always shown  toward its prophets, tolerating and even wor shipping them up to a point, beyond whlch  it begins to throw stones and set stakes.  The  pre-computer  economic  forecasters  did not compile an impressive record. Thom as Malthus,  the early 19th century British  economist, predicted that population growth  would outrun agricultural productivity on  a. worldwide basis within a century. Irving  Fisher, an otherwise distinguished Yale econ omist, w111 never escape  the  ignominy at tached to his declaration on October 15, 1929,  that ""Stock prices have reached a perma nently high plateau."" During World War ll  US government economists, strongly influ enced by a simplistic version of Keynesian  theory, issued a consensus forecast of a seri ous postwar depression. Today's forecasters  have  dissociated  themselves  from  these  oloopers by  the adoption of sophisticated  statistical methods and computer  technol ogy. The modern forecaster squats over his  model  like  the Delphic Pythia,  inhales  its  spirits, then speaks of the mysteries revealed,  frequently in an obscure patois.  This new model-based forecasting proce dure was made possible by several changes  on the ""supply side,"" including the govern ment's accumulation and publication of vast  amounts of macroeconomic data,  the  im provement of computers and statistics, and  the proliferation of professional economists.  Most of the pioneering work on modelling  was completed in the 1940s and 1950s. By the  Kennedy years  there were already a half dozen models with 50 or more equations.  But until  the middle 1960s all  the models  were developed and operated by the govern ment, academic institutions, and non-profit  foundations. The lucrative private forecast ing industry had its origins not in any new  technical achievements by its founders, but  in their abllity to find new markets for old  achievements, usually not their own. They  passed the word that elaborate models, un der  the guidance of suitable experts, were  now prepared to unveil the future to ordi nary businessmen and public officials. Or  rather,  they hinted and  titillated and en ticed, with a kind of utopian enthusiasm,  never  really promising-for that would be  unscientific  (as well as  illegal).  Thus the success of private economic !ore casting depends on the government in three  vital ways. First,  the government supplies  for free an the raw data about the economy  that get fed into the models. Second, since  government actions can affect the modern  economy in so many different ways, uncer tainty  about  government  intentions  and  their potential effect creates much of  the  demand for economic forecasts. Finally, the  government itself is one of the forecasters'  best clients, with the endearing habit of pay ing many  times  over  (through  different  agencies)  for  access  to  the  same model,  which is spewing back predictions based on  information the government itself supplied.  Can computer models really divine the fu ture, or do they represent just another of  the superstitions that litter history? The rec ord is very mixed. In the 1960s until 1968,  ",1978

191,House,95,-0.406,1078,7,Mr. MURPHY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, H.R. 10732 would authorize ap propriations to carry out what is com monly known as  the 200-Mile Fishery  Zone Act. This legislation will insure that  funding will continue to be available to  the Secretary of Commerce  a.nd  the  Regional Fishery Management Coun cils for carrying out their responsibilities  under this act.  The 200-Mile Fishery Zone Act became  Public Law 94-265 on April13, 1976. That  act made it unlawful for the first time beginning with March 1, 1977-for for eign fishing vessels  to fish within 200  miles of our shores without a permit.  Already, that landmark piece of legisla tion has had a salutary effect on protect ing  and  conserving  the  fisheries  re sources of our coastal shores.  For instance, while our annual domes tic catch has remained about the same  for  the past  2 years-approximately  2.5 million metric  tons-we have seen  the foreign catch off our coastal shores  decline from 2.7 million metric tons in  1976 to 1.7 million metric tons in 1977,  a 37-percent decliine.  Similarly, we have seen a decline in the  monthly average of foreign fishing ves sels off our shores. Figures released by  the National Marine Fisheries Service  indicate that approximately 780 foreign  fishing vessels operated within the zone  during 1977, about one-third less than  the approximately 1,200 vessels operating  within the zone in 1976.  Early signs indicate that there is a new  vigor in the U.S. fishing industry. Orders  for new fishing vessels have  increased  dramatically and there is a new interest  seen in replacing and modernizing old  fishing gear and in expanding, and build ing new, processing plants.  Mr. Speaker, this act is beginning to  work but much more remains to be done.  Thus far, only three fishery management  plans have been prepared and approved  by the Secretary. Two of these involve  fish in the Atlantic coast-haddock, cod,  and yellowtail surf clams and quahogs and  the  third  involves salmon  in  the  Pacific coast. More than 75 plans have  teen  identified  by  the  8  Regional  Fishery Management Councils  established by the act that need to be de veloped. This is a monumental task these  Councils are facing and it is only through  the passage of this legislation that these  Councils will be able to get the necessary  funds with which to prepare these plans.  H.R. 10732 would authorize to be ap propriated $40 million  for  fiscal year  1979 and $45 million for each of fiscal  years 1980 and 1981.  Mr. Speaker,  the administration re quested that only $22 million be appro priated to carry out this act in 1979. To morrow morning, I plan to appear before  the Appropriations  Subcommittee  on  State, Justice, Commerce, and Judiciary  and request that $15.4 million be added  to their request for fiscal year 1979 so  that the Department of Commerce will  have adequate funds for carrying out this  act.  Hopefully, with the prompt passage of  this legislation, which authorizes these  additional funds, our fisheries resources  will receive the attention to which they  are entitled.  I now yield  to  the gentleman from  California (Mr. LEGGETT) such time as he  may consume.  ",1978

203,Senate,95,-0.379,1182,7,Mr. MUSKIE.," I would have been happy  to engage in this colloquy earlier. Now I  wish  to finish my side of it, but I will  yield  in due course.  Another point that the Senator made  was that CBO's estimates, the cost, the  inflationary impact of this bill are based  on worst case analysis. I challenge that,  but before I do I point out that the Sen ator from Kansas himself is engaged in  worst case analysis of the position of the  Budget Committee,  the Congressional  Budget Office, and the administration.  I listened to his description of our pasi tion, I listened to his description of the  President's position, and if I ever heard  a worst case analysis, a strawman analy ysis designed to give him an attractive  target to hit, for the purposes of his sup porters in the galleries, that was it. I did  not recognize it, and I doubt that the  President would.  So now I wish to get to the merits of  this issue and the procedural questions  that are involved.  Some of this I hope may be of interest  to citizens in the gallery who are con cerned about the state of this country's  economy not only from the point of view  of  their own livelihoods but from  the  point of view of the economy as a whole  because  it  is  that with which  I  am  charged. The Budget Committee is not  the Agriculture Committee. The Budget  Committee has been created to exercise  discipline with respect to the whole $500  billion of Government spending which  can come from only one place, the tax payers' pockets. My friends in the gal leries are taxpayers as well as farmers.  That is our responsibility and  it  is  our responsibility to give the Senate our  best judgment even when that best judg ment runs counter to the popular tide  of a current popular issue.  If the Budget Committee were to bend  with the wind ever~r time the wind from  the grassroots says, ""Senator, we need  more money,"" there would be no budget  process. There would be no restraint on  spending. And instead of a $500 billion  outlays ceiling  for  the next year we  would have something closer  to $530,  $540 billion.  If there is any doubt on the part of  anyone in the gallery on that point, I  would be glad to give them as much ex posure as they need to the pressures that  are brought upon the Budget Committee  to provide more money, more money, for  this, that, or the other.

207,Senate,95,0.078,1273,7,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, ever since  the birth of our great Nation, the dream  of every American included the oppor tunity to be one's own boss. Our history  of  individual entrepreneurship  is  long  and filled with many success stories. We  in the Congress have, as well, long sup ported  the  idea  that every American  should be afforded every opportunity to  partake of that dream.  But in the last few years, in our zeal to  provide badly needed social services and  to protect  individual Americans  from  numerous  hazards  and  practices, we  have unwittingly created a hostile envi ronment within which small businesses  have trouble thriving. The stories about  individuals  rising  from  rags  riches  through individual initiative are becom ing fewer and fewer.  I believe an article in the April 1978  issue of the Ripon Forum entitled ""How  to Reinvigorate Small Business"" articu lates these problems quite well. The au thor of that article, Mr. John c. Top ping, Jr., does not stop there, however.  He goes on to prescribe what I think is  a well reasoned prescription to reinvigo rate small business. I believe  that the  plan Mr. Topping outlines is sound and  further that we should take a  leading  role in insuring that this road to the  American dream is not lost.  I  commend  this article  to my col leagues and ask  it be printed  in  the  to  RECORD.  The article follows:  HOW TO REINVIGORATE SMALL BUSINESS  (By John C. Topping, Jr.)  Small business is the politician's equiva lent of the weather; everyone talks about it,  but no one does much about it. The state  of both the weather and small business has  worsened appreciably since January 20, 1977.  The  rotten  turn of weather  in the Carter  era seems  to be pure coincidence;  the de velopment  of  an  increasingly  foreboding  climate for small business is, however, some what more  the product of Administration  action and inaction.  Shortly  after  the  election, Carter  en thusiasts were advancing the fanciful claim  that  the Georgia politician was  the  first  small businessman  ever  to become Presi dent.1 Such hyperbole has developed an in creasingly hollow ring amidst the mounting  evidence  that Administration  action  has  worsened  the already perilous position of  small business.  The more hostile climate for small busi ness  is not the product of a conscious de sign;  instead it is the result of a series of  seemingly unrelated pollcies. By far the most  inimical of these to small business has been  the Administration's effort to bail out the  financially  threatened Social Security sys1 Among the several Presidents who could  claim prior small business experience were  Warren Harding (successful newspaper pub lisher in Marion, Ohio) Herbert Hoover (very  successful  engineer)  and Harry Truman  (unsuccessful haberdasher).  tern  in  large part by huge hikes in Social  Security taxes paid by employers.2  A secondary cause of  this worsened cli mate for small business has been the recent  rise in the Federal minimum wage of more  than  15 percent.  In  addition  to  freezing  many relatively unskilled youth from the job  market, this jump in the minimum wage has  placed a considerable cost squeeze on many  small and medium-sized businesses.a  Despite these recently escalating pressures,  American small business, including much of  the  legal and medical profession, still con stitutes a significant sector of our economy.  The statistics which tend to be dated and to  have  limited reliability  indicate that firms  with  less  than a million dollars  in annual  income have producedlletween a third to a  fourth  of our  national  business  receipts  since the early 1960's.4 Perhaps, as Neil Ja coby suggests,5  it is hyperbole to character ize our economy as a manifestation of the  corporate state.  Nevertheless, in the last few years a num ber  of  factors  have weighed  increasingly  heavily on small or new businesses, and par ticularly on aggressive risk-taking firms  in  new technology areas. These factors impeding  entrepreneurial entry and growth include:  Federal, state and local regulatory require ments which raise the cost and difficulty of  entry into areas of business;  Manipulation  of  government  regulatory  mechanisms by established firms in order to  restrict entry by competitors;  Drastically lessened availability of venture  capital for new or small businesses;  A dramatic skewing of economic incentives  against self employment and entrepreneurial  activity and  in favor of  those who derive  their principal  income from someone else's  payroll.  Although these problems have yet to trans form our economy,  their adverse  impact  is  generally more severe on incipient innovative  firms than on mature industrial giants.  REGULATION AS A SPUR TO MARKET  CONCENTRATION  The rapid growth of governmental regula tion has often raised the cost and lengthened  the time required for business entry into cer tain  industries or product areas. In many  instances, manufacturers must obtain prior  approval of one or more agencies such as the  Food and Drug Administration, the Environ mental Protection Agency or the Department  of Agriculture before they can market a new  product.  The effect of pre-entry clearances  is par ticularly severe on incipient. modestly capi talized businesses. Unlike huge manufactur ing concerns, small businesses  rarely have  on tap a legion of lobbyist/lawyers to smooth  over their difficulties with  the Washington  regulatory establishment. The political clout  ~The finally enacted Social Security bill  provided for hikes  in Social Security taxes  that will amount  to $227 billion in yearly  collections within ten years. About half of  this tax bite would be visited on employers.  The Administration sought legislation plac ing a  far higher burden on employers.  3 Some of the smallest businesses are ex empt from such coverage but numerous res taurants, cafeterias, fast food franchise out lets, gas stations and small manufacturers  are affected.  1 ""The  USA  Business  Community:  Its  Composition  and Changing Nature, With  Special Reference  to Small Business  (In cluding  Selected  Statistics  on Minority  Owned Firms).""

The  long  lead  time and associated  legal  and administrative costs occasioned by pre entry  clearance  requirements  result  in  front-end costs which may effectively pre clude a modestly capitalized firm from de veloping a new product or process. A giant  corporation, on  the other hand,  is much  better able to take the risks of securing pre entry clearances.  Its normally greater  so phistication  in clearing regulatory hurdles  gives it a greater chance of success in ob taining  the necessary clearances. Further more, once its product has received the nec essary regulatory appro~als, _ the super cor poration, heavily capitalized and equipped  with a  sophisticated marketing and distri bution capacity,  is well positioned  to  re capture quickly its front-end investment.  CENTRALIZING  INNOVATION  The disproportionate  impact of  regula tory barriers on market entry by modestly  capitalized  firms  tends  to enhance market  concentration. But this may not be the most  troubling aspect. The most detrimental re sult of such  regulation may be a  serious  slowdown in the rate of technological inno vation. Small businesses and individual in ventors, despite  their  limited capital base,  have been the prime source of technological  innovation  in America. A  leading business  analyst, Arthur Burck,  recently  observed,  ""Small companies and individual inventors  were responsible for a remarkable percentage  of  the  important  inventions and  innova tions of this century;  these include the ~ir  conditioner,  power  steering,  xerography,  cyclotron, cotton picker, helicopter, FM cir cuits, automatic transmissions, zipper, Pola roid  camera,  cellophane,  continuous hot strip rolling of steel, and the oxygen steel making process. The Jewkes study of inven tion  showed  that of  61  basic  inventions  examined only 16 resulted from research by  large companies."" 6  It is possible that this historical pattern  may not be fully applicable to our present  economy,  in  which many  technological  breakthroughs require huge sums of front end capital. Nevertheless,  there  is undeni able  loss  to  the economy  if, as seems  in creasingly the case, incipient firms are im peded by heavy handed regulation from both  product development and capitalization.  CORNERING THE MARKET  In addition, the regulatory structure may  be actively manipulated by established cor porations to fence out competition. A par ticularly glaring example of  this has oc curred in the field of computer data trans mission.  American Telephone and Telegraph Com pany  (AT&T)  dominates this field. In the  late 1960's Sam Wyly, a young Dallas computer  executive  and  business  innovator,  mapped out plans for a national microwave  data transmission network to compete with  AT&T. Wyly poured m1Uions of his own  money into Datran, the corporation he had  set up to develop the data transmission net work, and raised millions more.  But AT&T resisted tooth a.nd nail, fighting  Datran and other microwave  transmission  applicants in a protracted battle before the  FCC  and  the  courts. After  losing  these  rounds, which bled  the microwave appli cants, AT&T applied  its economic muscle  to cut away their markets. Recently, Datran,  despite the  technological superiority of its  data  transmission process, was  forced  to  fold before AT&T's superior might.

211,Senate,95,-0.262,160,13,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  today,  June 7, the ANZUS Council meeting will  start at the Department of State. I be lieve  it is  relevant to briefly comment  upon this valuable organization.  The ANZUS Treaty came into opera tion on April 29, 1952. The treaty con tains no limiting duration, thus recog nizing  the  continuing  and  enduring  common interest of the members. Aus tralia, New Zealand, and  the United  States are allies whose  ties were even  more  firmly bound during  those dark  days of World War II when national  survival was  threatened. The United  States  acquired  the  benefits  of wise  counsel and geographically significant  bases. The ANZUS image, as friends with  common interests and working together  prevailed and  is still celebrated at the  Australian-American Memorial in Can berra and at various commemorations of  the Battle of the Coral Sea.  It is custo::nary on occasions such as  this  to make reference to  the ""special  relationship""  that prevails. Yet,  I  for  one have never been certain exactly what  commentators mean by  ""special  rela tionship."" There are, obviously,  ties of  language, of kinship, of history, and of  cultural heritage. Perhaps the true sig nificance of these ties in a global politi cal sense was affirmed by John Foster  Dulles at  the  second ANZUS Council  meeting when he described the alliance  as affecting ""a vast area of the globe, an  area of not only great strategic impor tance, but also an area of  tremendous  cultural and material significance."" In deed,  those points  remain valid  today  and are tributes to the far-sighted lead ership of New Zealand Prime Minister  Holland,  and  the  recently  deceased  Australian Prime Minister Menzies.  This year's meeting will discuss  the  global political balance, economic ques tions, security issues in the Pacific, and  general developments  in Asia and  the  Pacific. In my judgment, our deepening  ties of  trade,  investment, and cultural  exposure to one another, moreover, have  benefited the remainder of Asia.  The Colombo plan, an Australian ini tiative that brought other Asian people  into  these countries for education and  exposure has had widespread and un quantifiable benefits to other Asian so cieties. Today, these three allies-despite  each facing innumerable economic prob lems-have been  attempting  to work  closely with the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations to find viable mechanisms  for encouraging economic development  within the region. This, in my mind, is in  the  forefront  of  values  of  such  an  alliance.  The challenge we all face today is to  forge a common perspective that allows  us to draw new purpose from shared as pirations. We cannot permit the ANZUS  alliance to a trophy or to erode through  neglect, rather we must continue to seek  out those positive areas that benefit not  only our three countries, but also move  toward insuring a more stable and peace ful Pacific region.  It is the function of the ANZUS Coun cil, composed of the foreign ministers of  the  three countries,  to coordinate  the  efforts of the member states. These close  relationships are based on common per ceptions,  objectives,  and  purposes.  Charles Lamb once said in one of his  essays that ""there is nothing so irrele vant as a poor relation."" Although, pe riodically through the years a few of our  Pacific neighbors have maintained this  is the case, I emphatically reject it. Our  close  relationship with Australia and  New Zealand is based to a  large extent  on our common heritage and willingness  o1 each nation to make unique contribu tions in seeking a better world.  I would conclude by simply noting an  old Australian song which makes even  clearer the shared pioneering experience  of  the  three allies.  In ""A Centennial  Song"" in 1888, some typical Australians,  Philip Beck and Fergus Hume, Mel bourne Argus, January 26, 1888, page 5,  noted:  Girdled by our isolation, as the old war fades  from view,  Ancient quarrels are forgotten; we begin the  world anew.  To begin anew  is  the challenge  this  alliance  faces  in a  changing Asia  in creasingly focused on economic condi tions. But I, for one, am confident that  these allies still have much to offer to  one another and to their Asian friends.  It is in that vein that I extend my wel come  to our ANZUS friends.   TRIBUTE TO JAMES ALLEN,  DEMOCRAT OF ALABAMA   ",1978
212,Senate,95,-0.145,160,13,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, it is always  a sad day for the U.S. Senate when one  of its Members falls. The death of Sen ator James Allen is particularly tragic to  me since I considered Jim one of my  close friends.  In the nearly 10 years that Jim Allen  served  in  the Senate he distinguished  himself as a master of parliamentary  procedure whose skills knew no peer. For  his invaluable contributions to the leg islative process, we owe a special debt  of gratitude.  Friends and adversaries alike saw him  as a man of  eminent fairness, a gentle  symbol of decency and integrity in the  Senate of the United States. No less in spiring to me was his deep and abiding  Christian faith. As one of  the  leaders  of the weekly prayer breakfast group, he  contributed much to the spiritual wel fare of the Senate. Over  the years he  reminded us constantly that a deep re ligious faith is the foundation of Amer ica's strength and greatness.  He was a man who was always aware  of the spiritual significance of our de cisions in the Senate. He believed tha~  and I quote him:  The stronger men are spiritually, the bet ter their earthly government will be.  He subscribed to the philosophy con tained in these words from the poet Walt  whitman:  Why build these cities glorious if man un builded goes,  In vain we build the world unless the builder  also grows,  Shortly after arriving in the Senate,  Jim addressed the weekly prayer break fast group for  the first  time. On that  occasion, he shared with his colleagues  a letter he had received from one of his  constituents, a letter which said in part:  Far from being handicapped by being a  Christian, it is my view that the best busi nessman, the best public servant, the best  professional man,  the best person  in any  walk of life is a Christian.  To that, Jim added:  We need to set the tone for high and lofty  conduct  for  all  the people. Our conduct  should inspire confidence and respect and  give the people greater faith and confidence  in our government and in us as their duly  el£>cted representatives.  He spoke those words in May 1969, and  they guided his steps daily throughout  his years of service in the Senate.  ",1978
213,House,95,0.308,186,13,Mr. HAGEDORN.," Mr. Speaker,  the  success of proposition 13  in California,  as well  as  the  recent  tax  limitation  amendment  approved  in  Tennessee,  demonstrates clearly  the growing dis satisfaction with  their tax burden felt  by citizens throughout the country.  On the Federal level, fiscal year 1979  is the third year of the budget process with fiscal year 1976 having been a trial  run in most respects. During this time,  Congress will have run up more  than  $180 billion in new budget deficits, and  will have increased total outlays by more  than 40 percent or $132 billion.  Clearly, whatever benefits have ac crued from the new budgetary process and it has provided the opportunity to  assess the budget in a more coordinated  and comprehensive manner-fiscal disci pline is not one of them.  Federal expenditures,  in short, have  continued to grow faster than the econ omy as a whole, with the public sector  taking an increasing proportion of the  earnings of  its citizens. It is  the total  level of Federal expenditures, not merely  the nominal  level of Federal revenues  that represents the true Federal tax bur den upon citizens, as Nobel Prize winning  economist Milton  Friedman  has  ob served.  I  am  proposing  a  constitutional  amendment which would  extend  the  same basic limitation principle adopted  in California and Tennessee to the Fed eral Government although, for obvious  reasons, it is cast in the form of a spend ing rather than a tax limitation.  The amendment would  require  that,  except during times of war or other na tional emergency, annual  increases  in  levels of budget and off-budget outlays  would not exceed  the average annual  percentage increase in the GNP during  the 3 calendar years preceding.  The amendment would not only impose  substantially more discipline upon  the  Federal budgetary process, but would  also affect significantly the character of  that process. Special interests would no  longer be  in competition with the tax payer  to  raise  the  total ante  in  the  budget;  instead, they would be compettheir  ing with each other  to  increase  relative share of a fixed ante.  Mr. Speaker,  the  lesson  from Cali fornia  and Tennessee  ring  loud  and  clear. It is time for the worst culprit of  them all-the Federal Government--to  reform its ways equally as well as these  States.

I hope the President  will not veto the tuition tax credit bill,  which has been passed by a very, very  substantial majority of this House and  which this House has expressed its will  a number of  times. Again, I hope  the  administration will support it.  Mr. Speaker, the American people sup port the tuition tax credit approach as  opposed  to  the  administration's ap proach.  I  hope  the administration  is  getting  the message,  because  people  allowed the tuition tax credit will be able  to keep their own money to help finance  education rather than having the money  go to the Government and then having  the people try to get their money back.  That is the approach reflected in the  recent elections, and  that  is  the ap proach we should take.  PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  ",1978

AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. M'CLORY  Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chairman, I offer  an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. McCLORY: Page  3,  strike out  line 13 and everything  that  follows  through  line 21 and  insert in  lieu  thereof ""$135,522,000.""  Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chainnan what  this amendment undertakes to do is two  things, first of all, it proposes to rest?re  $4.2 million which is budgeted and wh1ch  was requested but which was deleted by  the subcommittee and then by the full  committee. These funds were  intended  for the law enforcement and investiga tive activities of the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, and Firearms.  I might say on that subject that I ap peared before the subcommittee and I  requested not only that these funds be  retained but I requested that they pro vide an additional $8.5 million in order  to continue the so-called CUE program,  the comprehensive urban enforcement  program which, in my opinion, has been  so highly successful in intercepting the  illegal  traffic  in firearms  in the  three  major cities which were designat~d for  this pilot operation, namely Chicago,  Washington, D.C., and Boston. Let me  add that the results of this program are  just  tremendous  insofar  as  reducing  criminal activities and helping to reduce  the number of crimes committed with  fireanns.  It is because of the success of this pro gram, which has been delineated in are port which is available to all Members of  the House, that it seems to me. so ex tremely important that we should mclude  and retain the $4.2 million in funds.  The other part of my  amendment  would  strike  the  language which  the  committee gratuitously put into the re port, which seeks to restrai~ the Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, and F1reanns from  implementing some regulations that they  have proposed, and I might say that these  regulations  relate  to  the  tracing  of  firearms.  Mr. Chainnan, I have visited the trac ing center of  the Bureau, which is  i.n  downtown Washington. The program 1s  carried on with five or six young women  who sit at telephones and receive infor mation from our law enforcement people,  local police departments throughout the  country, asking for information with re gard  to firearms  that have been used  in connection with  the commission of  crimes. They trace the sales and trans fers of weapons by  telephoning  thou sands of manufacturers, wholesalers, and  dealers of  firearms, and  through  this  procedure they are able to trace, over a  period of a couple of weeks, generally,  where  a  given  firearm  was  last  transferred.  ",1978
217,House,95,0.328,212,13,Mr. TAYLOR.," Mr. Chairman, I com mend the committee for this language in  this bill; and I rise in opposition to the  amendment which seeks to restore funds  that will permit the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms to establish a Fed eral firearms registration program.  The BATF is in effect seeking to do bY  regulation that which the Congress over  the years has refused to do by legislation.  This  is one more example of how the  bureaucracy is attempting to usurp the  prerogatives of the U.S. Congress.  Mr. Speaker, not only do I doubt that  the Federal registration of firearms will  be an effective way of stopping crime,  neither do I believe that it will be an  effective way of tracing weapons used to  commit a crime. The Bureau's own rec ords support the validity of this state ment.  What the program will do is to further  harass  the honest,  law  abiding gun owners, dealers, and manufacturers by  adding to their burden of paperwork and  forms they must submit and adding to  the cost of their hobby or business.  We are talking about requiring 168,000  federally licensed firearms dealers, man ufacturers,  and  importers  to  submit  nearly 700,000 reports each year at a cost  of something like $10 million to the tax payers.  Mr. Chairman, if proponents of Federal  firearm registration desire to have such  a law on the books then let them intro duce a bill and bring it before the House  through  the regular legislative process  and a yea and nay vote. This idea of leg islating through the backdoor by regula tion is not in the great tradition of this  body where the people's representatives  are permitted to fully debate the issues  on their merits.  It is time that the Congress reasserts  its authority over the bureaucracy and  this is the place to begin.  I urge defeat of this pro gun control  amendment.  The CHAIRMAN.

233,House,95,0.504,316,13,Mr. KELLY.," During the time the pop ulation was going down, employment- employment in New York City for public  service employees-went up 46.7 percent.  In other words, it took more people, now  that we have new  technology and all  these  improvements, more people serv ing fewer. And during this time the cost  went up 312 percent. And that is why the  people are mad.  Now, let us talk about Congress a little  bit. Our credibility in this land is  just  about at the bottom of the heap, and why  is that so? It is because we as a group  have gone  forth on  the hustings and  promised the people that we are tired of  big government; we are going to reduce  big government; we are going to reduce  spending; we are going to reduce taxes:  we are going to do all of these things and we have lied in our teeth. And that  is why the people are mad.  Certainly  the people are mad. This  Congress,  right here, you know what  your ratings are and right now we have  a  classic  confrontation  between  pro posal 13 and this New York City bailout  bill.  I want to read something to you. This  is from a unanimous report by the Sen ate Committee on Banking. It is not  something  that  some  kookie  kook  dreamed up but the U.S. Senate Com mittee on Banking, the whole thing, Re publicans, Democrats,  Liberals, Con servatives, and everybody else.  Mr. Chairman, this is what it says, it  says that New York State and City offi cials back in 1975 said thatAll  that was needed  in addition to state  and city and local efforts already initiated,  was a one time commitment from the Fed eral Government to provide short term loans  to cover seasonal shortfalls of revenue and  maintain the city's cash flow  in  the  fiscal  yea.r.  They said further that at the end of  the  seasonal  loan,  or  perhaps  even  sooner:  New York City would have a  balanced  budget and be  able  to meet  its  financial  needs directly from the credit markets.  Mr. Chairman, the credit markets do  not want anything to do with New York  City, because  they have not balanced  their budget. They do not have any in tention of balancing  their budget, be cause  if  they do  the whole  political  house of cards will come down. Spending  the people's money is the way the poli ticians in New York buy their elections.  The whole thing is ridiculous and is  predicated on budget busting expendi tures that nobody can afford.  I want the Members to remember one  other thing: The people in New York  City pay the highest taxes in the United  States, have the highest debt, and since  we bailed the politicians out in 1975 this  is what their leadership there has done:  They have raised revenues and given 18  parts to the government and one part to  the people. There has been an increase  in revenues of $1.9 billion and a reduc tion in debt of $69 million. And if you  just divide that out there are 18 parts,  one goes to the public to reduce the debt  and the rest goes  to  the politicians to  spend in order  to get reelected in the  next election.  So that is what we are doing to the  people of New York City, and we have an  opportunity right now to tell the Ameri can public, ""We got the message,"" we are  not going to sustain the politicians in  New York City in any more of the kind  of  nonsense  they  have  been  going  through, and  that what we are doing  now is that we are starting to respond  to the people and saying to them that  we did mean what we said when we said  we would reduce the cost ofgovernment.  That is exactly what the situation is.  ",1978
234,House,95,-0.038,316,13,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, for  the past 3 years  New York City has been the focus of  attention of this country as a case study  in what seemed to b~ the end product of  municipal overspending.  I, for one, have previously, in the last  Congress, opposed the type of legislation  that we are working on and discussing  and voting upon today. I, for one, paid  particularly close attention to what the  city of New York chose to do  to over come  this condition, since it was clear  from  the  outset  that unless  certain  changes were made, and  reforms  in stalled, the remedies we approved in 1975  would have little benefit to show upon  their expiration this year.  I might add, outsiqe of my prepared  remarks,  to my good  friend  the Con gressman  from Zephyrhills, Fla. <Mr.  KELLY) who just spoke, that the gentle man from Florida and I  serve on the  same committee and subcommittee that  heard the testimony for weeks about the  problems of New York City. The Con gressman  from Zephyrhills, Fla., and  this Congressman from Mayfield, Ky.,  come from areas that have many who are  of conservative opinions, people who are  concerned about taxes, and people who  are really concerned about this country.  Yet,  I would  remind my  friend  from  Zephyrhills, Fla., that what we are dear ing with is the largest city in this coun try, and when we talk about the future  of our country how can we forget the  financial plight at this time of New York  City?  Further, I might add that I have a lot  of confidence in the new mayor of New  York City,  our  former  colleague, Ed  Koch.  I believe Mayor Ed Koch is trying to  do the right thing to turn the situation  around  in New York City. He, as  the  new mayor,  incidentally,  is not saying  yes all the time to the municipal unions  which have caused part of the problem  in the past.  Beginning last December and continu ing in February and March of this year,  the Subcommittee on Economic Stabili zation, of which I am a member, held  several days of hearings on New York  City. I want to say here and now that  the testimony provided us by the various  witnesses who appeared before us was  most persuasive and  thoroughly docu ments  those  remedial steps  taken by  New York City as well as what end re sults have been established. Ten essen tial facts, stressed again and again by  various spokesmen need to be noted:  First, it is clear that the city has made  every  effort  to  overcome  its former  budgetary problems.  Again, I want to say I have confidence  that Mayor Koch is trying to turn the  situation around in New York City and  is not saying ""yes""  to  the municipal  unions' every wish.  Second, New York City is still not able  to  reenter  the  all-important  private  market to obtain needed financing.  Third, it has cut many corners and  reduced the level of many of its services.  Fourth, it has lowered its deficit from  $2 billion in 1975  to a current level of  only $600 million.  I again go from my prepared remarks  to remind my dear friend,  the gentle man from Zephyrhills <Mr. KELLY)  that  from Mayfield, Ky.,  and Zephyrhills,  Fla., regarding the welfare that is being  doled out in New York City, many of  those welfare recipients have come from  his district and mine.  Fifth, New York City has always been  on time in the repayment of the seasonal  loans that we guaranteed during the last  Congress, and its outlays have remained  constant despite inflation.  Sixth, New York City's failure to enter  the market last October was,  in large  measure, due to the lack of a guarantee  as well as  the  inability of  the city  to  produce a genuinely balanced budget.  Seventh, any assistance to be provided  from either State or city pension funds  cannot be expected unless some Federal  guarantees could be offered.  Eighth, mere extension of the current  short-term loan authority will only pro long the agony of revival efforts.  Ninth, private  investors .need  long term commitments, and a seasonal ap proach simply would not do that job.  Tenth, the bankruptcy of New York  City would carry with it economic re percussions, domestic as well as interna tional,  that would  be massive  yet  unpredictable.  Mr. Chairman, I believe our commit tee has developed legislation which will  meet many of these problems and lead to  their solution:  The details of the bill have been out lined.  It is a responsible effort on our part.  ",1978

237,House,95,-0.383,329,13,Mr. 'WRIGHT.," Mr. Speaker, whenever  any part of this big American family of  ours has been smitten by disaster,  the  rest of us have always been willing  to  come to the rescue. That is a tradition as  old as the Nation itself. It is part of what  is meant by being one Nation under God,  indivisible.  When the Dust Bowl smote the Great  Plains of the Midwest, New York Con gressmen voted  for  the Great Plains  conservation program. New York City  residents have paid $1 out of every $10  of the billions that have gone into that  long-range rehabilitation effort. And it  has been good for the Nation.  When 7 years of drought ravaged my  State and the whole American South west, every single Member of  the New  York City  delegation  voted  for  the  drought relief program, and citizens of  New York City paid $1 out of every $10  that went into that program.  When generations of neglect left the  vast Appalachian  region  lingering be hind the rest of the country, in wide spread  poverty, New York Members  voted for the Appalachian development  program. New York City residents have  paid-not on a short-time basis, not on  a grudging basis, but on a long-term and  the  I  continuing basis-$1 out of every $10 in  taxes  that have helped  restore Appalachia.  Flood walls in Florida, water projects  for the American West, crop supports for  the heartland of America-$1 of every  $10 that have gone in taxes to support  these vital long-term programs has come  from the citizens of New York City.  Now New York needs our help, and it  is not going to cost us one red penny,  judging by past experience. They have  faithfully  repaid on  time or ahead of  time, and with interest, every cent that  we extended in the loan of 1975.  New Yorkers are not here asking for a  handout;  they are only asking  for a  hand up. They are not asking  for a  grant, nor even a loan from the Federal  Government, but merely for a long-term  loan guarantee so that they can borrow  in the private markets and thus rehabil itate their own city by their own efforts.  Now,  the gentleman from Ohio sug gested that we  just give  them only a  short-term extension. But let me ask you  this, my friends:  If financial difficulty  caused you to have to seek refinancing of  your home to sustain your family, would  you think you should be required to pay  back  the whole mortgage  in 3 years?  That would not help you. You would  need some reasonable long-term oppor tunity to work yourself out of the prob lem. That is what the bill offers. It is not  what the recommital motion offers.  If you have a leak in the tire of your  automobile, would you merely pump a  little more air in so you could go perhaps  3 more miles? No, you would be wiser to  fix the tire. It would take a little longer,  but ultimately it would have to be done.  New York City is asking for a vote of  confidence  in  its  long-range  future.  I  think it has proven itself worthy of that  vote of our confidence. Not only has it  faithfully repaid every penny of the pre vious loan ahead of schedule; the Gov ernment has made $13 million on that  transaction.  New York  citizens  themselves have  tightened their belts. The city has done  every single thing which it promised to  do  in its austerity program. It has re duced the city payroll by 60,000 people.  It has closed hospitals. It has made every  citizen pay tuition in the City College.  Very  impressive  self-help measures  have come from the citizens of New York  themselves. City employee pension funds  have purchased $2.65 billion in long term  bonds. The State of New York has made  available $800 million a year to help re store liquidity. Because of all  this,  the  city of New York has made great pro gress. They have reduced their budget  deficit from $1.8 billion in 1975 down to  $760 million today.  So they have earned a measure of our  faith. Let us look at the alternative of  our refusal. If we should fail to express  this confidence in their long-range fu ture and  if New York City, America's  biggest city, were to go bankrupt, shock  waves would be sent throughout the en tire economy. Citizens of your communi ties and mine would have to pay higher  property taxes to finance any kind of lo cal improvement, because the bond mar",1978

239,House,95,-0.45,342,13,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike  the  requisite number of words,  and I rise to speak against the amend ment.  Mr. Chairman, I  really do not quite  know how to begin. I do not really know  which of my feelings  to leave unmen tioned and which of them  to express,  frankly, about this amendment.  The gentleman from Michigan <Mr.  FORD)  has already  indicated what the  effect will be. I just want to make a few  observations so as to put this amendment  in context.  No.  1,  in my  judgment,  if  the ad ministration is supporting this amend ment-and it is difficult  to determine  what  they are supporting on  this bill  these days-but if they are supporting  this amendment that would, in fact, be  a betrayal of every person in this House  who,  just a week ago, stuck with  the  President  on  the  tuition  tax  credit  proposal.  The second point I would like to make  is that even if you are for a tuition tax  credit I would think, because I think the  motivation for both proposals, both the  tuition tax credit and the middle income  student assistance, is the same, I think  you would feel very unhappy about the  prospect of cutting out from participa tion in the BOG program every family  that earns more than $22,000 a year.  If this  is an administration amend ment then what they are saying to the  Congress is: ""Mr. Congressman, you can  not change ~dministration priorities by  1 percent. You can not do that.""  If we acquiesce in that we might as  well all wire our buttons to the White  House and go home. I do not think we  came here to be the President's Congress men, I think we came here to be our own  people's Congressmen. And my people  especially  those  in  the middle  income  area, say, ""Look, we do not mind pro grams that help  the poor. We do not  mind foreign aid programs if they are  designed right and do the job they are  supposed  to do, but we would  like  to  share, occasionally, in the largesse of the  Government.""  What the President is doing, if he is, in  fact, supporting this amendment, is ask ing me, 10 days from now, on this floor,  to defend a foreign aid bill against efforts  to cut an additional $600 million from  that budget. We have already cut the for eign aid bill $1.2 billion in committee.  This committee has taken half of that  cut and put it into domestic programs.  ",1978

242,Senate,95,-0.465,433,13,Mr. HATHAWAY.," Mr. President, the  bill  I am introducing  today,  the State  and Local Government Funding Impact  Act, is part of a continuing effort on my  part to require greater a.::countability by  both  the Federal burea1cracy and  the  Congress.  We have  all heard  the  complaints  from  our  constituents-the  Federal  Government has become cumbersome,  insensitive,  interfer1ng,  unresponsive.  The complaints are persistent and grow ing, and directed not  just against the  bureaucracy, but against Congress as  well. We in Congress are criticized for  passing too many laws without sufficient  concern for their effect in the long run.  We have already taken some steps to  answer  these complaints. The Budget  Act was a major improvement in the way  Congress deals with legislation. The re quirement for a paperwork impact state ment was another. I hope that this ses sion will see the passage of the Sunset  bill, which I cosponsor.  The role of Congress  in oversight of  the Federal rulemaking process would be  strengthened by two pending measures,  Senate Resolution 360, which I sponsor,  and S. 2862, the Regulatory Control Act,  which I cosponsor.  Congress still has a great deal to do  to improve its own performance in these  areas. We must prepare our legislation  with greater care and with better under standing for how it will affect the people  we are trying to help and the people in  other  levels of government who must  work with it.  The State  and Local Government  Funding Impact Act was drafted as the  result of numerous discussions with State  and local officials in Maine. They have  stated consistently that one of their ma jor problems in dealing with Federal aid  programs  is  the uncertainty about the  continuance of Federal funding and of  the effect that this uncertainty has on  their own administrative and budget re quirements.  This  legislation would  improve  that  situation by requiring greater specificity  in stating the administrative and fiscal  impact of Federal aid programs on State  and local governments. It would require  every  report accompanying  legislation  that authorizes a new program on new  spending authority  for a  program  to  state:  First. How the program would be ad ministered, whether by State or  local  government, and why such a plan of ad ministration was chosen;  Second. How much matching expendi ture by State and  local governments  would be required and why a particular.  level of matching was chosen, and  Third. What existing programs or ac tivities, on any level, duplicate or supple ment the proposed program.  This legislation will help make Con gress more accountable. It would prob ably result in less legislation, but, I hope,  better legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 3185  Be  it enacted by  the Senate and House  of Representatives of the United States of  America i~ Congress assembled, That  this  Act may be cited as  the ""State and Local  Government Funding Impact Act of 1978"".  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES  SEc. 2. (a) The Congress finds that there  is a recognized need for more effective over sight of Federal programs and activities in  order to conserve and use more efficiently in creasingly scarce Federal budget resources;  that there is a need for greater understand ing by State and local governments of the  impact that Federal programs w1Il have on  their own administrative and budget require ments; and that a major barrier to effective  oversight is a  lack of adequate specificity in  statements of how Federal programs will  affect State and local governments.  (b) The purposes of this Act are  to im prove congressional oversight of Federal pro grams and activities and to increase the un derstanding by State and local governments  of the effect of such programs and activities  by requiring greater specificity in stating the  administrative and fiscal impact of such pro grams  and  activities on State and  local  governments.

However, if I had been there, I would  have voted nay.  This  amendment would have given  congressional approval to an act which  threatened the foundation of this body;  that  foundation  being  the  right  of  elected Representatives to make laws. It  would have given to the Federal bureauc racy the right to implement law by fiat.  In addition,  it would have seriously  challenged  the  second  amendment  rights  guaranteed  all  law-abiding  Americans in the Constitution. The peo ple of my great State have  registered  a  firm  commitment  to  those  second  amendment rights, and those that are  familiar with  the State of Alaska are  June 8, 1978  well aware that firearms are a part of  daily life in the bush. I am grateful that  n. majority of this body saw fit to protect  those rights, and once again, I reiterate  my vote of nay to the McClory amend ment H.R. 12930.e  MEDICARE FUNDING FOR  ABORTIONS  HON.

245,,95,-0.323,498,13,Mr. PATTISON of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, once again we are confronted  with the issue of medicare funding for  abortions.  I do not  intend or wish  to  argue either side of  the abortion  issue  here today. Neither the legality or the  morality of abortions at the question at  hand. The legality of abortions has been  decided by the Supreme Court. Only a  constitutional amendment, not an appro priations bill, can possibly change that  situation. As to its morality, the various  theologies of  the world are unable  to  agree. A vote on the Hyde amendment  does not represent approval or encour agement of abortion.  We have never teen able to come up  with a moral consensus on the abortion  question. If the world's religions are un able  to agree  that  the practice  is  im moral,  it  is  rather presumptuous of a  legislative body to do so. The House of  Representatives was created to make the  laws by which our country is governed.  But the Congress most definitely is not  gifted with  the ability  to make moral  decisions  for an entire Nation. As  in  other matters, except where there is vir tually universal agreement, the question  of morality should be left to each indi vidual. Those who oppose abortions will  not choose  to have one. By  the same  token, however, those women who do not  oppose abortions should be allowed to de cide for themselves. It is undoubtedly a  difficult and heavy choice to face.  By denying medicaid funding of abor tions to poor women, we are leaving the  freedom of choice only  to  those more  affluent who can afford it. This attempt  to restrict poor women's access to medi caid funds for abortions is clearly an act  of  discrimination,  based  solely  upon  wealth or income.  I have consistently voted against the  restrictive  language which would deny  medicaid funding of abortions  to poor  women, because the fact is, abortion un der  the  law of  the United States  is a  legitimate medical procedure. The legal ity of the operation has been recognized  by the U.S. Supreme Court and cannot  be  changed,  except  by  constitutional  amendment. No  consensus  has  been  reached on the morality of the issue. If  any one of these facts was different;  if  abortions were illegal; if the medical pro cedure was not accepted as a legitimate  one; or if the country as a whole was  able  to agree on  the proposition  that  abortions are immoral, I would not sup port medicaid funding of abortions.

246,,95,0.08,511,13,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, it has been  my good  fortune  to know  the distin guished Congressman, GEORGE MAHON  chairman of  the Appropriations Com~  mittee and dean of the House of Rep resentatives, for quite a few years. One  day he approached me on the ftoor of  the House stating that he  felt  that I  might know Shakespeare. To this I re plied that over  the years I had found  great pleasure  in  language written by  the Bard of Avon in words of such en during charm that men  treasure them  and will not let them die.  In succeeding conversations with the  dean of  the House,  different  literary  quotations were  passed  between  us.  Among  them was  the quotation  from  Longfellow's ""Excelsior.""  Beware the pine-tree's withered branch!  Beware the awful avalanche!  That was the peasant's last Goodnight.  A voice replied, far up the height, Excelsior!  As it happens, the newspaper in Lub ~ock, Tex.,  is called  the Avalanche. It  Is my pleasure to include for the perusal  of the Members an article by Jay Harris  which appeared  in  the Lubbock Ava lanche. Excelsior  in  this  sense means  ever upward, as I understand it. It has  been my good  fortune  to know great  men of  letters  in  the House-l place  GEORGE MAHON's name at the top. The  article follows:  THE BEST YEARS ...  (By Jay Harris)  Not  long ago, Cong. George Mahon sent  us an item of interest.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  It reftectea the veteran  legislator's wide ranging  interests,  including that in poetry  which he has been known to quote at the  drop cf a meter in the nation's capital. Here  is a portion of the letter he Eent:  ""Dr. Tim Lee Carter, a favorite Congress man friend from Kentucky, and I exchange  quote3 from Shakespeare and literature gen erally from  time to time when we meet in  the corridors of  the Capitol.  ""On one recent cccasion in the House, he  observed my reading from The Lubbock Ava lanche-Journal. He said,  'Beware the awful  avalanche.'  ""I told him that I recalled that 'you who  bore, mid snow and  ice, a banner with the  strange device,' but I did not remember any  reference  to  the avalanche. But here  it is.  I  am glad  to say  that  I, myself, do not  think The Avalanche is awful!""  Then Mr. Mahon enclosed the frontispiece  and opening page of ""The Complete Poetical  Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.'' And  he also sent along Pageg 22-23, which con tain the poem ""Excelsior.""  The words, once familiar to most students,  start, if the old timers recall: ""The shades of  night were falling fast, As through the Alpine  village passed, A youth, who bore, 'mid snow  and ice, A banner with the strange DEVICE,  Excelsior ! ""  And midway through the poem: ""Try not  the pass! the old man said; Dark lowers the  tempest overhead, The  roaring  torrent  is  deep and wide! And loud that clarion voice  replied, Excelsior!""  Then:  ""Beware  the pine-tree's withered  branch! Beware  the awful avalanche! This  was the peasant's last Goodnight. A voice re plied, far up the height, Excelsior!""  The poem goes on to relate how: ""At break  of day, as heavenward, The pious monks of  Saint Bernard, Uttered  the  oft-repeated  prayer, A voice cried through the startled air,  Excelsior!""  Then, near the end: ""A traveller, by the  faithful hound, Half-buried in the snow was  found, Still grasping in his hand of ice, That  banner with  the strange device, Excelsior!  ""There in the twilight cold and gray, Life less, but beautiful, he lay, And from the sky,  serene and far, A voice fell, like a falling star,  Excelsior!""  Ah, we wonder if modern youth reads, and  heeds, such things? We are sure  the poem  meant much to the young George Mahon of  yore, studying for a career which even he at  the time had no inkling would reach such  lofty heights.  But, knowing the man, and from the man  the youth, we are sure that somewhere back  there in those pioneer schools and his later  studies at then Simmons (later Hardin-Sim mons) and the University of Texas, the youth  and young man was inspired.  We often have wondered if today's youth  would take up the banners of causes such as  those in World War I and later World War II  and do so with fervor and understanding.  '  It was not just youth alone which drove  millions of young, middle-aged and  some  older men, and women, to fight a battle for  Democracy-and  believe  their  cause was  right.  To us, the saddest chapter in this nation's  history is the one written in the jungles and  doubt-infested valleys of Vietnam.  While  there  were many  who  indeed  doubted their cause,  there were  thousands  who believed in it, only to find their fellow  citizens-both young and old, but more of  the latter-undermining them at home.  We have never been one to believe in ""lost  causes"" or moral victories. And while ""win ning  isn't everything,""  it's  like  the man  said--especially in a war-it beats anything  else.  Thinking back upon the men we knew who  16949  gave their all in World War II, later in the  Korean conflict and the Vietnam debacle men who volunteered, incidentally-we won der what else they might have contributed to  their country.  Would they have grown up to be statesmen  molded in the form of a George Mahon, a  Harry Truman, a George Marshall, a Norman  Vincent Peal, an outstanding doctor or scien tist or even a newsman?  And, having given as they did, was their  sacrifice and contribution any the less?  We  think not, and we  think we should  never forget that fact. In an age when pa triotism sometimes is equated with buttons  and bows  and old-fashioned  ideas  about  morals and such, one wonders if the young of  today, or the older for that matter, would  take  up  the  ""banner with  the  strange  device.""  Banners and causes can be  taken up  in  other ways than just in fighting wars, and  should be. And  in so saying, we mean  in  achieving for one's fellowman, not in ""taking  to  the streets""  in some  form of senseless  anarchy or narrow ""right.""  We recall during the height of the Viet nam protests a young man who worked with  us  asked one  day:  ""And what did your  friends who died gain by their deed?""  Our answer was simple: ""The best years of  your life!""  "" ... And from the sky, serene and far, A  voice fell, like a falling star, Excelsior!"" e  THE TAX CODE  HON. WILLIS D. GRADISON, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 8, 1978  G ",1978
247,,95,0.233,511,13,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Speaker, today  I would  like  to insert in the CoNGRZS SIONAL  RECORD  an  article written by  Richard L.  Lesher,  president  of  the  Chamber of Commerce of  the United  States. The article points out some very  important but relatively unknown facts  about the distribution of the Federal in come tax liability. As the article points  out, a true reform of the tax code would  be ending  the ""bracket creep"" caused  by inftation that raises every taxpayer's  liability automatically every year. This  Congress could take a large step forward  toward a fair and permanent reform by  enacting an indexing procedure for the  personal income tax system. I hope you  will give Mr. Lesher's c.omments serious  consideration:  DEMOLISHING MYTHS ABOUT THE TAX CODE  (By Richard L. Lesher)  WASHINGTON.-Would you be surprised to  hear that:  The ""richest"" half of America's taxpayers  pay 93 percent of the personal income tax?  Loopholes and fringe benefits are of most  value to the low-to-middle income group?  Americans owe more to their government  than a meaieval serf owed to his overlord?  It's all  true. These are just a  few of the  iconoclastic revelations contained in a mind blowing article on  tax policy appearing  in  the  March  1978,  edition  of  Harper's  magazine.  The article was written by Paul Craig Rob erts, who is both college professor and Sen ate staffer. His simple thesis is that we are  all being taken by a parasitic government in  unholy alliance with good-hearted tax ""re formers"" who place their faith in a few sim plistic  slogans without ever  checking  the  figures.

248,House,95,0.177,537,13,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.," Madam  Chairman,  I  rise  in  support of  this  transportation appropriation bill.  As a member of  the Transportation  Appropriations Subcommittee, I assure  you that we have worked together dili gently  to present a  funding proposal  which  balances  the Nation's diverse  transportation needs against  the even  greater need to keep Federal spending in  check.  I  commend  our  subcommittee  chairman, Mr. McFALL, for his fair and  thorough approach to this bill and for  his expert handling of the difficult prob lem of planning a transportation budget  while the authorizing committee is still  debating legislation which would entirely  revise the highway and mass transit pro grams.  I  also  commend  the  ranking  minority member, Mr. CONTE,  for his  hard work in putting this bill together.  It's not perfect, but on balance it is a  good bill.  I am pleased to be able to report that  our committee's bill is $211 million below  the budget request, while still providing  a total of $8.9 billion in new budget au thority for transportation programs, and  $9.6 billion for liquidation of obligations.  Let me just mention a few of the major  items we have funded.  For Amtrak, we have provided a total  of $660 million, the bulk of which is for  operating grants. The Department of  Transportation is now in the process of  developing a  new  route  structure  for  Amtrak, however, and our committee  will consider a new  request  to adjust  these funds if the final route structure  requires it. We have increased funding  for the railroad safety programs of the  FRA,  recommending 25 new positions,  most of which will be assigned  to in crease  track  inspections. We are ex tremely concerned about the number of  recent  train derailments and a better  track safety effort  is needed. For the  Washington Metro, we have provided  $19.4 million only for the Federal inter est subsidy for bonds. No additional con struction funds will be appropriated for  the Metro pending local agreement on  the  long-range financing plan for  the  system. For UMTA, we have approved a  substantial increase, to allow most of its  programs  to be funded  through direct  appropriations in fiscal ~-ear 1979.  Under our bill,  the Federal Highway  Administration is funded at a level con sistent with the new highway legislation  under consideration in the House Public  Works Committee, which would continue  financing highway programs through di rect appropriations. These programs in clude  some  very  important  highway  safety research, as well as rail-highway  crossing demonstration projects on and  off the Federal system. For the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  we have recommended $80.2 million, but  the committee is concerned about  the  justifications for NHTSA's truck brake  standards and suggests that the NHTSA  review its procedures for developing all  new standards, including those for air bags and other passive restraints.  In a number of  transportation pro grams, the administration requested full  funding in the 1979 fiscal year and the  committee disagreed. For example,  the  FAA provisions are under the budget, at  $2.4 billion because flight service station  improvements were not full  funded  in  this bill.  In a  similar case,  the Coast  Guard's bridge alteration program was  not full funded, representing a savings  in this bill of $19.7 million. Of course, the  bill for these bridges will have to be paid  in future years. The committee did rec ommend an increase of 750 new positions  for the Coast Guard in 1979, to meet the  additional environmental, marine safety,  and law enforcement responsibilities re quired by  the new 200-mile  limit. We  have also included language in our com mittee report indicating that the Coast  Guard should review its search and res cue operations to determine whether and  how they may be better coordinated, par ticularly with  the agencies of  the De partment of Defense; and I concur in  that recommendation.  I am particularly appalled by the cur rent slowdown by the air traffic control lers. There can be no excuse for the in convenience caused thousands of passen gers who travel by air, which is appar ently brought about because  the con trollers have been denied free air travel  overseas.  The  authorizing  committee  should give  immediate consideration to  the question of free  transportation for  any Federal employee. There is no rea son why the airlines should have to pro vide this service.  For the CAB, we have recommended a  total of  28 new  J:Ositions, which will  hopefully help eliminate the backlog of  cases and allow the CAB  to strengthen  its consumer programs and handle addi tional route applications.  Included with  these funding  recom mendations of national importance are  several provisions of direct concern in my  congressional district. The committee re port includes language to insure that de sign and engineering work will begin in  fiscal 1979 on the Cochrane Bridge over  the Mobile River. That bridge is in dan gerous condition and must be replaced.  I support provisions in the Public Works  Committee's new  highway  bill which  would  assist  the States  in  replacing  bridges which are in great disrepair, but  which are too costly to be fund €d  from  the States' regular allocations.  In addition, this bill includes funds to  allow the Coast Guard to purchase ap proximately 230 acres of property it is  currently leasing for its aviation facility  in Mobile;  it includes funds for a new  flight simulator addition at that avia tion center; and it provides funds for the  construction of  the Three Mile Creek  Bridge under the Coast Guard's bridge  alteration program.  Our committee bill also provides $4  million for the Sandhill Crane Wildlife  Refuge  in Mississippi. Construction of  the I-10  interchange at Gautier, Miss.,  has  been delayed  pending  assurances  that this endangered species will be pro tected, and the courts have held that the  agency responsible for  the construction  of the project is also responsible for the  required mitigation.  This  is a quick overview of some of  the  important programs and projects  funded through this transportation ap propriation bill. As in any appropriations  bill  there are  some  items which  are  funded or programs omitted which  I  would have handled differently if I had  sole control over the bill. But we operate  under the committee system, and I am  convinced  that  our  committee  has  brought a reasonably well-balanced bill  to the floor. I believe it is worthy of your  support.  Mr. McFALL. Madam Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. DICKS).  ",1978

253,,95,0.496,654,13,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, an out standing  Houston  journalist,  Lynn  Ashby, recently wrote one of the most  perceptive articles I have ever had the  pleasure of  reading. It would be well  worth the time for my Colleagues in Con .gress to take a few minutes to carefully  read his comments which appeared  in  the Houston Post on Sunday, June 4:  JIMMY: HELP I  (By Lynn Ashby)  PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER,  The White Home,  Washin,ton. D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I knOW you are quite  busy, what with running the Western world  and all, but I would like to talk to you just  a minute. In the long run, it might actually  save you a lot of time. My plea is simple.  Please,  leave me alone.  You  are no doubt  thinking:  ""I'm not  bothering you, you're bothering me."" So, let  me explain.  I  am overgoverned, overtaxed, overregu lated and overspent.  I have more govern ment than I have ever had before. It's more  than I want and more  than I can afford.  Under your management are 41  regulatory  agencies with an annual budget of $4.82  blllion, which is about double what it was  only  four years  ago. You have agents  to  regulate my every move, my every deed, my  every dollar.  Then there 1s the judiciary, regulators of  another sort. Federal Judges I never voted for  June 9, 1978  and never heard of tell me where to send m-y  children  to school, how  to build my  jailb,  where to draw my city's limits, when to hold  my elections and in which languages.  Now, why is it that you feel I can't take  care of myself? Where does it say that those  working in or for Washington are somehow  innBJtely superior in intelllgence to the rest  of us? I don't need all this help, honest.  I get the idea that you, and those working  under you,  really have  a  low opinion of  Americans. You feel that we are not smart  enough to cope without your help. Well, our  fathers were smart enough. So were  their  fathers and their fathers. But obviously the  sons of the '70s did not inherit this wisdom.  Thus, it is felt, we mus.t be protected.  Really, I think you underestimate us. We  aren't that stupid. We elected you, didn't  we? Yet we are buried under an avalanche  of expensive government advice, mostly un solicited. I am paying an extra $666  for a  U.S. automobile because of  the regulations  Detroit must labor under. A hospital room  averages $22 more per day, due to govern ment red tape. Dow Chemical estimates it  spent $147 million in 1975 complying with  federal  regulations, and  I would  imagine  this was all passed on to the consumer.  All right, to be fair, we do need some rule8,  some regulations, some inspections, but good  Lord,  the 1977 Federal Registry has 65,603  pages, up 8,531 from the year before. Whether  you are a liberal or a conservative, Mr. Presi dent, let's be reasonable.  This  rampaging growth of your govern ment is costing me a bundle, and I'm getting  tired of it. You talked a good fight during  the election about  curta111ng  the  federal  bureaucracy. The fact is, according to Alan  Campbell,  chairman of  the Civil Service,  there has been no cutback in the number of  federal employes. And those taken oft' your  own White House  staff have simply been  transferred to other federal agencies. I'm stUl  paying them.  The cost of federal, state and local govern ments, according  to one study,  is growing  at a rate of $5.2 million an hour. Our gov ernments now spend almost one-third of our  GNP, and the fact that the U.S. has slipped  from first  in the world  to seventh 1n per  capita GNP tells us something, right there.  I am now obligated for $150,000 in govern ment spending, an increase of $20,000 in the  last year a.lone. The average American worked  !rom Jan. 1 to May 5 Just to pay his taxes.  This is more than ever before, but I can't see  that we're any better off. We've just got more  people on the government payroll taking in  e.nd handing out more of our money.  In just one area, you are taking $248 bll llcn from us and spreading it around through  182 different federal programs, ranging from  $8 million in guaranteed income to owners  of sheep and goats selllng mohair or wool, to  $5.4 blllion for food stamps. This year you  s;>ent $500 mlllion, a half blllion dollars,  mind you, for films, TV spots and federal  movies. And you spent $35 m11lion for sani tation fac111ties for Indians.  Do not get me wrong. I am all for feeding  the hungry, clothing the naked, making life  better for our downtrodden. But you have  gone off the deep end. Two weeks ago HEW  had a little birthday party for itself, and it  cost $15,000. When someone complained, it  was noted that this ls less than HEW spends  every three seconds.  If you  are  overspending,  you  are  also  wasting. It is estimated that through fraud,  creating and theft, close to $12 b1111on 1s lost  by the federal government each year. That is  a lot of money, and frankly, I think you could  do a better job in this matter.  Look, we've got problems. Last year  the  average worker's hourly salary went up 9  percent but his productivity went up only  ",1978

The point I wanted to make is that the  statute does authorize the Administrator  to  take action against those chemicals  which do  show unreasonable  risks  to  health and the environment.  the gentleman from Texas <Mr.  ECKHARDT) has already pointed out, we  very carefully constructed the language  in the act when it was before us a couple  of years ago to make sure that the burden  would be on the Government to take a  potentially dangerous chemical off  the  market. We felt that that was where the  burden properly lay.  Of course, this part of the act has not  even been implemented yet. All we are  doing here with this authorization is per mitting the authorization of funds for  the staffing up of this agency with re searchers,  toxicologists,  chemists,  and  others who have some expertise for the  purpose of being able to evaluate poten tially dangerous chemicals.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would urge  that we support this authorization since  it is, as I say, to permit the staffing up at  the beginning stages of  this new pro gram. The program has not even been  implemented insofar as the enforcement  aspects are concerned.  ",1978

264,House,95,-0.4,823,13,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Chairman, our atti tude  toward  life permeates whatever  we do. It appears to me that we are on a  collision course in terms of our action  the Congress as  they  ma~ufest our resnect for life, especially  as It relates to the poor. There are no  funds for agencies who solely want to  enable a poor woman to have counseling  and assistance to carry the fetus to term.  As a result, and I have seen this come in  from our federally defined proverty areas  myself, poor women usually are dealt  with onlv in terms of having an abortion.  It is truly discrimination in reverse.  However, those of us who wish to main tain  the Hvde  language must have a  commitment to aid these poor children  as ~embers of  I  support  the Hyde  whose  lives we save in terms of  their  human needs. We must  support  the  Mitchell amendment which directs at tention away from the military and to ward  the human needs. We muat be  interested in preserving life, not manu facturing the neutron bomb. We ~nust be  more  concerned with  aiding  foreign  countries not with bullets but with food,  clothing, and shelter.  We must be concerned with the plight  of our elderly.  We must love and respect life from the  dawn of life <the fetus) to the evening of  life (tho elderly).  That  is why  language.  It should reflect on all o.f our actions  a::. Members of Congress.  I sincerely regret that I must reject  the amendment put forth by my good  friend  and  colleague,  the  gentleman  from Ohio <Mr. STOKES), whose positions  on most  issues  I usually support and  respect.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair  recog nizes the gentleman from Minnesota <Mr.  0BERSTAR).  ",1978
265,House,95,-0.553,823,13,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  The issue we face in this debate is the  right of defenseless human life to exist.  Abortion is not the solution to a prob lem, it is the failure of society to look  for a solution.  The unborn life we seek to protect with  the language of section 209 in the HEW  appropriation bill, is, to be sure, incon venient life, burdensome life. It came at  the wrong  time, maybe; or possibly in  the wrong form-disabled, handicapped,  retarded,  the wrong  sex-discovered  through the scientific marvel of amnio centesis--or whatever other  reasoned  excuse. The point i:>,  this is defenseless  life;  the most defenseless in our midst,  life to which we owe the highest order of  care and legal protection.  The issue is not whether we will pro vide funding for a service to one eco nomic  class  of  citizens  and  not  to  another-the Government does not fund  abortions for the well to do so it has no  obligation to provide them for the poor.  The issue is not the rights of the poor  to a  service, but,  rather,  the right of  the unborn to live.  The  language of  the committee bill  protects that right. It does two things:  It protects the life of the unborn; it pro tects the life of the mother, if endan gered by the pregnancy.  There are many other services we do  provide  for  the poor-preand post natal care, pregnancy counseling, child  services, health care services, to mention  a  few. There are many more  that we  r.hould provide-alternatives to abortion  that are not now adequately provided,  either through authorization or appro priation.  There can be no room in the heart of a  compassionate government for funding  of programs to terminate innocent life.  I urge the defeat of this amendment,  which is no less than an open assault on  human life.  I do not think we need extended debate-our minds have either been made  up by ourselves or for us by our con stituents.  I urge your vote for the voiceless and  voteless of our society-the unborn.  Let us defeat  this amendment and  send a clear message to the other body,  that we intend to stand firm for human  life.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair  recog nizes the gentlewoman from New York  (MS. HOLTZMAN).  ",1978
266,House,95,-0.493,823,13,Ms. HOLTZMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I am  concerned about the debate that we have  heard here because it is really irrelevant.  Whether anybody here agrees or dis agrees with the right. to abortion, the fact  is that it exists and is constitutionally  guaranteed in this country. We have the  right to disagree with the Supreme Court  decision or disagree with the Constitu tion. That is a matter of personal pref erence. It seems to me the debate here is  irrelevant  to  the sole  issue before us  which is whether or not women who can not afford to have an abortion, who can not afford to exercise their constitutional  rights will be denied the opportunity to a  sa.fe  abortion performed under med ical safeguards.  I  think that it is heartless, cruel and,  in a way, sanctimonious for us to say that  we will prevent young women and older  women who cannot afford  to have an  abortion the right to decent health care  with respect to their abortion.  I also think that it is inexcusable for  this committee to come to the floor of the  House with this restriction on the right  of abortion without having presented to  the Members of Congress the health ef fects of restrictions presently in the law.  How many women who have been denied  the right to a safe, legal abortion have  had back-alley or self-induced abortions  and, as a result, have died or have suf fered  infections,  sterility, physical  in firmities and the like? Why are we not  presented with that information?  I think the amendment offered by the  gentleman  from Ohio  <Mr.  STOKEs)  ought to be supported.  ",1978

This decision permit media access and  coverage of House proceedings, but only  by means of audio coverage.  I  think that in contrast to what was  said on this floor on Monday, this does  not represent an historic breakthrough,  but rather an historic breakdown. It rep resents a very serious misreading and  misinterpretation of  the provisions of  House Resolution 866, which clearly pro vided for  the simultaneous availability  of audio and visual coverage of all pro ceedings by the broadcast media.  At no point  last on October 27 of  last year when that resolution was over whelmingly adopted was there any sug gestion, nor was there any suggestion in  the deliberations that took place in the  Committee on Rules before that resolu tion came to the floor of the House, that  audio and visual coverage should be de coupled and that audio coverage should  be made available to the media before  visual coverage occurred.  y  !-'  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JAMES  BROWNING ALLEN  ",1978

276,Senate,95,-0.237,992,13,Mr. MORGAN.," Mr. President, I have  taken the opportunity this weekend to  explore and review the amendments to  S. 2467 proposed by  the supporters of  this bill. I would like to comment briefly  on them.  First, I wish to compliment the pro ponents of S. 2467 for their willingness  t0  listen  to  the concerns of Senators  such as myself who have a genuine inter est in the preservation of our system of  effective  labor-management regulation.  I believe that the distinguished Senators  from New Jersey and New York along  with the majority leader have sought to  accommodate some of the fears I have  had about the effect of S. 2467.  Let me give an example of compromise  which I believe is essential to any legis lative act.  In the area of equal access, the sup porters of  the bill have attempted  to  work out a compromise. In an important  effort,  they have  tried  to clarify  the  point that an employer should not pay  an employee to listen to an outside labor  organizer. I expressed some reservations  about this approach as a constitutional  isr.ue. While  I  remain opposed  to  the  so-called equal access rule, I did want  to state my appreciation for the spirit  in which these changes were made and  I wanted to thank the Senators for their  reasonableness.  While I am glad to see some move on  the part of the supporters of this bill,  I must confess that I remain concerned  r,hout the approach of this bill and about  its specifics.  Before addressing the individual pro visions, I would like to reaffirm my con cern that the labor law reform bill rep resents a maior alteration in the thrust  of our labor laws, in spite of the changes  set forth by the new amendments. I must  reaffirm my view that this bill will have  a major impact on small business and  will affect the spirit in which labor and  management conduct their relations and  will affect their attitudes toward employ ees.  I must reaffirm my view  that the  need for this bill has yet to be demon strated; I have not seen the failings of  the present system which mandate such  a reform effort. My fear is that it will be  the employees who suffer from most of  the reforms proposed inS. 2467.  ELECTION CHANGES  The first proposal  for chan~e deals  with amending the election provisions of  S. 2467. The amendment provides that  the maximum time for setting elections  shall be 35 days after an employer re ceives notice of a union organizing ef fort--and I emphasize the word ""effort.""  Mr. Pre~ident, I must confess that I  am concerned that there is no rationality  involved in this amendment. To what is  a 35-day time limit related? One Sena tor stqted in the markuu of S. 2467 in  the Human Resources Committee  that  this  is pretty much a numbers game.  Personally, I do not see it that way. We  are dealing with a lot of employees and  a lot of employers, and to them there is  no game at all in this bill.  At present. the National Labor Relations Board has been acting so as to pro duce elections in between12 and 45 days.  The figure of 45 days seems a reasonable  one. On the whole, however, I must re turn to my earlier position-this matter  should oe left to the NLRB. The fact that  we have a bill in the House of Represent atives which calls for a 15-day election  and  a  bill  in  the Senate which has  changed from 21  to 35 days reinforces  my point that the Congress is invading  the province of the National Labor Re lations Board. My personal view is that  if the Congress wishes to direct the Board  to set time limits, then we might wish to  state our feelings that time limits should  be formalized by the Board. We should  not make arbitrary and unsupported de terminations  about  appropriate  time  limits. This  issue  is  too  important  to  too many people for us to do so. I have  no quarrel with the notification and time  computation provisions, but  I  remain  opposed to the imposition of time limits  by the Congress. The Board is the expert  in  these matters  and  its  discretion  should be maintained.  In fact, as I  read  it,  this substitute  may be worse than the committee ver sion or that of the House of Representa tives. As I understand it, a union would  file a notice of an intent to organize.  This notice of intent could not be acted  upon for 35 days, at which time a peti tion would be filed. If the union has a  majority of the cards and is an appro priate bargaining unit under Board rules,  then  the Board, under  this substitute,  would have to give the petition priority  and hold the election as soon as possible.  The result is that there would be no hear ing to insure that the whole affair was  correct and elections could be held at  any time, perhaps within 5 days, after  a petitio:l is filed. I am particularly dis turbed by the elimination of  the hear ing. This is a major change in the law.  If there were stronger evidence, and  none has been brought forth, that there  were substantial problems with the elec tion pro~ess, then I think we should re form the law. At present the major issue  in an election is designating the appro priate units and resolving election issues.  The actual holding of an election after  the Board has clarified the technical de tails is really no problem. I do not be lieve that eliminating case-by-case deter minations  is possible,  so  I  think  that  we will continue to have some time pe riod needed to sort out issues, many of  which are rais~d by unions, such as which  employees they may represent. The hold ing of an election, once  the issues are  resolved, is of a lesser consequence, and  I  am confident  that  if we direct  the  Board to come up with rules, they will  take these considerations into account.  EQUAL ACCESS CHANGES  The second major change proposed in  the substitute bill  is alteration of  the  so-called equal access  rule. Under  the  modifications set forth, organizers could  come onto company property but they  could  not  address  employees  during  working hours or in working areas. They  would be limited to areas such as cafe terias, parking  lots,  and areas where  workers congregate during changes of  shifts. There could be only two organizers  on the prouerty at any time except that  four could gather in parking lots. Finally,  the change suggests that a  labor orga nization must provide written notice 1  day in advance of a request to address  employees, stating the areas and times  for the talks. There is an important pro vision to exclude from the operation of  the equal access rule, employers of 10 or  less employees.  I must say that supporters of the bill  have come a long way toward limiting the  rule which  they have fought to create.  There is so much change I am surprised  that they still want  to pursue  it. The  parking  lot or cafeteria  rule still has  certain  infirmities to my mind.  First, there is still the problem of set ting up a straw man and asking your  opponent to compromise and move half way. Someone has argued that equal ac cess was needed, and said, ""We'll com promise  if you'll come halfway."" My  problem, Mr. President,  is  that I  still  do not see the need with which I should  compromise. The statement I made ear lier is that we have equal access today.  We have remedial access where physical  problems or law violations make infor mation gathering difficult;  this may be  ordered by the courts. There is still, im plicit in this rule, an assumption that  every employer in the country is deny ing his employees information such that  the Congress should make a rule of open ing up company property to organizing  efforts with a few safeguards. I must re state my question-where was the need  for this provision and where is the real  compromise?  Second, and I am certainly mindful of  Senator JAVITs' point that one should not  fear creating a  remedy because it will  be used,  I can only foresee delay and  endless  court  cases  to  define  exactly  what is a nonworking area and which  employees may  be addressed  in  these  areas. I will not go into specifics, but I  can see that this section will generate  much delay, the same delay that other  portions of the bill seek to remove.  Finally,  I  remain  concerned  about  what ""addresses employees"" means.  Is  this limited to captive audience speeches  or is it more broad so as to include post ers,  informal talks by supervisors, and  a myriad of other communications that  go on between employer and emplovee?  How many court cases will be necessary  and how many different rules will de velop to manage this very difficult area  which has already been handled most ef fectively by  the NLRB under current  practice?  MAKE-WHOLE CHANGES  The third major area of change is in  the make-whole provision. Here several  changes have been made in S. 2467. In  response to the concern that the Bureau  of Labor Statistics figures to be used cov ered units of 5,000 employees, which was  unrelated to the majority of cases, the  substitute proposes to use the Employ ment Cost Index <ECI) of the Depart ment of Labor. This index is based on a  sample of collective bargaining agree ments from units of all sizes and is a  weighted measure. It attempts to meas",1978
277,Senate,95,0.257,1031,13,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I am  introducing to you today a bill entitled  the  ""Uranium Miners' Compensation  Act of 1978.""  The problem of  lung cancer among  uranium miners was first brought to my  attention by  the Navajo Nation, many  of whose members work in the uranium  mines of the Southwest. However, after  some study, it became apparent that all  uranium miners,  regardless of origin,  are seriously endangering their lives by  entering the mines. Despite marked im provements  in mine  conditions  since  1969, many miners are still exposed  to  high and unsafe levels of uranium radi ation, thereby causing many of them to  die from anaplastic carcinoma. Further more, significant numbers of uranium  miners in the States of New Mexico, Wy oming, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and Wash inq-ton who began their mining careers  prior to the 1969 improvements still face  the  threat of  lung  cancer  since  the  latency period for  the disease  is any where  from 10  to 15 years. It is  im portant that this problem be addressed  at  this  time  since  the  number  of  uranium miners will  increase dramati cally as our Nation turns its attention to  the underdeveloped mineral  resources  contained in uranium mines.  The  thrust of  the bill  is  threefold:  First, the measure seeks to upgrade ex isting State workmen's compensation  laws by requiring the Secretary of Labor  to publish a  list of  those States with  inadequate coverage for uranium miners.  Those State plans which do not pay  benefits for total disabilitv or death will  be declared inadeQuate and those plans  providing case benefits which are not  equivalent to the amount of benefits pre scribed by the Federal Coal Mine Health  and Safety Act of 1969  shall also be  deemed inadequate for purposes of this  bill. Mine operators in States with in adequate compensation plans will be re quired  to purchase  insurance so  that  to miners  they may provide benefits  working in their mines.  Second, the measure contains a rebut table presumption that miners afflicted  with lung cancer after 10 or more years  in the mines shall be said to have con tracted the disease as a result of employ ment in the mines. This provision should  serve to hasten the litigation process for  miners and their survivors. After enact ment of this bill, claims of miners who  have violated mine antismoking regula tions may be denied as a result of such  violations.  Third,  the bill authorizes the Secre tary of the Department of Health, Edu cation, and Welfare  to make research  grants to public and private agencies and  organizations and  individuals. Grants  will be directed to those institutions hav ing particular expertise in the problem  of lung cancer in uranium mines. Spe cial consideration will be given to insti tutions on the basis of location and past  research efforts.  Mr. President, I am pleased to intro duce this bill to you today, and look for ward to its prompt and favorable con sideration.   By Mr. DOMENICI:  S. 3200.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT  ON NORTHERN  IRELAND-REAC TION FROM IRELAND  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 13, 1978   ",1978
280,,95,-0.339,1083,13,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, the recently  completed study and report of Amnesty  International documenting serious hu man rights violations in Northern Ire land prisons is beginning to evoke reac tions from the Irish press. The report by  the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organiza tion documents some 78 cases of pris oner mistreatment by the Royal Ulster  Constabulary. In subsequent davs I and  other members of the Ad Hoc Congres sional Committee for Irish Affairs will  introduce these cases into the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD.  One of the first responses came from  the highly  respected Hibernia Weekly  Review published in Dublin. Their theme  goes beyond  the mere findir.e:s of  the  amnesty  report. They  speculate  that  those  in  the RUC  responsible  for  the  abuses are not likelv to be disciolined.  They cite as precedent the fact that fol lowing earlier similar  findings by  the  European Commission on Human Rights  of abuses in the palace barracks, Holy wood, those responsible got off scot-free.  In fact, as Hibernia points out ""Some  of them were actually promoted and to  the best of our knowledge not a single  one of  them was dismissed  from  the  service.""  What they are saying is not only are  these human rights violations being tol erated; in some cases, those responsible  are  actually being  rewarded. This  is  reprehensible and must not be reoeated  in this instance. The Ad Hoc Congres sional Committee on Irish Affairs which  I chair will monitor the future actions  taken against those responsible for the  abuses at Castlereagh.  I now wish to insert the Hihern}a edi torial. It deserve the close a.ttPntion of  my colleae:ues, esoeciallv in lhrht of this  Congress' deep interest in human rights.  [From the Hibernia Weekly Review, June 8,  19781  AMNESTY AND CASTLEREAGH  The findings of the Amnesty International  investigation into allegations of police bru tality at Castlereagh barracks should surprise  no one. And unfortunately they are unlikely  to have much effect on  the procedures by  which confessions are secured at the most  notorious interrogation centre in the North.  So many revelations of the brutal and crim17521  inal  conduct  of  plain-clothes  officers  at  Castlereagh have been  ignored for so  long,  that even the impartial Amnesty Report is  unlikely  to make much difference. Castle reagh is what it is and the interrogators are  what they are because Roy Mason wants it  that way. He wants the statistics to prove  that he is ""winning"", which means convic tions, which means confessions, which means  what even Amnesty has now confirmed from  the investigation of 78 individual cases.  Nor need the police responsible for what  Amnesty describes  as  'frequent maltreat ment' be unduly worried for  their  job se curity. Indeed quite the contrary. They can  be reassured by how well  their colleagues  survived the European Commission on Hu man Rights  finding  on  the  brutality at  Palace Barracks, Hollywood,  in 1971. The  Commission, it will be remembered, found  unanimously that the detained people were  subjected  to  'inhuman treatment' to such  an extent as to be in breach of the Conven tion on Human Rights. But was a single man  of them disciplined much less charged with  his criminal assaults on the detainees? Not  a bit of  it. Some of  them were actually  promoted and to the best of our knowledge  not a single one of them was dismissed from  the service. So the dirty tricks department  at Castlereagh can carry on regardless. No  questions will be asked from above. All they  are interested in the confessions.  It is ironic but not altogether surprising  that the self-same man who turns a blind  eye  to this criminal activity  is so keen to  criminalise the very subjects of this abuse.  It is not enough for Mason to be locking up  about ten times more prisoners per head of  the population than in any other country in  Europe. He  is also determined on the pre tence that all this relates to 'normal' crim inal  activity.  In Mason's  sinister make believe  there  is no poll ttcal struggle: ergo  there can be no political prisoners. And the  most  incredible  aspect of  this  calculated  fraud, is that the man is almost getting away  with it.  There  is however  the  troublesome  little  problem of the 300 men in H Blocks, Long  Kesh. These ""criminals"" are so disorientated  that they refuse to accept Mr. Mason's cate gorization. They are confined to cells meas uring 10' x 6'; they are barefooted and wear  only a blanket; they get no exercise and all  normal prison privileges are denied them. In  fact they endure permanent solitary confine ment under what are intensely cruel condi tions. But  confined,  diseased, muted and  stinking (because of the slops strike) though  they may be, they are still a  living witness  to the lie that Mason would have the world  believe.  The inadmissable reality of course is that  Northern Ireland as presently constituted is  ungovernable except  through repression. It  always has been that way and the methods  have been  remarkably constant. Only  the  agents of repression have changed. It used to  be the wicked Unionists through Stormont.  Now  it's  the British  Secretary  of State  through Westminster.  Amnesty International has a unique repu tation for its concern for prisoners all over  the world. Its team in the North included two  doctors,  two  lawyers and a  researcher, and  its 70-page report resulted from detailed in vestigations over 10 days. Apparently it was  given the full co-operation of theN. I. Office  during  its  investigations. Coming  so  soon  after the death while in detention at Castle reagh of Brian Maguire, the report Gonfirms  the worst  suspicions  following  allegations  from many other sources. But until  those  responsible for torturing suspects or prisoners  are themselves put on trial for their conduct,  there can be little faith in the restoration of  law-whatever  about  order-in Northern  Ireland.e  ",1978

282,House,95,-0.044,1174,13,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, 201 years  ago today our American flag was born  of a Joint Resolution of the Continental  Congress. Today is Flag Day, and for the  last 62 years June 14 has been set aside  as a day when we should honor our flag  and remember what it stands for.  As our Nation has grown over the years  from the Thirteen Original Colonies to  our present 50  States, our  flag  has  changed to reflect the growth and diver sity of our great people. As Henry Ward  Beecher once said of our flag:  It is not a painted rag. It is a whole his tory, it is the Constitution, it is the Govern ment. It is the free people that stand in the  Government and the Constitution.  Therefore, we should remember, especially today, that our flag does not merely  represent a loose collection of 50 States,  but that it stands for  the people who  make up those States and who bind them  together  to form  the United States of  America.  Thus it is fitting that today also marks  the beginning of a 3-week celebration  extending  through  July 4  to  ""Honor  America."" The purpose of  the ""Honor  America"" celebration, a project of  the  American Historical and Cultural Society  which sprung out of  the Bicentennial  celebration, is to promote youth appre ciation and understanding of the rights  granted us by the Constitution and how  fortunate we are to live in a land such  as ours.  On  the  first  Flag Day,  President  Woodrow Wilson said of the flag:  Though  silent,  it speaks  to us-of  the  men and women who went before us and of  the records they wrote upon it.  During the following 3-week celebra tion, we are not just paying tribute to  those who have made America what it is,  but we are calling attention to the Amer ica of the future.    ",1978

It is most  appropriate  that we  recognize  these  achievements during NASA's 20th anni versary year.  In  the past  two decades, NASA has  served as a leader of the most rapid tech nological  advance  the world has ever  known. Little we as a nation have done  recently has evoked as much admiration  as our achievements in space. The NASA  team and astronauts have taken man to  the Moon and back, demonstrated the  use of space for the benefit of mankind  and for the expansion of human knowl edge and begun a systematic exploration  of the solar system. Space offers a large   potential for contributing to the solution  of many problems here on Earth.  Mr. Speaker, it has been gratifying to  have been a part of the space program  through  the Science  and Technology  Committee. I would add that there has  been no greater advocate for the space  program than Chairman ""TIGER"" TEAGUE.  He has played a leading role in helping  to guide  the space program over  the  years.  Again, I want to join my colleagues in  recognizing the accomplishments of the  NASA team and astronauts.

I  recognize  that every  area of  the  country is not the same. Probably there  are som~ areas of the country where staff  legal  servi:::es  are needed more  than  others. But in my district and others like  mine, where the lawyers have said they  will  cooperate,  and where practically  every lawyer has indicated that he would  be willing to participate, they should be  given the opportunity to provide for the  legal services to their friends and their  neighbors under the legal services pro gram. There is no question that the legal  needs of the poor would be better served.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair  recog nizes  the gentleman from Texas <Mr.  PICKLE).  ",1978
287,House,95,-0.218,1200,13,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Chairman,  those  officials  in my district  interested with  the administration of the legal services  program have written me and called me,  encouraging  the support of  the  legal  services program. I would like to quote  to you a part of one communication, as  follows:  I have been following with growing con cern the attempts by Attorney General Grif fin Bell  to reduce  the proposed budget to  be allocated the Law Enforcement Assistance  Administration for state and regional crimi nal justice planning activities for the com ing fiscal year. It is my belief that without  the assistance currently being provided the  counties in the Capital State Planning Re gion,  funding  for  local projects would be  severely  reduced. The primary strength of  this program remains  that the determina tion of how this money is to be spent is made  at the local level. Now,  through a proposed  incentive plan to fund only those local gov ernment projects that have been approved  by  the Administration,  local determination  may  give way  to  decision-making  from  Washington.  Since the responsiblUty for criminal justice  planning efforts was first designated to the  Capital Area Planning CouncU  in 1971,  a  total of 48 projects have been initiated by  the Councll of Government with significant  multi-county  impact. Some of  these pro grams include the Regional Pollee Academy;  numerous law enforcement communications  equipment grants;  residential programs for  adolescents and adults; and, most recently  a multi-county jaU study to determine the  most cost effective means for participating  counties  to comply with state and federal  guidelines  for  the  construction  of  jail  fac1llties.  I believe in the worth of this program,  and I believe in the testimony of my city  councilwoman, Mrs. Betty Himmelblau.  I  therefore hope  this House will not  make unnecessary cuts that cripple the  program. That would be a cruelty against  poor people who need this service.  The CHAIRMAN.

290,House,95,0.225,1226,13,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I  really had not in tended to get into this, but I  think we  have left some impressions that we need  to correct, even at this hour of the night.  Mr.  The gentlewoman  from New  Jersey  <Mrs.  FENWICK)  was absolutely  right.  People who read this debate are going  to get the idea that the House of Repre sentatives has something to hide. It doe&  not have anything to hide. I think it is  very important that we make that abun dantly clear to the American people.  I do think that the main reason I am  going to be against this amendment and  take the position offered by the gentle man from Illinois <Mr. ANDERSON)  is per haps a reason different from that which  has been stated. It seems to me that we  have enough to disagree on between the  minority and the majority, and if the  majority is in control, as it will be, of the  employees who decide where the cameras  are going to point and what is going to  be the content of any television program,  then the minority just by the very nature  of this situation is not going to be very  happy with a  lot of the decisions that  are made.  I am not saying that I do not trust  the Speaker; I do. He is my friend. He  has never done anything to me that has  not been perfectly honorable. I am not  sure  that  this will always be  true of  whatever  employees  he may  hire.  I  would much rather put my faith in the  content of  television programs which  come from this House in the networks,  because I  think they may be unfair to  all of us. but in an absolutely fair way.  Nevertheless, it will remove one bone of  contention which exists between the ma jority and the minority, and I happen to  think that there are too many bones of  contention already.  It is my hope, that this amendment  will be voted down and we will then pro ceed to do whatever is necessary to get  this Chamber televised as rapidly as pos sible. I think the Amerioan people ought  to know what goes on in this Chamber,  and I  think they will mainly be proud  when they find out. I do not think we  have a thing to be ashamed of. This is a  great body. We do not always agree and I do not suppose we ever will-but,  nevertheless, we  usually disagree  like  Americans, and I think that is the way  we shall portray ourselves to the Amer ican people. So I hope that the amend ment will be voted down.  ",1978

304,,95,0.372,1265,13,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, as the on going Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  (SALT)  in Geneva wear on, it is becom ing  increasingly clear  that significant  elements of the proposed SALT II agree ment cannot be verified. This  includes  range limits on cruise missiles, lim1ts on  the upgrading of ICBM's, the strategic  potential of the Backfire Bomber, the de ployment of mobile ICBM's as well as  the conversion of medium mobile mis siles to mobile ICBM's.  Against  such  a  backdrop, with  the  U.S.S.R.'s alarming advances in both its  offensive  and  defensive  capabilities  causing  growing U.S.  public  concern  about Soviet intentions and trustworthi ness, verification has emerged as a cru cial factor in SALT. Consequently, Con gress now realizes that--with so much at  stake in these negotiations-it must stay  abreast of what is transpiring in Geneva.  With that in mind, my colleague from  Illinois  (Mr. DERWINSKI)  authored an  amendment to last year's Arms Contro!  and Disarmament Act requiring the exec utive branch to report to Congress on a  timely basis as to the verifiability of any  arms control proposals made to or ac cepted by the United States.  While the ramifications of the Derwin ski amendment have been the subject of  considerable  discussion,  both  in Con gress and the executive branch, little has  been written about how it may figure in  the debate between Congress and the ad ministration over the contents of the new  SALT agreement. In recognition of that  fact, Dr. Carnes Lord, assistant profes sor of government and foreign affairs and  a foreign affairs officer in the Arms Con trol and Disarmament Agency's Verifica tion and Analysis Bureau from 1975  to  1977, definitively analyzed the implica tions of the Derwinski amendment in an  article he wrote on verification and the  future of arms control which appeared in  the spring issue of Strategic Review.  I  commend it to our colleagues' attention,  Mr. Speaker, and request that the perti nent excerpts be printed at this point in  the RECORD.  VERIFICATION AND THE FUTURE OF  ARMS CONTROL  (By Carnes Lord)  IN BRIEF  Verification has become an ever more prom inent  factor  in SALT,  refiecting  in  large  part a growing mood of uneasiness and skep ticism  in  the United States about Soviet  intentions and trustworthiness. The techni cal process of verification  is not nearly as  controversial as  the political  judgment of  how extensive verification  should be-i.e.,  how much assurance regarding com!)liance is  necessuy. Given the complexity of the new  limitations being discussed in SALT II, the  incidence of compliance  issues  is  likely to  rise. Critical to the verification process is the  willingness to respond vigorously to assessed  violations. A coherent and effective U.S. veri fication policy must be based on the recognition  that domestic support for SALT can  no longer be sustained by official efforts to  apologize for, or interpret away, threatening  aspects of Soviet behavior.  Verification-the  process  of monitoring  and assessing compliance with arms control  agreements-has been an important factor in  the arms control policy of the United States  an:i  in  the history of arms control efforts  since World War II. Only in the last several  years,  however, has verification become a  truly controversial issue in American politics.  The protracted dis!)ute over alleged Soviet  violations of  the strategic arms  limitation  (SALT) agreements of 1972, which became a  central element of the debate over the mean ing and value of detente with  the Soviet  Union, is the most important, if by no means  only, example of the new prominence of the  verification  issue. What has not been gen erally recognized is that the sudden notoriety  achieved by the verification problem has in  some degree altered the terms of the problem  itself. If SALT has become the touchstone  of U.S.-Soviet detente, verification may be  becoming the touchstone of SALT. Whether  a SALT II agreement can bear up under the  political weight of detente is a question that  will depend in no ~mall measure on the re sponsiveness of SALT verification to essen tially political requirements.  This is not to suggest that verification is  only  now becoming  a  ""political matter.""  Verification has  always  served a  political  function and involved oolitical decisions. Yet  the particular complexity and abstruseness  of the verification process, together with the  relatively modest demands  that were  for  many years placed on it, tended to conceal  this fact from public  (and  indeed official)  view. Verification was generally left to the  care of technical specialists.  Largely because it was for so long regarded  as primarily a  technical matter, verification  tended to be neglected  in policy thinking  about arms control and national security.  It is not surprising that  those  responsible  for  the management of the United States'  national  security  apparatus were  ill-pre pared for the emergence of verification as a  source of impassioned political controversy.  What may have been tolerable inadequacies  in policy or critical thinking on verification  at a  time when arms control was at best a  marginal element of  the national security  policy of the United States were revealed as  serious vulnerabilities after control of stra tegic armaments had become the centerpiece  of that policy.  Nor should recognition of the frankly po litical side of verification be construed as an  endorsement of the corruption of technical  judgments on verification by the perceived  requirements of policy-corruption of a sort  that is sometimes alleged to have occurred  within the U.S. government during the hey day of detente. On the contrary, delineating  as clearly and publicly as possible the exact  role that politics should play in the verifica tion process may well be  the best way  to  avoid such corruption. Decisions concerning  verification that are based on fundamentally  political considerations ought to be identified  and defended as such. Failure to recognize  the political element in such decisions-or  deliberate  attempts  to  disguise  that ele ment-tend to destroy  the very possibility  of independent technical analysis of verifi cation questions.  The emergence of verification as a promi nent issue on the Ameri~a'l oo1itl,.al R-:~ne  may have been signaled by a  little-noticed  action of the United States Congress. In May  1977, the House, and subsequently the Sen ate, voted to amend the Arms Control and  Disarmament Act, as extended to fiscal year  1978, so as to require the Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency  (ACDA)  to file state ments with Congress on a number of matters  pertaining to verification, and, in particular,  ",1978
305,,95,-0.237,3,18,Mr. MORGAN.," Mr. President, I have a  real complaint to lay before the Senate.  I want to express my concern and my  outrage over  the handling of applica tions for nuclear_ powerplant  licensing  by the Government.  Recently, Chairman Joseph Hendrie  of  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  testified before the House Subcommittee  on Energy and Power that proposals for  accelerating  the  time  for granting  censes were unacceptable to him. While  I am not challenging his reasoning in  this instance. for I do not know the sub stance of the proposed changes in licens ing procedures, I, am concerned that this  is an attitude which may be prevalent  in  the nuclear  regulatory machinery;  that is, go slow, go slow, go slow.  Well, Mr. President, I  think that we  should  be  deliberate  in  granting  censes for nuclear power facilities and I  recognize the great power controlled by  the electric utilities  in  their nuclear  plants. I believe  that the industry has  attempted to comply with the Govern ment's efforts to protect the public wel fare. The nuclear industry has as many  regulations and requirements and rules  as any sector of our society, yet, the in dustry has seen fit to move ahead and  comply with Government controls. The  Government now does everything from  licensing processors of nuclear fuels  to  setting standards for the guards at nu clear powerplants.  Mr. President, I am no special advo cate of nuclear power nor have I sought  to single out nuclear power for special  treatment.

That tragic pic ture is portrayed with dramatic, indeed  frightening, clarity  in an article from  U.S. News & World Report  reprinted  in the Akron Beacon Journal for July 30,  1978.  The article points out that hundreds  of millions of people in Latin America,  Africa, and Asia lead lives that at best  are marginal, on the ragged edge of star vation. The article states that, worse yet,  the poor are losing ground: 1.4 billion  people received less than their minimum  daily requirements for food in 1975-300  million more than in 1965.  The article notes  in  the developing  nations, the job situation is so bad as  to stimulate illegal immigration to de veloped countries, thereby worsening un employment and social conditions in the  developed  countries. Already millions  have crossed into the United States from  Mexico and  the Caribbean, and  thou sands more are infiltrating daily.  On the other hand, the United States  already sells more products to the Third  World than to European customers, and  there is a huge potential market waiting  to be tapped.  In  short,  both  on  humanitarian  grounds and from the standpoint of self interest, we should do all we can to help  these developing  countries  raise  their  standard of living.  Mr. Speaker,  the  text of the article  follows these remarks:  [From the Akron Beacon Journal, July 30,  1978]  POOR VERSUS RICH-A WORLD STRUGGLE FOR  SuRVIVAL  (By Donald c. Bacon)  The poor and the hungry, their numbers  rapidly multiplying are casting a long shadow  across the rich nations of th'e world.  Economic and political stability worldwide  is being  threatened as  the global popula tion climbs, poverty spreads, people flee !rom  poorer to wealthier lands, and demand drives  up prices o! food and scarce raw materials.  Strident voices in the more than 100 less developed nations that make up the so-called  Third World-a term used  to differentiate  emerging countries from the main Western  and Communist blocks-are demanding  a  greater share of the planet's limited riches.  With 70 percent o! the world's population,  they want more than their current 11 percent  of 1 ts total productive income.  ""The  transfer of wealth from the rich  to  the poor is a matter o! right, not charity,""  declares President Julius K. Nyerere of Tan zania, echoing a theme o! many Third World  leaders.  For leaders of industrial nations such as  the United States, statements like that carry  the unspoken  threat of  less-developed na tions  banding  together  to  force  economic  conces,ions  from  advanced countries. The  alternative: uprisings that could spread into  a  global  struggle pitting  the world's poor  against the rich.  William E. Colby, former director o!  the  Central  Intelligence Agency, warns:  ""The  greatest danger of violence and difficulty in  the world  is between  the haves and have nots-them against us.""  What  follows  is a  searching  look at  the  needs, accomplishments, failures and future  o! the hundreds o! millions who inhabit the  Third World.  The most  important !actor  in  the con frontation of poor vs. rich  is  the awesome  implication o!  the world population  trend.  About one person in every three lives  in an  advanced nation. At century's end, it is likely  to be one in five. The latest projection is that  peo,le in developed countries eventually will  be  outnumbered  10  to  one  by  those  in  emerging nations.  ""There  is  a  real question whether such  a shrinking minority will be able to control  the economic, financial and political destiny  o! the world-and what means it may have  to employ to do that,"" comments the World  Bank's Mahbub ul Haq,  an authority on  Third World problems.  In  less  than 50 years,  thanks in part to  the rise in health standards, global popula tion has doubled  to 4 b1llion people. The  World Bank estimates  that the  figure will  climb to 6.3 biWon bv tl'e end o! the cen tury, will  reach  8  billion  by  2020  and  will  continue  rising until  it  stabilizes at  perhaps 11 billion a few decades later.

312,,95,-0.269,211,18,Mr. 'HEFTEL.," Mr. Speaker, under the  leave  to  ext.end my  remarks  in  the  RECORD, I include the following: Only a  few of our number have been  in  the  House long enough to remember Charlie  Fletcher, a former Member of Congress  who represented a California district im mediat.ely after World War II.  I am proud to note that Charlie has  been a resident of Honolulu for a num ber of years and has made a profound  and lasting impress.ion upon Hawaii as  one of the most capable and successful  businessmen in our State.  A recent article in the Honolulu Ad vertiser recounted Charlie's r.emarkable  career, and I am pleased to bring that  profile to the attention of mY colleagues.  CHARLIE FLETCHER UNDERSTANDS  (By Ron Ronck)  It  is  only  a  few  steps  from  Charlie  Fletcher's desk to a small telescope that he  uses to watch the planes taking off at Hono lulu International Airport.  ""Take a  look,"" he says as he waves a hand  across  the horizon. ""Isn't this a  fantastic  view?""  Indeed it is.  Charlie's view originates on the 19th floor  of Pioneer Plaza,  downtown at 900 Fort  Street Mall. It couldn't be much better.  Opened last December on his 75th birth day, the 22-story building is a monument to  the  leadership he has shown as Chairman  of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of  Pioneer Federal Savings and Loan.  The name of Fletcher  is well-known  San Diego.  Charlie's father, Colonel Ed Fletcher, was  an early land developer in California and his  mother, Mary, was prominent in local society.  in  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  from Massa They moved  to San Diego  chusetts in the late 1880s.  Charles K. Fletcher is one of 10 children,  each of whom became directors of the Ed  Fletcher Company and continue the family's  interest in real estate.  He attended San Diego public schools and  was graduated from Stanford University in  1924 with a degree in political science.  ""After Stanford,"" Charlie  explained,  ""I  spent a  year at Oxford and another year  traveling  around Europe  and  the Middle  East.  ""On my way home I came  through Asia  and stopped  in Honolulu. The first  time I  saw the islands I knew this is where I even tually wanted to live.""  In 1926, Charlie married Jeannette Tober man, daughter of another California  land  developer. They spent  their honeymoon in  Tahiti, stopping again at Honolulu on their  return.  ""For some reason, though, we decided not  to stay in Hawaii but to live in Los Angeles.  ""I worked  four years selling stocks and  bonds and another  four years at what  is  now the Security Pacific Bank. This is when  I  got  interested  in  the  savings and  loan  business.""    On one of his vacations, Charlie drove  down  to San Diego and started the Home  Federal Savings and Loan Association with  $9,500. That was  in 1934. Today this same  business is worth over $3 billion.  ""When  the war came along I went into  the Navy. I'd missed World War I so I was  ready. I  felt that I ought to do something.  ""So at the age of 40 I was assigned to the  staff of  the Chief of Naval Operations  in  Washington, D.C.""  It was in the nation's capital that Charlie's  interest in politics was reawakened and he  ran twice for Congress as a Republican.  On his second try, in 1946, he was elected,  defeating an incumbent Democrat who had  held oftlce  for 20 years.  Because President Truman called a  spe cial session of Congress during election sea son. Charlie decided not to fly back to Cali fornia to campaign.  He feared that the voters would backlash  him for leaving Washington while important  legislation was being discussed.  ""For whatever reasons, I was defeated and  the Democrats got back it. We could win a  seat but not hold  it.  ""Actually, my election defeat was the best  thing that ever happened to me.  ""If I hadn't lost I would never have gone  back to my Home Federal Savings and Loan  Association. My son, Kim, is no\v running the  business which is the third largest of its kind  in the country.""  In 1960, Charlie was enjoying a conven tion in Honolulu when he was approached  during a break by George Hamilton, head  of Pioneer Federal Savings and Loan. He  was 58 at the time and Hamilton was in his  seventies.  ""When he learned my name was Fletcher,  he asked if I was from San Diego. I said I  was and told him who my parents were. By  coincidence he knew them very well.  ""Later he took me downtown  to see  the  Pioneer office which was then on the corner  of Merchant and Fort.  ""It was a dinky hole-in-the-wall and I'd  never seen anything so archaic in my life. It  looked as if they were literally pushing things  under the rug.  ""He told me that Pioneer was the oldest  savings and loan in the state, having been  chartered by King Kalakaua in 1890. I asked  if he was the oldest how come he was also the  smallest.  ""He told me he wasn't sure since he hlid  just taken over the chairmanship six months  before. The board of directors had brought  him out from California because he was a  professional fund raiser.""  23771  The following day, Hamilton approached  Charlie again and asked if he'd be interested  in running Pioneer Federal Savings and Loan  in Honolulu as well as his Home Federal in  San Diego.  ""I refused at first but Hamilton insisted.  He said that he was going around the world  on a four-month honeymoon and that he'd  offer me an interesting opportunity.  ""I'd take over his job for the first month,  my San Diego  president  for  the  second  month, my son for the third month and I'd  come back again for the fourth month.""  Pioneer gave Charlie complete control of  the company and a hefty advertising budget.  With Hamilton winging around the world  with his bride, Charles K. Fletcher went to  work.  By the end of the four month period, he  had doubled  the association's worth. Pio neer's $4 million business was up to $8 mil lion.

313,,95,0.1,224,18,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, this week's  edition of U.S. News & World Report  carries on its ""Editor's Page"" an article  by Marvin Stone on Maine's exceptional  Governor, James B. Longley.  Governor Longley is the Nation's only  Independent Governor, and  independ ence has been the distinctive feature of  his tenure in Augusta. In his one term in  office <he has declined  to run for  re election, keeping a  campaign promise  made  in 1974), Governor Longley has  instituted a policy of careful fiscal man agement and limited spending. This has  not always won him supnort, but his  steadfast dedication  to his principles  has earned him the respect of a great  majority of Majne citizens.  In his article, Marvin Stone wisely  lets Governor Longley speak for himself  on everything from politicians to limits  on taxes. I urge my colleagues to read  the article, which follows, and to seri ously consider the Governor's message:  YANKEE WHO TAMES BUREAUCRATS  (By Marvin Stone)  It is worth anyone's time  to visit with  James Longley, Maine's Governor  for  the  past 37'2 years. For Jim Longley is one of a  vanishing species-he brings a businessman's  hardheaded, Yankee realism to government.  Longley was a wealthy  insurance execu tive when he was coaxed into running as an  independent, pledging to serve one term. This  promise he is keeping, much to the regret,  it is said, of a majority of Maine's voters.  When he took office, the state had suffered  the  largest deficit  in  its history and an  even larger one threatened, unless Longley  raised  taxes by up  to 100 million dollars.  The  state was  run by  entrenched,  free spending bureaucrats. ""One of the things I  found  in government,"" he says, ""is that if  there's a  door open  for spending,  it'll be  spent.""  He set about applying what he calls his  bottom-line test: Who is the beneficiary of  this spending? ""And very frequently I found  that the special interests and the bureaucracy  were the beneficiaries. not the people.""  Longley tightened the screws. He brought  in top administrators, both Democrats and  Republicans. The state's payroll was pruned  by almost 2,000 people, or 16 percent. Wel fare rules were tightened, cheaters set adrift.  Millions were saved on needless  travel by  officials,  duplication  in  the  departments  eliminated.  Much of  this came only after prolonged  head knocking with a  recalcitrant Legisla ture. The result? Maine ended this fiscal year  with  a  surplus of 41 million dollars.  In  March, 20 mUlion was returned to taxpay ers. The governor has called a.  special ses",1978

315,Senate,95,-0.55,341,18,Mr. CLARK.," Mr. President, a  few  weeks ago the senior Senator from South  Dakota, Mr. McGovERN, offered what I  think is an eminently reasonable judg ment in regard to the recent appearance  of crises-particularly concerning Af rica-in our foreign relations.  In  just a  few hundred words pub lished in the New York Times, Senator  McGovERN demonstrated that in terms  of alliances and genuine influence, the  United States occupies a strong position  in the world, whereas the Soviet Union  is  comparatively  isolated  and  belea guered. On this basis, he urges that we  reject false alarms and restore a meas ure of confidence to our view of inter national issues.  Because I  think it may be of inter est to others, I ask that the article I  have described from the June 26  issue  of the New York Times be printed in  the RECORD.  The article follows:  A CooL FOREIGN POLICY  (By GEORGE McGOVE:tN)  WASHINGTON.-In recent days there have  been implications-sometimes attributed to  President Carter, sometimes to national se curity adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski,  some times to the Committee on the Present Dan ger or other exalted sources-suggesting that  the United States is standing by helplessly  while  the Soviet Union, with  the help of  Cuba,  is  taking over first Africa and then  the world.  It is even suggested by some that Soviet Cuban involvement in Africa is of such omi nous consequences that it might preclude  further progress on a strategic arms control  agreement with the Soviet Union.  I  regard most of  this  talk  as  a  false  alarm-tJhe  result of hyperactive  imagina tions playing upon ""worst-case"" scenarios.  Secretary of State Cyrus R.

Mr. Chairman, since fiscal 1976,  the  United States has maintained a  finely  balanced program in the Middle East. An  integral part of this program has been a  modest economic assistance program of  $90 million for Syria.  In return, the Syrians have consistent ly pressed  for broader United States Syrian relations. The Syrians have been  playing a helpful  role with  regard  to  events  in South Lebanon. First,  they  made clear they would not be drawn into  fighting with the Israelis. This was done  in the teeth of shrill criticism from tne  Arab rejectionist states that the Syrians  were selling out  to  the Palestianians.  Then in the negotiations leading up to  adoption of Security Council Resolution  425, the Syrians agreed not to press for  language condemning Israel.  Subsequently, the Syrians-at the Leb..;  anese  request-took  steps  to  prevent  further reinforcements of the Palestin ians by the Iraqis, again despite sharp  criticism throughout the Arab world that  the Syrians were undermining the Pales tinians. The Syrians have also pressed  the Palestinians to cooperate with the  U.N. forces in Lebanon.  Syria has been quietly helpful in re solving the problems of Syrian Jewish  emigration.  ",1978
324,,95,0.739,471,18,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, as a service  to my colleagues, I am inserting a very  interesting article  from  the American  Metric Journal, volume VI, unit 4, 1978.  Since our recent debates regarding fund ing for metric programs, a number of  the Members have  indicated  they are  starting to get calls and letters regard ing the metric programs in the United  States.  Therefore, I call attention to this ex tension and urge my colleagues  to use  this in reply to their constituents. This  is very  important as  the first mailing  piece because we all can learn by experi ence. In fact, much was made in recent  debates as to how well other nations were  adjusting to metric conversion.  At  this point,  I  include  the article,  ""Metric Conversion Takes a Pounding"":  METRIC CONVERSION TAKES A  POUNDING  Metric has been legal  to use in England  since 1864. It became a  legal alternative in  America in 1866. It has never succeeded in  either place, the public would not accept a  substitute system for one they already knew  and trusted.  Many attempts over the years have been  made by small groups to persuade or com pel people to use metric. Various schemes at tracted fragmented support but were not ac cepted by the public or industry. The inch/  pound system has always emerged as the pre dominate language of measurement in counEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tries given a choice. Most countries adopting  metric have done so by force.  A different story ha.s developed over  the  past 13 years in England. A form of economic  force has been exerted on the British by a  group of European nations who have come  to dominate European trade in the past two  decades by forming a trade block. This group,  known as the European Economic Commu nity (EEC), was formed to control commerce  in Europe after World Wa.r  II. There were  language and  trade barriers  to  retard  the  free buying and selling between the small  countries on the continent. They each used  nationalized forms of the old incomplete and  obsolete MKS  (traditional) metric system.  Those free nations belonging to the inter national Standards Organization (ISO) who  wanted  to  join the EEC agreed  to use the  modernized SI metric which was more com plete and would be represented by the same  terms and symbols in all EEC countries. Af ter many years, the old nationalized metric is  still used by every one of these EEC coun tries. There is no uniformity in the labeling  or measurement units employed. A product  from Italy can be marked with one unit and  the same  item manufactured  ir: France or  Germany will be labeled with a different sym bol or unit. The schools of each nation teach  ne, tionalized metric.  Yet, great pressure has been brought  to  bear upon  the British to use metric if they  wish to participate in the EEC and share in  the vast Eu Ro-market. Had they elected not  to join extreme hardship and economic chaos  would result. The country has depended on  exports for survival for years. At one time  export accounted for over 80% of the gross  national product. In recent years manufact urers have lost much of the market and the  cccnomy has suffered.  The Confederation of British Industry and  the Board of Trade decided  to  take  the  plunge and join the EEC in 1964. This was  done as a secret act as far as the public was  concerned. No publicity, news articles or fan fare to condition or s:;licit support from the  English citizens. It was felt  the move was  mandatory and necessary for survival. Why  delay and give the public an opportunity to  stall the inevitable? This has p-roven to be a  major mistake which has and will cost the  nation millicns of dollars and much confu sion as well as distrust of government offi cials. The public knew a.lmost nothing about  the metric commitment for over five years!  A campaign was launched to persuade the  Americans, Canadians, Australians and other  English  speaking nations  to change along  with the British. These countries were told  they had become an inch/pound island in a  sea of metric. The remaining nations would  be left behind in world trade, that over 90%  of the earths population were using metric.  This propaganda program was accepted by  the U.S. Department of Commerce who had  tried for decades to sell metric to Americans.  It had a tendency to ring ""official"", many got  the idea the USA was on the way. The Cana dians jumped in right after the Australians  and guessed  the U.S. was well en the way.  Many misleading  stories were  circulated.  Conferences and meetings made metric ex perts over night. The public was led to believe  the whole world had almost left them behind  but were  just barely saved  in the nick o!  time by the sudc!en proposed switch to met ric. That is another story which is being cov ered at another time in AMJ.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch in London,  the House of Parliament was ""in between a  rock and a hard place."" They wanted to re tain busines3 connections with the U.S., be  able to placate the British public and remain  in the EEC by switching the country over to  metric. Their very best bet was to go to the  London newspapers some fine English morn24031  ing and announce ""the Americans have gone  over to the metrics and left us behind! we  can't have that now can we,  let's get busy  and beat them at their own game and change  to SI."" It just did not happen for them. So,  in 1977 after 12 years of trying to induce the  Americans to assist them by converting they  elected to force metric on the subjects. Prime  Minister James Callagan inherited the nasty  job of pushing over  the change from Sir  Harold Wilson who originally slipped the SI  over on the country. A recent article in the  Times carried a quote from a letter sent to  Callagan by Wilson declaring his opposition  to metric weights and measures in the shops  and stores. This should serve as an indication  of the style and methods employed by the  Wilson government.  James Callagan appointed Mr. John Fraser  minister in charge of forced conversion. The  cut-off dates established by Parliament in  1977 would now  carry  some  enforcement  power. Those in violation would be slapped  with a 50 pound  fine. It was in tended  to  cover certain commodities  an<1  then after a short period be extended to more  until all  trade goods would be covered by  law. This seemed to be the straw that broke  the camel's back. Thousands of  letters o!  protest were received by members of Parlia ment. Clubs, organizations, and associations  of all kinds rose up in indignation. The ed ($100.00)  itor of the American Metric Journal attended  some of these meetings in London and else where in Britain. Mr. Hopkins  interviewed  Lord Munson and spoke with others in gov ernment about  the problem. At  the  time  of  the visit John Fraser announced ""it is  clearly impossible to proceed against a back ground of hostility.""  He also commented at the same time, ""re sistance to metrication orders has led us to  review whether we can still claim universal  support."" Consumer groups had organized a  resistance program. They had the support of  a number of MP's including Mrs. Sally Op penheim who  is  the Shadow Minister  for  Prices. She was quoted as saying ""I say every one should be allowed to choose if they want  to buy or sell  in metric. Don't make  it a  punishable offense if they do not."" She added  ""it is monstrous that people should be sent  to prison for using yards, inches, and feet. It  is eroding yet more of our freedom.""  Retailers who agreed to go along with met ric were promised their competition would be  compelled to comply. It didn't happen at all.  These few lost large volumes of business to  those still selling in the familiar customary.  Manufacturers of goods sold to British with out  the customary  inch/pound  labels also  ~uffered a loss of business.  Officials in cou:1ty government and lower  positions seemed to support public feelings.  (See article ""Counselor Sends Back Metric  Gobblegook""). Several claims were made by  educators that metric was no short cut to  math,  it was a hinderance. Some students  entering certain trades had to go back and  learn imperial to get jobs. In industrial test ing  for math  ability, British Leyland  re ported  scores  running  considerably  below  those previous scores from  tests done with  the imperial system taught in schools.  (See  article ""Why Metres Don't Add Up"") .  It is now generally conceded by most, that  metric is unwanted in England. It has cost  the taxpayers a fortune so far and after 13  years has failed to help the British economy  measurably. It is agreed that manufacturers  have little choice in the matter. If they wish  to continue in the EEC  they will not only  have  to use metric but promise  to  try to  compel  the  entire  country  to  change  to  satisfy the headquarters group in Brussels.  A recent trip by R. A. Hopkins to finalize a  one year study of methods and results of the  use of metric in the EEC countries, indicated  very  little has been accomplished by  this  ",1978

It is estimated that arson is re sponsible for over 1,000 deaths and 10,000  injuries annually. At this rate if left un checked, arson deaths and injuries will  surpass  those attributable to all other  serious crimes in 4 years.  The documentary will examine: The  victims of arson;  the building owners  who sell deteriorating buildings back and  forth in order to inflate their value and  collect high  insurance payments after  the fire; as well as the insurance com panies who fail to adequately investigate  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  a suspicious fire,  thereby providing the  ""fuel that keeps the arson fires burning.""

BRECKINRIDGE  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, August 2, 1978  e ",1978
326,,95,-0.223,484,18,Mr. BRECKINRIDGE.," Mr. Speaker,  on August 2, 1977, 1 year ago  today, I  introduced H.R. 8686, the Congressional  Legal Counsel Act of 1977, similar to title  II of S. 555, passed by the Senate, 74 to 5,  on June 27, 1977. My remarks upon in troduction can be found on page 26239  of  the August 2,  1977, CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I wish to reem phasize the need for creation of this of fice and to add an amendment to its pro visions. Over the years I have consist ently supported the concept of congres sional review of Federal rulemaking pro posals. On March 3, 1976, I cosponsored  H.R. 7979, the Administrative Rule Mak ing Reform Act of 1976,  introduced by  Congressman LEVITAS, which would give  Congress the authority to review regula tions adopted by Federal agencies and  permit either House to disapprove those  which are unnecessary or clearly outside  the intent of Congress.  On June 16, 1977, I offered a substitute  amendment within the House Agricul tural Committee consideration of food  stamp legislation which would have per mitted the General Accounting Office to  inform the Congress, through its com mittees, of any illegal, ambiguous, or im pro'l':'er Federal regulation in order to en able the committee and the Congress to  deal directly with the proposed rule.  All of these prior efforts, Mr. Speaker,  have been aimed at legislative control of  the rulemaking activities of the Federal  agencies which annually adopt over 6,000  regulations with the force and effect of  law, and  to protect the private citizen  and small businessman from administra tive excesses and abuses.  My amendment  to H.R. 8686 would  simply permit the Counsel in the Con gressional Legal Counsel Office to review  any rule or regulation by  the Federal  Government with the intent to report to  the Congress whether the rule is illegal,  ultra vires, an unauthorized use of funds,  a failure to expend funds as mandated,  or in any other way does not comply with  the intent of the Congress. Court and/or  legislative challenges could be brought  by the Counsel for and in behalf of the  Congress where appropriate.  A  final provision of  the amendment  provides that failure to act by the Con gress on a rule or regulation is not con sidered an expression of approval or dis approval. The wording of my amendment  appears below:  August 2, 1978  (SECTION 9 (C) OF CONGRESSIONAL LEGAL  COUNSEL ACT OF 1977)  (c) (1) Upon the direction of either House  of the Congress, or of any committee, sub committee, or Member of the Congress, the  Counsel shall review any rule or regulation  published for comment or promulgation by  any department or agency of  the Federal  Government to determine whether such rule  or regulation will carry out the policy es tablished by the Congress in an effective and  timely manner, and to determine whether  such department or agency has  failed  to  promulgate such rules and regulations as  may be necessary for the effective and time ly  implementation of policies  established  by the Congress.  ( 2) The Counsel shall, from time to time,  conduct  reviews of  rules  and  regulations  published for comment or promulgation by  any department or agency of  the Federal  Government to determine whether such rule  or regulation will carry out the policy es tablished by the Congress in an effective and  timely manner, and to determine whether  such department or agency has  failed  to  promulgate such  rules and  regulations as  may be necessary for the effective and timely  implementation of policies established by  the Congress.  (3) The Counsel shall report the results  of any review conducted under paragraph  ( 1) or paragraph ( 2)  to the Congress, to the  House of the Congress, and to the commit tee,  subcommittee,  or Member  involved.  Any such report shall include a determina tion of the Counsel with respect to whether  the department or agency of  the Federa..l  Government  involved(A) has taken, or proposes to take, action  which  (i)  is contrary  to, or  inconsistent with.  any provision of law;  (11)  is beyond the scope of the aUJthority  of such department or agency;  (111)  involves any unauthorized use of ap propriated funds;  (iv)  involves  any  failure or  refusal  to  expend or ~obligate appropriated  funds,  lf  such failure or refusal ls inconsistent with  any policy established by the Congress; or  (v)  does not comply with policies estab lished by tPe Congress or with the intent of  Congress relating to any such policy; or  (B) has failed to take a particular action,  1f such failure has the effect of frustrating  congressional intent.  (4) When directed to do so pursuant to  section 4(e), the Counsel shall bring a civil  action in any appropriate court of the United  States to challenJZe the validity of any rule  or regulation promulgated, or proposed  to  be  promulgated,  by  any  department  or  agency of the Federal Government on the  basis of any grounds spec14'1ed in subpara graph  (A) and suhoaragraph  (B) of para graph f3), or to challenge the failure of any  such department or agency  to promulgate  such rules and regulations as may be neces sary for the effective and timely implementa tion of nolicies established by the Congress.  (5) The  failure of either House of  the  Congress, or any committee, subcommittee,  or Member of Congress, to direct any action  by  the Counsel under paragraph  ( 1), or  the failure  to adopt any resolution under  section 4 (e) , shall not be considered to be  an expression of approval of any  rule or  regulation promulgated or proposed  to be  promulgated, or of the failure  to promul gate, by any department or agency of the  Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, the American Law Divi sion of the Library of Congress informs  me that the Court of Claims in a 4-to-3  ooinion in Atkins v. United States, Ct.

330,Senate,95,0.49,640,18,Mr. LAXALT.," Mr. President,  some  50,000 nonindigenous Communist troops  are now in Africa, 40,000 Cubans, 5,000  Russians and 5,000 East Germans, along  with assorted other East Europeans. This  force exceeds  the next  largest French  force by a factor of 5 to 1, and to me  poses a direct threat to any attainment  of peace on the Continent.  Notwithstanding Ambassador Young,  this large Communist force is by its very  nature destabilizing. The mere existence  of an unchecked, extraneous force of this  magnitude on a volatile,  resource-rich  continent will spark a continuing series  of  interventions and  count.erinterven tions such as we have seen recently, thus  threatening to transform the entire con tinent into one giant battlefield.  For this  reason, I am encouraged by  recent reports in the Economist of Lon don that African leaders are beginning  to speak out. At a recent summit meet ing of the Organization of African Unity  in Khartoum, a number of responsible  voices were raised urging a sharp reduc tion  in  the  number  of Communist  troops on the continent.  Mr. President, because these voices are  still  in  the minority and because  the  presence of  such  a  large Communist  force in Africa is a serious matter worthy  of the attention of my colleagues, I ask  that the text of the Economist editorial  from  the July 29,  1978,  issue entitled  ""Five to One is Wrong"" be printed in  the RECORD:  The editorial follows:  [From the Economist of London, July 29,  1978]  FIVE TO ONE Is WRONG  ""A policy of  force  and  intervention  in  Africa""  is to be rejected ""regardless of the  source"", the Organisation of African Unity's  summit meeting declared last weekend, af ter a debate in which the voice of Africans  willing to criticise Russia was for once loud  in the land (see page 54) . The Cuban army  in Ethiopia is conspicuously not taking part  in  the Ethiopian government's latest at tempt to crush the rebellion in Eritrea. The  Cubans in Angola have not acted to prevent  that country's government  considering  a  deal with the west, in which Angola would  support  the west's plan  for Namibia and  make peace with western-backed Zaire  in  return for the dropping of western help to  rebels  inside Angola. This unusual Cuban  diffidence is in large part explained by this  week's meeting  in Belgrade of  the ""non aligned movement"", where Cuba's clumping  around Africa in support of Russia's friends  has caused raised eyebrows even in that tol erant mixture of neutrals and neutrals-on Russia's-side.  So was Dr. David Owen right when he told  the house of commons on June 28th that  Africa was starting to turn against Soviet Cuban policy? Not yet. It is better that the  Cubans in Ethiopia should be oiling their  guns rather  than using them against Eri trea's justifiable attempt to break free from  the Ethiopian empire, and better that the  Cube,ns  in Angola  should  confine  them selves to keeping Mr. Neto's government in  power rather than dictating his foreign pol icy. ~ut the problem of the Soviet-Cuban in tervention  in Africa will not start  to be  solved until the sheer number of communist  soldiers in the continent has been sharply  reduced.  Africa now contains at least 50,000 men  in uniform  from  non-African  communist  countries. That  includes more  than 40.000  Cubans, most of them in Angola and Ethio pia but with contingents in 11 other coun tries; at least 5.000 Soviet advisers, mostly  in Angola and Ethiopia; and an unknown  number of troops and ""security personnel""  from eastern Europe, including maybe 3.000  from Russia's most dutiful dependency, East  Germany. On the other side of the balance  there are only about 10.000 French  troops  in the continent, half of them doing nothing  ",1978

If we  do not work and try to keep our bases  there, we are going to be in great trouble.  I  think American  interests must  be  served. We,  in the International Rela tions Committee, have already cut this  item by $5 million. The Committee on  Appropriations has already cut by $5  million  this aid.

332,,95,0.194,731,18,Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee.," Mr.  Speaker, the continuing controversy sur rounding  the Endangered Species Act  and its application in the Tellico Dam  case has led many, including some of my  colleagues, to charge the Tennessee Val ley Authority with failure to comply with  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  section 7 of the act and consult with the  Department of  Interior. Such allega tions are totally unfounded.  Before the snail darter was listed as  an endangered species, at a point when  the Tellico project was some 75 percent  complete, TVA began frequent and in tensive consultations with the Fish and  Wildlife Service in an effort to resolve  the snail darter question. These consul tations included biweekly reports to the  service and TV A's prompt compliance  with information requests made by the  service. Those  consultations  are  con tinuing today.  On June 23  of  this year, S. David  Freeman, Chairman of the TVA's Board  of Directors and a man whose views re garding Tellico differ substantially from  those held by past TVA leadership, ap peared  before  the  Subcommittee  on  Fisheries, Wildlife Conservation and the  Environment during its oversight hear ings on the Endangered Species Act. In  his prepared statement, Chairman Free man noted that TVA had been cooper ative with the Department of Interior.  Further, when questioned about the con cern expressed by some that TV A had  not been cooperating, he replied that he  didn't think anyone,  including the De partment of Interior, could dispute the  fact that ""* * * TVA was fully cooper ative.""  Many other charges, both false and  misleading, have been  leveled  against  TVA during  the Tellico controversy.  I  have addressed only one here. However,  I would like to draw my colleagues' at tention to the following piece which ap peared in the Washington Post on July  11, 1978, and which outlines some of the  allegations which have been made.  I  would  then like to refer my colleagues  to the ""Letter to the Editor"" by former  TVA Board Chairman Aubrey J. Wagner  in last Friday's Post. Mr. Wagner ably  rebuts those allegations. This letter also  follows:  ENDANGE~ED SPECIES:  THE PORK-BARREL  FACTOR  (By Lewis Regenstein)  The Post's June 19 editorial ""The Darter  and the Dam"" is based on, and repeats, the  same false and misleading information being  so widely spread by the opponents if the En dangered Species Act.  The Senate is expected to vote this week  on amendments to gut and cripple the En dangered Species Act. Those  amendments  would place in jeooardy the future survival  not just of the snail darter but also countless  other rare and endangered species, including  the whooping crane, grizzly bear, California  sea otter, Mississippi sandhill crane, northern  Rocky Mountain timber wolf, Florida sea cow  (manatee), spotted owl, Bachmann's warbler  and many other types of imperiled wildlife,  including whales, dolphins,  and  even  the  Asian elephant, threatened by a habitat de struction project of the Agency for Interna tional Development.  The amendments to the Endangered Spe cies Act  that are being pushed,  including  those introduced by Sens. Howard Baker (R Tenn.) and John Culver  (D-Iowa), and an  even worse one sponsored by Sen. John Sten nis  (D-Miss.), would seriously weaken Sec tion 7 and cut the heart out of the act. Sec tion 7 prohibits agencies of the U.S. govern ment from  taking actions that would wipe  out endangered species and from funding or  authorizing  projects  that would  destroy  24291  habitat critical to their survival. Under the  proposed amendments, a procedure would be  set up through which the U.S. Government  could be allowed to wipe out any species, un der certain circumstances, that gets in the  way of  federal projects, such as highways,  dams or stream channelization programs.  Opponents of the act would have us believe  that only  obscure,  ""unimportant""  species  would  be  affected by  these  amendments,  species like the snail darter, a 3-inch minnow  that is threatened by the Tellico Dam being  built in Tennessee by the Tennessee Valley  Authority.  In  fact,  all  species-including  snail darters-are  important  links  in  the  chain of life and are essential if nature's deli  cate  balance  and  the  earth's  life-support  systems are to remain .in tact. \Vha t is actually  involved here  is virtually  all  endangered  wildlife whose habitat is threatened by gov ernment boondoggles.  Moreover, not even the pork-barrel lobby  has beep able to make a valid case that the  act is inflexible and needs changing to allow  such projects to go forth. Clearly, it is pre rna ture and unnecessary  to amend the act  now when there is no compelling reason to  do so. Of the approximately 5,200 potential or  actual conflicts that have arisen between fed eral projects and endangered species under  the  act,  all but one have been  resolved,  usually  administratively,  through negotia tion, modification or compromise. For exam ple, a lawsuit by conservationists forced the  Federal Highway Administration to reroute  an  interstate highway  around,  instead of  through, the last refuge for the 40 or so Mis sissippi  sandhill  cranes  remaining  in  the  wild. As a. result, and because of the Endan gered Species Act, we now have both a high way and sandhill cranes in Mississippi.  The one exception has been  the TV A's  Telllco Dam, a situation in which the TVA  adamantly refused to consult with the In terior Department as  required by  the act  and negotiate a compromise that would not  destroy  the snail darter. There has,  thus,  never been an instance of good-faith con sultation under the act that did not result  in an acceptable solution being found. The  now-famous (or infamous) dam is a  largely  worthless project that could not be justified  even if there were no snail darters involved.  In fact,  the project's concrete,  labor and  earthwork amount to  less  than 20 percent  of  the widely  touted  $119-m1llion  figure.  The dam was never  intende:l  to generate  any significant amount of power, and w111  not do so. Most of the money has gone to  forcibly buy up and to build road improve ments  for  future development of  the rich  farm  land  surrounding  the  dam,  25.000  acres of which will be destroyed if the dam  gates are closed, alon~ wit'IJ. ma.1or  Indian  archeQlogical sites, a beautiful river valley,  the  finest  trout stream  in  the Southeast  and the last free-flowing stretch of the Lit tle Tennessee River.  the  fertile  farmland-much  of  it  forcibly  seized  from  its owners-were de veloped  or  returned  to  agricultural pur poses, almost all of the cost of the project  could  still be  recovered. As Sen. Gaylord  Nelson  (D-Wis.)  pointed out  in opposing  these amendments, TVA  itself admits that  the value of farm production could  reach  $52 million a year versus an estimate:i $3  million from hydroelectric power. TVA and  the  Interior Department are now working  to~ether to work out a plan that wlll solve  this problem.  If the Supreme Court's Tell1co Dam de cision has  the result of slowing down  the  pork-barrel  lobby and  the construction of  such wasteful and  inflationary projects,  it  would be the best thing tha,t could happen  for the American taxpayer and for the fight  against inflation.  -Most Americans wan  to  see  their pre cious wildlife heritage preserved for future  If  ",1978

334,,95,-0.171,978,18,Mr. ERTEL.," Mr. Speaker, some time  ago I announced by intention to offer an  amendment  to  the Foreign Assistance  Appropriations Act cutting off all funds  for Peace Corps activities in South Korea.  My amendment was designed to encour age the Government of South Korea to  make former Ambassador Kim Dong Jo  available to the House of Representatives  in its investigation of Korean influence  buying. Kim Dong J o is believed to have  information  critical  to  the  successful  completion of this inquiry.  I am not going to introduce my amend ment because the South Korean Govern ment has assured the leadership of this  House that former Ambassador Kim will  supply investigators with details of his  alleged  transactions with Members of  Congress. This is a modest but im'!or tant step in getting to the bottom of the  Korean scandal.  We have no assurance  that former  Ambassador Kim's  testimony will  be  given under oath.  We have no assurance that he will be  subject to cross-examination.  We do know, however, that for the first  time the South Korean Government is  willing to permit Mr. Kim to respond to  written interrogatories. This, in itself, is  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  an indication that the South Koreans  may now appreciate the wisdom of act ing in good faith and in the spirit of  international comity between allies. In  not introducing my amendment, I am  suggesting that we adopt a waitand-see  attitude. If Mr. Kim provides new and  concrete factual  information as prom ised. the Committee on Standards of Offi cial Conduct may have sufficient infor mation to complete its investigation. If  Mr. Kim  is not forthcoming with this  information or if the circumstances of  his testimony are deemed inadequate, we  may still want his sworn testimony before  the committee. For the time being, how ever, I am satisfied that the investigation  is proceeding in a positve manner and no  immediate action by this body, such as  my amendment, is required. In fact, for  this House to impose further sanctions  against South Korea at this time may be  counterproductive.   BALANCE(S) OF POWER, BOOK III  C(l) MIDDLE EAST  HON. JOHN B.

This legislation which would become ef fective on October 1, 1978, provides for  an estimated cost-of-living increase of  7.3 percent in payments to veterans with  service-connected disabilities and to wid ows and children of veterans who died as  a result of service-connected disabilities.  In addition, S. 2828 includes an amend ment  sponsored by  our distinguished  chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, Senator ALAN CRANSTON, and  cosponsored by me and my other col leagues on  the committee,  to  increase  dependency  allowances;  provide  tional  compensation  to veterans who  have suffered the loss or loss of use of  three limbs or who are in need of spe cial medical aid; raise the automobile as sistance allowance; provide for an av erage  increase of 10 percentage points  in the service-connected disability rat ings of veterans who have suffered the  impairment of extremities, partly as a  result of non-service-connected disabil ities;  and entitle survivors of certain  totally disabled veterans, whose deaths  have not been !ound to be service con nected, to receive benefits under the de pendency and indemnity compensation  law.  Mr. President, as chairman of the Sub committee on Compensation and Pension,  I would particularly like  to thank my  distinguished colleague, Senator MATsu NAGA,  for  chairing  the  subcommittee  hearings on this bill. Further, I would  like to commend the committee staff for  their excellent work as well as the staff  of the other members of the committee.  Finally, I especially appreciate the co operation and assistance of the service  organizations, Veterans Administration,  Congressional Budget Office, and various  other interested persons in formulating  that legislation.  This legislation, when approved by the  Congress, will mean a great deal to thou sands of disabled veterans and the wid ows and children of veterans in Georgia  and  throughout  the Nation who,  like  everyone else, are caught in the grip of  the ever-increasing  cost-of-living and  spiraling medical costs. I hope that the  full Senate will approve this bill today  and an agreed upon measure between the  House and Senate can soon be sent to the  President for his signature.  ",1978

337,House,95,0.297,1134,18,Mr. BEARD of Tennessee.," Mr. Chair man, I move to strike the requisite num ber of words, and I rise in support of the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I think the situation is  really somewhat worse,  as  far as  the  shortage with which we are dealing is  concerned, than what is reported.  I  am not going  to spend  too much  time on this amendment, because it has  been ably represented as to the need to  improve our National Guard and our Re serve forces. The major concept of the  all-volunteer service is ""a small active  duty force, supplemented by larger and  better trained Reserves."" It is the pres ent failure of this concept that concern  me.  We have the Department of Defense  speaking out about how great the all volunteer service is working today, but I  want to take this opportunity to speak  to the Committee on Appropriations and  also  to speak  to  the members of  the  Authorizing Col'nmittee and  say  that  things are not that great. We talk about  incentives.  I wish  the Members would  read the advertisement in the Readers  Digest on the All-Volunteer Army. Here  are some of the headlines:  ""See Europe through the Army's eyes.""  ""Sailors have more  fun.""  We  have  advertisements  displayed  with young military men riding camels  around the Pyramids.  ""Get a free college education.""  ''A 3.0-day paid vacation.""  ""Free medical benefits.""  ""Learn a trade.""  They go right on down the line, and  there is not a single word in any of these  advertisements about what may happen  or, by the way, you may find yourself in  a foxhole some day or that you could be  out training in 20-degree weather in the  middle of a  field. All  these wonderful  incentives and the emphasizing by our  recruiters  that  these  incentives  are  what the Army  is all about-it is  the  emphasis of  these  incentives  that  is  causing up to 40 percent of the young  people joining our military to quit be fore their first tour of duty is complete.  But we need to see what we are get ting. Are we getting a dollar's return of  quality for what we are paying?  Dr. White says we are getting a better  quality in the All-Volunteer Army.  Do the Members of the House know  that the Army is now spending millions  of dollars rewriting all its training man uals and downgrading the reading level  from the 11th grade to the 8th grade?  Do we know they are putting their man uals out in the form of comic books?  How many people know the Army is  now appropriating and setting aside mil lions  of  dollars  to  establish  reading  schools just to teach the young recruits  how to read, because up to 30 percent of  the kids coming today cannot read at all  or can only read up to the seventh grade  reading level.  to  ",1978

Beyond the fact  that such cuts would  severely under mine the United States role in interna tional  financial  institutions  and  our  ability to deal effectively with our ad versaries around the world,  these cuts  could drasticallv undermine the security  of one of our closest friends and allies,  Israel.  In light of the Senate's recent decision  to approve  the arms package  to  the  Middle East, which has already done  much to disrupt the military balance in  the Mideast and to threaten Israel's se curity, Congress should not even con sider any additional cut in aid to Israel,  no matter what form consideration of  such a cut takes. Efforts  to  reconvene  the Mideast peace talks which have most  recently been jeopardized by Egypt's in transigence, would also be disrupted by  changing aid levels at .this time. Given  , these developments, it is imperative that  Congress be responsive to Israel's urgent  economic and defense needs by oppos ing any reduction in aid.  Yesterday; an amendment to the In ternational Security Assistance Act of  adopted without opposition  that expresses the sense of the Congress  that  the United States should be  re sponsive to Israeli defense requirements  and should  sell  Israel additional ad vanced aircraft  in order  to maintain  Israel's defense capability which is es sential  to peace. The  intent of  this  amendment  is  clear-the  security of  Israel is of the utmost concern and im portance to the United States. Adoption  of any amendment today which would  reduce U.S. aid to Israel would not only  be  in direct contradiction  to what  is  necessary for peace in the Mideast, but  it would also be contrary to the explicit  1978 was  ",1978

DEAR CONGRESSMAN ANDERSON:  In a  few  days you will have an opportunity to vote  on H.R. 8729 and H.R. 11986,  the aircraft  noise reduction legislation recently approved  by the House Committee on Ways and Means  and the House Committee on Public Works  and Transportation.  The 15 regional and local service airlines  who provide airline  service  to more  than  400 of the nation's small and medium-sized  communities strongly urge you  to support  this legislation a.imed at significantly reduc ing aircraft noise around the nation's air ports.

The airports wlll be provided additional  airport development grant funds  to reduce  noncompatible  land uses  around  airports  through  the acquisition of  land or noise  suppressive equipment. The airlines will re ceive assistance  through  the creation of a  two percent excise  tax on passenv.ers and  shippers to provide funds to aid in either re tiring or retrofitting about 1600 jet aircraft  which do not meet current Federal noise  standards.

In recognition of Rev erend Wilson's service and contributions  to the city of New York, the New York  Council of Churches has awarded Rev erend Wilson  its 1978 Society for  the  Family of Man Award. Reverend Wilson  will  receive  that award  in November  along with Menachem Begin, Anwar  Sadat, and Thomas A. Murphy.  I feel very proud to be able to say that  Reverend Wilson  is  the pastor of  the  Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Har lem and has done so much to help the  residents of my community.

349,Senate,95,-0.41,1342,18,Mr. CULVER.," Mr. President, among  the funds provided by the 1979 Interior  appropriations bill are $3.44 million for  a visitors' center at DeSoto Bend Wild life Refuge. The De Soto Bend Refuge  lies along  the Missouri River on  the  Iowa-Nebraska border about 20 miles  north of the Council Bluffs-Omaha area.  Hundreds of  thousands of visitors an nually observe the snow and blue geese  which stop to feed there and the other  varieties of wildlife including deer and  coyotes which inhabit the refuge, or en joy the rcreational opportunities on its  la!'ge oxbow lake, or wander among the  cottonwood groves, sand dunes, and open  fields. In addition, they can relive a part  of our past by viewing the Bertrand Ar chive of Civil War Era artifacts relating  to the opening of the Western frontier.  The refuge is growing in popularity and  it is expected that 1 million people will  take advantage of these benefits annu ally by the year 2000.  Together with additional funds which the Fish and Wildlife Service has an nounc~ an intention of requesting next  year, the appropriation in this legisla tion wlll be used to construct a perma nent facility at DeSoto Bend. Such a cen ter would  have  storage  and  display  space,  research  laboratories and a  li brary for the Bertrand Archive as well  as a wildlife viewing gallery and other  service areas. Both for residents of the  area who have long recognized just how  important a natural and cultural re source De Soto Bend is and for visitors  from across the Nation who will share in  its use,  the construction of such a fa cility will be a welcome and important  addition.  The need for such a center first came  to light some ten years ago when two  Omaha men,  Jesse Pursell and Sam  Corbino, after ingenious historical de tective work and a patient search, lo cated the remains of the Bertrand. While  on its maiden voyage carrying supplies to  the Montana gold fields, the steamboat  sank after hitting a snag in t.he Missouri  River north of Council Bluffs, Iowa, in  1865. Silt and sand carried by the river  soon buried the wreck and changes in  the fickle Missouri's channel later con cealed its location. The Bertrand's cargo  lay undisturbed and remarkably well preserved by the mud which encased it until its discovery more than a century  later.  Once the artifacts were recovered and  cleaned, it readily became clear that a  significant  regional  cultural  resource  had been discovered. There were liter ally hundreds of thousands of individual  items-one  estimate  says  perhaps  as  manv as 2 million each one saying some thing about the opening of the frontier.  Supplies such as detonating devices, mer cury mortars,  and pickaxes  illustrate  what work must have been like in the  early miriing camps. Capes, coats, gloves,  hats, suits, buttons and combs of every  kind document the styles and fashions  of the mid-19th century.  Foodstuffs  from  salted mackerel  to  brandied peaches  to canned  tomatoes  suggest both the variety and limitation  of the diets of the early pioneers: Varie ty by 1llustrating that such luxuries as  Chesapeake Bay oysters were available  to the pioneers, limitations by showing  that at the same time many staples could  be obta~ned only by long, arduous, and  uncertam river tramc. Plow frames, pen  holders, candle molds, leather harnesses,  and butter churns reveal the technology  of everyday life. Bottle after bottle of  alcoholic ""stomach bitters"" tell us per haps a  little of  the primitive medical  state of art of the time but a lot more  about the resourcefulness of their manu facturers  and  consumers  in avoiding  Federal liquor taxes.  These examples merely touch the sur face of the encyclopedia of goods which  were excavated. What is at De Soto Bend  for the study of scholars and the interest  of Americans who care about their past  is,  in effect, a whole shopping center  of what was available for residents of  the Midwest a century ago. Once this is  understood, I believe that there can be  little wondering why the citizens of my  State believe that the Bertrand archive  is a unique regional treasure.  The construction of a center to store  display, and study these artifacts will b~  tJhe  final  step  in a  long hard-fought  process to preserve that treasure. Short ly aiflter the immensity and value of the  archive were recognized, some suggested  moving the bulk of the collection to the  Smithsonian  in Washington and dis persing  the remainder  to many other  museums throughout the United States  Residents of the area and their elected  representatives  protested  sharply  against  this  removal of  the artifacts  from  their logical and natural setting.  It was decided-quite correctly-that the  integrity of the archive should be pro tected and that it remain at De Soto  Bend.  It was further necessary for Congress  to take action to protect the condition  of  the artifacts  themselves.  Ironically,  the perservative work done by the Mis souri River mud was rapidly being un done by exposure of the collection to the  fresh air. An emergency allocation which  I requested from the House Interior Ap propriations Subcommittee and which  was approved by the Congress allowed a  professional team to stabilize the con dition of the artifacts.  Now it is important to provide an in terpretative  center  for  the Bertrand  which is both appropriate to the scope  and value of  the archive and which  is consistent with the other purposes of  the refuge. The funds which are in this  bill  and planned  for next year will  permit construction of a center of this  kind.

There  is no question about the fact that small  business  is  in every congressional dis trict not  just in 260. It discriminates  agai~st all of them that are not in that  category, up to 435.  Beyond that, there are a whole lot of  congressional districts where the labor  surplus area is very small. Beyond that,  the  gentleman  from California  <Mr.  McFALL) is exactly right in that the main  reason for getting this amendment out  of here is because of the price differen tial that they can receive if they delete  it because now they have to be competi tive.

353,,95,0.3,1459,18,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to express my sincere appre ciation to my colleagues for their unani mous consent yesterday to the amend ment I offered to the Federal charter of  the Boy Scouts of America. I know the  Boy Scouts share in my gratitude to the  House of Representatives for the expedi tious passage of this legislation.  The purpose of this bill, H.R. 11956, is  to specify that the Boy Scouts' annual  report to Congress shall be printed as a   separate House document. Although the  Boy Scouts' annual report was printed as  a House document for 55 years, almost  every year since  their Federal charter  was granted in 1916, they were informed  in 1977 that this practice was to be dis continued because their charter does not  specify such treatment of their report.  Unlike the Girl Scouts of America, the  Boy Scouts were incorporated before it  became the practice for Congress to in clude this provision in Federal charters.  25019  Hence, the Boy Scouts' report may net  be printed as a House document, while  the reports ol other federally chartered  organizations of' much shorter  tenure,  may.  The Boy Scouts are proud of  their  Federal charter and have always  felt  honored to have their report produced as  an omcial congressional document. I am  sure my colleagues are, likewise, proud of  the Boy Scouts of America and the great  positive influence they exert on the youth  of America, and so it is fltting that the  House of Representatives has agreed to  reinstate the printing of their report as  an omcial  congressional  document.  I  thank and commend my colleagues.   RETIREMENT OF J. BURKE KNAPP,  VICE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD  BANK  .  HON. CHARLES W. WHALEN,  JR  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday; August 8, 1978   ",1978
354,,95,-0.139,1459,18,Mr. WHALEN.," Mr. Speaker, the inter national community has lost the services  of  a  distinguished public  servant,  J:  Burke Knapp, who retired on June 30  as Vice President of the World Bank.  Mr. Knapp  joined the Bank in late  1949 as Assistant Director of the Eco nomics Department. In the fall of 1952,  he was named Director of Operations of  the Western Hemisphere Department  (now the Latin America and Caribbean  Regional Office). Four years  later,  in  July of 1956, he became a Vice President,  one of three appointed that year, and in  October 1972, Mr. Knapp assumed  the  position of Vice President of Operations  of the World Bank.  '  In the post. Mr. Knapp examined in  detail every project that was considered  for World Bank and International De velopment Agency <IDA)  financing. His  creativity  and  leadership  guided  the  World  Bank-IDA  through  extremely  difficult political circumstances and al lowed  the Bank to remain the world's  foremost international financial institu tion for development.  J. Burke Knapp's academic and pro fessional distinctions are many. He was  named a Rhodes Scholar and studied at  Oxford for 3 years, after graduating with  honors <Phi Beta Kappa) from Stanford  University. He was elected Honorary Fel low of St. Johns College, Oxford, in June  1975, and in April of this year, Mr. Knapp  was awarded the Japanese Order of the  Rising Sun (Second Class).  In addition, his activities as a citizen  distinguish him well. He has served on  the board of directors of the Arena Stage  <Washington Drama Society, Inc.) since  195'9 and was chairman of its board for  10 years. He also has been a member of  the board of directors of Mount Vernon  College since 1965.  Obviously, J. Burke Knapp's contri butions have benefitted the entire inter national-and  local-community. His  thorough professionalism will be remem bered and appreciated by all those who  seek to establish a better environment  in which future generations may live.e  ",1978
355,,95,-0.338,1472,18,Mr. MAGUIRE.," Mr. Speaker, I was  not surprised  to  read  the headline in  yesterday's Washington Post: ""Surprise:  Public Backs Carter on Taxes; Roper  Survey Shows Fairness Rated above Tax  Cut.""  While the survey cited clearly demon strates  the popular appeal of most of  President Carter's reform proposals of  last January, now considered dead on  Capitol Rill, it also showed great public  division on  the  issue of how  to  treat  capital gains.  I  submit  the public unsureness  re sults from the lack until now of a true  reform position, carefully articulated, on  capital gains. But so Congress cannot  escape without the opportunity of doing  what logic and common sense demand, I  am today introducing the Capital Gains  Full Indexation Act of 1978.  Columnist  Clayton  Fritchey  marized in Saturday's Post:  sum In its spontaneous embrace of the Steiger  approach, Congress had perceived  that  if  there is no relief for the ordinary investor,  the government could well klll the goose that  has  laid  so many of  the golden eggs of  American  private  enterprise  (emphasis  added).  Exactly so. But here is the rub:  the  Steiger approach, and  its near cousin  with a face lift in the Ways and Means  bill, do little or nothing for ordinary in vestors, for many years at least. I con sider ordinary investors to be those mid dle-or upper-middle-income savers who  are buying homes, or socking away for  their children's education.  Now there is nothing wrong with sav ing  for  future exigencies, or  junior's  education, by keeping a savings account  at the local bank. Those funds are used  to finan~e small business, mortgages,  and consumer credit--all essential for  our national growth.  But economists and others agree that  the element missing from  the current  economic recovery is risk capital invest ment in the new machines and plants  necessary to employ the millions enter ing the labor force every year. This in vestment has  traditionally come  from  equity issues-new stock offerings.  But new equity  is no  longer a  sig nificant source of funds, and ordinary  investors have led the exodus from the  stock market. According to Mr. Fritchey,  over 5 million  fewer Americans own  stock than a decade ago.  ",1978

I would draw his attention to the fact  that there has been a great deal of dis cussion on the Senate floor the past 3  days on the chairman of the Federal En ergy Regulatory Commission's comment  that the existing case load under sec tion 4 is overwhelming, and is bogging  them down in paper.

361,,95,0.283,24,22,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, reserving  the right to object, and I shall not object,  I  join with the majority leader in sub mitting this request to the Senate.  I very much hope there will not be an  objection. I do not believe, in all candor,  that either side has 50 votes on the mo tion to recommit. I think the issue is still  up in the air. Only time will tell. Time  is of the essence at this paint in this  session of the Senate.  While I oppase this conference report  and while I will vote for the motion to  recommit, I believe that it has a chance  to prevail, and if it does not prevail I  will vote against the conference report.  These facts notwithstanding, I do believe  it best serves the interests of those of  us who oppose the repart of the Senate  and the country to get on with the busi ness of deciding this issue.  With that in mind, then, Mr. President,  I have consulted with many Senators  on this side and I am hopeful that the  unanimous-consent  request  will  be  granted.  I have asked the Republican cloakroom  to notify all Senators on this side that  this request would be made at this time  so that everyone could be present. I be lieve  the distinguished majority leader  may have done the same.  I want it clearly understood, however,  that in agreeing to this, those of us who  oppase the conference report, the distin guished Senator from Texas, the distin guished Senator  from Wyoming,  and  others who have been involved, in no way  are suggesting that we have diminished  our optimism or enthusiasm for trying to  recommit this conference repart in order  to improve it, because I believe if we do  recommit it we can significantly improve  it and that it will come back and we will  do a better service for the country.  In any event, I do not believe an ex tended  debate  beyond  next Tuesday  would serve anyone's best interests. I do  not object.  ",1978
362,House,95,-0.367,180,22,Mr. ULLMAN.," Mr. Chairman. I yield  myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, let us be sure we fully  understand the parliamentary procedure  here. The Ways and Means Committee is  working with the Public Works Commit tee in developing this bill. as we usually  do in trust fund-related projects. The  Public Works Committee asked the Ways  and Means Committee  to produce an  amendment that would provide the reve nue to accommodate the program that  they had  laid out and  recommended.  They of course did not have the author ity to repeal the excise tax, and so the  excise taxes supporting the trust fund  would be fully in place and there is an  uncommitted surplus of about $2 billion  in that fund now.  Mr. Chairman, the Rules Committee  has made in order as an amendment to  title Ill of H.R. 8729  the sutstance of  H.R. 11986, which was reported by  the  Committee on Ways and Means. H.R.  11986 makes changes to the excise taxes  on air transportation and provides re funds or credits on certain of these taxes  for expenditures by airlines to modify or  replace existing noisy aircraft.  Under present law, an 8-percent ex cise tax is generally imposed upon thP.  fares of airline passengers on domesti~  flights  and  flights  to or  from nearb:,1  points in Canada and Mexico. Air passen gers departing the United States, whose  fares are not entirely taxable under the  8-percent tax, are subject to a $3 per  person  international departure  tax. In  addition,  a  5-percent  tax  is  imposed  upon domestic air freight transportation  charges. The proceeds of these taxes are  presently deposited  in the airport and  airway trust fund from which appropri ations are made  for certain aviation related purposes. These taxes are sched uled to decline or terminate on July l,  1980.  The Ways  and Means Committee  amendment will  reduce the present 8percent passenger and 5-percent freight  taxes by 2 percentage points, and also  suspend the present $3 international de parture tax, for a 5-year period from  October 1, 1978, through September 30,  1983.  In place of these reduced or suspended  taxes, there will be 2 percent passenger  and freight  taxes which use  the same  tax base as under present law. As a re sult, the total tax for domestic passenger  and  freight  shippers will  remain un changed. In addition, there will be im posed international passenger departure  taxes of $2 where the air fare is less than  $100 and $10 where the fare is $100 or  more. There will also be a 5-percent tax  on charges for international air freight  which departs  the United States. The  new taxes will be imposed upon the com mercial air carriers and will be in effect  for a 5-year period until October l, 1983.  At the end of  this period  the present  level of excise taxes would be restored, if  they remain generally in effect on that  date and the proceeds are being depos ited in the trust fund pursuant to con gressional review in 1980 of the airport  and airway program, as the trust fund  expires in 1980 under current law.  Those domestic air carriers whooper ate large subsonic jet aircraft which do  not comply with  the FAA's 1976 noise  regulations may obtain refunds or cred its for the new excise taxes they have  paid. They will be entitled to refunds or  credits for certain percentages of costs  they have incurred,  including progress  payments, after January 24, 1977, and  before January 1, 1985,  to bring their  noncomplying noisy aircraft into com pliance with FAA noise regulations by  one of three methods: First, retrofitting,  which is adding sound absorbing mate rials  to  the engines; second, replacing  the engines; or third, replacing the non complying aircraft. These percentages  are 50 or 90 percent for retrofitting depending on the number of an aircraft's  engines-75 percent for replacement en gines, and either 40 percent or 25 percent  for a  replacement aircraft--depending  upon the noise level of the replacement  aircraft. The Secretary of Transporta tion is required to certify that the costs  have been incurred for qualified prop erty before a  refund or credit will be  allowed.  These  refunds  or  credits will  be  treated as taxable income when received  by the air carriers. Rules are also pro vided to generally prevent the claiming  of multiple credits for  the same non complying aircraft and  to  require  recapture of credits or refunds where a  replacement aircraft  is sold or  leased  within 5 years of being placed in service.  Foreign air carriers will be entitled  to obtain  lump-sum  refunds of  their  payments of these taxes for the entire  costs  incurred  to bring  into  compli ance their aircraft which operate in the  United States. These carriers must first  certify  that  their U.S. operating fleet  does,  and will  in  the  future,  comply  with the 1976 noise standards.  Excess  tax  collections  over  the  amounts of  refunds or credits will be  deposited  into  the airport and airway  trust  fund.  In addition,  the provision  amends the trust fund statute to permit  expenditures  for  noise  compatibility  programs and planning grants from the  trust fund-as included  in other  titles  of H.R. 8729.  The provision also requires the FAA  to issue an annual report of unsafe air port and airway operating conditions  before any expenditures can be made  from  the trust fund  for  the fallowing  fiscal year.  The Treasury Department supports  this bill. Mr. Chairman,  I  urge  the  adoption of  this amendment  to H.R.  8729.  ",1978

364,,95,-0.526,271,22,Mr. MITCHELL of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, the National Medical Associa tion Journal recently carried an article  by John T. Chissell, M.D., of Baltimore,  Md., which offered different perspectives  on the problem of high blood pressure,  which affects so many black Americans.  I  am  inserting into  the RECORD  the  article written by Dr. John Chissell and  I urge my colleagues and members of  congressional staffs to read this article.  HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MONTH-DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVES  By the time this issue of the Journal of the  National Medical Association  reaches you.  there will have been intensive media cam  pa.igns exhorting the nation's citizens, pa.r tlcula.rly black Americans, to be checked out  for hypertension, and if found to have high  blood pressure, to take one or more pills dally  for the rest of their lives. Well-known and  respected entertainers will sing the message  ""do it for them (family or friends) and for  yourself-take your medicine for the rest of  your life.""  The popular messages with regard to hy pertension detection and control certainly  all have a  basis  in some  facts and some  truths, but the members of the National Med ical Association and the people who look to  the members of the NMA for management of  their health problems need to look at some  other basic facts and  truths about hyper tension.  There is increasing evidence that lifestyle  changes may normalize hypertension. My own  experience and research indicates that life style changes which result in better nutri tion, adequate amounts of aerobic exercise,  and inner balancing techniques such as medi tation and biofeedback have the greatest po tential for controlling high blood pressure,  while at the same time moving the individual  in the direction of optimal health and well ness. In fa.ct, the time hypertension is first  diagnosed  is an  ideal  time  to  initiate an  awareness of  the patient's  lifestyle habits  which may be producing the hypertension,  and to begin substitute habits which may  reverse  the movement  toward disease, dis a.bllity, and death in an individual or ta.rget  population  to  a  direction  toward optimal  health and wellness.  We need not condemn people to a daily  ritual of taking pills and their cumulative  side effects if we a.re willing to educate our selves and our patients to the fact that daily  health habits may be just as effective (if not  more so)  as chemicals in controlling high  blood pressure.  The amount of medication patients may  need to control their hypertension can be  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  minimized with a concomitant emphasis on  eliminating negative health habits and ini tiating positive health ha.bits.  There is ample evidence that black people  suffer more  from hypertension, both from  onset at younger ages and from more severe  consequences, than their white counterparts.  Many quantitatively oriented western cardio vascular  specialists  and  researchers  have  looked for the answers to this increased sus ceptlbllity in blacks by ma.king a genetically  oriented search for some inherent defect in  blacks. Members of the National Medical As sociation have an obligation to insist that  at least an equal a.mount of research money  and effort be spent in examining the effects  of psychosocial stress on the etiology, mor bidity, and mortality of black hypertensives.  Emotional stress of any variety, because of  its resistance to precise measurement, or be cause of  resistance  in fitting  into Kochs  Postulates, has been shamefully neglected by  quantitatively oriented  cardiovascular  re searchers. Racism as a psychosocial factor  has been almost totally ignored.  There  ls  increasing  international agree ment that hypertension ls one of the diseases  of civilization. The United States, in spite  of its technological superiority in the health  field among clvillzed countries, does not re flect that superiority when it comes to the  prevention of hypertension as evidenced by  the increasing amount of high blood pres sure in US citizens. The figures have been  widely publicized this month; this ls a time  to examine alternative methods of preven tion and treatment of hypertension to the  multlbilllon dollar pill-pushing philosophy  that involves all of us today. This is also a  time to examine our own lifestyles and the  kind of health these ha.bits have produced in  us. The time ls now, seize the time! !--John  T. Chlssel, MD.e  ESTHER L. LINN  HON.

The  report,  entit!ed  ""Vietnam  and  China: An American Diplomatic Oppor tunity,"" was authored bv Representative  JONATHAN BINGHAM, Representative PAUL  MCCLOSKEY,  and Reoresentative AN THONY BEILENSON. All three o.f these dis tinguished House Members have current  or former legislative responsibilities with  the main subiects of  this paper-U.S.  foreign policy in Asia. postwar rebtions  with Vietnam, and the trade embargo  now  imposed by  the United States on  Vietnam.

373,House,95,-0.439,440,22,Mr. JOHNSON of California.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  in support of H.R.  12611, the Air Service Improvement Act  of 1978. The bill was  reported by  the  Committee on Public Works and Trans portation on May 19 by a vote of 37 to 5.  Prior to this, the committee held exten sive hearings on airline regulation. We  also  held many markup  sessions  in  which we carefully worked out a moder ate, respansible bill which provides !or  increased competition while protecting  the interests of small communities, air line employees, and smaller air carriers.  Our bill is more moderate than the bill  which the Senate passed last spring.  The present regulatory system for air lines needs substantial revision. The law  now  governing  the airlines was  first  passed in 1938. At that time the airline  industry was a  fraction of its present  size, and the airlines were heavily de pendent on Federal subsidy.  Through most of its history the CAB  has administered the 1938 act to protect  the airlines and discourage them from  competing. These  policies may  have  been desirable in the early days of the  act. But in recent years protective reg ulation has not benefited either con sumers, who have had to pay higher than-necessary  fares, or  the  industry,  which freouently has had a poor earn ings record.  During the last few years there have  been substantial changes in CAB policy.  Under  the leadership of John Robson  and Alfred Kahn, the CAB has encour aged the airlines to be more competitive  and the airlines have responded with a  wide variety of discount  fares. These  fares have helped combat inflation and  have enabled many persons to travel by  air who could not have afforded to pay  regular fares. The reduced  fares have  resulted in record levels of travel, and  airline profits have never been higher.  The legislation we are presenting to day will  insure that in the future the  CAB will not be able to reestablish the  protective and anticompetitive policies  of former years. The bill will also insure  that the competitive policies which the  CAB developed will not be set aside by  the courts.  Perhaps the most important provision  of the bill is the new policy statement  requiring that in all  its decisions CAB  emphasize competition,  low  fares, and  entry by new carriers. Other provisions  of the bill, such as the dormant author ity and experimental entry provisions,  will give the airlines increased freedom  to enter new markets, without CAB ap proval. The fare flexibility provision a~­ lows airlines to adjust their fares, withm  a zone of reasonableness, without CAB  approval.  The bill has a sunset provision termi nating CAB on December 31, 1982. This  will  permit  complete  deregulation  if  Congress  finds  that  course  to  be  appropriate.  The bill also includes provisions to in sure that the transition to a more com petitive system will be fafr and equitable  to all persons involved. Protection is ex tended to small communities. now receiv ing air service, and to airline employees.  Mr. Chairman, it is important that the  issue of regulatory reform be resolved in  this session of Congress. During the past  few years, the airline industry, its em ployees, and the communities it serves  have been in a state of uncertainty as to  the basic ground rules which will govern  the industry. I believe that this time has  been well spent in careful study of the  issues; but now that we have had ade quate time for study and deliberation, it  is only fair that this matter be resolved  promptly.  Mr. Chairman, the language in H.R.  12611 which amends section 408 of the  act  of  1958  is  intended  to  subject  mergers, and acquisitions  to  the same  scrutiny as would be applied under the  Clayton Act and the Sherman Act as if  they occurred in a nonregulated industry.  Thus,  the effect of this provision in  H.R. 12611  is  to permit those mergers  which-even if it would violate  tradi tional antitrust standards-meet a  two  part test: First, the merger's anticom petitive effects must be found to be out weighed  in  the public  interest by  the  probable effect of  the  transaction  in  ""meeting  significant  transportation  needs of the community to be served,""  and second,  the Board must find  that  ""such significant  transportation needs  may not be satisfied by any reasonably  available  less anticompetitive alterna tive."" This  two-part  test, which only  comes into play if the transaction has  been first been found  to violate  tradi tional antitrust tests, is similar to that  imposed by judicial interpretation of the  Bank Merger Act.

As we celebrate this week, let us be re minded that while we seek to continue  to renew cultural and historical ties, as  well as respect the ethnic pluralism of  our society, we must also collectively re assess  the status of Hispanics  in this  country, our contributions, goals and ac complishments, as well as the obstacles  which still confront us.  This is a time of critical importance to  all Hispanics. Due to increasing num bers, as well as ever-growing political  strength, citizens of Hispanic origin can  no longer be  ignored. Of all minority  groups in the United States, the Hispanic  population is currently experiencing the  greatest rate of growth. It is anticipated  that at the end of the next decade, His panics will constitute the lar.;est ethnic  minority group in the Nation.  But numbers alone are not significant.  Now, to obtain the equality of opportu nity previously denied them, Hispanics  throughout the Nation are working to  transform their numerical strength into  true political power.  The current political strength of the  Hispanic population can perhaps be best  exemplified by results of the last Presi dential election, where,  in California,  some 1.4 million Hispanic voters were  registered. Similarly,  that same year,  900,000 Hispanics were  registered  Texas, 800,000 in New York, and in Ari zona, 177,800. Thus, it seems inevitable  that Hispanic voters will play a major  role in the immediate political future of  this Nation.  Nevertheless,  despite  our  increased  numbers and political awareness, many  obtacles must still be overcome. To this  day, many Hispanic people still face the  serious burdens of poverty, illiteracy, and  discrimination. Such facts can be illus trated by the staggering unemployment  rate that Hispanics have that is of one  and a half times greater than the gen eral popula1 ion.  Distressingly, important areas of em ployment still remain closed to citizens  of Hispanic origin. One such obvious area  of underrepresentation exists within the  Federal Government  itself. Here, His panics make up only 2.6 percent of the  Federal work force, while comprising at  least 7 percent of the general population.  Yet, I grow ever more confident in our  ability to overcome such difficulties, as  the Hispanic people  reach goals and  make contributions previously  thought  impossible.  This week is of great significance to  all those sharing in the proud heritage  of the Hispanic culture. Today, we must  all recognize, and seek to strengthen, the  common culture and heritage comprising a most important segment of this Na tion-the Hispanic  community.  gether, through a unit.ed Hispanic peo ple, bound by our  commonality and  To in  ",1978
377,,95,-0.422,700,22,Mr. HART., I move to lay that motion  on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was  agreed to.  FRAUD IN GOVERNMENT  PROGRAMS  ,1978
378,,95,-0.224,700,22,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, this morn ing, the Governmental Affairs Subcom mittee on Federal Spending Practices  and Open Government held hearings on  fraud within the General Services Ad ministration. The Deputy Attorney Gen eral  told us of steps  that  the Justice  Department  and GSA  are  taking  to  establish a  joint strike  force  to  take  charge of  the  criminal  investigation.  That strike force will give us one person  in charge, which I believe is essential to  assuring the taxpayers of this country  that we are not going to let the thieves  continue to cart away money, television  sets, and whatever else they want from  agencies of the Federal Government.  We also heard testimony this morning  from Elmer Staats, the Comptroller Gen eral, on his soon-to-be-printed  report  ""Federal Agencies Can, And Should, Do  More To Combat Fraud In Government  Programs."" Mr. Staats  reported  that  Federal programs involving $250 billion a  year are being handled by a number of  agencies of the Federal Government. He  further  told us  that, while we might  think the fraud we discovered in GSA  was a selected instance of fraud occur ring  in one department,  that was not  true, that the same thing that is going  on in GSA is going on in a number of  other agencies of the Federal Govern ment that are dispensing goods and serv ices, up  to $250 billion of  taxpayers'  money.  He further told us that the agencies  themselves have not perceived their role  as being one  to  try  to prevent fraud  from happening at the start, trying to  discover fraud that is going on, or trying  to prosecute fraud after they find that  it is going on. He told us in this report  that most of the Federal agencies per ceive their role as one to carry out just  the program for which they are created;  in other words, to dispense the money or  goods or services that their program has  been created to carry out. They have not  seen their role as being one of trying to  prevent fraud or corruption from occur ring.  Without thi.s kind of thrust, Mr. Pres ident, I thir.k it will be imoossible for us  to have the taxpayers' confidence. I real lv th~nk what this report said is what  the peonle have been saying for a  long  time: There is too much fraud going on.  There is way  too much waste and in effici.ency and the people have known it.  Now this report by the General Account ing Office makes it very clear that it is  going on, that it is not just GSA, it is all  of the agencies of the Federal Govern ment. I think now the task is going to be  to see how we can change the thinking  of the managers of our agencies and how  we can put in the kind of devices that  will be necessary to prevent future scan dals such as we see going on  in GSA  today.  The chairman of the Government Af fairs Committee  <Mr.  RIBICOFF)  in structed me and our subcommittee  to  look into this and to hold hearings on  the GAO report. We intend to do that  as soon as we can determine what is the  best way to try to attack this problem.  We will be holding hearings in regard  to that.  I think a number of things are going  to have to be explored to try to deter mine what is the best way to see that the  agencies develop the mechanisms to set  the priorities to be able to try to prevent  fraud before it occurs, to look in those  areas where money could be ripped off  by  those people  that would  take ad vantage of programs, and to trv to put in  the kind of controls that would be nec essary to prevent that from happening,  then to detect fraud once it does occur  and  to  see we  speedily and properly  prosecute it, if it does occur.  I see that this is a  tremendous task,  but one in which the clock is running,  because if we do not do that, as the peo ple are  losing  their confidence  in our  ability  to manage  these programs,  I  think we will see more proposition 13's.  I think that is where the people are try ing  to speak out and say, ""We know  there is waste going on and fraud going  on, and we are willin~ to pay for services  to people that deserve those services, but  we do not want to pay for people who do  not deserve the services and we do not  want  to pay in areas where we  think  people are ripping off the Federal Gov ernment.""  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD at  this time a synopsis of the GAO report  that General Staats gave us today.  There being no objection, the material  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  FEDERAL AGENCIES CAN, AND SHOULD, DO MORE  To COMBAT  FRAUD  IN GOVERNMENT PaoGRAMS  Federal  economic  assistance  programs  amounting  to about $250 billion annually  are susceptible to fraud and related white collar crimes. No one knows the extent of  fraud against the Government, but Depart ment of Justice officials believe  it ranges  from 1 to 10 percent of the expenditures.  Federal  agencies  have  not  been  doing  enough to identify fraud in their programs,  and the Department of Justice has been slow  in assisting Federal agencies' antifraud ef",1978
379,,95,0.495,713,22,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President: our col lea~ue in the House, TOM RAILSBACK, is a  supporter on  the equal rights amend ment <ERA). However, he  is not only  concerned with passage of ERA but also  with maintaining  the  integrity of  the  process by which constitutional amend ments are proposed, debated, ratified, or  rejected. TOM  RAILSBACK's  regard  for  fairness led him to sponsor the attempt  amend House Joint Resolution 638  to  insure that States have the right to re consider earlier actions. In Represent ative RAILSBACK's words:  in  the House  of Representatives  to  It is undeniable that providing States with  the right to reconsider their earlier actions  could result in rescissions by some. I hope  that that does not occur. Nevertheless, this  is a risk which I feel we must take if we are  to assure  the American people  that  their  Constitution is not being unfairly altered.  The  importance of TOM RAILSBACK'S  entire views is great, so I  ask that his  ""Separate Views""  from House Report  95-1405 be printed in the RECORD.  The material follows:  the s:-re~e  SEPARATE VIEWS OF MR. RAILSBACK  Charles L. Black, Jr., Sterling professor of  law at Yale, stated before the House Judi ciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitu tional Rights, ""that  it would be  entirely ,  impermissible  to extend the time for rati fication without also extending the time for  rescission."" After close examination of the  law and policy surrounding the issues of ex tension and rescission, I find myself in agree ment with Professor Black's statement.  Without question, we are, by our actions  on House Joint Resolution 638, writing on  a blank page of constitutional law. We must  take care  to write  fairly and precisely so  that the image we create will not come back  to haunt us during the consideration of some  future constitutional amendment. Though I  have supported the equal rights amendment  in principle and practice since voting for it  in 1971, the issue of extending the time dead line for its ratification has implications far  beyond the merits of this, or any, amend ment. The extension resolution now pending  before the House of Representatives must be  judged in this light.  Extension of the deadline for ratification  of  the equal rights amendment has been  challenged on the grounds that it is uncon stitutional and that it is fundamentally un fair.  From my  read!ng  of  Court's decision in Coleman v. Miller, 307  U.S. 433 (1939), and the testimony of a num ber of constitutional scholars,  I  am con vinced that Congress' article V po~e-s in clude  the :power  to  increase  the  time for  consideration of this amendment. I cannot,  however, so readily dismiss the charge that  an extension  in the form provided by the  pending  resolution  is  fundamentally un fair. The New York Times, Washington Post,  Washington Star, Chicago Sun Times. Char lotte Observer, Baltimore Sun, New Republic,  and a host of other newspapers and maga zines have offered their editorial opposition  to the extension for j11St this re!l.son.  Providing an extended period of years for  ratification, but not for reconsideration by  those States having earlier ratified, smacks  of expedient rules-changing. To many Amer icans, such an action would suggest  that  Congress has decided to amend the Constitu tion by whatever means it finds necessary  and at whatever price. Despite the nobility  of  the ends sought by  the proponents of  the equal rights amendment, these ends do  not, in my opinion, justify the use of means  which give rise to t-he appearance of lm!)ro priety in the constitutional process. Use of  such means  can do  little more  th?n  to  reinforce  the resolve of  those who oppose  this amendment.  Because  I want  to see  the equal rights  amendment ratified, but cannot support the  extension proposal  in  its pres~nt form.  I  intend to offer an amendment on the House  floor similar to that which I offered in the  Judiciary Committee. My amendment would  simply provide  those States ratifying  the  equal rights amendment during the first 7year period with the right to reconsider that  a-::tion during the extension period. t  recog nize that such an amendment, as with the  extension resolution itself, would not bind  future Congresses, but it would serve as an  expression of how  this Congress believed  the rescission question should be  resolved  that determination must be  if a.nd when  made.  It  is  undeniable  that providing States  with the right to reconsider their earlier ac tions could result in rescissions by some. I  hope that that does not occur. Nevertheless,  this is a  risk which I  feel we must take if  we are to assure the American people that  their Constitution  is not being unfairly  altered.  In  addition  to  increasing  fundamental  fairness in the amending process, the limited  right of rescission which I will propose has  the ancillary benefit of buaranteeing  that  ratification of the equal rights amendment,  when  it occurs, will manifest the contem poraneous approval of the States, an implicit  requirement of article V according  to  the  Supreme Court's opinion in Dillon v. Gloss,  256 U.S. 368  (1920). The existence of con temporaneous approval must surely be  in  doubt where States are allowed to ratify for  more than 10 years, yet not once allowed to  reconsider a vote of approval. Only by rec ognizing a right of rescission during the ex tension period can we be certain that ratifi cation by 38 States means the equal rights  amendment continues to have the support  of the constitutionally required number of  States.  Those suggesting that a rescission amend ment is ""clearly unconstitutional"" have ap parently failed  to take note of statements  made by a number of constitutional experts  appearing before the Subcommittee on Civil  and Constitutional Rights. Professor Charles  Black,  in addition to expressing his belief  that a failure to provide for rescission dur ing any extension would be entirely imper missible, stated that, ""it is going to be very  har:i as a practical matter  for anyone  to  argue  in the future  that rescission  is not  available  to the States, although. Congress  has  in  effect  exercised  the  same  right.""  Though on policy grounds he did not favor  such action. Laurence Tribe, Professor of  Law at Harvard,  indicated his belief  that  Congress could provide a statutory right of  rescission and concluded  in his  testimony  that:  ""Congress should, after the passage of an  extended period, be willing to  treat as ef fective a State's attempted retraction of its  own prior ratification, as well as a State's  attempted retraction of its own prior rejec tion;  the quid pro quo for Congress' power  to alter  the  time  for  ratification  in such  cases should arguably be Congress' duty, ab sent extraordinary circumstances,  to  treat  as stale any State vote  (pro or con)  that  has many years  later been unambiguously  reversed. In this way, a State would be as sured that its vote on an amendment could  not bind the State's people into the indefi nite future     .  ""I say this with hesitation, as someone who  has supported the equal rights amendme.nt.  I don't relish the prospect of a reverse band wagon of rescissions, but the question here  is one of constitutional procedures and I am  obliged to testify accurately on that ques tion whether it cuts in favor of my substan tive views or against them. It seems to me it  is at least bizarre to construe the Constitu tion in such a way that the power of Con gress to extend, which it seems to me is sim ply a corollary of the inabllity of Congress  to bind its successors, somehow cuts for and  not against ratification of the amendment.  It seems to me it does cut both ways.""  Erwin Griswold, former Dean of Harvard  Law School and Solicitor General of  the  United States,  testified that he found, ""no  real basis for ... saying that once a State  has ratified, no matter how long a time has  passed,  it cannot rescind although once it  has rejected, it can always ratify thereafter.""  These statements a.re representative, but not  exhaustive, of the testimony of four out of  seven constitutional scholars appearing be fore  the subcommittee ln November. Theil  ",1978
380,House,95,-0.264,752,22,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to voice my  support  for H.R. 13097,  the Medicare  Amendments of 1978, and I also com mend the Ways and Means Committee  for the fine job they have done in devel oping this bill.  The Medicare Amendments of 1978  embody a principle that I have long sup ported. We have a very good health care  system in this country but in our Federal  programs, such as medicare, we have not  taken advantage of  the  full  range of  quality services provided by health pro fessionals. This bill goes to the heart of  that problem by making coverage under  medicare more rational.  For example, medicare coverage  for  chiropractic  services  is  limited under  current law to the manual manipulation  of the spine to correct a displacement  which can be demonstrated by X-ray.  The cost of the X-ray itself is not reim bursed by medicare, but the X-ray is re quired before other chiropractic services  may be provided.  This is a faulty policy in two respects.  But not reimbursing the cost of a man datory X-ray, the current program im poses a disincentive for chiropractic care.  Also, by requiring an X-ray that may not  be medically necessary, te patient could  be  exposed  to  needless  radiation.  It  makes little sense to me that we have  been requiring medicare patients to go  to other specialists or  through proce dures which may not be in their best in terest in order to be reimbursed for med ical care that can be provided in a sim pler and less expensive manner.  I sponsored a bill to change this policy,  and I am pleased that section 22 of H.R.  13097 follows the legislation I proposed.  It would provide reimbursement for the  cost of an X-ray if, indeed, an X-ray is  necessary. In addition, it would cover the  physical examination and treatment of a  displacement  found  through  normal  clinical procedures without a mandatory  X-ray.  I hope this important change will be  enacted into law as quickly as possible  and urge my colleagues to support H.R.  13097.    ",1978

We are talking here about a relative  handful of cases-only about 14 at the  present time-and if the cost of claims  against the insurance company in that  limited number of cases spread among  the whole pool of  those  insured  is so  spread, I cannot believe it can have a  substantial impact on the rates. We have  American citizens who are not protected  now and I hesitate to delay that needed  protection  for American citizens over  some contingency that may or may not  occur. We have a record of cases where  Americans have been injured and there  has been no reimbursement because of  diplomatic immunity. I  think it is time  to act.

Some little time ago I concluded that  while the act is far from perfect, it is  much better than no action at all and  should be supported.  Therefore, for several weeks  have  been prepared  to oppose recommitting  the act, action almost certain to result in  no act at all.  This senator has very  recently  re turned from a 10-day meeting of  the  International Parliamentary Union  in  Bonn, Germany. Parliamentarians from  72 nations were present including rep resentatives from the parliaments of the  industrialized  western  nations  with  whom the United States is usually closely  associated.  Although worldwide energy problems  were not among the several subjects of  formal deliberation and resolution at this  conference, the energy dimculties of the  United States  in particular, and  the  world generally, the perceived lack of a  U.S. policy on energy, our trade imbal ances, and the fall of the dollar, all be lieved to be related, were very frequent  topics of informal discussions, especially  among our allies  in the  industrialized  nations.  It became very clear to me, as a result  of su:::h discussions and conversations  with our allies and representatives at  Bonn that adoption of the Natural Gas  Policy Act on our past, even though far  from perfect, would be perceived as a  strong positive move on the part of the  United States  to establish a national  energy  policy.  I  believe  it  would  strengthen the dollar, and that belief is  shared by representatives of the Western  nations at Bonn, West Germany.  I suggest this as an additional reason  for voting against recommittal of  the  conference  report  this afternoon and  later voting for its adoption at the time  that question arises.

395,,95,-0.465,921,22,Mr. HATHAWAY.," Mr. President, the  intention of this amendment is to insure  that the new Department of Education  carries out the purpose of  the Career  Education Incentive Act consistent with  the structure envisioned by Congress in  enacting  that  legislation, which was  signed into law on December 13, 1977.  The amendment would  require  that  for the next 5 fiscal years the Office of  Career Education could not be discon tinued or consolidated unless  for any  year Congress  failed  appropriate  funds to carry out the purposes of that  act and unless  the conditions already  established in section 413 of the commit tee bill were complied with. Those con ditions allow discontinuation or altera tion of a number of statutorily created  offices if a period of 90 days has passed  after notification to the Senate Commit tee on Human Resources and the House  Committee on Education and Labor, in cluding a complete justification for the  rationale behind the reorganization.  This aspect of my amendment thus  provides for a  limited exception to the  reorganization provisions contained  in  the committee's bill. But, for reasons I  shall explain,  I believe  this exception  is vitally needed if Congress clearly ex pressed goals regarding career education  are to be fulfilled.

396,Senate,95,-0.247,973,22,Mr. RANDOLPH.," the chairman of  the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, are  designed to make specific that handicapped  individuals are covered by appropriate pro visiorui with respect to special consideration  and equal employment opportunity require ments.  Mr. President, the report to accompany S.  2883 asserts that ""since an taxpayers sup port public broadcasting,  it  is  imperative  that  service  to  unserved  or  underserved  populations be substantially increased"". In  this regard, the bill, as reported, includes as  a ""basic objective"" the involvement by and  increase of non-commercial, educational and  cultural radio and television service to mi norities and women. To accomplish this end,  the secretary of commerce is reauired to take  amrmative steps  to  inform minorities and  women of the availabUity of funds and the  localities where new public telecommunica tions  fac111ties  are needed and  to provide  such other assistance and  information as  may be appropriate. Further,  the secretary  is required to give special consideration to  applications which  increase minority and  women operation of, and participation  in,  public telecommunications entitles.  In addition, with respect to the approval  of applications for construction and plan ning grants,  the Secretary of Commerce  is  required to base determinations of whether  to approve an application, in part, on criteria  designed  to achieve  ""the development of  public  telecommunications  facilities operto minorities and  ated by and available  women"".  Mr. President,  the requirements for spe cial consideration, and  so forth, that I have  cited do not  include handicapped  individ uals among the covered groups. I  find this  apparent oversight unfortunate.  As  indicated recently by Stanley Fleish man, the counsel for the California Associa tion of the Physically Handicapped:  ''Television confers status on those indi viduals and groups it selects for placement  in the public eye, telllng the viewer who and  what  is  important  to know about,  think  about, and have feelings about"".  But,  as  emphasized by Mr. Fleishman,  with respect to fair treatment in television,  ""virtually no progress has been made on be half of people with handicaps"".  Mr. President, the place to start in order  that progress might be made is right here  with public broadcasting. As stressed in the  committee report, it is imperative that serv ice to unserved or underserved populatlons such as handicapped  individuals-be sub stantially increased.  The  proposed  amendment would  place  handicapped individuals on the same foot ing as minorities and women with respect  to steps to be taken to increase participa tion. Again I quote from the committee re port-""public broadcasting must be respon sive to the needs and interests of all seg ments of the population, especially  to  the  needs and interests of disadvantaged groups.""  Certainly, handicapped individuals comprise  one such group.  In addition to including handicapped in dividuals on equal footing with minorities  and women with respect to such special con sideration, the proposed amendment would  extend the bill's equal employment oppor tunity requirements to include handicapped  individuals.  Mr. President, recently, I  received from a  constitutent a letter with respect to a com plaint he had filed und~r section 504 of the  Rehab111tation Act of 1973 concerning dis crimination by a public broadcaster against  the deaf and hearing impaired.  In response, Frances Farmer, director of  the Intergovernmental Affairs Omce !or Civil  Rights. of the Department of Health, Edu cation, and Welfare, wrote that Congress re cently held hearings to determine what agen cy will  have  responsib111ty  for  enforcing  civil  rights provisions as part of  its con sideration of  the Public Broadcasting Fi nancing Act of 1978. She said:  ""Because the corporation for public broad casting receives Federal funds from several  sources  (including this department) and is  licensed  by  the Federal Communications  Commission,  there was disagreement about  which agency should have civil rights en forcement  responsib111ty .... I  regret  that  I am unable to provide specific information  about civil rights enforcement in public tele vision  broadcasting. We will  hold  your  complaint and contact you when the Con gress decides whi~h agency shall have en forcement responsibility.""  Unfortunately, with respect to complaints  based  on  handicap,  under  the  blll,  as  reported,  there would continue  to be dis agreement.  No protection is extended to handicapped  individuals and no determination is made as  t.o enforcement responsib111ty. The proposed  amendment would  remedy  this  failure  to  include  handicapped  individuals  among  those covered by the equal employment re quirements added by  the bill,  for which  H.E.W. is given enforcement responsibllities.  In  addition,  the  proposed  amendment  would make specific that, for  the purposes  of this act, handicapped individuals would  be defined as presently defined, for purposes  of Civil Rights programs, in the rehabilita tion act of 1973. This provision would assure  administrative  ease  and  avoid  confusion  caused by having different definitions.  In  sum, Mr.  President,  the  proposed  amendments make specific that, with respect  to equal employment opportunities, special  consideration requirements, and other Civil  Rights obligations handicapped individuals,  are included.

400,House,95,-0.506,1103,22,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speak er, I am only one of several Members of  the House who have taken an interest in  the subject of the development of rubber  from native American plants over the  years I would like to pay tribute to the  senior Member of the House who has had  that interest, the distinguished gentle man from Texas <Mr. POAGE) who has  been a proponent of this program for  many, many years.  My  interest in this  legislation stems  from a number of sources including a re port of the National Academy of Sciences  recommending a major program in this  area. The report is entitled, ""Guayule:  An Alternative Source of Natural Rub ber."" It was referred to during the course  of  the hearings, and  its recommenda tions are included in the bill before us.  But  I have here another document  from which I would like to quote very  briefly, which may be of interest to some  of the Members. It is entitled in this sec tion, ""Discussion of a Possible Connec tion of the United States Government  With the Guayule Industry."" It goes on  to state, ""it would appear that the Gov ernment might be  interested  in  en couraging the guayule  industry in the  United States in view of""-and it lists  about six or eight reasons. Then later on  occurs this quotation:  We are personally convinced that under  real encouragement the production of gua. yule rubber would develop rapidly into an  important industry in the United States.  I have said that many times, and many  other Members have said  that many  times. But I quote from a report issued in  1930 by a certain Maj. Dwight D. Eisen hower of  the U.S Army. That was 48  years ago. We made an abortive effort  to develop that guayule industry during  World War II, but we still have not fol lowed  through with  the recommenda tions made by Major Eisenhower 48 years  ago. I think today we may have the op portunity to remedy that defect by the  enactment of this legislation.  I am glad, therefore, on behalf of the  Science and Technology Committee, to  join my distinguished colleague on the  Committee on Agriculture in urging pas sage by  the House of H.R. 12559,  the  Native Latex Commercialization Act of  1978.  This bill, also known as the ""guayule  bill,"" would provide  for  a  long-range  program of  research and development  aimed at the commercialization of rubber  production based on the guayule plant.  The bill would authorize the sum of $55  million spread over a period of 4 years  to initiate this program. Under the pro visions of  the bill  the Department of  Agriculture would be given the respon sibility for carrying out this effort.  Latex or natural rubber is an essential  ingredient in a wide range of products  needed to keep our modern industrial so ciety operating. Today every pound of  new natural rubber which we use must  be imported. These imports amount an nually to well over half a billion dollars,  and all indications are that our need for  natural rubber will continue to grow.  Furthermore,  the manufacture  of  synthetic rubber, which is based chiefly  on petroleum, is also, with the price rises  for oil, contributing a growing share to  the imbalance of payments. As the need  to conserve  the world's petroleum  re sources  increases  it will be more and  more important to develop other sources  for petroluem products such as synthetic  rubber.  The production of natural rubber from  the guayule plant is not new. During the  Second World War the Forest Service  operated an extensive guayule program,  the ""Emergency Rubber Project,"" which  in 3 years produced 3 million pounds of  rubber. But at the end of the war the  availability of Malaysian rubber and the  expectation that synthetic rubber would  be available in near-unlimited quantities  led to the termination of this project.  The time is overdue for the resurrec tion of a domestic rubber industry. The  world demand for rubber is rising and so  the demand of American  industry.  Within another few years we can expect  to spend $1 billion annually on natural  rubber imports. If a successful domestic  rubber industry can be achieved, a grad ual but significant reduction in the need  for imports can be achieved.  In the process, we can create a new  source of employment in the Southwest ern States where guayule can be culti vated. During World War II, the emer gency  rubber project employed 10,000  people. The bill before us would authorize  grants to be made to Indian tribes. I ex pect  that when guayule production  is  proved  to be  a  commercially  feasible  source  of  rubber  Indians  and other  groups in the Southwest will find  it a  viable crop.  H.R. 12559 would authorize the Secre tary of Agriculture to carry out research  leading  to  the  commercialization  of  guayule rubber and to establish a Na tional Advisory Committee. The  au thority for the Secretary would include  the conduct and sponsorship of research,  the establishment of seed collections and  experimental plantings, the development  of harvesting and extraietion technology,  and the performance of economic studies.  The Secretary would also be authorized  to work with the States and other public  agencies and to cooperate with the Gov ernment of Mexico where  the guayule  plant also grows wild and where a signif icant  development  effort  already  is  underway.  Mr. Speaker,  this bill was  reported  unanimously by the Committee on Sciis  ence and Technology. I urge the Mem bers of the House to give it their support.  ",1978

I also would  like  to  include at this  point a letter I received from Dr. Ray mond A. Moore, director of experiment  station, South Dakota State University.  The letter is as follows:  too,  I,  SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,  Brookings, S. Dak., September 1, 1978.  Hon. JAMES ABDNOR,  House of Representatives, Longworth House  Office Building, Washington, D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN ABDNOR: Dean Dear born has shared with me your letter of Au gust 16 and a copy of the bill H.R. 12559  (Native  Latex Commercialization Act  of  1977). I convened the energy committee of  the Agricultural Experiment Station and we  went over the b111 rather carefully. This com mittee is very excited about the possib1lity  of producing energy from agricultural plants  and products. It does appear that the b111 1s  written  specifically  for  the  southwestern  part of tbe United States, with special em phasis on Guayule. We are quite certain that  that plant cannot be grown successfully in  South Dakota. We do have  latex bearing  plants that are commonly grown in South  Dakota; however the yield of latex is prob ably quite low. We are thinking quite specifi cally of the Euphorbia species. We would like  to see the b111 changed or expanded to in clude all latex bearing plants, not just those  which yield Parthenium latex. We also be lieve tbat the authority to carry out the re search and development program should be  within the Department of Agriculture rather  than Commerce.  Finally, we believe  that some emphasis  should be placed on by-product developtftent.  It might very well be that by-product uti lization wm be required to make energy pro duction economically feasible.  Even without  the changes  that we have  suggested we believe the b111 1s good and de serving of support. I personally believe that  some day agriculture wm be able  to  take  care of its own energy requirements and in  addition contribute much more to the energy  desires of our society. This b111  is a step in  that direction. We have several energy proj ects underway  in  the Agricultural Experi ment Station now and plan to initiate some  research  in  the area covered by  this b111  especially 1f it were broadened as we sug gested. We would  like  to expand this pro gram. We would also like to discuss this with  you  personally whenever  your  schedule  would allow.  Sincerely yours,  Director, Experiment Station.  R. A. MOORE,  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Moore is concerned  that the wording of the bill seems to in dicate a bias toward the southwestern  portion of the country. I am not suggest ing  it does at all, but he does  state  further that latex bearing plants which  grow in South Dakota are not mentioned.  Just as a point of clarification, is it  not the intent of the committee that all  latex bearing plants are potentially sub ject to research under this bill and that  institutions, such as South Dakota State  University, may receive grant assistance  to conduct such research?

408,,95,-0.387,1259,22,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, I join  with Senators STAFFORD and RANDOLPH  in an amendment to make specific the  role of the Architectural Barriers Trans portation and Compliance Board with  respect  to  litigation authority. As  re ported,  among other  things, S.  2600  would have amended section 502 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973  to  include  among the designated functions of the  Board the authority to ""sue and be sued""  in its own name and be represented by  its own legal counsel in all Federal, State,  and local courts. In addition, as reported,  the committee bill would authorize the  Executive Director, at the direction of  the Board, to bring a civil action to en force, in whole or in part, any final order  of  the Board  issued pursuant  to  the  Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 or of  standards prescribed pursuant thereto.  Mr. President, since the time the Com mittee on Human Resources considered  S. 2600, however, concern has been ex pressed that the mandate of the Board  could  .be  better  accomplished  with  changes in the statutory language de signed to enable the Board to utilize, to  the maximum extent feasible, as appli cable, the resources of the Justice De partment. Thus, the amendment we of f er today would strike the ""sue and be  sued"" provision, retain the authority for  the Executive Director, at the direction  of the Board, to bring a civil action in  the appropriate U.S. district court  enforce, in whole or in part, any final  orders of the Board and to represent the  Board on appeal before the appropriate  Federal court of appeals, and authorize  the Executive Director, at the direction  of the Board, to intervene, appear, par ticipate, or to appear as amicus curiae,  in any court of the United States or in  any court of a State in any civil action  which relates to section 502 of the Re habilitation Act of 1973 or to the Ar chitectural Barriers Act of 1968.  In addition, in the place of the ""sue  and be sued"" authority, the amendment  we offer would provide that, except as  provided in section 518(a)  of  title 28,  United States Code-relating to litiga tion  before  the Supreme Court--the  Executive Director may appear for and  represent the Board in any civil litiga tion with respect to the Board's responsi bilities under section 502.

409,,95,-0.344,1311,22,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. President,  the  Senate recently approved a bill to revise  and  extend  the programs  authorized  under the Comprehensive Fmployment  and Training Act of 1973 <CETA). Dur ing consideration of this legislation, both  in the Human Resources Committee and  in the Senate, great care was exercised to  insure that misuse of Federal funds and  abuses in the CETA programs would be  eliminated.  The House and Senate bills both con tain  new  prov1s1ons  that  would  strengthen the authority of the Secre tary of Labor  to  investigate and take  action against program abuses. Provi sions that establish strict new guidelines  for audits, investigations, and program  management would hold local program  operators accountable to aide by CETA  regulations  regarding acceptable program activity and proper handling of  funds.  The Secretary would be  required  to  issue regulations to control abuses such  as political activities, nepotism, kick backs, the use of CETA funds for lobby ing, and expenditures for activities out side those specified in the act. The Sec retary would have authority to subpena  records and witnesses for investigations.  New provisions would require bonding of  persons who manage CET A  funds  to  recover any Federal money that may be  lost through fraud.  In  addition  to  criminal  sanctions  against  embezzlement  and misuse  of  funds  in current law, a new provision  was added making it a criminal offense to  obstruct a CETA investigation. Also, the  Secretary would have the authority to  terminate any program found in viola tion of the act.  The House and Senate bills also would  establish a new Office of Management  Assistance in the Department of Labor  to provide the resources and guidance  needed by local program administrators  for effective program operation.  The combined effect of these new pro visions would give  the Department of  Labor and the prime sponsors the re sources they need to protect the integrity  of CET A programs.  Although this legislation has not yet  been enacted into law, the Department of  Labor has expanded its audit and inves tigation activity. The Secretary of Labor,  Ray Marshall, established a new Special  Office of Investigations charged with re porting directly to him on a regular basis  on irregularities in program operation.  Ernest Green, Assistant Secretary of  Labor  for Employment and Training,  drew a clear picture in his testimony be fore the House Government Operations  Subcommittee on Manpower and Hous ing  to highlight  the  important safe guards built into the new CETA legisla tion, and the steps already undertaken  by the Department of Labor to eliminate  abuses under CETA programs.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of his  statement be printed in the RECORD.  The statement follows:  STATEMENT OF ERNEST G. GREEN  Madam Chairwoman and Members of the  Subcommittee:  I am pleased to appear before you today  to discuss  the Comprehensive Employment  and Training Act and to answer the specific  questions concerning CET A that were raised  in your  letter of  invitation.  I will address  those questions  that are within ETA's re sponsibility; Mr. DeMarco, Director of  the  Office of Special Investigations, in his state ment will address those that affect his office.  As you know, the CETA legislation expires  at the end of  the current fiscal year and  bills  to reauthorize it are now pending in  both Hcuses of the Congress. While the final  outcome of the CETA reauthorization is un certain at this time, we should keep in mind  that the Administration proposed, and the  House Senate  committees  adopted, many  changes in the current law strengthening the  Secretary's authority  to manage  the CETA  program.  I would now  like  to turn to the specific  questions raised in your letter of invitation.  IMPROVING  'IHE DEPARTMENT'S MONITORING  SYSTEM  I am pleased that the Subcommittee has  requested that I address how the Department  can improve its monitoring system in order  to further prevent, detect and correct abuses  in implementing the CETA legislation. This  question  is one  to which both the Secre tary and  I have personally given a  lot of  consideration  and  as  a  result many new  actions have been taken.  Over $28 billion has been allocated under  CETA since  its  inception.  I  am confident  that most of these funds have been spent  appropriately and that most CETA programs  are administered efficiently with both pro gram and fi~cal integrity. I  further believe,  based en our  review of specific programs,  that the actual level of fraud and misuse of  funds is extremely low.  The Secretary has stated  that fraud  in  the CET A program is less than one percent.  This estimate  is based on our experience  under audits of CETA programs and  the  evidence that we have garnered in our moni toring of the programs.  The Department has  increased  its CETA  audit activities. These audits, conducted in  accordance with accepted accounting stand ards, focus and follow through on any costs  that have been questioned until such time  as the Department is satisfied with the fiscal  integrity cf  the program. Audits over  the  last four years have identified about 67 mil licn dollars in what we technically call ""ques tionable costs."" I want to emphasize that the  term  ""questionable costs""  is not  synony mous with misuse of funds or with fraud.  Cos.ts can be questioned for a variety of rea rnns. Perhaps, the program participant was  a month too young for the program, or had  been unemployed 29 rather than 30 days, etc.  The costs may also be questioned because  the prime sponscr's books were unavailable  during the time that the auditor wished to  examine  them, or  the accounting was not  entirely current, or there appeared to be a  bookkeeping error or the like.  We are in the process of examining the  67 million dollars  in questioned costs  in  detail. A decision will be reached with re spect  to whether  each  questioned  cost  should be allowed or disallowed. Costs are  disallowed for many reasons. These may in clude substitution of CETA workers, pollt ical activities  in  the conduct of  the pro gram,  technical  ineligibility  of  CETA  participants, and other nonfraudulent vio lations of the statute and regulations.  We are aware that there has been misuse  of funds in some CET A programs. The De partment has taken rapid steps to correct  these abuses as we identify them or as they  are called to our attention. I do not want  to  leave  the  impression  that any  level of  abuse of funds is acceptable. Where we have  found proven cases of abuse we have moved  rapidly to terminate financial assistance or  take other appropriate action.  This Administration's immediate concern  when it came into office was to help the un employed as quickly as possible. The De partment devoted its full resources to that  effort. We know  that  the structural and  countercyclical  training and public service  employment programs in CETA have made  a contribution  to the improvement of the  American workers' immediate and long term  prospects  for  employment. Since we  took  office  the unemployment rate has dropped  from 7.4 percent  to 6.2 percent.  As  I  stated, we  recognize  that  further  improvements  in  the monitoring of CETA  are necessary. We are continuously under taking  these  needed  actions  administra tively. We  have  also  proposed  legislative  changes  to  further strengthen  the Secre tary's authority to manage the program.  The Administration's legislation  for  the  reauthorization of CETA, forwarded to Con gress earlier this year, contained a number  of amendments which would  increase  the  Department's ability to investigate and take  action against abuses and to establish stand ards  to eliminate further abuses. The Ad ministration's proposals, which have been  incorporated into both the House and Senate  ",1978
410,House,95,-0.246,1337,22,Mr. HOLLAND.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank my colleague for yielding and I  rise, somewhat reluctantly. I heard the  gentleman say that there is a great pub lic cynicism about  the Congress. I do  not know the basis of or the origin for  the statistics, or where  those  allega tions have come from. We have just gone  through a rather difticult period of the  reelection process in which, again,  the  vast majority of  the Members of  the  Congress were  reelected, which  rebuts  completely any statemen'; that there is a  public cynicism of the Members of the  Congress because if it was that bad, they  would all have been turned out in the  recent primary elections.  Second, I admire the gentleman's pur pose, but I do not think we can create  an impression in the public's mind that  this is an institution of purity and right eous people by passing this law. I think  we, individually, have a duty to behave  in an acceptable fashion  to show  the  public that we are ethical. So I am a  little bit concerned that we are creat"""".  ing a  law here that is going to make  more headlines as Members make an  error here and there. That it is going to  dri1e people away from even  thinking  about running for Congress. Following  the Watergate era, I am told, there were  speeches being made by  the members  of the Committee on the Judiciary all  around the country to describe Water gate and  its  ramifications.  I am  told  there were honoraria paij  for  those  speeches, so that the Members derived  some personal income from that unfor tunate experience. But the public, I be lieve, derived a far greater benefit froJll  that type of exposure. And I suppose the  day will come where the next big problem  occurs and it will again bring about the  participation of the Members and an other demand around  the country for  more speeches and more honoraria.  So I do not think the Members should  be deprived of that privilege by earn i:ngs limitation.  ",1978

412,House,95,0.353,1350,22,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words,  and I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, the provision in this  bill requiring the same reporting of Mem bers of Congress for candidates for Con gress  troubles me deeply. We already  have a myriad of reporting requirements  made by the Federal Elections Commis sion under the Federal Election Act.  These requirements pose difficulty for  challengers who are  less sophisticated  than many Members who  are better  equipped to handle these reporting re quirements. I  think the additional re porting for candidates required by this  act goes well beyond reason and will un doubtedly add  to  the burden  that  is  already occasioned by the FECA require ments on candidates.  It is becoming more and more difficult  to recruit able people to want to serve  in  this body. And  the more reporting  that we require of candidates, the less  anxious  they are going  to be  in  the  future. There may be plenty of candi dates for the Congress, but the total possible universe of candidates will un doubtedly be reduced.  It has already been pointed out that  if  there  is  a  compelling  reason  for  financial disclosure for Members of Con gress, it is because that person occupies  a position of public trust. Obviously, a  challenger occupies no position of trust.  There is no reason to require disclosure  of that challenger. There is no conflict  of  interest, either real or hypothetical,  until a person does become eligible  to  vote.  The gentleman from California has  properly described  this feature of  the  bill as a ""misery loves company"" provi sion. Because we are obliged to fill out  all of  these onerous  reports,  therefore  we are going to fix all of the guys who  are running against us. They will have  to fill them out too. We are simply plac ing an additional burden upon a group  of persons to comply with this onerous  and unnecessary reporting.  Since this bill has no criminal penal ties,  the practical effect is  that candi dates are not going to report unless they  have a good chance of winning.  So, the law will simply apply to some  of us, but not all of us, who seek office.  Those who are frivolous candidates or  candidates with little chance of winning  will probably not file these reports any way since there is no criminal penalty.  Mr. Chairman, in my  judgment this  is make-work for the Clerk of the House  and for the Ethics Committee. It is an  attempt to justify an extra load we put  on ourselves by  laying it on somebody  else.  It is unworthy of the purposes of the  ethics resolution that we passed in the  House. It is unworthy of the House, and  it is unworthy of this bill. I hope the  amendment offered by  the gentleman  from California will be adopted.  ",1978
413,House,95,-0.162,1350,22,Mr. PIKE.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike  the  requisite number of words,  and I  rise in opposition to the amend ment.  Mr. Chairman,  this troubles me be cause, really, until now in the debate I  have agreed wholly with what the gen tleman from California has said, and  tended to disagree witl: what the gentle man from North Carolina has said.  agree wholly with the gentleman from  California when he says that what we  are doing here is an act of political voy eurism, but when he says that we are  only going to allow the voyeurs to ex amine one side, this troubles me. I think  that the voyeurs in the press and in the  media generally should have the same  rights-and of course this may be my  new career rather than my old career  creeping into the fore here-but I can not accept anything which is going to  allow either Members of Congress or  candidates  to cover up their financial  situation.  Therefore,  do  think that the voy eurism should apply with regard to both  the  sitting Members  and  those who  would  take  their places.  oppose  the  gentleman's amendment.  ",1978

With these two-year cycles  of survival, I must keep my options open.  We may get together soon.  I remain,  Sincerely,  JAMES D.

RICHARD NOLAN  OF MINNESOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 19, 1978   ",1978
416,,95,-0.313,1441,22,Mr. COTTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  been  in contact with  the Knights of  Columbus who are concerned that they  may be adversely affected by section  501 (~) of  the Internal Revenue Code  which prohibits a tax exempt status for  organizations which discriminate on the  basis of  religion. This  situation was  clearly not intended when the law was  enacted, and I am introducing legisla tion to correct it.  The Knights of Columbus are exempt  from Federal income tax law under sec tion 501 (c) (8) of the Internal Revenue  Code. Because subordinate lodges of the  Knights are unincorporated, those which  desire to hold title to real property must  form  an  affiliated  corporation. Some  2,000 of these affiliated corporations are  exempt from the Federal income tax law  under section 50l<c) (7) of the Code as  ""social clubs.""  However, section 50l<g) of the Code  which was added in 1976 may prohibit a  tax exempt status for social clubs which  provide for discrimination against any  person on the basis of religion.  It is clear that this is not what Con gress had in mind when this provision  was enacted. During committee hearings  on section 501 (g) the case of the Knights  of Columbus was brought up  several  times. It was indicated at this time that  since the Knights of Columbus were a  fraternal society and not a  social club,  they would have no problems under this  section. Information regarding potential  CXXIV--1919-Part 22  to  conflicts  resulting  from  the  existing  status of  these affiliated  corporations  unfortunately was not made available at  that time.  In order  be  a member of  the  Knights of Columbus, and therefore a  member of one of these affiliated corpo rations, an individual must be a practic ing Catholic. Organizations which dis criminate by providing that only mem bers of a particular religion may  join  was not the type of discrimination envi sioned by section 501 (g). Rather,  this  section was  aimed  at  organizations  whose composition was not religiously  centered, who  had  several  religions  represented among its members, but who  refused membership to someone simply  because they were a member of a partic ular religion.  The legislation which I am introduc ing would  correct  this  situation  by  exempting affiliated corporations of an  association from the Federal income tax  under section 501 (c) (8)  of  the Code.  This would merely create a  situation  which was thought to exist during com mittee hearings.  Mr. Speaker, I have asked the Depart ment of the Treasury for its comments  on this legislation, and am including at  this point in the RECORD a letter received  from Mr. John M. Murphy, Esq., of the  Knights of Columbus soliciting my help  for these changes.  KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS,  New Haven, Conn., September 6, 1978.  Re Legislative Definition of Lodge System  Internal Revenue Code Section 501 (c)  (8).  Hon. WILLIAM R. COTTER, M.C.,  Room 2338, Rayburn Building,  U.S. House of Representatives,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR BROTHER COTTER: This letter and its  enclosures come to enlist your aid in behalf  of  the Knights of Columbus on  the above  subject.  As you know,  the Knights of Columbus  and all of its state and subordinate councils  throughout  the country are exempt  from  federal income tax under Section 501 ( c) (8)  of the Internal Revenue Code.  Bee a use our local councils are regarded as  unincorporated associations, we have over  the years suggested  that any  local council  wishing to acquire real estate for a council  home or club form a corporation which can  take title to the property for the benefit of  the members. We have also suggested that  they i::eek tax exempt status for those ""home  corporations"" under Section 501(c) (7) of the  Code.  You may  recall  that in 1976 P.L. 94-568  was enacted and included a Section 501 (g)  prohibiting discrimination  on grounds of  religious belief by certain social clubs, such  as our so-called ""home corporations."" The  problem which this change in the law created  for our home corporations is summarized in  the enclosed copy of a February 24, 1978 let ter  from Congressman Waggonner  to  the  Chief Counsel of Jnternal Revenue Service.  Mr. Waggonner points out that the kind of  ""religious discrimination"" which Knights of  Columbus exercises  in  its membership  re a,,irements was not the kind of discrimina tion  Section  501 (g)  was  intended  to  proscribe.  Mr. William J. Lehrfeld, a Washington tax  attorney and a member of  the Order, has  been engaged by us to seek a change in Sec tion 501 ( c) ( 8) of the Internal Revenue Code  so  that our home corporations can qualify  for tax exemption under that section rather  than under Section 501 ( c) ( 7) . If we can ef30529  feet this change in the law, we will then in struct all of our local councils throughout  the country  to  seek  exemption  for  their  home corporations under Section 501 (c) (8).  I enclose a recent letter from Bill Lehrfeld  with a copy of the suggested amendment and  an  explanation.  I  also  respectfully-and  earnestly-ask your help  in obtaining  this  change in the law, which will be gen11ine1y  appreciated by all our members and will have  no adverse effect on tax revenue.  Would you be in touch with Bill Lehrfeld  (his number is 785-9500)? I would be happy  to meet with you at any time or place, in  Washington  or Hartford, which  you  can  conveniently manage to discuss this impor tant request.  All best wishes.  Fraternally yours,  JOHN M. MURPHY,  Supreme Advocate.e  A COMPILATION OF ACTION,  IN VOLVEMENT, AND COMMITMENT  TO  ISRAEL AND SOVIET JEWRY  HON. RICHARD L.
