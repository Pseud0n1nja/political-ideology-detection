0,,106,-0.402,1,2000-01-24,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, the reports that the House is returning to work today are inaccurate. This House will complete month one of the new millennium with no action either on this floor or in committee on any of the major  issues  that  this  country faces. Nothing on education, nothing on Social Security, nothing on the environment,  nothing  on  tax  reform, nothing on health care or prescription drugs for seniors. There is some question as to whether this House will even vote on the trivial matters that usually occupy its time any time during the month of January. With an abbreviated year and the opportunity for meaningful action largely ending in July, I think this is unfortunate.

8,,106,0.287,8,2000-01-24,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President,  last week the Department of Defense conducted its most recent flight test of our National Missile Defense system. A great deal has been said and written about this test in the last few days— much of it erroneous—and I think it is important that we draw the correct conclusions about what this test does and does not mean. The test conducted last week was one of a series of 18 scheduled flight tests of the National Missile Defense system, and only the second to actually attempt to intercept a strategic ballistic missile by colliding with it in space. The first test this past October was primarily a test of the vehicle that actually  hits  the  target missile. Last week’s  test was  significantly more complicated and  involved additional, newly developed elements of the National Missile Defense system, such as the ground-based radar and the Battle Management Command, Control and Communications system. In fact, a senior Defense Department official told reporters before the test that the battle management system is: ‘‘the most difficult and sophisticated part of this entire program.’’ The latest test began with the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base  in California. After  its  rocket  engine burned out, the target missile deployed both a mock warhead and a balloon decoy intended to try to fool the interceptor missile. The missile was tracked by satellites and by the National Missile  Defense  system’s  ground-based radar at Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and  the  interceptor missile was launched to meet the target. It sighted the target missile and then closed on it. While the interceptor did not hit the target warhead, it appeared that all of the systems tested functioned properly until the  final six seconds of these, when the infrared sensors on the interceptor vehicle did not operate correctly—as they had in the October test. While the failure to hit the target is disappointing, it is hardly justification for all the negative comments I have heard about last week’s test. It’s important to remember that a test program involves the testing of weapon systems to see if they perform as they were designed. The purpose of this test program is to uncover problems and correct them. If  it were possible to take a design straight from the drawing board to the field, we wouldn’t need testing programs. We test because we expect to  find problems and try to solve them. What’s  remarkable about  the National Missile Defense testing is not that the intercept vehicle missed on the second test but that it succeeded on the first one. Many newly introduced elements had to work right on this most recent test even to achieve a near miss, and the really significant news on this test is that all of the new elements which added complexity to the  challenge  seemed  to have  performed very well; the only thing that apparently didn’t work properly was the one element which was already proven to work in the October flight. Some of the critics of missile defense have said this test was a major setback for the program. It was not. In fact, it demonstrated  significant progress  in the development of a workable and reliable National Missile Defense capability. The October flight was primarily a test of the intercept vehicle and its ability to identify a target in space, discriminate between the warhead and a decoy, and collide with the warhead. It did exactly what it was designed to do, but critics of the program claimed that had the decoy not attracted the intercept vehicle’s attention, it never would have detected the warhead. They argued that the system can not work when there are decoys, and only did work because there was a decoy. As ridiculous as that sounds, it has been echoed by those who have long opposed missile defense in any form. An editorial  in  the New York Times claimed that the October success was ‘‘lucky’’ and occurred ‘‘almost by accident.’’ Now wait a minute and think about  this. When  two objects—each about the size of a chair, launched 4300 miles apart and traveling at a combined speed of 15,000 miles an hour— collide  in the vastness of space 140 miles above the Earth’s surface, that’s not an accident. That’s a demonstration of some very capable technology and engineering. Clearly, for some, no amount of evidence will be convincing. But repeating something that’s wrong doesn’t make it right. Predictably, some are urging the National Missile Defense  program  be slowed down or even shelved  in the wake of last week’s test. For some critics, delay or cancellation is always the right course of action when it comes to missile defense. Others suggest abandoning this program for another approach using different basing modes, but that will only delay the National Missile Defense deployment we need now. Still others believe the administration’s assessment of technological readiness should be delayed in order to remove the decision from presidential politics. This, too, would be a mistake. We have a National Missile Defense program because we have a growing vulnerability to the threat of ballistic missile attack. That threat will not wait for us to conduct a test program with perfect results, something that has never happened with any weapon system. Delay in deploying a defense against these missiles only serves the interests of our adversaries. This threat is growing. We must all remember that this program is not just an  academic  exercise.  The  Senate passed  the National Missile Defense Act last spring; in September the Intelligence Community released a new National Intelligence Estimate of the ballistic missile threat which, according to  its unclassified  summary,  judges that  some  rogue  states may  have ICBMs much sooner than previously thought, and that those missiles will be more sophisticated than previously estimated. In just the past few weeks, British authorities intercepted components bound for Libya for missiles with three times the range of Tripoli’s current arsenal. According to news reports from last week, the Director of Central Intelligence cannot rule out that Iran may already be able to build a nuclear weapon. And this past weekend, North Korea said it was reconsidering its declaration to refrain from any more longrange missile tests, though of course a moratorium on flight testing, however long, does not mean that North Korea isn’t making progress on its missile development programs. While the threat continues to intensify, we’ve already had too much delay in deploying a missile defense system. In fact, we are behind today precisely because those who counsel delay have long had their way, not because of any inherent problems with the technology. What’s required now is that we stay the course we set for ourselves when we passed  the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. That act makes it the policy of the United States to deploy a National Missile Defense  system as soon as technologically possible. With the successful test in October and last week’s  test  incorporating additional elements of the National Missile Defense system, the talented men and women of our armed forces and industry have demonstrated that this system  is technologically possible. The test program is in its early stages and much can and will be done to refine the system between now and the start of missile production. But  there  is no question that this technology is not just within our reach but is actually in our grasp now. I congratulate the Defense Department for the extraordinary technical accomplishments  it has achieved  so far, and urge it to continue to work to improve this important program. ",2000

10,,106,0.39,15,2000-01-24,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, I am reminded each time I look to the sky of the reach Americans have made to the heavens. I am extremely proud that every manned  spaceflight  since  the Apollo program has been powered by engines tested at a facility in my home State of Mississippi, the John C. Stennis Space Center. There, a dedicated group of professionals  labors  largely unheralded to ensure the performance and safety of the engines that propel our astronauts into space. Although I have known many of these outstanding Mississippians in my years in Congress, I only recently had the opportunity to work closely with one of these professionals. The leadership at NASA decided to offer a legislative fellowship to Congress to one of NASA Stennis’ rising stars, Mr. Patrick Scheuermann. Patrick arrived on Capitol Hill  in January, 1999, at the beginning of a very busy opening session of the 106th Congress.  Although many  thought other  proceedings  that  opened  the 106th would  supercede  a  legislative agenda,  the Senate professional and personal staffs ensured that,  in the background, the business of Congress stayed in motion. Patrick cut his teeth in the difficult staff preparations for the legislative cycle that would take place around the issues that dominated the Senate floor. An effort was underway at NASA to reinvigorate manned space flight and to reduce the cost of getting to space. Patrick was assigned to research and report on these initiatives and to keep my legislative staff briefed on their status through the Authorization and Appropriations process. Patrick approached his assignment with the interest of someone who not only enjoys what he does, but with the infectious enthusiasm that brings others onboard as well. My staff quickly became knowledgeable of  the many NASA programs that together form our Nation’s efforts to reach space. I found more and more space related meetings on the calendar. As the Session progressed, the Senate led the charge to complete the first NASA Authorization Bill in many years. One hundred million dollars was added to the NASA budget to develop third generation reusable  launch vehicle  technology, a program known as Spaceliner 100. Patrick’s ability to explain the facets of NASA’s programs to legislative staffers and his vigilance as changes developed ensured the ultimate success of these endeavors. His detailed understanding of Stennis Space Center’s capabilities and assets also proved to be of great value in assessing the facility’s potential for commercial activities. Patrick has a long history with the Space  Program. After  earning  his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Orleans, he made his first foray into the world of Rocket Science as a contract  test  engineer,  testing  Space Shuttle Main Engines at the Stennis Space Center. This brought him across the ‘‘Great Divide’’ that is the Pearl River and firmly onto Mississippi soil where the NASA hierarchy recognized and recruited the talented young engineer. Although our neighbors across the Pearl claim Patrick as a native son, Mississippians have adopted him for his hard work and strength of character. He also made the grade through his success in attracting one of Greater Picayune’s finest, Miss Sarah Melissa Lee to be his bride. Together they have added  to Mississippi’s  fame  through their beautiful children, Chandler and Christina. Although I am sorry to lose the talent and expertise that Patrick brought to my staff, I am pleased that his return to the Stennis Space Center foretells many more years of innovation and success at this vital national treasure. f COMU.S. TRIBUTE  TO  LIEUTENANT  MANDER  JOHN  DIMENTO,  NAVY ",2000
11,,106,-0.303,15,2000-01-24,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President,  last spring I joined my colleagues in honoring President Lyndon Baines Johnson when we hung a portrait of our former president on the one blank wall left in the President’s Room in our nation’s capitol. As I noted at that time, I could think of no other president or American who was as deserving of this honor as LBJ. As the Senate Majority Leader and President, LBJ was a man of immense skill, dedication and compassion. He is remembered by most Americans as a great leader whose strength of personality helped him preside over an extremely productive Senate  that  expanded Social Security, created  the Interstate Highway system, and passed one of the most important civil rights laws of the 20th Century. Less well known, however, is LBJ’s tremendous ability to compromise. He truly believed in the message of his favorite Bible verse: ‘‘Come, let us reason together.’’ Our nation and our government needs more men and women who share this powerful belief. Today, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues and all Americans another aspect of LBJ’s  legacy that too often has been overlooked—his work  to  bring  justice  to  disenVerDate 04-JAN-2000 05:27 Jan 25, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24JA6.007 pfrm11 PsN: S24PT1 ",2000
12,,106,0.505,2,2000-01-31,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, all the Presidential Republican candidates  and  Democrats  are  campaigning today for the Nation’s first elections tomorrow.  I would  like to talk, Mr. Speaker, about what is happening with our national debt. The public debt of the United States that technically every citizen now or our kids and our grandkids eventually are going to have to pay off. Mr. Speaker,  I hope every one of those candidates realizes that this talk about paying down the public debt is somewhat  of  an untruthful  presentation of what is happening with the public debt of this country. The way we do our bookkeeping here in Washington is sometimes confusing and unquestionably very complicated. But what we have right now is a public debt, as defined in law of $5.72 trillion, $5.72 trillion, approaching $6 trillion. We made some good decisions this past year to not spend any of the Social Security surplus for other government spending. Excellent start. Excellent beginning. But still, our total national debt continues to increase. Why is the total debt of this country continuing to  increase as we brag, and that  is Republicans, Democrats, the President, brag that we are balancing the budget and paying down the Federal debt? Here is why. We have about 112 trust funds. The largest, of course, is the Social Security Trust Fund. But we are borrowing from all of these other trust funds also. The Civil Service Retirement Trust Fund, the Highway Trust Fund, the Airport  Trust  Fund,  the Medicare Trust Fund. From all of these trust funds we are taking the extra money, because we have charged additional taxes more and above what is needed in any particular one year of spending. Now, we are using that money for other government spending. I am  introducing  legislation  that says let us lower the total debt subject to the debt limit that Congress has to pass and the President has to sign. Let us lower that debt to where it will be at the end of this fiscal year next October 1, and then let us stick to it. Let us make sure that we have the kind of freeze that is going to take the burden off of our kids and our grandkids so that they are not going to end up having to pay for what we consider is very important spending this year. Mr. Speaker, I am a senior member of the Committee on the Budget. This week we are holding what are called listening sessions, talking about what the Members are willing to do in terms of holding the line on spending. I am a very strong advocate, and I will encourage at our meetings tomorrow, this week and next week, that we have spending caps  for the kind of spending discipline that it allows us. We have come a long ways. When I first came to Congress in 1993, the projected deficit, in addition to what we were borrowing from Social Security, was over $200 billion a year. Now, at least, we have balanced the budget in terms of Social Security spending, and that is the largest amount. There will be approximately $120 billion or $130 billion more money coming in from Social Security taxes than we need in any one year, so somehow we should be starting to talk about how do we reduce that burden on working men and women of America; and how do we save Social Security in the long run? It is a huge challenge. We talk about millions and billions and trillions. But, Mr. Speaker, if anybody can conceive what a trillion dollars is, let me just give what is going to be required to pay out Social Security benefits over the next 75 years over and above what we are going to collect in Social Security taxes. Over and above what we are going to collect in Social Security taxes over the next 75 years, it is going to take $120 trillion more money. That has got to either come  from  increased borrowing, increased taxes, because I suspect the way we have been going in Congress it is not going to be coming from reduced spending in other areas. There are huge challenges before us. Mr. Speaker, I am a farmer. What we do on the farm is we try to pay off the farm so that our kids do not have to pay off that mortgage. In this country we are continuing to increase the debt to give a bigger mortgage to our kids and our grandkids. Let us turn that around. Let us have the presidential candidates start talking about the seriousness of saving Medicare and saving Social Security and paying down this huge public debt that  is  facing this country.

17,,106,0.288,23,2000-01-31,Mr. WELLER.," Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. GUTKNECHT) for his leadership and for his participation tonight in explaining the marriage tax penalty, what it is and why it is wrong and what we are going to do about it. I look back, in listening to my colleague’s  comments,  to  5 years ago when he and I were elected as part of the Class of 1994; and if we think about it back then, think of the issues that were facing us. Congress and the President had just imposed the biggest tax increase in the history of this country on the American people, putting the tax burden at the highest level it had ever been  in peacetime history. The Federal Government was  looking at $200 billion to $300 billion  in deficit spending  for  the  foreseeable  future. More children were living in poverty than ever before. There was a rogue IRS running amuck amongst families and small business. We brought about some fundamental changes during the last 5 years. We balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years. We cut taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years. And in the State I represent, in Illinois, 3 million  Illinois children now benefit from that $500-per-child tax credit that was part of our middle-class tax relief. Remember all those times we were told time and time again that it was radical, it was crazy, how can you balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time? ",2000
18,,106,0.552,23,2000-01-31,Mr. GUTKNECHT.," Mr. Speaker,  if the gentleman would continue to yield, I think the comment was that, if you go ahead with these reckless tax cuts, lowering capital gains tax rates, remember, we were going to lower the top capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent. That represents a 30-percent cut. And some of our colleagues on the left said, well, you are going to blow a hole in the budget. I wonder how many times we heard that expression. Well, the interesting thing is we lowered the capital gains tax rate, and we have actually seen more revenue coming into the Federal Government. As more people convert assets that are not producing the way they want to into other assets, they recognize that gain, they pay the taxes. When you increase economic activity, you  increase revenue to the Federal Government. When you allow people to keep more of their own money, revenue to the Federal Government  goes  up  because  they spend that money, and it gets recycled through the private economy. Here again  is one classic example. This marriage penalty is the next big log that is going to fall. And this will be a tremendous victory. I was surprised to learn, 28 million American couples paying a penalty of an average of $1,400. We have made tremendous progress. There is still a lot to be done, but we are not going to give up with just this. This will be the next step. As we go forward, I think more and more Americans will see that this will benefit not only a lot of working families but it will benefit the economy as well. ",2000
19,,106,0.495,23,2000-01-31,Mr. GOODLATTE.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. I especially want to thank and congratulate him for his effort in this matter. I know that he has  introduced, along with the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH) and the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Ms. DANNER), a Democrat, H.R. 6 to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of that legislation along with the gentleman from Minnesota and many others because it is long overdue. As has already been noted, we attempted to do that in the tax package that we passed last year that was unfortunately vetoed by the President. This time we are going to go back, put it right on the line and say that we are going to introduce a bill, produce a bill that simply eliminates the marriage tax penalty. For the last year and a half, I have discussed it at every single one of the dozens of town meetings that I have conducted across my congressional district. Every time I bring this up, I can just see everybody in the audience nodding their heads in agreement. They understand this issue. I use exactly the illustration that the gentleman from Illinois referred to earlier and he has provided to other Members. I take that to them. I say, you have a couple, each earning $31,500 per year for a combined income of $63,000. If they are married, they will pay nearly $1,300 a year more than the same two people with the same  two  jobs  living  in  the  same household with the same income.

At some point down the road, this body may be called upon to confirm or not confirm Mr. Mancuso’s nomination because it has been suggested that President Clinton is expected to nominate him to be the next Department of Defense Inspector General. If that happens, then each Member of this body would need to weigh all the facts bearing on Mr. Mancuso’s fitness to serve as the Pentagon’s watchdog, which is also the Pentagon’s top cop.

It  substantiated allegations of misconduct on the part of senior DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso, and at least one of his investigators, Mr. Mathew Walinsky. Mr. Mancuso at that time was Director of DCIS, and he was so from 1988 until 1997. Since that report was issued in October, my staff has been inundated with new  complaints  about  alleged misconduct  by Mr. Mancuso  and mismanagement  at  DCIS  while  Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS. My staff is now in the process of evaluating these allegations to determine if they have merit. Once that review has been conducted, I may issue a second report. Getting back to Mr. Wilson’s article in the National Journal, by comparison, instead of my report opening up a new can of worms, Mr. Wilson’s article has opened an old can of worms—in this case, Navy worms. It explores Mr. Mancuso’s role in the investigation of misconduct at the infamous Tailhook convention in September 1991. By reopening this very unfortunate episode in naval history, Mr. Wilson has shed new light on Mr. Mancuso’s fitness to move into the inspector general’s slot. Mr. Wilson  reports  that  the U.S. Court of Military Appeals condemned Mr. Mancuso and the DCIS for, in their words,  ‘‘heavy-handed  investigative tactics  that  trampled constitutional rights.’’ According to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Mancuso’s  tactics  included  ‘‘threats, intimidation,  falsification  of  interviews, and overreliance on lie detectors.’’ In an opinion issued on January 11, 1994, on the Tailhook case, the U.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced Mr. Mancuso’s tactics. The court compared the Tailhook case review process, which was set up by Mr. Mancuso, to sort of an assembly line justice, where investigative  and  judicial  functions were merged and blurred.  ‘‘Merged’’ and  ‘‘blurred’’ are words  the  court used.  ‘‘Assembly line’’ are words the court  used.  The  court  called Mr. Mancuso’s assembly line justice ‘‘troublesome.’’ Going on to quote the court: At best, it reflects a most curiously careless and amateurish approach to a very high profile case by experienced military lawyers and investigators. At worst, it raises the possibility of a  shadiness  in  respecting  the rights of military members caught up in a criminal investigation that cannot be condoned. That is what the U.S. Court of Military Appeals had to say. That is the highest military court in our land. It is often called the United States Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces. So this highest  court  has  condemned Mr. Mancuso  for  ‘‘shadiness.’’ The court said his practices were ‘‘careless and amateurish’’ and even ‘‘troublesome.’’ The court said he and his investigators failed  to  respect  the  constitutional rights of members of the armed services. I hope the Chair will agree that these are very serious charges about a person whom the President may nominate for our confirmation as inspector general of  the Department of Defense. The court’s  criticism—again  referring  to the Court of Military Appeals—may help to explain why the Tailhook investigation was a total failure. The entire  investigation probably cost  the taxpayers close to $10 million and involved  several  thousand  interviews. Unfortunately, not one  single naval aviator who  faced an assault charge was ever convicted by a court-martial. As  the  Director  of  DCIS, Mr. Mancuso  led the Tailhook  investigation. He is accountable for failing to conduct it as a professional. A legitimate question for my colleagues and for the President: Should that same man, a man who used shady investigative tactics, a man who failed to respect  naval  judicial  process  in Tailhook, be confirmed as the Pentagon’s watchdog? It is legitimate to ask if Mr. Mancuso is the best person to fill that position. I leave those thoughts with my colleagues over the next several weeks as this nomination may come up for consideration. I yield the floor. EXHIBITNO. 1 [From the National Journal, January 22, 2000] TAILHOOKMAYSOILCHOICEFORPENTAGON’S MR. CLEAN (By George C. Wilson) The man President Clinton is expected to nominate as inspector general of the Defense Department—the  Pentagon’s  top  cop—is coming under increased scrutiny in the Senate for questionable official conduct. Questions surround his role in the Tailhook sexual assault investigation of the early 1990s and his handling of his own investigators, one of whom pleaded guilty to stealing a 13year-old boy’s identity to obtain a false passport. Donald Mancuso, the Pentagon’s acting inspector general and probable nominee for the permanent  job,  formerly  led  the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. DCIS, which conducts most of the fraud and misconduct investigations at the Defense Department, had taken over the Tailhook investigation in 1992 after the Navy was accused of botching it. During the Tailhook investigation, naval aviators accused Mancuso’s agents of heavyhanded tactics that trampled their constitutional  rights. These  tactics,  they maintained, included threats, intimidation, falsification of interviews, and overreliance on lie detectors. In the end, no aviator was convicted at court-martial  for misconduct at the Tailhook convention, which was held in September 1991 at the Las Vegas Hilton. The U.S. Court of Military Appeals, in its review of the Tailhook cases, criticized military lawyers and the IG’s investigators—who were supervised by Mancuso—for procedures that were ‘‘troublesome.’’ The court faulted investigators for an approach that was ‘‘curiously careless and amateurish,’’ and that didn’t sufficiently respect the rights of suspects. Several  lawyers who defended Tailhook aviators told National Journal that they stand ready to cite examples of misconduct by DCIS agents if the Mancuso nomination moves forward. Their testimony could widen and escalate a battle over Mancuso that Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, began at the end of  the past  congressional  session. White House attorneys had focused on Grassley’s earlier objections, but they apparently had not  looked  into Mancuso’s Tailhook  role when they told National Journal recently that they saw no reason to recommend he not be nominated. Grassley up to now had focused his objections on Mancuso’s supposedly poor  judgment while director of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service from 1988–97. Grassley accused Mancuso of coddling a deputy after the deputy confessed to stealing a dead boy’s identity in an effort to get a false passport for still-mysterious reasons. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has mounted a stout defense of Mancuso and has told Grassley that none of the Senator’s objections should bar him from advancement. However, the Tailhook connection, which Grassley’s investigators have just begun to probe, may turn the Mancuso nomination into a ‘‘bolter’’—pilot talk for an airplane that misses the arresting wires stretched across an aircraft-carrier deck and so fails to land. Grassley will do his best to exploit the Tailhook connection in hearings and on the Senate floor. Former Navy Secretary John W. Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would hold confirmation hearings on a Mancuso nomination, is likely to plead with the President not to nominate anybody who would pull Congress back into the Tailhook swamp. The U.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced the tactics of Mancuso’s agents in an opinion  issued on Jan. 11, 1994, on a Tailhook case against Navy Lt. David Samples. The defendant had been charged with participating  in  the  ‘‘gantlet’’  in which drunken pilots groped, and in some cases assaulted, dozens of women who ventured down the third-floor hallway at the Hilton. Samples charged that he endured his own intensive gantlet of interrogations as one naval VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JA6.032 pfrm01 PsN: S31PT1 ",2000
22,,106,-0.276,58,2000-01-31,Mr. REID.," Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say to my friend, the majority leader, that on the surface it does appear that something needs to be done with nuclear waste. If you get under the surface, of course, there should be something done. I am not going to give a long dissertation now on nuclear waste. We have had that in the past. But the fact of the matter is, really what should happen is, it should stay where it is. That  is what  the  scientists  say.  It could be safely stored on site in dry cast storage containment, as is done in Calvert Cliffs, MD,  for the next 100 years. The nuclear power  industry, which has created this fiasco, wants someone else to clean up their mess. They want it out of their hands. They want their hands washed of it. The  fact of the matter  is, we are looking at  this  legislation. Senator is trying to come up with some alternative. I have been told by the minority on the Energy Committee that if that is the case, he is going to try to change the legislation that is now before this body. That is, the legislation now before this body would take the Environmental Protection Agency out of the mix; that is, the Environmental Protection Agency would not be  setting  the  standards  for Yucca Mountain, but it would be given to the Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission, which, in fact, is the one that does licensing. That really is literally having the fox guard the hen house. In this legislation, we simply want things to remain the way they are— have  the Environmental Protection Agency set the standards. But we understand there is a lot of agitation by the very powerful nuclear power industry, that wants to move this forward in spite of the fact that it could damage MURKOWSKI VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JA6.050 pfrm01 PsN: S31PT1 ",2000
23,,106,-0.351,65,2000-01-31,Mr. HARKIN.," Madam President, I am pleased to join my Senate colleagues in recognizing January as National Biotechnology Month. At the dawn of this new century, it is fitting for us to recognize the promise and potential of biotechnology. With the mapping of the human genome, we are on the brink of critical advances in health care and medical discovery. These advances can become new cures and new treatments, new industrial products, and improved agricultural  products. Biotechnology  is changing medical practice  from  the way diseases are diagnosed to the way they are treated. By helping us to understand life at the molecular level, biotechnology can help eliminate the guesswork of disease management and treatment. Biotechnology researchers have already made dramatic strides in confronting some of our most devastating and  tragic diseases,  from cancer  to multiple sclerosis to Alzheimers. Recent breakthroughs in human embryonic stem cell research have given us cause to predict cures for diseases such as Parkinsons,  juvenile diabetes and spinal cord injury. As Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations subcommittee, I have been a  long-time advocate  for health  research. Last  year, ARLEN SPECTER and I took the lead in providing  the  National  Institutes  of Health  (NIH) with a $2.3 billion  increase,  the  largest  in NIH history, bringing the agency’s overall budget to $17.9 billion. This year, we plan to introduce a resolution calling for a $2.7 billion increase—keeping our commitment to double NIH funding over five years. NIH provides funding for the basic science that underpins the important research and development done by the biotechnology  industry. This  strong public-private partnership has made our country the world leader in the area  of  biotechnology  innovation. There are approximately 1300 biotech companies in the United States, employing more than 150,000 people. In my own state of Iowa, we have approximately 180 companies, with more than VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:32 Feb 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A31JA6.014 pfrm01 PsN: S31PT1 ",2000
24,,106,0.257,72,2000-01-31,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation important  to  the energy  security of our country. This legislation entitled the ‘‘Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization and Improvements Act of 2000’’ not only includes provisions authorizing the annual funding for the Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission (NRC), but makes  essential amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will assist the NRC in its efforts to achieve greater efficiencies and  eliminate outdated  restrictions within our nuclear energy sector. As mentioned, this legislation includes  several amendments  to  the Atomic Energy Act, including the following: Eliminating  provisions  in  current law that preclude any foreign ownership of power and research reactors located in the United States. These outdated provisions are a significant obstacle to foreign investment or participation in the U.S. nuclear power industry and its restructuring. No valid reasons exist to prohibit investors from countries such as the United Kingdom from participating in the ownership of nuclear plants  in this country. The provisions in current law that protect U.S. security interests are unchanged by my legislation. Eliminationg the current statutory requirement that the NRC conduct an antitrust review in connection with licensing actions. Other federal agencies already have comprehensive responsibility to enforce antitrust laws affecting  electric utilities. Requiring  the NRC to do independent antitrust evaluations for licensing actions is redundant, time-consuming and unnecessary. Simplifying  the  hearing  requirements  in a proceeding  involving an amendment to an existing operating license, or the transfer of an existing operating license. The amendment provides that the Commission should not use formal adjudicatory procedures in such cases, but rather should comply with the informal rulemaking requirements contained in the Administrative Procedure Act. Giving the NRC the authority to establish  such  requirements  it deems necessary to ensure that non-licenses fully comply with their obligations to provide funding for nuclear plant decommissioning. This includes jurisdiction over non-licensees, i.e., those who have transferred their license but retain  responsibility  for  decommissioning. The proposed package also includes legislative provisions  sought by  the NRC. The foreign ownership and antitrust review changes  just mentioned were included in the NRC’s legislative proposals last year. Other provisions requested by the NRC should serve to enhance nuclear safety and physical security,  increase  efficiency,  and  enhance the economic use of Commission resources. These changes are necessary to ensure that nuclear energy remains part of our nation’s energy portfolio. Nuclear energy is a vital ingredient for providing U.S. base load capacity based on economic, environmental and electricity needs. Mr. President, I am sure everyone is aware of my strong commitment to nuclear energy. This conviction is wellfounded. One need only consider a few simple facts to find justification for my position. Ensuring diversity and reliability in our nation’s future energy portfolio is a critical national security concern. As just one example, our increasing dependence on imported fossil fuel is a dein energy  cause for concern. Last year oil imports accounted for 54% of U.S. oil consumption. This dependence could create a national security crisis. This dependence may also contribute to an environmental crisis. Similarly, although we continue to invest in renewable energy resources, the hard facts demonstrate that renewables alone cannot obtain sufficient energy generation to meet future needs. An article by Richard Rhodes and Denis Beller in the most recent edition of Foreign Affairs argues the case for nuclear energy in detail. Mr. President, allow me briefly to review some facts found in this article that address some very important questions. These repeat the same points I made in a speech at Harvard in October of 1997 and have made many times since. First, what  estimated  mands will the world face? A 1999 report by the British Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering estimates that the consumption of energy will at least double in the next 50 years and grow by a factor of up to five in the next century. The OECD projects 65% growth  world energy demand by 2020. How can nuclear energy play a role in meeting future energy needs? The  anti-nuclear  groups  are  dead wrong. Nuclear power is neither dead nor dying. France generates 79 percent of its electricity with nuclear power; Belgium, 60 percent; Sweden, 42 percent; Japan 34 percent; and the United States, 20 percent. The United States remains the largest producer of nuclear energy in the world, and the U.S. nuclear industry generated nine percent more nuclear electricity in 1999 than 1998.  In  order  to  sustain  economic growth, China has plans for as many as 100 nuclear power plants, and South Korea will more than double its capacity by building 16 new plants. Nuclear  power’s  advantage  is  the ability to generate a vast amount of energy from a minute quantity of fuel. For example, whereas one kilogram of firewood  can produce one kilowatthour of electricity and the ratio for oil is one-to-four, one kilogram of uranium fuel in a modern light-water reactor generates  400,000 kilowatts of electricity, even without recycling. Nuclear safety and efficiency have improved dramatically in the last decade. For example, the average U.S. capacity factor in 1998 was 80 percent, compared to 58 percent in 1980 and 66 percent in 1990. The average production costs for nuclear energy are now at just under two cents per kilowatt-hour, while electricity produced  from gas costs almost three and a half cents per kilowatt-hour. Most importantly, radiation exposure to workers and waste produced per unit of energy have hit new lows. What about the risks from radioactivity? Good evidence exists that exposure to low doses of radioactivity actually improves  health  and  lengthens  life VerDate 27-JAN-2000 01:41 Feb 01, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JA6.036 pfrm01 PsN: S31PT1 ",2000
25,,106,-0.353,93,2000-01-31,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Erin Breeze, one of my constituents from Nederland, Colorado who was one of twelve Americans selected as an inaugural George J. Mitchell Scholar. Erin was selected from more than 250 applicants  in a nationwide competition  to pursue one year of post-graduate study at a university in Ireland or Northern Ireland. The scholarship is named in honor of former Senator George Mitchell’s contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process and is awarded to individuals who have shown academic distinction, commitment  to service and potential  for  leadership. Indeed, Erin has rose to the occasion. Erin will graduate  in May with a degree  in International Affairs from the University of Colorado. She is a Dean’s Scholar, recipient of a service  learning scholarship and member of numerous honor societies. Erin  spent  a  year  as  a  volunteer  for AmeriCorps, where she completed 1800 hours of service in the areas of education, environment, and public safety. While  tutoring  first and second grade students in San Diego, CA, Erin also assisted the school district in assessing the needs and conditions of primary and secondary schools. Additionally, after becoming a certified wildland firefighter, she helped develop a community education project with the Flagstaff Fire Department in Flagstaff, AZ and provided disaster  relief  to  residents  in Lama, NM following a forest fire. As an intern for the Youth Volunteer Corps in Santa Rosa, CA, Erin designed an educational seminar to teach seventh grade students about  the subject of child  labor. She then led a group of students through the organization and completion of a school supplies drive  for  their peers  in  the Philippines. Recently, Erin returned from Geneva, Switzerland where she was an intern at the International Peace Bureau and The Hague Appeal  for Peace. As a George J. Mitchell Scholar, Erin will be enrolled at  the University of Limerick  for a master’s degree  in Peace and Development Studies. Her long-term goal is to pursue a career  in which she can  facilitate collaborative approaches to peacebuilding. Mr. Speaker,  for  the past year we have heard so much about how our young people are being led astray and turning to violence. However, from my visits with young people in my district, I have seen how they are showing great promise  for our nation’s  future. Erin Breeze is one of those promising individuals who is making a difference both in her local community and  the global community. Because of her unswerving dedication and talent, I have no doubt that Erin will be a future world leader for peace. NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY MONTH HON. JAMES C.

27,Senate,106,0.446,12,2000-02-07,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. President, unfortunately, one of the issues that continues to show up and seems to have  nine lives—or more than nine, is the  matter of gun control. We have seen it  every session a number of times. I am  sure we will see it again. I think it is  something about which we ought to  talk. I believe most people have come  to the conclusion that the passage of  additional laws is not going to make a  great deal of difference in the behavior  of criminals. Sadly, law abiding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights are the ones who will be  impacted by additional gun  control  laws. But it would not affect those who  do not  intend to abide by the  law.  Therefore, the idea of additional laws  certainly is questionable.  In my mind, it is not the direction we  ought to take. Fortunately, I think the  majority of people in this country also  believed the passage of new laws is not  the solution. We need to enforce the  numerous gun  laws that are on the  books.  Thankfully  for  our  country,  the  President has not been able to carry  out his continuing agenda of wanting  more and more gun laws. But, regrettably, he has not been able to make enforcement more effective. More  laws  are not going to keep those who are  willing to break the law from doing  things illegally. Stronger enforcement  of existing laws is the answer. The administration, however, has not presented such a program. Certainly, we  need to move in that direction.  When tragedies occur, as they did in  Colorado and a number of other places,  of course all of us wonder what we can  do to ensure that these tragedies do  not happen again. The first impulse in  a legislative body is to pass more laws.  Unfortunately, that is often the most  political thing to do. But the fact of  the matter is, in almost every instance  numerous gun laws were broken when  these  terrible acts were committed.  One might  say, what  advantage  is  there in passing more? Indeed, what we  ought to be doing is talking about enforcement.  As many of you know, the administration has been busy developing new  gun control initiatives and additional  laws—everything from threatening gun  manufacturers with Federal  lawsuits  to mandatory licensing of new handgun  purchases. Currently, there are 26 municipalities  that have  filed  lawsuits  against the gun industry, and they are  shown on this chart. These  lawsuits  seek to make gun manufacturers liable  for the criminal misuse of firearms. Interestingly enough, three cases have  been  thrown out by  judges  in Cincinnati,  OH,  Bridgeport,  CT,  and  Miami-Dade County, FL.  These cases are interesting. For instance these judges noted:  . . . the City’s complaint is an improper  attempt to have this Court substitute its  judgment for that of the legislature[.] Only  the legislature has the power to engage in  the type of regulation. . . .  The city of Cincinnati.  The plaintiffs have no statutory of common  law basis  to  recoup  their  expenditures. . . .  The city of Bridgeport.  . . . the Plaintiffs have not directed this  Court to any statute or case that would  allow a city or county to proceed against a  group of manufacturers. . . .  Miami-Dade County, FL.  The courts have pointed out municipal lawsuits are not the answer. Interestingly enough, the President has announced the Justice Department will  pursue a similar lawsuit against the  gun manufacturers on behalf of HUD.  Basically, the Federal Government is  trying to pressure gun manufacturers  into settling their current cases.  Once again, the action highlights the  President’s failure to pass gun control  legislation. Instead of bringing  forth  legislation, he is seeking to go through  the judiciary to do what he has been  unable to accomplish in Congress.  This next graph shows the results of  a poll taken recently by CNN and USA  Today. It was conducted between December 9 and 12 of last year. Let me  read it:  As you may know, the U.S. Justice Department is considering filing a lawsuit against  the gun manufacture industry seeking to recover the costs associated with gun-related  crimes. The companies  that manufacture  guns in the U.S. have stated the charges  have no merit. Which side do you agree with  more in this dispute: the Justice Department  (or) the gun manufacturers?  The result was, those who agreed  with the lawsuit by Justice were 28  percent, and those who agreed the lawsuit had little merit were 67 percent. I  really believe this poll reflects how  American’s  feel about a government  lawsuit against the gun industry.  In the President’s State of the Union  address he spoke about the idea of having individual states regulate the sale  of handguns by requiring a photo ID  and documentation of the successful  completion of a safety course—just to  purchase a handgun. This is clearly another attempt by  the President  to  tighten gun laws on law-abiding citizens. Of course, criminals do not register  their guns. Enforcement, however, is how we get guns out of the  hands of  the criminals. Republicans  have continued to support law enforcement efforts.  Project Exile, for example, which has  been put into place around the country, has dropped the murder rate in  Richmond, Virginia by 30 percent each  year that it has been in place.  Unfortunately,  President  Clinton  cannot say the same for his gun control efforts. This is a graph of ATF gun  referrals, prosecutions, and convictions  in 1992 and 1998. Between 1992 and 1998  ATF  referrals  for  prosecution went  down by 5,500 or 44 percent; prosecutions have dropped 40 percent; and, finally, convictions have dropped 31 percent.  This graph shows just how tough the  administration has been since 1992 regarding  the enforcement of existing  federal gun laws.  Last year, I asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct an  audit of the National Instant Check  System (NICS). The system was put in  place in November 1998 as phase 2 of  the Brady Act. I asked the GAO for an  audit to see if, indeed, it is operating  as Congress intended it to. I am confident when the report is released—and  it has not yet been released but will be  very soon—we will have results that  show the NICS has not been as effective as we hoped it would be.  Lastly, since  last November, there  have been numerous news articles from  around the country that highlight the  publics disfavor with attempts by the  President  to add more gun control  laws. I want to take a minute to highlight a couple of these. One is titled, it  is the ‘‘Wrong Approach,’’ by the Cheyenne Tribune Eagle, which suggests:  Since the President has been unable to ban  individuals from owning guns, Mr. Clinton  has decided to do an end run around the Constitution.  That is the point of view of that particular paper.  Another is titled, ‘‘Gun Deaths, Injuries on Decline.’’ This article speaks  about a government study which shows  that gun deaths have declined since the  late 1960’s.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  to print  these articles  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Cheyenne Tribune Eagle, Dec. 16,  1999]  WRONGAPPROACH—FEDERALLAWSUIT  IGNORESRIGHTSOFGUNMAKERS  Once again, President Bill Clinton, our national embarrassment, is showing utter contempt for our Constitution as well as for the  basic rights of the individual and the concept  of freedom.

32,Senate,106,0.272,16,2000-02-23,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, I would  like to point out that what we have before us is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. As I  said in my opening remarks, this bill  does not answer all problems of education. I am not one to try to base  what I do on what a particular poll  shows today or tomorrow. I am trying  to help satisfy some of the pressing  educational problems facing America.  When I go home to my little State of  Delaware, a matter of real concern to  families, whether  their children are  teenagers, in secondary or in grammar  school, is how the family can afford to  send their children to quality colleges.  This is a key problem facing the typical American family. Make no mistake about it. I defy any one of you to  go home and talk to parents, talk to  your  neighbors who  have  children.  Time and again they will tell you how  difficult it is to have the funds necessary to pay for college education.  So I do not apologize for bringing  this kind of legislation before us. This  is a matter within the jurisdiction of  the Finance Committee. I might say,  we have had this legislation reported  out since last May. I am pleased and  delighted we are having the chance to  debate and vote on it. Yes, it does not  settle the problems of teachers’ training, the size of classes, or many of the  other matters mentioned by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.  I do not deny those are important problems, but they are matters within the  jurisdiction of other committees. What  I seek to do today is to bring to the  Senate legislation that will be most  helpful to the typical American family,  meeting part of that great American  dream of sending their children on to  higher education.  We have purposely tried to devise the  kind of program that takes advantage  of the miracle of compound interest.  The question is not how much it costs  the Government. The question is how  much does this  legislation help the  typical American family? We all know  the miracle of compound interest. If  families will start when their children  are small, saving in educational IRAs,  up to $2,000, this will provide significant resources, tremendous amounts of  money to help them send their children  to school.  Yes, this legislation does not answer  all problems of education, nor was it  intended to. That is not within the jurisdiction of my committee. But I do  say it does seek and will address some  of the most important problems facing  the American family.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  COVERDELL). The Chair recognizes the  Senator from New Hampshire.  ",2000
33,Senate,106,0.429,16,2000-02-23,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I begin  by congratulating  the Senator  from  Delaware for bringing this bill forward  again, and the Senator from Georgia,  who is presently in the Chair, for having been the original author of this  bill.  This is a very strong piece of legislation which, as the Senator from Delaware has so effectively pointed out, is  absolutely critical to the parents of  this country as they try to assure the  one thing that is most important in  most parents’ lifestyles in dealing with  their kids, beyond giving their kids  love and a sense of how to deal with reality and a sense of values, and that is  the ability to get a good education.  The ability to get a good education,  once you get out of the public school  system in our country today, is tied, to  a great extent, to your ability to pay  for  that  education.  Postsecondary  school education, even under public  school systems, can be extraordinarily  expensive.  These college savings IRA accounts  give parents more flexibility. In fact,  there was an ad I saw on TV last night  which brought home the reality of this  so effectively. It showed a baby being  born. The theme of the ad was: The  first image that comes across the parents’ minds is the wonder of the baby.  The second image that comes across  the parents’ minds is, $210,000 is flashed  up on the screen because that is what  it  is going to cost to educate that  child, to have that child, who was just  born, go to college. The theme of the  ad is: What am I going to do to pay  that?  One way to address it is to pass this  bill which was passed and, regrettably,  rejected by the Democratic side of the  aisle and the President. It is before us  again so we can give parents some relief.  Nobody is claiming this is the entire  rug or the entire makeup of the issue  of how we address education. No one is  claiming that this is the whole quilt.  This is one block within the quilt, one  item of the quilt in how we improve  education in this country today. It is  an important item, and it is an important statement to make that we, as a  Congress, are going to, once again, put  forward this initiative which we put  forward last year as part of our efforts.

37,Senate,106,-0.395,44,2000-02-23,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, today in  the Detroit Free Press, there is a story  about a potential nightmare in Michigan. The article alleges  that Kevin  Olender, a felon convicted of assault  with a dangerous weapon was preparing  an attack on his co-workers in Farmington Hills. According to the article,  Olender was able to evade background  checks required by the Brady law, by  purchasing a gun in parts. Allegedly,  Olender was only one part away from  finishing the construction of his firearm, and that part was expected within  days.  In the end, investigators prevented  any shoot-out, but the article highlights another loophole in federal firearm  law that gives  felons access to  firearms which would otherwise be forbidden. I urge my colleagues to close  this loophole and the many others in  our federal law.  I ask that the Detroit Free Press article about this loophole be printed in  the RECORD.  The article follows:  [From the Detroit Free Press, Feb. 23, 2000]  FELON’SGUNCHARGESSHOWNETLOOPHOLE—  POLICE SAY SUSPECTWASABLE TOBUY  PARTSON-LINE  (By L.L. Brasier and Ruby L. Bailey)  With a credit card and the Internet, Kevin  Olender had everything he needed to find  parts for an assault rifle.  It was no problem, even for a felon.  Four  days  after  Christmas  last  year,  Olender went shopping. He ordered a $199.95  parts package for a military-style rifle from  Interordnance, an Internet gun dealer based  in Monroe, N.C. He bought another parts  package from the firm Feb. 4.  Police and prosecutors say Olender, 40, of  Wyandotte, was preparing for an assault on  co-workers at Compuware  in Farmington  Hills. He only needed one more part, known  as a receiver, to finish building a working  gun.  The part was on order, police say. But authorities raided his home last Friday and arrested him.  ‘‘He was ready to do it,’’ Farmington Hills  Police Chief William Dwyer said Tuesday. ‘‘I  think we saved a lot of lives.’’  Dwyer said his  investigators  found evidence that Olender had located the receiver,  a palm-sized part that holds pieces together  and makes the gun fire, and expected it within days. Dwyer would not say how investigators determined that.  A person with a felony background is prohibited from possessing a gun or ammunition. But there’s a loophole in federal law.  Though dealers cannot sell a gun without a  background check, they can sell gun parts,  weapons experts said.  Ulich Wiegand, owner of  Interordnance,  said he did not check Olender’s background  when filling his order.  ‘‘No, of course not,’’ he said. ‘‘We are not  required to because we weren’t selling him a  gun.’’  Olender was convicted in 1996 in Detroit  Recorder’s Court of a felony, assault with a  dangerous weapon, court records show. He  received five years’ probation.  Wiegand said he sells many parts packages,  but declined to say how many.  ‘‘You have to understand, we did not send  him guns,’’ Wiegand said. ‘‘This is nothing  but parts, and he could do nothing with them  without a receiver.’’  Wiegand said his company sells fully assembled weapons only to federally licensed  firearm dealers.  But Dwyer said Olender’s easy access to  gun components on the Internet points out  the need for new laws.  ‘‘It is like the old West, only with no sheriff in town,’’ Dwyer said. ‘‘You’ve got sexual  predators, violent people buying guns. We  need to come up with some safeguards.’’  Olender is being held in the Wayne County  Jail on a charge of possessing a firearm as a  felon, and using a firearm in a felony.  Olender could face federal charges for possessing ammunition as a felon. Agents for  the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms are  investigating what  charges  may be filed, said Vera Fedorak, an agency  spokeswoman.  During Friday’s raid, authorities recovered  two disassembled rifles from Olender’s basement, as well as a manual for assembling the  guns. They also found hundreds of rounds of  ammunition,  including  steel-nosed bullets  designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests.  Investigators found that he was missing receivers, also known as frames, used to hold  the gun pieces in place.  To purchase a  receiver, Olender  should  have been subjected to a background check,  by law. Dwyer and others would not comment further about the receiver.  Without the receiver, what Olender had  was like ‘‘a car without a motor,’’ said Victor Reid, co-owner of Midwest Ordnance Gun  Shop in Royal Oak.  A receiver would cost $300 to $400, he said.  The part is regulated by the federal government, has a serial number, and cannot be  sold without a license.  ‘‘They are virtually impossible to get illegally,’’ said Reid, who said he does not sell  gun kits at the store, or on the company’s  Web site. ‘‘It’s not an item that you can just  go buy.’’  The packages that Olender bought from  the North Carolina  firm consisted of gun  parts from military weapons dating to the  1950s, and disassembled overseas. The packages  are  popular  among  collectors  and  sportsmen, who acquire the needed receivers  through dealers, and reassemble the guns.  Police said they are investigating where  Olender got the ammunition.  Concerns about guns and the Internet have  prompted federal lawmakers to pursue legislation targeting Internet sales of guns.  Hundreds of Internet sites advertise weapons for sale.  Many are dealers who comply with federal  laws. But individuals often don’t, said Jim  Kessler, policy director for U.S. Sen. Charles  Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer has sponsored a  bill that would make it illegal for anyone except licensed gun dealers to buy and sell  guns over the Internet. The measure is pending.  ‘‘Nobody’s watching,’’ Kessler said.  ‘‘The  Internet itself presents a giant loophole in  gun laws.’’  When searching for guns over the Internet,  buyers can’t legally make the purchase directly on-line, gun experts said.  Buyers scan Web sites where guns are advertised, then contact a dealer and complete  the purchase. The dealer must ship the weapon to another gun dealer, who is required to  make sure that the buyer fills out the required forms and undergoes a background  check.  ‘‘It’s not like someone can put their credit  card in a Web site and get a gun,’’ said Trish  Hylton, spokeswoman for the National Rifle  Association.  She said the Internet ‘‘is like a classified  ad. The person selling and the person purchasing have to abide by all the laws that  are in place.’’∑  f  RETENTION OF MILITARY SERVICE  MEMBERS  ∑",2000
38,Senate,106,0.311,15,2000-03-07,Mr. ABRAHAM.," I don’t, for the very  simple reason that in the House, the  House-passed legislation went beyond  the scope of what we passed in the Senate to include legislation, or to expand  the use of this  legislation to transactions  that  involved  securities and  other  transactions which would  fall  under our Banking Committee’s jurisdiction. Had those been in the initial  legislation we  introduced here, then  the jurisdiction of this bill in the Senate might have been altered or in some  way divided.  For that reason, I think there is a  very valid argument for the Banking  Committee, because of the broader nature of the legislation that came to the  House, to participate in the conference.

40,Senate,106,-0.303,15,2000-03-07,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I appreciate the leader yielding to me.  As we go through our daily schedules  and responsibilities, I bet I do a lot of  things which are a source of concern  for the majority leader. I am sure he is  not surprised that the way this matter  has been handled is a source of concern  to me. We talk daily. Sometimes we  talk hourly. Sometimes I am sure we  talk more than he would  like. But,  nonetheless, we talk. To say we were  surprised  and  disappointed  that  a  unanimous consent request could be  propounded without any notification is  an understatement. It is disappointing.  I hope we can avoid surprising one  another. But, of course, we do it. That  is understandable. Certainly, the majority leader has every right to proceed  in any way he sees most appropriate. I  think it is a violation of the trust and  communication that we try to maintain. And I am very disappointed he  sought to come to the floor without  any notification of the issue.  Let me say three things.  ",2000
41,Senate,106,-0.276,22,2000-03-07,Mr. REID.," If the Senator will yield  with his right to have the  floor,  I  agree. If there is a Senator who believes  there  is a problem with any  judge, whether it is the one we are  going to vote on at 5 o’clock or the two  we are going to vote on tomorrow, or  Thursday, they have every right to  come to talk at whatever length they  want. But with Judge Paez, it has been  4 years. There has been ample opportunity to talk about this man. He has  bipartisan support. I have no problem  with people talking about the decisions  he has rendered. He has been a judge  for about 18 years in State and Federal  courts. I think there has been an exhaustive review of those.  If the Senator from Alabama, who  has a fine legal mind and is former attorney general of Alabama, and the  Senator from New Hampshire, who has  had wide-ranging experience in government and in the Senate and House of  Representatives, want to talk, more  power to them. My only point  is, 4  years is too long.  I also repeat some of the things the  ranking member of the committee has  said. It is a myth that judges are not  traditionally confirmed in Presidential  election years. It is simply not true.  Recall that in 1980, a Presidential election year, 64 judges were confirmed; in  1984, 44; in 1988—we talked about that  when we had a Democrat Senate and  Republican President—42 were  confirmed; in 1992, we had 66. That is the  record. I think that really says a lot.  When we had President Bush and a  Democratic majority, and a significant  majority, we could have stalled things.  We  approved  66 nominees—I  repeat  that for the Record—whereas, in President Clinton’s  last year of his  first  term, 17 were approved. That is really  not fair.  My point is that we need to move  these along. I think as part of the legacy of the Republican leadership of this  Congress, you can’t hold your heads  high when you have up to this point  confirmed three or four nominees. You  need to move up and have 40, 50, or 60.  Otherwise,  I think you are not  fulfilling the need the country has to take  care of the tremendous backlog of 30  pending judges and probably 35 or 40  more in the pipeline as we speak.  I hope Senator SESSIONSand Senator  SMITHof New Hampshire, who are both  very fine legislators, will say all they  want to say negative or positive about  the nominees. But let us move forward  and vote on them.  I again repeat, I don’t think it is a  good legacy for the Republican leadership of the Senate to break a record  that you certainly don’t want to break;  that is, in the country that is rapidly  growing with  all kinds  of Federal  crimes being committed, we have fewer  judges to do the job. It is very desperate.  In the State of Nevada, a fine judge  in the prime of his judicial life and a  senior judge took senior status. It was  the only way we could get another  judge. It is that way all over the country.  I have no problem, I repeat, with  what the Senator is doing. I think it is  commendable.  I also think when we talk about the  Ninth Circuit, which I have defended, I  have, as I have stated, I guess some  could say, a conflict of interest because  one of my two sons was administrative  assistant to the chief judge and my  other boy is presently working there.  It is a circuit in which I live and practice law. Let Members not denigrate  that circuit.  Of course, they have so many cases;  and it is true, their reversal rate is  high. They decided almost 5,000 cases  in a year. Out of approximately 5,000  cases, they have had about 12 or 14 reversals. That is not so bad. The cases  that are taken up are ripe for the Supreme Court because they are in conflict with other circuits.  That reversal rate has improved. The  numbers, as indicated by Senator MURKOWSKIearlier today, are from another  year.  I think criticism of the Ninth Circuit  is certainly  in order. Go ahead and  criticize the Ninth Circuit. As far as  the Senator doing anything unconstitutional, it isn’t even close. The Senator has every right to do what he is  doing.  I appreciate very much the courtesy  of the Senator. He did not have to  allow me to speak out of order. I know  the Senator has a lot to say.  ",2000
42,Senate,106,0.623,22,2000-03-07,Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.," I appreciate my colleague’s remarks and  will yield to him at any time.  I will respond briefly to my colleague  because I think he is correct on the  numbers. I think the numbers speak  for themselves. I believe there were  some 66 nominations brought through  during  the Bush years. This  is not  about the number of people. I think it  is a fairly reasonable assessment to say  if those nominations came through in  1992 or from 1989 through the end of the  term in 1993, it is likely they were not  very controversial. There was no debate, really. They were pretty much  unanimously agreed to.  We are talking about two issues: One  is  the  controversial  nature  of  the  judges involved; two, the controversial  nature of the Ninth Circuit. Both the  Ninth Circuit and the judges are in and  of themselves controversial. In the case  of the one vote the Democrats in 1992  brought forth, although it did win, it  was  a  controversial  nomination.  I  think Judge Paez, with all due respect,  and Judge Berzon, are controversial  nominations. Clearly, the Ninth Circuit is controversial.  I have agreed with the majority leader; if he chooses to accept, I have indicated I am willing to limit the debate  on Thursday to about 5 hours total  time on our side to discuss these nominations. I am not blocking for the sake  of blocking. I am trying to make some  points that I hope will result in the rejection of these nominees.  I will discuss this Ninth Circuit and  the reversals. As I said, from 1994 to  2000, 85 of 99 decisions—86 percent—by  the Ninth Circuit were reversed by the  Supreme Court.  What kind of a record is that? What  kind of knowledge of the law does this  indicate when the Supreme Court could  overturn 86 percent of the cases in the  last 6 years and, as I said, 90 percent of  the cases overall?  To be specific, in 1999 to 2000, 7 of 7—  100 percent of the cases set down by  this court—were overturned by the Supreme Court. There  are  four more  pending now that are being challenged.  I will not go into the details of each  case,  but U.S.  v. Locke, Rice  v.  Cavetano, Roe v. Flores-Warden, U.S.  v. Martinez-Salazar, Smith v. Robbins,  Gutierrez v. Ada, Los Angeles Police  Department v. United Recording Publication—all of those were overturned,  all 7 of 7.  From 1998 to 1999, during that year,  13 of 18 of the decisions of this court, 72  percent, were overturned by the Supreme Court—reversed.  From 1997 to 1998, 14 of 17 were overturned by the Supreme Court, 82 percent of the cases.  From 1996 to 1997, 27 of 28 cases were  overturned,  96 percent of  the cases  overturned.  From 1995 to 1996, 10 of 12, 83 percent,  were overturned.  And on and on and on.  I have the documentations of these  cases.  The bottom line is the Ninth Circuit  is notorious  for  its antilaw enforcement record, its frequent creation of  new rights for criminals and defendants, often in the face of clearly established law.  These two judges we now are debating,  I  believe  based  on  their  own  records and comments and paper trail,  are going to be act the same. They will  be making the same kinds of decisions.  It is an embarrassment to have 90  percent of the cases overturned. In my  view, it shows, frankly, an ignorance of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:49 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S07MR0.REC S07MR0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000

45,Senate,106,0.109,43,2000-03-07,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce the St. Croix Island  Heritage Act, legislation that will help  develop a regional heritage center in  Calais, ME, in time to commemorate  an event of great historical and international significance: the 400th anniversary of one of the earliest settlements in North America, at St. Croix  Island. I am pleased to have my senior  colleague from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, as a  cosponsor of my legislation.  Planning  for the regional heritage  center is well underway. The residents  of the St. Croix River Valley and organizations such as the St. Croix Economic Alliance and the Sunrise County  Economic Council have worked hard to  move the project forward. They commissioned a consulting firm to evaluate the market potential of the heritage center and to prepare preliminary  exhibit and operating plans. They secured planning and seed money from  the U.S. Forest Service, the city of Calais, local businesses, and others. And  they have hired a full-time project coordinator to oversee development of  the heritage center. Now they need assistance from the National Park Service, assistance that this bill would provide.  The regional center will preserve and  chronicle  the  region’s cultural, natural, and historical heritage. The Interior Department’s role in the planning  and development of the heritage center  stems from the close proximity of the  proposed site to St. Croix Island, the  only international historic site in the  National Park System.  In 2004, the United States, Canada,  and France will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the first settlement at St.  Croix  Island. We have only  4 more  years to prepare for a celebration of  this historic event.  I have spoken before on the Senate  floor about the historical significance  of the settlement of St. Croix Island. It  is a remarkable and little-known story  that bears retelling. The story dates to  the summer of 1604, when a French nobleman, accompanied by a courageous  group  of  adventurers  that  included  Samuel Champlain, landed on St. Croix  Island and set about to construct a settlement.  They  cleared  the  island,  planted crops, dug a well, and built  houses, fortifications, and public buildings. In the process, they were aided by  Native peoples who made temporary  camps on the island. At the same time,  Samuel Champlain undertook a number of reconnaissance missions  from  the island. On one, he found and named  Mount Desert Island, now the home to  Acadia National Park.  By October of 1604, the settlement  was ready. But the Maine winter was  more  than  the  seventy-nine  settlers  had bargained  for. By winter’s end,  nearly half had died, and many others  were seriously ill.  The spring brought relief from the  harsh weather. The colony was relocated to Port Royal in what is now  Nova Scotia and, in 1608, Champlain  and his fellow explorers founded Quebec.  According to the National Park Service, the French settlement on St. Croix  Island in 1604 and 1605 was the first and  ‘‘most ambitious attempt of its time to  establish an enduring French presence  in the ‘New World’’’ and ‘‘set a precedent for early French claims in New  France.’’ Many view  the  expedition  that settled on St. Croix Island in 1604  as the beginning of the Acadian culture  in North America. This rich and diverse culture spread across the continent,  from  Canada  to Louisiana,  where French-speaking Acadians came  to be known as ‘‘Cajuns.’’  Mr. President, thousands of people  attended the celebration that marked  the 300th anniversary of the settlement  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:49 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S07MR0.REC S07MR0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000
46,,106,0.231,6,2000-03-14,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, this Member rises to alert his colleagues to the introduction of H.R. 3707, the Taiwan Facilities Enhancement Act. This bill authorizes construction of modern, secure facilities for the American Institute on Taiwan. In the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the Congress established the American Institute on Taiwan to perform on behalf of the United States Government any and all programs and other relations with Taiwan. These facilities are grossly inadequate today from a security perspective, and major enhancements would be necessary  to bring them into compliance with security requirements. Mr. Speaker, Congress must specifically act to authorize because it is not a normal embassy or a consulate. Mr. Speaker, over 20 years after the enactment of  the Taiwan Relations Act, our unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan are stronger, more robust, and more important than ever. For very practical and security reasons, the Congress needs to act to upgrade our diplomatic facilities on Taiwan as well. It will also demonstrate that we have and will have a presence in Taipei for the long-term, if necessary, to assure that any reunification is peaceful and uncoerced. This Member hopes that all Members of Congress will cosponsor and support this legislation. f BLISS MANUFACTURING BANKRUPTED (Mr. TRAFICANT  asked  and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

49,,106,-0.302,13,2000-03-14,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I thank again my good friend, the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. FATTAH), for yielding me the time and for his leadership in the Congress. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this legislation to rename the central post office  in Arlington County after the late Joe Fisher, who so ably represented Virginia’s old 10th District between 1974 and 1980. I want to commend my good friend and distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WOLF), who now represents the new 10th District of Virginia, for his leadership on this bill, as well as the prior bill with regard to Mr. Broyhill. Joe Fisher was one of the finest men I ever knew. I am proud to stand on his inspirational shoulders today. He was extraordinarily  intelligent, holding a doctorate from Harvard in economics. He was a man of unquestioned integrity and genuine humility. He worked hard and purposefully, and he understood our responsibility to the future, particularly  in the area of environmental preservation. Many young people who are active in Government service and public service today got their start working for and observing Congressman Joe Fisher. During his service here in the House, Joe was a leader on economic issues, tax reform, and economic policy. It is amazing  to  think  that he was appointed to the Committee on Ways and Means in his very first term. The leadership of my party appointed Joe to head no less than seven task forces that helped to draft the Energy Policy Act of 1978. He was a founding member of the Environmental Study Conference that provided a bicameral forum  in which to examine our Nation’s environmental policies. And he was a strong voice for Federal workers in Northern Virginia, as well as  for people in need throughout the country. After leaving this body in 1980, Joe continued his public service as Secretary of Human Resources in the administration of then Governor CHUCK ROBB. He, in fact, had the unenviable task during that period of time when we had a recession in the State of administering Virginia’s AFDC and Medicaid programs. But he had a heart that was as expansive as his mind. And throughout his tenure, he earned a reputation  for being  fair minded, even handed, and extraordinarily effective. When he left Richmond, he continued serving the public as a professor at George Mason University, which is a post he held until he passed away at the age of 78. He has left a legacy in Northern Virginia particularly, but in this country generally. With regard to Northern Virginia, I think it is fair to say that he was instrumental  in transforming Northern Virginia from what had at one time been a segregated, insular suburb to a progressive and inclusively caring community. That probably would have happened without Joe Fisher, but it happened sooner and more profoundly because of Joe Fisher. Beyond his service to Virginia and this Nation, those of us who knew Joe Fisher came to appreciate the renaissance character of his personality and intellect. He was an avid sportsman and hiker. He was a national leader of the Unitarian Church. But  first and foremost, he was a devoted husband and father to his wife Peggy and their seven children. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to support this bill to honor the lifetime of public service that Joe Fisher provided our country. Again,  I commend my good friend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WOLF) for his leadership on it. ",2000
50,,106,0.282,13,2000-03-14,Mr. DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to honor Mr. Joseph L. Fisher. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 3701, introduced by Representative FRANKWOLF and Representative MORAN, which  designates  the United States Post Office  facility  located at 3118 Washington Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, to be known as the ‘‘Joseph L. Fisher Post Office Building.’’ Mr. Fisher served a distinguished career in both the U.S. Armed Forces and as the  first Representative  from Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. Born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, January 11, 1914, the late Congressman Joseph Fisher was first elected as the representative of the 10th Congressional District of Virginia in 1974 as a Democrat and began his service in the Ninety-fourth Congress. He held the seat of Congressman FRANKWOLF. He  served three terms and was the second Member of Congress to represent the 10th Congressional District. He served the 10th district through a period of tremendous growth and change for Northern Virginia. During his six years in Congress he served as a member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees and earned a reputation  for his diligent work on taxation, energy and budget policy. He also served as chair of seven task forces all on national policy issues. When he first came to Northern Virginia he accepted a position as an economist at  the U.S. Department of State before serving his country in World War II in the Pacific theater from 1943 to 1946. After he returned to the area, he was elected to the Arlington County Board in 1963 and became an advocate for JIM VerDate 13-MAR-2000 01:22 Mar 15, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K14MR7.058 pfrm02 PsN: H14PT1 ",2000
51,,106,0.34,27,2000-03-14,Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a good day for rural America. I want to congratulate the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. EMERSON) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. CLAYTON) for reviving the Rural Caucus. I do not know what happened that it died. It should never have. For  someone who  represents a very rural district, it is certainly a delight that we have it back. Why do we need a Rural Caucus? Well, first, I come from a very rural district, the most rural district east of the Mississippi,  from northern  tier Pennsylvania. A lot of people do not think of Pennsylvania as being rural. They think of Philadelphia and Lancaster and Pittsburgh. But much of Pennsylvania is rural. It is the most rural population in the country. Onethird of Pennsylvanians live in towns of less than 2,500. That is rural. Now, the problem we have is that urban America, who really runs this country,  dominates  governments  at State and national level, does not understand the needs of rural America. I call rural America the heartland of this country where we have some of our finest, hardest working people with the best work ethic. There is nothing more than we can point to today than the farm crisis. As I look out on the beautiful farmlands that are  in Pennsylvania and other neighboring States, and as we see the farmers leave and the barns fall down and the underbrush grows up on what was beautiful farm fields, we are gradually losing much of our heritage in this country. The farm crisis, if not addressed, will again put more and more rural people out of work and send them to the cities to push more urban sprawl. It is vital that this Congress meets the needs to preserve farms in this country because of the vital role that we play. My message to the White House is stop the food embargoes. Allow American farmers to sell their products at a fair price around the world. By lifting the embargoes, it would be $12 billion to $15 billion added to the farm budgets, and our farmers would get a much better price for their products because their markets would be expanded. Another  issue that  is  facing rural America is rural health care. I chaired health issues in Pennsylvania for a decade. I understand them. Rural health care is paid an unfair payment in comparison to urban suburban America. Why should a procedure in rural America be paid maybe half as much as a procedure in suburban urban America. There is no real reason for that except that is the rules that have been promulgated by HCFA that administers Medicare and Medicaid. If rural America’s health payments are not equalized or made fair, we will lose rural health care, and there will be no winners because those people will have to travel long distance to suburban areas. HCFA will pay the high price  for the same health care that could have been administered in the hometown communities. Rural transportation, rural airports, rural rail lines, we cannot afford to lose another mile of rail line in rural America. We cannot afford to have another community  lose  its ability to have rail service because it will make sure that certain jobs and certain opportunities are not available to them. Local air service is vital to the future of rural America, and it is under threat in this country because of government policies. Another issue that has just been recently brought into the national news is the explosion of substance abuse in this country and in particular in rural America. Rural America was always thought to be free of drug use. It was an urban problem. Mr. Speaker, the recent studies show that there is more abuse among young people  in  rural America than any other part. One of the reasons is we do not have adequate enforcement in rural America. The strike force, the drug strike force, the special groups that have been put together to work in urban America and suburban America, they do not like to work out in rural America. Because we do not have adequate enforcement, drug usage is on the rise, and we are losing young people by the thousands because drugs, not only harm young people, they often kill them. Drugs are dangerous. Drugs are not healthy. Drugs are not safe. We must somehow stop the drug culture in all of America and specifically rural America. A question I ask: Is rural America prepared for e-commerce? Do we have adequate ability to the Web, to the Internet? Are our telephone systems up to date? Do we have digital switching? Do we have an adequate amount of fiber optics? Because if we do not, it will be no different than if we do not have highways and we do not have rail and we do not have air service. E-commerce is where the future is. One of the issues is equity in education. Rural school districts have historically been underfunded in comparison to urban and suburban districts. Suburban America has a strong tax base and can afford a good educational system. Urban America has some of the similar problems of rural. We have always subsidized them. But we have not subsidized rural education in the same manner that we have subsidized urban education. So rural education has had to take a back seat. Not all of the opportunities  that are needed  for our young people are there. One of the issues facing this country and rural America is, do we have adequate access to technical education. My answer is no. The jobs that are out there today, many of them are hightech jobs, many of them are mid-tech jobs. But we need an education that is a blend of academic and technology. America is not prepared in my view, and rural America very much so, not prepared for the jobs of tomorrow, not prepared for the jobs of today. We are not adequately training the workforce. What is going to happen if we do not prepare this technical workforce, we are going to export another level of manufacturing that we should not lose and we do not need to lose if we do not prepare the workforce for the manufacturing companies. The manufacturing companies that are still processing and manufacturing in America today are very high-tech. There  is  a  computer  and  a  robot hooked together all the way down the line. It is a very high-tech manufacturing, and it takes a worker far more than was needed in the past when one just needed a willing worker. One needs a person today that is trained. f ELIMINATION ON BAN ON IMPORTING TO UNITED STATES IRANIAN CAVIAR,  CARPETS,  AND  PISTACHIOS ",2000

53,,106,-0.288,34,2000-03-14,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, this evening I want to talk with my colleagues about the  future. As  I talk about the future, I want to talk about the children of this country, because they truly are our future. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about education, particularly an effort  in education called character education. We  talk about a  lot of things that work and things that do not work; but as my colleagues know, before I came to the people’s House to serve in this body, I was the State superintendent of schools in the State of North Carolina. As I have told many of my colleagues from time to time, there are a lot of things in education that a lot of us who work in it, if we are honest with ourselves, do not know a great deal about when we do do some of the things  that work and a  lot of  the things that do not work. I happen to know  firsthand  that  character  education can make a difference to teach our children values and make sure that our students are well rounded and prepared to become good citizens. In 1989 when I took over as State superintendent, we did a survey of about 25,000 students across our State, and I was quite alarmed at some of the results we got back. About 37 percent of the students said that they did not respect their fellow students nor their teachers, and it was quite obvious from that data that something needed to be done. We pulled together teachers, administrators, members of the clergy. We pulled  together members  from  the bench and we did an extensive study for about a year and a half, almost 2 years, and came up with what we called ethics education. We put together some principles, and ultimately that evolved into character education. It was later adopted by the State board of education and then the North Carolina general assembly in 1995; and we received a grant in 1995 from the U.S. Department of Education to begin a process  in three of our school districts, three of the larger ones, incidentally, Wake County, Cumberland County, and Mecklenberg County to pilot character education. Now, across my congressional district,  school  leaders have developed character  education  initiatives  that really  are making  a  difference  for stronger schools and better communities. Wake County, as I just mentioned, was one of the early leaders. Not only were they a leader by receiving the funds and initiating the project and having community meetings, because this truly is based at the school level and the community  level; but they have become a  leader through their innovative effort that they call Uniting for Character. In that process, there are a number of principles that they focus on and that they come together on, which are respect, citizenship,  justice and  fairness,  honesty,  caring,  respect  and trustworthiness are the core; and each community must develop those issues that  they believe  in. What we  recommend is that the educators, the parents, the business community, all in the  community  come  together  and work together collaboratively to come up with those core  issues that they want to use. In Johnston County, another county in the district, they have come together and done theirs. The principal of Selma Elementary School, a  school which I visited just a few weeks ago, attributes 59 fewer suspensions during the 1995–1996 school year to their character education program. They also attribute the  fact that they have had academic  growth,  tremendous  academic growth over the years and again this year, and  I visited that school again to see what kind of progress they were making. They again are showing progress as a result of character education. It is not a program that teachers have to struggle with as another addition  to  their  already  crowded school day. It is integrated in the curriculum in the standard course of study that we use in North Carolina, and it is taught along with everything else they do, and I will talk about that more in just a few moments. Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues and certainly others across the country may have seen the CBS News profile that was done several months ago on one of the successful character education programs  in the Nash Rocky Mount school system, Baskerville Elementary School, a school that really was having a difficult time. They were having problems with truancy, they were having problems with discipline, their academics were  suffering, and under the leadership of a dynamic principal named Anne Edge, she took this on, she got her staff involved, she got the community involved, and she literally  indoctrinated  the children  in that school, and it is working well. I visited there several weeks ago, and I can tell my colleagues as a result of that program being implemented properly and being supported by the community, supported by the central office staff and the local school board, that is one  public  school  that has  turned around and is making a difference and it has become infectious. It is working all across Nash Rocky Mount school system in North Carolina. This morning, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to visit Tramway Elementary School  in Lee County, another school in my district where character education really fills the entire community with hope. I went  into that school  this morning, and  I was  so pleased to see the number of parents who were there. They were there participating, active in the school. They had other members of the school faculty there, but the impressive part of it was what was happening with the students. The young people in that classroom gave reports, probably half the class got up and  read  reports and shared with me and with the others present what character education had done, what a difference it had made, and the different character traits that VerDate 13-MAR-2000 03:12 Mar 15, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14MR7.104 pfrm02 PsN: H14PT1 ",2000
54,,106,0.554,69,2000-03-14,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I think that the compromise before us accurately reflects the consensus of the Congress that we must encourage the privatization of INTELSAT without diminishing competition. I strongly support the satellite reform conference agreement and  I urge my colleagues in the House to vote for its passage today. As many of you know,  for  the  last  few years, there has been great disagreement between the House and Senate on how to craft a meaningful satellite communications reform bill. Under the leadership of Chairman BLILEY, Representative  and Representative OXLEY, and Senator BURNS, we have reached the point in the debate where there is finally an agreement that can be enacted into law. I believe  that  the  conference  agreement achieves the core objectives of everyone who cares about satellite reform without imposing substantial threats to genuine market competition or breaching the Constitution. When the House passed its satellite reform bill at the end of the first session of the 106th Congress, I expressed some concerns of mine about  a  provision  in  the House  bill  that seemed  to place unnecessary conditions on lifting COMSAT’s ownership caps. In my opinion, retaining this language would have continued to block the consummation of the Lockheed Martin-COMSAT merger. I am pleased that this issue I raised was addressed by the conferees. The conference agreement now before us does not impose any conditions on the removal of COMSAT’s board and ownership restrictions. Those restrictions are eliminated upon enactment without conditions. This change will enable Lockheed Martin to acquire 100% of COMSAT without  further delay.  I thank Chairman BLILEY and  the other conferees  for amending  this provision so  that Lockheed Martin can more quickly enter the satellite communications market. I am also pleased  that  the  conference agreement does not contain fresh look and socalled Level  IV direct access, which would have been confiscatory and punitive. Extracting those provisions, along with the significant improvements that were made to the Housepassed privatization criteria, have put us in the position of being able to pass a compromise satellite reform bill that can be signed into law. I congratulate my colleagues in the House and in the Senate on a job well done, and I look forward to the enactment of this legislation. f AMERICAN  JOURNALIST  KATI MARTON  ADDRESSES  THE STOCKHOLM  HOLOCAUST  CONFERENCE  ON  ‘‘REMEMBERING WALLENBERG’’ HON. TOM LANTOS OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, March 14, 2000 ",2000
55,,106,-0.376,69,2000-03-14,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago in Stockholm representatives of 40 countries—including the Prime Ministers of Israel, Germany and Austria, and  the President of Poland—as well as Holocaust survivors and spiritual leaders met to focus attention on the legacy of the Holocaust. This three-day international conference was organized by the government of Sweden as part of an effort  to raise awareness among young people about the genocide of six million Jews and two million others, including Roma (Gypsies) and homosexuals, under the Nazi German regime. All who participated in the conference spoke of the importance of remembering that most heinous tragedy and of fighting against antiSemitism, racism and bigotry. In his address to  the  conference,  German  Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said:  ‘‘We must support each other  in  the  teaching of humanity and civil courage, so  that normal people shall never again, in the name of some criminal ideology, turn normal places into grim factories of execution.’’ Mr. Speaker, one of  the highlights of  this conference was  the address by Hungarianborn American journalist Kati Marton entitled ‘‘Remembering Wallenberg.’’ As she explained in her outstanding speech,  the Swedish humanitarian Raoul Wallenberg was one of the true heroes during this blackest of chapters in the history of humankind. Against almost insurmountable odds, he went  to Budapest at the height of the Nazi effort to extinguish the Jews of Hungary, and through courage, intelligence and  incredible effort, he was  instrumental in saving the lives of as many as one hundred thousand Jews. Mr. Speaker, Kati Marton is superbly qualified  to provide  this outstanding appraisal of Wallenberg. She was born  in Hungary, and both of her parents were journalists who suffered the Nazi occupation and the Communist takeover that followed. She and her parents were able to escape to the West, and eventually she came to the United States. Kati is a journalist and author of the first rank. She currently serves as  the president of  the Committee  to Protect Journalists, a nonpartisan nongovernmental  organization  dedicated  to protecting  journalists  and  press  freedom throughout the world. She is also the author of Wallenberg: Missing Hero and Death in Jerusalem. Mr. Speaker,  I  submit  the  text of Kati Marton’s Stockholm address  ‘‘Remembering Wallenberg’’ to be placed in the RECORD, and I urge my colleagues to give it thoughtful attention. REMEMBERINGWALLENBERG I am immensely grateful for this chance to talk about Raoul Wallenberg. Fifty-five years after the Holocaust we are still  learning things about that shameful chapter  in history. The Swedish government’s recent admission of its mistakes is both commendable and essential  . . . Not only for the sake of historical truth—but to put present and future leaders on notice that they will be held accountable. Sweden did misjudge  the  character of  the  evil  represented by Hitler . . . but this country also gave the world Raoul Wallenberg . . . one of the Holocaust’s  few genuine heroes. And today  . . . thanks to Sweden  . . . we are gathered here to learn not only from the misjudgements of the past terrible century . . . but from its extraordinary moments of humanity . . . If those terrible times are to remain real . . . and cautionary . . . to those who are lucky enough never to have experienced them . . . a great deal of the credit goes to conferences like this one  . . . for which I thank the Swedish Government and the American Jewish Committee. The historians of the Century that has just ended have the responsibility to tell the story of Wallenberg so that the next generation  can understand humanity’s  extraordinary power for both perversity and compassion. Our responsibility is to shape public memory . . . and ultimately to stand against evil by bearing witness. Since we are here in search of Historical Truth . . . I would like to say a few words about another Swede whose role in the Holocaust and its aftermath has for too long been forgotten or misunderstood . . . buried under rumor  and misinformation: Count Folke Bernadotte. Bernadotte’s assassination at the hands of Jewish extremists over half a century ago is a tragically prophetic tale . . . as we continue to search for peace in the Middle East. In many ways, Folke Bernadotte was not the right man for the role of the United Nations first Arab-Israeli mediator . . . not in the overheated emotional climate . . . and volatile military situation  . . . which prevailed during that traumatic first year of Israel’s  life. But—whatever  his  personal shortcomings or the weakness of his peace effort . . . Folke Bernadotte was a good man who threw caution to the winds and acted out of humanity. In the ’40s . . . as now . . . those qualities were in short supply. He deserved better than he got: death at the hands of extremists opposed to any negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Long before Bernadotte  landed  in Palestine, he had proved himself a skilled negotiator and committed humanitarian. He was responsible for the War’s most unsung, most controversial, and most successful rescue effort inside Germany. Through many hours of hard nosed negotiations with the notorious Heinrich Himmler  . . . Bernadotte extricated 21,000 prisoners . . . including 6,500 Jews . . . citizens VerDate 13<MAR>2000 05:49 Mar 15, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A14MR8.004 pfrm04 PsN: E14PT1 ",2000
56,,106,-0.478,83,2000-03-14,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce H.R.  3909,  designating  a United States Postal Service facility in the First Congressional District of Illinois as the ‘‘Henry W. McGee Post Office Building.’’ Henry McGee, the first black Postmaster of Chicago, gave 44 years of outstanding and exemplary service to the Post Office Department, now known as the U.S. Postal Service. He began his career in 1929 as a temporary substitute letter carrier and ended it in 1973 as General Manager of the eight metropolitan districts of Chicago. For this reason alone, I think it is more than fitting to honor his service and commitment to excellence, by naming the post office facility at 4601 South Cottage Grove Avenue as  the ‘‘Henry W. McGee Post Office Building.’’ But Mr. McGee’s accomplishments do not end here and neither should the praise. Mr. McGee coordinated  the arrangements for the 1939 convention of the National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees and in 1945 he served as president of the Chicago branch of the National Alliance. In 1948, Mr. McGee was appointed by  the postmaster  to comanage  the employment office,  later becoming the manager and overseeing the conversion to career employment for a large number of female employees. Continuing  to  strive  for  excellence, Mr. McGee acquired his bachelor of science degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology, and earned a promotion making him General Foreman. Later, he became Superintendent of the largest finance station of the Post Office Department. In 1961, Mr. McGee received a master’s degree in Public Administration from the University of Chicago, while concurrently being promoted to Personnel Manager for the Chicago region of the Post Office Department, which  encompassed  Illinois  and Michigan. Five years later, Mr. McGee became the first black Postmaster of Chicago. Abraham Lincoln said: ‘‘. . . in the end it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.’’ I am honored to submit this legislation saluting 90-year-old Henry McGee, a praiseworthy and admirable man. I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile measure.

57,,106,0.269,83,2000-03-14,Mrs. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  this evening to speak out for our rural American communities and to join my colleagues, Mrs. CLAYTON from North Carolina, Mr. MORAN from Kansas, Mr. POMEROY from North Dakota to celebrate the formation of the new Congressional Rural Caucus. This morning we held a press conference to formally announce  the  formation of our new Congressional Rural Caucus. We were joined by several Members of the Rural Caucus, the Speaker  of  the House DENNIS former Representative Glenn English  from Oklahoma who was representing the National Rural Network, and many Americans who live and work in our rural communities across our great nation. Those attending  the press conference expressed such strong support for our initiative to review the Congressional Rural Caucus. It really says to me that there is a great deal of support  for our rural American communities. That there’s a real recognition of just how important rural America is to our nation. It tells me that we’re on the right track here with our Rural Caucus. And  there  is absolutely no doubt in my mind that our Rural Caucus can and will help communities achieve real results. Since  last August my  colleagues, Mrs. from North Carolina, and Misters from Kansas,  from North Dakota, have been hard at work laying the ground work  for  the Rural Caucus. And we’ve been hard at work recruiting Members to  join and  take an active part  in  the Rural Caucus. We set a goal of 100 Members by our kick-off date. We not only met our goal, we surpassed it. To date, there are well over 110 bipartisan Members of the Rural Caucus. And more Members are  joining every day. We’ve all joined together to raise a loud voice for rural America on Capitol Hill. Think about it. With nearly a fourth of the House on board, that’s one heck of a loud voice. And the list just keeps growing. To my Rural Caucus colleagues I want to say ‘‘thank you.’’ Thank you for standing up and speaking out for your rural communities. Together we can make a real difference for all of rural America, and  I  look  forward  to  the work that lies ahead of us. Now to be honest, we couldn’t have done this alone. It took a lot of work and assistance and support from the many, many organizations of the National Rural Network. To all of the groups who have supported our efforts for the Rural Caucus, thank you. Because of your experience, your knowledge, and your  living connections with rural America, you all are an integral part of the success of the Rural Caucus. And I look forward to working with you on all that lies ahead. Now I want to briefly talk about why I think the Rural Caucus is so important and why I think it’s needed here on Capitol Hill. You may know  that about one  in every  four Americans—that’s 62 million people—live  in  rural America. That’s also about the same number of people who live in inner cities. And an additional 15 million people live in small cities and towns.

58,,106,0.538,3,2000-03-23,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker,  pornographers  in this country make more money than rock and country music combined. Pornographers bring in more dollars in a year than all Broadway productions, all theater shows, all ballet, jazz and classical music combined. And this administration is doing almost nothing about it. The Supreme Court has ruled that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment.  Federal  law  prohibits interstate transportation and distribution of obscenity. But since 1992, prosecutions for interstate distribution and sale of illegal pornography are down 75 percent. In all of 1997, there were only six prosecutions by all 93 U.S. Attorneys. The cause and effect between pornography  and  crime,  violence  against women and children, rape and child abuse, is clearly established. The President and the Department of Justice should enforce the law, not ignore it. f AN IRRESPONSIBLE BUDGET (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2000
59,,106,-0.349,3,2000-03-23,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the budget. The Republican budget contains tax breaks for the wealthy while  ignoring working Americans, which I think is irresponsible. It is not a fiscally oriented budget that looks toward the future. It contains deep cuts  in domestic spending. The Republican budget would cut FBI agents and Drug Enforcement agents, college scholarships, air traffic controllers, and programs for women and children. By contrast, the Democratic plan invests in education, our future in preparing our working force for the 21st Century. It reduces class sizes, protects our senior citizens, builds schools, provides college scholarships, provides affordable drug prescriptions, preserves Social Security and Medicare and pays down the deficit in a responsible manner before spending and emptying the bank account. b1015 The Democratic plan  looks toward the future and a sensible, balanced tax relief. It is an investment in support and strength of our Social Security and Medicare, and it pays off the debt. It provides everyone with an opportunity to succeed and work hard. It provides our children, our senior citizens who are less fortunate. f PORKER OF THE WEEK AWARD (Mr. HEFLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) ",2000
60,,106,0.591,3,2000-03-23,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker, last week the world watched as five cloned piglets were introduced before an international news core. Scientists cheered the achievement as a scientific and medical  breakthrough.  Maybe  the American people should have cheered as well since we paid for a good bit of that research with $2 million of our tax dollars. The Advanced Technology Program, a corporate welfare program managed by the Department of Commerce, gave a grant to the company responsible for cloning the piglets. The company, PPL Therapeutics, claims it needs taxpayer assistance because it cannot find private backing for cloning research. It will certainly be interesting to see if that company shares its profits with the American taxpayers now that they have found success. In this modern-day nursery rhyme, five little piggies got cloned, and the American public got taken to market. The ATP gets my  ‘‘Porker of  the Week’’ Award. f BUDGET AND DEBT REDUCTION (Mr. SHOWS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2000
61,,106,-0.092,3,2000-03-23,Mr. SHOWS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the upcoming budget debate and the opportunity we have to pay off our debt. Did my colleagues know that reducing our national debt would provide a tax cut in itself to millions of Americans because it will restrain and lower interest rates? Did my colleagues know that more than 25 percent of our individual income taxes go to paying off interest on our national debt? We can greatly restructure our budget and get our real tax savings to America if we pay off the debt now. Did my colleagues know that more than $1.2 trillion is held by foreign investors? In 1998, the U.S. Government paid $91 billion in interest payments to these foreign investors. We must reduce this drain and create a stronger global economy for American business and agriculture. This is the right thing to do. Let us give our children a strong America. Let us pay off the national debt. I urge everyone to take an honest look at the Blue Dog Coalition’s proposal. I believe it would put us on the right track. f SOUND ENERGY POLICY NEEDED FOR ECONOMY, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND LOWER GAS PRICES (Ms. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) ",2000
62,,106,0.384,3,2000-03-23,Ms. DUNN.," Mr. Speaker, working Americans across the country are paying the highest prices at the pump at any time since World War II. More and more of their hard-earned dollars are spent on gasoline, leaving far less dollars to be spent on their loved ones. But the lack of any energy policy by the Clinton-Gore administration has put not only our economic security at risk but our national security as well. The United States relies on foreign imports at this point for 56 percent of its crude oil needs today. That compares to 35 percent during the Arab oil embargo in 1973. Think what that would mean to the United States if that supply were suddenly cut off. The Clinton-Gore energy policy will just make things worse before they get better. The Department of Energy estimates  that  in  20 years  the United States will be dependent on foreign imports for 65 percent of our crude oil needs. We must have a sound energy policy to provide for America’s economic and national security interests and lower prices at the pumps. f SUPPORT THE STAMP OUT CANCER REAUTHORIZATION ACT (Mr. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.) ",2000
63,,106,0.331,3,2000-03-23,Mr. BASS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Stamp Out Cancer Reauthorization Act. Now, this bill would extend for an additional 2 years the breast cancer research stamp program enacted by us in the last Congress. Now, this is a 40-cent stamp used normally for 33-cent postage. The excess revenue raised is used to provide funding for breast cancer research at NIH. As of last month, almost 160 million stamps had been sold, raising $11.3 million for breast cancer research. 182,800 new cases of breast cancer are estimated  for the year 2000; and, sadly VerDate 20-MAR-2000 00:47 Mar 24, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K23MR7.006 pfrm02 PsN: H23PT1 ",2000
64,,106,-0.488,10,2000-03-23,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me time to speak in opposition to this rule. Mr. Speaker, this rule is restrictive. Although there are claims that it is allowing all debate on all points of view, it, in fact, does not do that. I  spent a considerable amount of time with my staff putting together a substitute amendment that certainly would have allowed this debate to be expanded out to talk about tax fairness and the kind of investments we need to keep our economic growth and to keep families secure in this country. I think it was a point of view that deserved to be debated, deliberated and voted upon. We ought not to have just a debate about whether we are going to have incredibly huge tax cuts that favor only a small segment of already wealthy individuals and corporations, or a situation where people talk about taxing some more. We have within this trillions of dollars of budget a huge amount of unnecessary  and  unwarranted  advantages that are given to special interests. If we were to recapture those, we can do the two things that we need to do in this country, invest in our economic growth, in education and job training, in health care and retirement security, and research and development, in infrastructure, and, at the same time, have the kind of fairness we need. Mr. Speaker, we need to have this process go back to the drawing board and come out again. ",2000
65,,106,-0.263,10,2000-03-23,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I do not have a problem with the rule, but I do have a problem with the budget resolution offered by the Republican  Party  today. Yogi Berra should be with us here today, because it is ‘‘deja vu all over again.’’ Last year it was a $800 billion risky tax cut scheme, this year it is a $1 trillion 10-year risky tax cut scheme. You would think that the Republican leadership would get it eventually and start listening to the American people about where our priorities should lie. But the problem is not that they do not get it, the problem is that they cannot sell it. They could not sell it last year when it was a $800 billion tax cut, they are not going to be able to sell it this year with a $1 trillion tax cut. They can’t sell it because the American people won’t buy it. The American people understand  if these projected budget surpluses do in fact materialize, although there is no guarantee they will, now is the time to take care of existing obligations, to shore up Social Security, Medicare, and pay down the $5.7 trillion national debt. That is the fiscally  responsible and  fiscally disciplined approach. It is sad that when the Republican leadership and members on the committee had an opportunity to vote for their  presidential  nominee’s  fiscal plan, a $1.5 trillion tax cut scheme, they were all ducking for cover, hiding under their desks and trying to flee the budget room in order to avoid having to vote on that issue. But the saddest commentary of all is that a contemporary American comic strip is more reflective of the values of the American people today than the governing majority party in the House of Representatives. I do not know how many of my colleagues had the opportunity to see the Doonesbury article that appeared about a week ago, but I think it tells the story very, very well. It opens up with a scene of men with one guy saying, ‘‘Heads up, he is coming this way.’’ Another  gentleman,  make eye contact.’’ And an empty hat, which I suppose depicts Governor Bush. Then Governor Bush saying, ‘‘Hi, fellows, I’m George Bush and I’m asking for your support. If you vote for me I will give a huge tax cut. How is that for a straight deal, huh?’’ ‘‘Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I can see how the wealthy might get excited. They’d be averaging  $50,000. But  it ‘‘Try  not  to wouldn’t mean much to a guy in my bracket.’’ Another gentleman says, ‘‘Besides, I care a lot more about shoring up Social Security  and Medicare  and  paying down the national debt.’’ ‘‘Yeah,  didn’t  fiscal  responsibility used to be a Republican issue?’’ Then Governor Bush: ‘‘But, but, you do not understand. I am offering you something  for nothing. Free money. Don’t you want free money?’’ Then another gentleman: ‘‘Sure, but not until we pay our bills.’’ ‘‘Right.’’ Governor Bush: ‘‘What is the matter with this country?’’ The last gentleman: ‘‘I guess we have grown up a lot as a people. I know I have.’’ Now, I am not saying the Doonesbury comic strip should set fiscal policy in this Nation, but I do believe, sadly, this comic strip better reflects the values of the American people and why we should support the Democratic alternative today. I certainly didn’t come to this Congress in order to leave a legacy of debt for my two little boys or for future generations. ",2000
66,,106,0.421,10,2000-03-23,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr.  KASICH)  SCARBOROUGH) ",2000
67,,106,-0.256,17,2000-03-23,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, we have come a long way in 8 years. We have come from a deficit in 1992, a record deficit of $290 billion and deficits projected as far as the eye can see, to a surplus computed the same way of $175 billion and that has underlaid this phenomenal economy. We are now at a fiscal fork in the road. We have wiped out the traditional deficit, the deficit in our annual budget. We have created surpluses in place of those deficits as far as the eye can see, but those surpluses only exist because of the way we keep books. We keep a cash set of books. If we had accrual accounting instead of cash accounting and if we recognized our liability to the Social Security program and  the benefits promised  to  those working today and to the Medicare program and the benefits that it entails, we would be booking substantial costs to both of those programs; and I do not think we would be in surplus. We would be in deficit again. There are many differences between our budget, the Democratic substitute, and their budget, the Republican budget. The resolution is on the floor today, but the main difference is this: we recognize our liability to Social Security and Medicare. They do not, and I will say why. Our budget generates savings, too. We have a cumulative surplus over the next 5 years of $48 billion; over the next 10 years of $365 billion. We take the $365 billion surplus, a substantial share of it over the next 10 years, and we direct the Committee on Ways and Means to provide legislation so that $300 billion of  that  surplus will be taken out of the general fund and contributed to the Medicare Trust Fund so that it will be more solvent than ever; we think more solvent to the tune of at least 10 additional years. b1315 We further direct the Committee on Ways and Means to reconcile legislation so that in 2011, 10 years from now, the total amount of debt savings that we are able to achieve because we have accumulated these surpluses over 10 years, the total amount of debt service, the reduction in interest on the national debt, will be computed, and that amount will then be transferred from the general fund to the Social Security trust fund for a period of years such that we can extend its life by 15 years. Those proposals have been made by the President. We put them in reconciliation language in our budget. They simply do not have anything. They are saying they are going to leave the Social Security surplus alone, and we are too. Good policy, and we agree. They are saying they will pay down $1 trillion of debt. So will we, using the Social Security trust fund. But we are going further. We are extending the life of both programs, and that is the main difference between us and them. We have shown in this budget resolution that we are presenting that we can cut taxes, by less, but significantly. We can pay down debt, $48 billion over the next 5 years, $365 billion over the 10year period in time. We can do all of these things and still provide for the reasonable needs of our country. $20.5 billion more for education, for example, in our budget than their budget. More for community development. In fact, they cut community development by nearly $2.5 billion between this year and next year. The Community Development Block Grant, the Economic Development Administration that means so much to many of our districts, they slice it, $2.5 billion. We plus it up. More money for law enforcement in ours. There is also an account that is vitally  important, because this  is not spending, this is an investment, more money for science, more money specifically for the National Science Foundation. You know, Mr. Chairman, when we had our markup in the Committee on the Budget, one of our Members from Princeton, from New Jersey, who is a professor of physics at Princeton and knows something about science, offered an amendment to the budget markup which would have added $2.8 billion over 5 years. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. HOLT) made that amendment, $2.8 billion over 5 years, $675 million a year to Function 250, which provides for the National Science Foundation. The Holt amendment was rejected. There was a compromise reached such that the committee did give him $100 million plus-up in the mark. But, you know, the arguments of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. HOLT) began to resonate apparently with the majority. Over the  last week, something happened. Last night, haunted by the persuasive arguments  that  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. HOLT) made in our committee last week, a majority had some kind of an epiphany, because they came around, and after rejecting his requested increase in NSF, they put $3 billion, exactly what he wanted, even more,  in the National Science Foundation function. Mr. Chairman,  in  light of that,  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. HOLT), to explain what we have also put in our budget resolution to accommodate an  increase  in scientific research and exploration. ",2000
68,,106,-0.631,17,2000-03-23,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished ranking member. Somewhere in this budget there is supposedly a reserve of $40 billion that is supposed to take care of Medicare and  the pharmaceutical benefit and whatever, but I cannot seem to find it. Could the gentleman explain to me where that is? ",2000
69,,106,0.129,24,2000-03-23,Mr. SHAYS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. SMITH), a member of the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Budget, so that he can respond to what was just said. ",2000
70,,106,0.551,24,2000-03-23,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Chairman, as this first point shows, this Republican Congress has ended the 30-year, $655 billion raid on Social Security. As the next chart shows, regrettably, Congresses of the past raided Social Security to pay for unrelated Washington programs. This was wrong, and this Republican Congress  has  done something about it. Seniors deserve to have their Social Security protected. First, Congress adopted the Contract with America that led to the first balanced budget in more than 30 years. We moved from $200-plus billion deficits to surpluses by 1998. But we knew and the gentleman  from Ohio  (Chairman KASICH) and  the Republican  leadership and the American public knew that we could do more. With their support, the House passed, despite the opposition of the ClintonGore  administration,  legislation  I sponsored, the Social Security lockbox, by an overwhelming 416–12 vote. As this next chart shows, last year President Clinton and ALGORE only agreed to set aside 62 percent of the Social Security surplus and proposed to spend the other 38 percent, or $52 billion, of Social Security on risky spending schemes. But we knew 62 percent was not good enough and refused to allow this reckless Social Security raid to continue. Even with the overwhelming endorsement of the Social Security lockbox vote, again this year the Clinton-Gore administration budget would have raided the Social Security Trust Fund by an additional $60 billion when the tax hikes and budget gimmicks were taken out. The budget resolution we are considering here today reinforces our Social Security lockbox for fiscal year 2001 and beyond. I urge my colleagues to support our seniors by protecting their Social Security benefits, vote for this Republican budget resolution. ",2000
71,,106,-0.172,24,2000-03-23,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Chairman, I appreciate  the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. SPRATT) yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Spratt budget alternative that is offered this afternoon. As a ranking member of the House Committee on Armed Services, I believe this alternative is the only one that addresses the critical need to improve access to health care services for our men and women in uniform and for our military retirees who have given so much to the Nation in the past. I also want to express my disappointment that the Kasich budget does not provide adequate funding for our military. In my view, it shortchanges the military by at  least $12 billion this year. But let me speak about the Spratt budget and the military health care. Today I speak for those young men and young women, their families, and the military retirees who have given so very much to our Nation, because they are entitled to the best health care available from our Government. The Spratt substitute is the only one that meets the obligation we owe our active duty members, our military retirees, and their families. I am pleased that the Spratt substitute embodies a bill that the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. ABERCROMBIE) and the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. TAYLOR) and I have introduced, H.R. 3655, to provide access to quality health care services for our retirees and for active duty and their families. H.R. 3655 is supported by the Military Coalition, an organization comprised of 28 nationally prominent associations representing more than 51⁄2million current and former members of the seven uniform services. The Spratt substitute provides for a comprehensive approach to address the problem of access to military health care, particularly for retirees and family members over the age of 65. It includes a comprehensive mail order and retail pharmacy benefit for all military retirees. It includes an expansion of the Medicare subvention program so that Medicare-eligible  retirees  may  be treated at military hospitals and have the cost of their care reimbursed by Medicare. It includes the elimination of co-payments for active duty family members under TRICARE  so  that our active duty service members will have fewer out-of-pocket expenses. It also  includes  expansion of  the TRICARE program to remote locations so the service members not near military  hospitals may  receive  better, more affordable health care. Overall, this Spratt substitute provides over $16 billion over 10 years for military health care. How many  times, Mr. Chairman, have we heard military retirees say, do something to live up to the obligation? This does it. This provides the money therefor. ",2000
72,,106,-0.176,31,2000-03-23,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to say a few words about the budget resolution. Unfortunately, I will not be able to vote for the resolution or any of the five alternatives put forth before us tonight, because none of them have a good combination of debt relief and spending priorities. The Republican  resolution offered by Mr. KASICHshortchanges important domestic programs by cutting non-defense discretionary spending by $6.9 billion over 2000 levels. This would mean  that over 300,000 students will lose their Pell grants for college, and that almost 2,000 FBI and DEA agents will lose their jobs.  In addition,  the Kasich resolution does not provide near enough money for debt relief. Virtually all economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, have argued that there is almost no better way of improving the government’s finances than reducing the debt. That  is also why  I am opposing  the Democratic, Black Caucus, and Progressive VerDate 20-MAR-2000 06:19 Mar 24, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K23MR7.091 pfrm02 PsN: H23PT1 ",2000
73,,106,0.238,38,2000-03-23,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I guess I should begin by suggesting to the gentleman from California (Mr. STARK) that that was about the best political speech I ever heard on the floor. I am not sure what it had to do with the budget, but it was a great speech anyway. The purpose of the Humphrey-Hawkins section of this budget debate is to reflect on perhaps what the economy is doing and what it is that the Federal Government has done in some way to effect that. I would just like to reflect on those thoughts for a few minutes here. Mr. Chairman, the performance of the economy in recent years has been very, very strong, and I think that all Americans have noted for one reason or another, either because they watched job growth, perhaps they watched the rate of unemployment fall, or perhaps they have watched income go up. But the performance has been strong and people are working all across the country. It is very encouraging. During the expansion, the Federal Reserve’s policy has been gradually moving to price stability and has resulted in declines of inflation, which is hardly perceptible today, and as a result,  lower  interest  rates,  and,  of course, the  lowest unemployment  in many decades. Those things have happened all at the same time. Now, let me repeat, we do not usually hear about low rates of inflation, low unemployment, and low interest rates all at the same time. That is a very interesting phenomenon, and I think one that we ought to say if we have done something collectively to make that happen that, maybe, we ought to continue to do the things that made it happen. The thrust of this policy has been very successful. Although I have some differences with recent explanations of Fed policy overall, over the last 2 decades, we have seen very successful economic growth with the exception of one 9-month period in 1990, 1991. The health of the economic performance has also generated higher  than expected revenues for the Federal Government. As a result, we get to have this discussion today about how we are going to spend money over the next fiscal year in the atmosphere of surpluses. State and local governments have also enjoyed a fiscal bonus from the combination of positive economic trends. The benefits of the United States economic growth have also been seen outside the country, and this has produced very positive results for the citizens of our country as well as citizens of many other countries. All of  this,  including  the  role of Chairman Greenspan, is more or less well  recognized by most Americans. What is less well known is the specific policy  framework which the Federal Reserve has used to achieve the positive results that I have just described. Chairman  Greenspan’s  exceptional leadership of the Fed is associated with the  framework  of  policy-making known as inflation targeting. That is right. The Fed has had its sites set on VerDate 20-MAR-2000 05:30 Mar 24, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K23MR7.093 pfrm02 PsN: H23PT1 ",2000

75,,106,-0.304,45,2000-03-23,Mrs. THURMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I sat in my office and I was listening to some of the debate today.  I was meeting with different constituents, all coming up to ask for different things because of needs that they have, and I was somewhat astonished that we kept hearing about how only the Republican Congress put this national government back  into  surpluses. Well, I quite  frankly do not agree with that. I just have to voice my opinion about that. I think that is just a real stretch here. However, I do want to say that I will not vote for the Republican budget resolution and will support the Democratic alternative for lots of reasons. Yesterday on this floor I talked about renewable resources for gas so that we could go on with solar energy, wind, biomass; and I think that is an absolute necessity for this country. I think the veterans’ mail order plan is absolutely something that has to be done, something that I have looked at and actually introduced. I think the extension of Social Security for 15 years, the Republican plan, does nothing in that area, Medicare by 10 years, and then the long-term tax credit for caregivers, and then also in education, reducing class size, renovation of schools, Pell grants, Head Start; we can go on and on. And as importantly as all of these expenditures are, so is paying down the debt. Mr. Chairman, one of the reasons I come here today is to talk about an issue that I think has become a national interest; and obviously, it has caught people’s attention, because everybody wants to talk about it now, and that  is prescription drugs. Last year my colleagues and I on the Committee on Ways and Means actually offered a no-cost program to this country to have a prescription drug plan that would have cut the benefit or to have cut the actual drug cost in half. It was denied. We never even had the chance to talk about it last year. Now, we have $40 billion in the Democratic budget, which I think is tied to a prescription drug benefit; and my understanding is that on the Republican support  the Democratic side they have $40 billion reserve fund for an undefined prescription drug benefit and defined only if Medicare reform happens. If Medicare reform happens, as I know some on the other side would like to have, it changes how we see Medicare in this country. It actually potentially puts us in a voucher system, some people like to call it premium support. So I cannot support something that is tied. Why, why are we going to hold our seniors hostage, hostage to Medicare reform to get a prescription drug benefit? Let us face it. We give them in the hospitals through health care already prescription drugs to make them better. We get them stabilized, we do everything that we possibly can, and then we send them home and we do nothing. So please  substitute. ",2000
76,,106,0.556,45,2000-03-23,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SAXTON), the vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee on which I serve. The purpose of this Humphrey-Hawkins debate here is to talk about the law and how it relates to the Federal Government; and for educational purposes, the Humphrey-Hawkins law is the law that governs the Federal Reserve. We are here to talk about how these laws impact our economy. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, in multiple testimony to Congress in both the House and the Senate, has said, and this is a quote from the chairman  of  the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, January 26, 2000, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee. Chairman Greenspan said, My  first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through and into a reduction of the debt to the public. If that proves politically unfeasible, I would opt for cutting taxes, and under no conditions do I see any room in the longer term outlook for major changes in expenditures. Let us review what we are trying to accomplish  in this budget. What we have accomplished just in the last few years alone is an unprecedented level of debt reduction, following Chairman Greenspan’s advice. In 1998 we paid $51 billion off on the Federal debt. In 1999, $88 billion paid toward reducing the Federal debt. In the year 2000, this year alone, we are dedicating $163 billion toward reducing the national debt held by the public; and next year as we project, we will be dedicating $170 billion to reducing the public debt, for a grand total of paying off the Federal debt held by the public to zero in 12 years. Mr. Chairman, this budget we are considering before us today is the most sweeping document this body has ever agreed to in a generation. We, for the first time in a generation, are stopping the raid on the Social Security Trust Fund.

78,,106,0.351,73,2000-03-23,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me  this time to speak about what is an excellent Republican budget. This is a good budget. Maybe it is not a perfect budget, but it has balance. It meets critical needs. It addresses crucial policy issues. It saves every penny of Social Security for our seniors. This budget provides generously for education, while stressing local decisions, local control, assuring opportunities for our public school system and for our children. This budget wipes out the national debt in the very near future. This budget restores our national defense and begins to mend broken promises made to our veterans and active duty personnel by this administration. This budget addresses vital health care needs, strengthens Medicare, and provides assistance  for  seniors with prescription drugs. Last but not least, the theme of my friends on the left is that Washington is more wise than the taxpayers are; Washington  can  spend  taxpayers’ money more wisely than they can. I respectfully disagree with this position. It  is my belief that Americans can make better decisions than Washington can about how they spend their own money. Americans, and my folks in the 8th District, deserve tax fairness, and they deserve more of their own money to spend on their own needs. This budget is good for North Carolina’s 8th District and it is good for America. I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ vote for this fine Republican budget. ",2000
79,,106,0.456,73,2000-03-23,Mr. GREEN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Right now we are talking about the so-called progressive substitute amendment. That term, progressive, actually means something very specifically to me, because I come from the State of Wisconsin,  where  the  Progressive Party  perhaps  reached  its  greatest heights. Our  two  statutes, our contribution  to Statuary Hall,  include Fighting Bob La Follette, really the father of the Progressive Party. I would also say that that progressive tradition is alive and well in Wisconsin today. All of my colleagues know about what we are doing in the area of education reform and welfare reform. Well, it seems to me, from the Wisconsin perspective, if we want to talk about progressive  themes  and  a  progressive budget, the budget that we should be supporting, quite frankly, is not the socalled progressive substitute, but is, instead,  this  budget,  the Republican budget plan. Because in my view that is  the  true Republican  progressive plan. Number one,  it strengthens retirement security. It protects 100 percent of the Social Security surplus. It sets aside $40 billion to provide for prescription drug coverage. That is progressive, to me. It promotes tax fairness, attacking some of the absurdities, some of the injustices in our Tax Code. It provides for reducing the marriage penalty. It provides for small business tax relief. And thanks to a sense of the Congress resolution that we added in the Committee on the Budget, it also takes care of one of the great problems that our farmers are facing in income averaging. My colleagues may not be aware, but as the IRS is looking to implement the income averaging plan from the 1997 balanced budget agreement, they will not let farmers take into account years in which they lose money. Well, I have news  for the IRS. Coming  from the Midwest, I know that we have lots of family farms who are losing money. b1930 That to me is a progressive plan. Our budget plan  strengthens  support  for science  and  education. We  increase education funding by 9.4 percent over last year; that is progressive. A difference between our budget and the socalled progressive plan is that our education funding is student centered, not bureaucracy centered. Under  our  plan, we  ensure  that money leaves Washington, leaves the bureaucracy and gets in the hands of classrooms and communities all across the Nation. We believe that our budget plan is the true progressive plan, because it seeks to make sure that every American will have the tools and the opportunity to pursue the American dream; that is progressive. Let us take a look quickly at the progressive budget plan. It is well-intentioned; however, it cuts $30 billion out of defense. How is that progressive? How is that progressive? How can you worry about progressive values if you are not secure? How can you worry about progressive values if your Nation is at risk? The progressive plan also raises taxes by about $151 billion over 5 years. How is that progressive? As we all know, the tax burden that we are facing right now is the highest that we faced since World War II. We are paying wartime taxes at a time when we are supposedly at peace. More and more families have to have two wage earners, not by choice, they have to have two wage earners just to make ends meet. And, yet, the progressive plan would increase their tax burden. My friends, I do not believe it is progressive. I am afraid I believe it is regressive. It is going backwards. It is going back to the days of tax and spend. Look  carefully at what our budget does. It strengthens the retirement security system by locking away 100 percent of the Social Security surplus  and  providing  for  prescription drug coverage; that is progressive. It retires the debt by the year 2013 to hopefully keep interest rates down and VerDate 20-MAR-2000 07:06 Mar 24, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K23MR7.169 pfrm02 PsN: H23PT1 ",2000

81,,106,-0.182,87,2000-03-23,Mr. TANNER.," Mr. Chairman, it has been a long day, and I think almost everything has been said, just not everyone has had a chance to say it. I think it would be wise to remind ourselves that a budget and a budget resolution is merely a forecast of future economic events with an attending set of priorities based thereon. It has been very well pointed out by the speakers before me that this country is right now laboring with a 13 percent mortgage on us. Over $300 billion a year. Now, my colleagues, no rational businessperson on earth, with a 13 percent mortgage on his business, would not make it a priority, when he came into some extra money, to reduce that staggering overhead. My colleagues say the American people are overtaxed. We agree. And the reason they are overtaxed is because they are lugging around a 13 percent mortgage  on  themselves  and  their country. Now, President Eisenhower said one time that he considered no money here in Washington a surplus as long as the Nation’s children had a debt. And I know that all my colleagues have a priority of tax relief for the here and now, but the Blue Dog budget has a priority for tax relief for the then and there. It is simply wrong to leave this country to our children, our posterity, with water so dirty that fish cannot live in it,  air  so  polluted  people  cannot breathe it, and a 13 percent mortgage on it that they are going to have to strain and struggle and pay for eternity. That is simply wrong. Our priority is debt reduction first, funding the programs we need to for the military; for the agriculture sector; for veterans;  for  education and  for health care. It is a balanced budget. Tax relief for some; but more importantly, tax relief for those who follow. This country will be stronger if we adopt the Blue Dog budget. ",2000
82,,106,0.314,87,2000-03-23,Mr. KASICH.," Mr. Chairman, let me first of all pay tribute to the Blue Dogs, because I think what the gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. STENHOLM) said early on is right. I think the Blue Dogs have made an enormous contribution in this House towards the effort of being able to balance a budget and pay down debt. I am, however, a little bit mystified with this budget because I have always felt that the Blue Dogs did not like the tax cuts because they wanted to pay down more debt. And in this budget they do not have the tax cuts, and they do not even pay down as much debt as we do. They went into the spending mode. We actually pay down $25 billion more than the Blue Dogs do. But I want to pose a challenge to the Blue Dogs, because I am hopeful that we are going to beat their budget, and I am hopeful ours will pass. I think my colleagues ought to like our budget. It does cut a lot of taxes, but it pays down a trillion dollars in debt; and it does restrain spending, and it does protect Social Security. So I would ask my colleagues to think about it when we get to final passage. But I also want my colleagues to know that today we unveiled, I think it was 170,000 general accounting reports today on waste, fraud and abuse in the Federal Government. And  the Committee on the Budget is going to start an effort to try to root out that waste in order to make this government more efficient. And we need the Blue Dogs. We need all my colleagues to participate with us, and we invite them to participate with us through the Committee on the Budget. If Members want to come and sit with us, we would like to deputize them. I  think on a bipartisan basis we ought to attack the waste and the fraud and the abuse, and set our priorities. And the things that touch my colleagues’ hearts, the poverty, they touch all our hearts too. So  let us prioritize; but at the same time, let us clean it up and let us do it together. ",2000
83,,106,-0.448,87,2000-03-23,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Blue Dog budget which balances fiscal  responsibility with  the need  to adequately fund programs addressing our national priorities and needs. The Blue Dog budget is a responsible plan that balances the budget and retires public debt without tapping into the Social Security trust fund. Mr. Chairman, I am particularly pleased the Blue Dog budget provides needed funding to expand the Montgomery G.I. bill. The Armed Forces  face serious  recruiting problems.  In order to meet our defense needs, the Armed Forces must have the tools it needs to draw men and women  into uniform. The Montgomery G.I. bill has proven to be the military’s most valuable  recruiting  tool. Unfortunately, the combination of a substantially devalued G.I. bill, which now pays only 36 percent of the cost of  receiving a 4-year college education, and expanded Federal financial assistance  to college-bound students without military service has crippled the G.I. bill’s effectiveness. Recent recruiting gimmicks such as psychedelic  humvees, Spike  Lee  advertisements, drag racers, or desperate cash giveaways are not the answer to these problems. Nor is conscription. Congress would  best  help  our Armed Forces by improving the G.I. bill. Providing access to higher education in exchange for national service is the right thing to do. A strong G.I. bill helps veterans and their families, aids our national defense, and strengthens the economy. Last year, my colleague, LANEEVANSand I introduced the Montgomery GI Bill Expansion Act (H.R. 1071) to ensure that our All-Volunteer Armed Forces had the ability to attract recruits, and, at the same time, provide veterans with the skills they need to better our economy and their lives. The Blue Dog budget wisely provides funding to expand the G.I. bill in line with H.R. 1071 and will restore  the MGIB’s value both as a meaningful readjustment benefit and an effective recruiting incentive. Mr. Chairman, the Blue Dog budget is good for America’s veterans and soldiers and is a solid blueprint for our Nation’s future. Unlike the Republican budget  that would  foolishly squander  the surplus,  the  responsible Blue Dog budget pays down  the national debt.  It will put the nation on a course to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2012 with a strong, immediate commitment to debt reduction. In addition  to  this,  it provides  for needed  investments  in our Nation’s health, establishing a $40 billion Medicare reserve fund that can be used to fund Medicare reform and a prescription drug benefit for our seniors. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing for veterans, soldiers and our nation’s future. Vote for the Blue Dog budget. ",2000
84,,106,-0.267,87,2000-03-23,Mr. MOORE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the conservative Blue Dog substitute to H. Con. Res. 290, the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, because it establishes a responsible fiscal framework for Congress to maintain a true balanced budget and to eliminate our national debt. The majority’s budget  resolution calls  for $596.5 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001, which is 2 percent more than VerDate 20-MAR-2000 05:51 Mar 24, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23MR7.041 pfrm02 PsN: H23PT1 ",2000
85,,106,0.473,94,2000-03-23,Mr. SUNUNU.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. This is a budget proposal that highlights the vision and the priorities of the  conservative Members  of  the House.  It establishes a clear benchmark for fiscal responsibility, for commitment to our national security, and for  lowering the tax burden on the American people. We pay down over a trillion dollars in Federal debt over the next 5 years. We offer tax relief for all Americans that makes our Tax Code more fair. We have a commitment to a strong defense that meets the priorities that have been outlined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we do not just set aside funds for Medicare or talk about Social Security. We make a commitment to real reform of these programs, to strengthen them, not just for today’s beneficiaries, but for future retirees and our children as well. b2130 We set aside every penny of the Social Security surplus, and this is an idea that while it seems somewhat new was first offered in the conservative budget 2 years ago. But we go further than that. We endorse proposals to let employees control a portion of their own payroll taxes, empower the individual to invest in their own retirement security, and give them the peace of mind that comes from knowing that that savings will be there  for them when they retire. We invest in priorities. As I mentioned, national defense, which over 15 years has been allowed to decay year on year. We saw our first real increase in defense spending last year. This budget increases our defense priorities up to a higher level than any other budget offered in this session. We make  a  commitment  to  veterans’ health care, $1 billion above last year’s spending. And we make a greater commitment to special education, the largest unfunded mandate on the books today, than any other budget that has been offered before us today, over $2.4 billion in immediate additional funding for special education, and make clear that this is our number one education priority to fully fund the special education mandate. And once we fund these priorities, once we set aside the entire Social Security surplus, once we set aside funds to  honestly  reform  and  strengthen Medicare and provide prescription drug coverage, then we reduce taxes in a way that makes the Tax Code more fair for every American. We eliminate the marriage penalty entirely. We eliminate death taxes entirely, not because we are concerned about one  income group or another but because we recognize that it is unfair to take 55 percent of what anyone in America wants to leave  to  their  descendants whether they are rich or poor or otherwise. We eliminate not just the Social Security earnings limit, but we repeal the 1993 increase on the taxes on Social Security beneficiaries. We expand  IRA savings opportunities, educational savings opportunities, and cut the gasoline tax, the tax increase imposed as part of the biggest tax increase in this country’s history that raised the price of gasoline at the pump. We roll back that tax as well. Mr. Chairman, this is a budget that is committed not just to fiscal responsibility and lower taxes, not just to a real commitment to national defense; but it is committed to reform, reforming and strengthening Social Security and Medicare in a way that we recognize needs to be done on a bipartisan basis. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2000
86,,106,-0.278,94,2000-03-23,Mr. DAVIS of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I think we have  finally reached the point in this debate where we are getting to the facts. And I think we need to start off with the central fact that has  finally been established  tonight and that is the size over 10 years with respect to the tax cut. Let me start by reminding everyone about a statement that was made during the presidential campaign that we need to honor, both Democrats and Republicans, or it will come back to haunt us. It is a statement by Senator JOHNMCCAIN. He said, It’s fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a surplus that we may not have. To bank it all on unending surpluses at the possible risk of the Social Security trust fund is our fundamental disagreement.

As one of the few classroom teachers in this body, who ran a chapter 1 program for 3 years in an urban school district, I am strongly in favor of this budget because of what it does  for education. We  focus on teachers. We focus on kids. We do not focus on bureaucracy. I am proud of what this budget does in terms of Social Security and Medicare, what  it does to pay down the public debt.

Cindy has faithfully served the chamber and its members for the past two years, and she has become an example  for other volunteers to follow. Her position with the Public Service Company of New Hampshire inspired Cindy  to become  involved with  the chamber in 1998. She was almost immediately nominated as the ambassador at various chamber events.  In  1999, Cindy became vice president of membership for the chamber. With Cindy at the helm, the committee increased its numbers by 20%. During this period, Cindy also co-chaired the annual banquet committee. This position required an extensive amount of effort in planning and executing  the celebration. Cindy’s participation  in any project guarantees  organization,  dedication and quality. She is one whose input is valued on all projects, and who desires to hear the opinions of others. She is truly a team-player, and was subsequently nominated as Chamber President for the year 2000. Cindy, it is a pleasure to represent such  a  valuable woman  from New Hampshire in the United States Senate. Mary Jo and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. May you always  continue  to  inspire  those around you.  TRIBUTE TO TERRY WHEELOCK ",2000
90,,106,-0.181,199,2000-03-23,Mr. BOYD.," Mr. Speaker, today, along with my  Florida  colleague Representative  I am  introducing  legislation that is intended to correct a boundary mistake made on a map in the Department of Interior’s 1988 Report to Congress: Coastal Barrier Resources System. The map was subsequently adopted by Congress in the 1990 Coastal Barrier Improvement Act. The St. Joe Company owns 45 acres east of the City of Mexico Beach, Florida. In 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the ‘‘Service’’) proposed certain additions and modifications to the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS). This proposal was accompanied by maps which depicted the existing boundaries of the CBRS as well as the proposed additions and modifications. However, while  the maps expressly reported to show the existing CBRS boundaries, at  least one of  them  instead contained a boundary  line  that erroneously  included about 45 acres of St. Joe property. Because the boundary was unintentionally misdrawn neither the property owner nor Congress was given notice of this action. In 1990, Congress enacted the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act. The CBRS maps adopted by Congress with the 1990 Act included the erroneous boundary  line  from  the Service’s proposed map. Several years after the Mexico Beach property was mistakenly included in the CBRS, St. Joe  representatives discovered  the mistake while examining maps at  the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Last year, representatives of St. Joe met with Department of Interior and Service officials  to discuss  the mistake. As a result of those discussions a letter was written to the Company from the Acting Director of  the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Gary Frazier, acknowledging that a boundary mistake had been made and stating  that  the Service would not object  to legislation to correct the mistake. Specifically, Mr. Frazier sated: The Service recognizes that in the 1988 Report to Congress the inclusion of the property  in question was not  identified as a boundary change for this unit, either in the accompanying map or text of the Report. Regrettably, this meant that neither the property owner nor Congress was provided with adequate notice of the boundary change reflected in the revised map for P–31. Therefore, because of this error in the Report and the equities associated with this specific situation, the Service would not oppose future legislative action to remove the 45 acres owned by the St. Joe Company from the System. The St. Joe Company has taken the proper steps in approaching the Department of Interior and the Service about this problem. Representative SCARBOROUGHand I are taking the next step in this process by introducing legislation to correct this mistake. It has been over ten years since Congress enacted the legislation which adopted the new map misdrawing the boundary of the Mexico Beach property. Therefore,  I urge  the House  to act expeditiously on this legislation. f SOUTHWIRE COMPANY’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY HON. BOB BARR OFGEORGIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, March 23, 2000 ",2000

Roy Richards, Sr. wanted to supply his mother and grandmother with electricity, and from that dream, he founded Soutwire Company in Carrollton, Georgia, exactly 50 years ago. On March 23, 1950, Southwire started cranking out wire with 12 employees. Two years later, the company had shipped 5 million pounds of wire and had doubled its plant size. Southwire has continued to grow, and has become a world leader in the manufacture of wire and cable. In 1992 Southwire opened the D.B. ‘‘Pete’’ Cofer Technology Center. For  the past  five years, the center has witnessed development of  the next generation of power  cables— superconductors. A  trio of 30-meter cables now provides power to three of the company’s manufacturing plants. Southwire continues on its path of quality assurance and will remain a giant in the world of wire and cable. I salute Southwire Company on its 50th Anniversary, and I am proud to count it as an outstanding employer, business, and community citizen in the 7th Congressional District of Georgia. f HONORING THE DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF JOHN ED MILLER HON.

John Ed has not only had a distinguished career with BellSouth, but he has also been an outstanding civic leader in the Middle Tennessee area. John Ed began his  long  telephone career with BellSouth soon after his graduation from Vanderbilt University in 1966. He progressed through a number of assignments in the Nashville and Birmingham offices before assuming his present position as BellSouth’s corporate for Tenand external affairs vice president  nessee. John Ed has also taken an active role in his Middle Tennessee community. He serves and has served on numerous civic boards and organizations, demonstrating his concern and love for Middle Tennessee. His tireless dedication to these organizations has truly made Middle Tennessee a better place to live. His leadership and vision at BellSouth will be sorely missed. I congratulate John Ed Miller on his outstanding career and wish him well in his retirement. f OIL PRICE REDUCTION ACT OF 2000 SPEECHOF HON. MATT SALMON OFARIZONA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, March 22, 2000 The House  in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3822) to reduce, suspend, or terminate any assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act to each country determined by the President to be engaged in oil price  fixing  to  the detriment of  the United States economy, and for other purposes: ",2000
93,,106,0.673,199,2000-03-23,Mr. SALMON.," Mr. Chairman,  it  is well known that, for close to a year, countries from the OPEC cartel and other oil-producing countries have conspired to steal from Americans by artificially  inflating  the price of oil.  It has had a dramatic effect on  the  life of every American and threatens the state of our economy. It takes more to fill our gas tanks, it is more costly  to  fly, and even grocery prices have risen significantly. For example, we pay an extra $10 every time we go to a gas station to fill our tanks. This year, increased gas and oil prices will cost  the average  family an alarming $700. In my home state of Arizona, higher gas prices will cost the Paradise Valley Union School District up to $60,000 more to bus kids to and from school this year. Unfortunately, the President’s response has been tepid at best. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson recently admitted,  ‘‘it  is obvious  that the federal government was not prepared. We were caught napping. We got complacent.’’ The Administration, which seems to have no problem attacking American companies  they suspect of being a monopoly, refuses to use its current  legal arsenal  to sanction  foreign countries that collude in monopolistic alliances to fleece the American people. Last year,  I requested  that Congress  look into OPEC’s price  fixing scheme. And  last night, Congress  took a small step  towards helping American consumers by passing H.R. 3822, which encourages the President to use his current authority to stop OPEC from inflating gas prices. But, I believe we can, indeed we must, do more. First and foremost we should have included a mechanism  in  this  legislation  to penalize countries  for gouging our constituents. Secondly, we should have repealed the 4.3 cent gas tax that President Clinton and Vice-President GORE included in their tax increase package of 1993. And finally, we should have examined cost effective ways  to  increase domestic oil production.

98,,106,-0.483,213,2000-03-23,Mrs. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a great privilege  to pay  tribute  to Phil and Charlotte Peterson, who will be feted by hordes of friends and admirers this Sunday, March 26, 2000, beginning at 6:30 p.m. at historic Miami Shores Country Club. If there was ever a dynamic duo that genuinely enhances the good name and stellar reputation of a particular  community,  then Phil and Charlotte would admirably fit that billing. Phil Sheridan Peterson, Jr. was born  in Sturgeon Bay, WI and comes from a very distinguished  lineage. Named after his grandfather, the legendary General Philip Sheridan, Phil faithfully upholds to this very day the tradition of duty to country and honor to God that buttressed the much-heralded exploits of his granddad. Growing up during the Depression era and losing his mother at the tender age of three, Phil had to quickly become the steady hand and exemplar to three other younger siblings, a sister and two brothers. His wife Charlotte, on the other hand, was delicately  schooled  in  the  appreciation  of music and the arts. As fate would have it, she met Phil when she was barely 12 years old, while picking cherries to contribute to her family’s sustenance at a Wisconsin orchard managed by him. It was indeed love at first sight, and as she is wont to say: ‘‘* * * from that day on, I’ve been working for him ever since.’’ As World War II unleashed its fury, young Phil,  then  a  fresh  high  school  graduate, unhesitantly responded to his country’s call to duty and  joined  the U.S. Navy. His  tour of service sent him to the Baltic Sea where he soon braved numerous air raids, sea battles and killer storms that wrecked havoc on his fleet ships,  tragically claiming  the  lives of some 1,200 brave Americans. Having survived the war’s harrowing ordeals. Phil Peterson returned  home  a much-decorated  hero  and thereby earned his rightful niche in the annals of the greatest generation of Americans who ever lived. Upon his discharge from the U.S. Navy, Phil went back to school to finish his education at the University of Wisconsin where he became an extraordinary feature on the school’s football and wrestling team. During this time Charlotte was also at the end of getting her college degree. Upon graduation  from college, Phil and Charlotte got married on December 27, 1947. Through this union they were blessed with  five wonderful children, who are now themselves successful and productive adult members of society. While they managed to get back and tend to the family Peterson orchard farm in Wisconsin, their adventurous spirit soon propelled their relocation in Florida’s Key West, finally settling down in what was then called Miami’s model community of ‘‘Liberty City.’’ Working as entrepreneurs for the first Harley Davidson’s motorcycle  franchise  in South Florida, Phil and Charlotte found time to immerse themselves in key leadership positions helping several civic organizations,  such as  the American Red Cross,  the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Easter Seals, the Covenant House, Toys for Underprivileged  Children,  St.  Jude’s  and Miami Children’s Hospital, Shelters for Abused Women, Miami  Rescue Mission,  Ronald McDonald  House,  Paralyzed  Veterans  of America, the Florida Motorcycles Dealers Association,  the Knights of Columbus, St. Vincent de Paul Society, and many local schools. Phil & Charlotte Peterson truly epitomize the preeminence of ordinary and decent folks who have tried to do their level best toward contributing  to  the amelioration of  their community and the welfare of their fellow human beings. Indeed, we have tremendously benefitted from their unique brand of tireless commitment and generosity. In  fact, Phil’s  first-hand experience,  thorough knowledge and solid reputation at Harley Davidson motivated him to address the varied issues  and  complex  problems  surrounding America’s  burgeoning motorcycle  business. Accordingly, his compelling testimonies before the U.S. Congress paved the way for shedding light on the devious schemes of fast-buck entrepreneurs who were illegally dumping foreign-made  substandard motorcycles  in  the American market. His  expert  observations subsequently led to the adoption of important pieces of initiatives that have now become our nation’s laws in this area. In their own quiet but dignified way, Phil & Charlotte Peterson have been and continue to be our  community’s  consummate activists. They genuinely abide by the dictum that those who have less in life, through no fault of their own, deserve the help of community leaders to help  them get back up and  lead normal, productive lives. Friends and admirers are oftentimes touched by their unique sincerity and selfless giving. The numerous accolades from various organizations represent an unequivocal testimony of the utmost respect and admiration they both enjoy from our community. Their word is their bond to those who have dealt with them not only in their moments of triumphal exuberance, but also in their quest to help us transform our community into the kind of a  caring neighborhood where  the young and the old, the rich and the poor, the mighty and the humble converge together to hasten the emergence of the spirit and optimism that nobly represent the true character of America. I am deeply honored  to extend my best wishes and utmost gratitude to Phil & Charlotte Peterson for what they have done to our community. They  truly exemplify a genuine leadership whose courage and kindheartedness appeal to our noblest character as a nation. f OIL PRICE REDUCTION ACT OF 2000 SPEECHOF HON. LOIS CAPPS OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, March 22, 2000 The House  in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3822) to reduce, suspend, or terminate any assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act to each country determined by the President to be engaged in oil price  fixing  to  the detriment of  the United States economy, and for other purposes: ",2000
99,,106,-0.389,213,2000-03-23,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Chairman, I am an original cosponsor of the Oil Price Reduction Act. We simply must take some common sense steps to  reduce  the price of gas.  In my district, which normally has some of the highest gas prices in the country, gas now costs over $2 per gallon. My constituents are hurting and need help. In its original form, H.R. 3822 would have allowed the Administration to halt arms sales to countries that are gouging American consumers by raising oil prices. But  the House leadership has weakened the bill and now it only counsels diplomacy. I’m all for diplomacy and have encouraged the Administration to forcefully engage all the OPEC countries about  this  issue. But diplomacy has  its  limits. Simply put,  this country should seriously reexamine our policy of selling arms  to countries  that seek  to gouge American consumers and hurt our economy. And to add insult to injury, these are some of the same countries that American men and women  risked  their  lives  for  in  the Persian Gulf war. Today, thousands of dedicated soldiers, sailors, airmen and women continue putting their lives on the line to keep Saddam at bay and these countries safe. I will vote for this bill, but we need to take a much firmer stance with the OPEC nations. For example, while the original bill would allow the administration  to  restrict arms sales,  I might have gone further and required that arm sales be halted. Amendments  to  that effect won’t be allowed in today’s debate. In addition, I am very disappointed that the House is not going to be voting on other key issues to address high gas prices. I believe we should stop exporting Alaskan oil  to  foreign countries and  I have cosponsored  legislation  to do  that. While our gas prices have doubled over  the  last year, we send 60,000 barrels of oil a day to Asia. If not exported, this oil would go to the west coast. We should be voting to halt those exports and give American families the benefit of American oil. We should also consider proposals to swap oil out of  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Making available oil from the SPR could offset the shortages produced by the OPEC countries  production  cuts. This would weaken OPEC’s ability  to unilaterally  raise our gas prices. Finally, we should be aggressively developing  renewable energy sources and alternative fuels. This would reduce our reliance on foreign fuels, while at the same time helping to preserve our environment. But we must also make sure we don’t do certain things that would not lower the price of gas, but would reduce safety on our roads and threaten the Central Coast economy and environment. For example, some have advocated getting rid of the 4.3 cents federal gas tax. That won’t help consumers who have seen a gallon of gas double in price. And it would cost California alone over $1.7 billion over the next 2 years in funds to build and maintain our roads and bridges. This funding has provided for the VerDate 20<MAR>2000 07:59 Mar 24, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23MR8.063 pfrm08 PsN: E23PT1 ",2000

",2000
101,,106,-0.553,9,2000-04-03,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 278,  to authorize use of  the Capitol Grounds for the National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service. President Kennedy proclaimed May 15th as National Peace Officers’ Memorial Day. Each year on May 15th, we, as a Nation, have an opportunity to honor the devotion with which peace officers perform their daily task of protecting us, our  families, our coworkers, and friends. There are approximately 700,000 sworn law enforcement  officers  serving  the American public today. During 1999, 134 peace officers were killed in the line of duty. In addition, approximately 65,000 officers are assaulted each year, with 23,000 sustaining serious injury. It  is most  fitting and proper  to honor  the lives, sacrifices, and public service of our brave peace officers. I urge support and adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 278. ",2000
102,,106,0.627,16,2000-04-03,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I will vote for H. Res. 429 because I agree that it is right and proper for this House to condemn the racist and xenophobic statements of Jeorg Haider, who until a few weeks ago was the leader of  the Austrian Freedom Party. Mr. Haider’s statements and political activity relating  to Austria’s past are alarming. Clearly, many in Austria have yet to come to grips with Austria’s Nazi past. That Haider, a governor of a province and the head of a major political party, went to a reunion of SS veterans (and praised  them)  is  unforgivable  and  should sound alarm bells. In some of his statements that I have read, Haider is trying to create a moral equivalency between  wartime  deaths  and  destruction caused by the Allies during the war, and the crimes and mass genocide caused by Hitler and his henchmen (including many Austrians). This mindset  is delusional.  It deserves  the forceful condemnation contained in this resolution, and  I  join  the  resolution’s author, Mr. LANTOS, who could not be here today, in support of this resolution. I see Haider as an Austrian version of David Duke, someone who is hiding his respect for an historic movement  that was monstrously evil. This is obviously the result of nationalistic emotions  that are  totally negative and can have serious consequences, and thus should be of utmost concern. Yes, Haider is no Nazi. But yes, it is clear that he has sympathy for them. While I agree with the part of this resolution condemning Mr. Haider’s views, I am uncertain whether those views reflect the mindset of the Austrian Freedom Party or the people who voted  for  them. Furthermore,  this  resolution states  that Haider and his party have  ‘‘expressed  fundamental disagreement with  the principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights.’’ I don’t believe the evidence supports this charge. The reports that I have read  indicate, on  the contrary,  that notwithstanding  the reprehensible statements of  its former leader, the Freedom Party is, in fact, a democratic party that supports freedom; and that where and when  they have been  in power, they have respected human rights. The resolution also states that the Freedom Party has been associated with unspecified ‘‘xenophobic,  racist policies,’’ not  just statements. To the degree that that is true, then this Congress  rightfully condemns whatever those policies are. However, many of us voting for this resolution, perhaps a majority voting for it, have no complaint with Austria running its own immigration policy in a way it believes consistent with the best interests of the Austrian people. Americans, especially  this Californian, are proud of America’s melting pot that  includes people of every  race,  religion and ethnic background. Diversity and freedom is  the culture of America.  If other countries, like Austria, desire an immigration policy that maintains traditional patterns and culture, rather than becoming a melting pot like the United States,  they have every right  to  immigration laws consistent with that goal. The immigration policies advocated by  the Freedom Party,  I would note, are very similar to the actual immigration laws of Israel, Switzerland, Australia, Japan and several other democratic countries. If it’s not considered xenophobic and racist for Israel and Japan to have such laws, then it shouldn’t be considered xenophobic and racist to propose them in Austria. Of course this resolution does not specify which policies are xenophobic and racist. If there are such policies, I certainly agree to condemning them. Mr. Speaker,  this  resolution  reaffirms  that Austrian people have  the  right  ‘‘to express their political views through a democratic election.’’ More than that, they have the right to choose who will govern them, even if we disagree with  the people  they  choose. This House is the greatest representative body in the world. We would never suggest  that an election not determine who governs a nation. Yes, by all means, let’s condemn the horrific statements of Mr. Haider and any  racist or xenophobic policies that are part of the Austrian Freedom Party’s agenda, if such policies are part of their agenda. But many of those voting for this resolution, again, perhaps a majority, are not attacking Austria. In this last four decades, Austria has had an exemplary record as  far as a  respect  for human  rights and democratic  institutions. With vicious dictatorships and corrupt regimes abounding on this planet, it would be imprudent for this body to condemn Austria  itself. However,  it  is clear from the words of Mr. Haider that a significant number have not come  to grips with  their country’s part  involvement with one of  the most monstrous evils ever to threaten humankind. Any attempt to minimize this evil, to excuse  the  inexcusable,  to portray  the Nazi movement and those who participated in it, including Austrians, in any other way than despicable and bestial, deserves America’s collective condemnation. I was visited the other day by members of the Jewish War Veterans  from my district.  I am proud of them, along with the other members of the ‘‘Saving Private Ryan’’ generation, people like my father, who saved this world from Nazism and Japanese militarism. They then went on to stand up to and defeat Communism. Communism and Nazism were  the twin evils of this century. To claim or imply a moral equivalency to our brave saviors of the World War II brave saviors of the World War II generation is an insult we will not bear. This resolution, while I don’t agree with all of it, vocalizes our outrage at such rhetoric.  I have joined with Mr. LANTOSmany times in the past in condemning anti-Semitism, warning political forces in Hungary, Romania, Iran, Russia, and elsewhere that anti-Semitism will not be tolerated. Today, I join Mr. LANTOS in condemning an Austrian political leader’s reprehensible and alarming  statements minimizing  the  crimes and evils of the Nazis and their army and SS storm troopers. I ask my colleagues to join in on this condemnation. ",2000
103,,106,0.387,23,2000-04-03,Mr. BACHUS.," Mr.  Speaker,  much time is there remaining? The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. PEASE). The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BACHUS) has 91⁄2minutes remaining. ",2000
104,,106,0.453,30,2000-04-03,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, tonight is a very important evening because the University of Florida Gators will become the national champions in basketball. It is very exciting for someone who graduated from the University of Florida many years ago to see an exciting young team of freshmen  and  sophomores  that  are going to be successful against the supposedly more experienced team from Michigan State. So it will be an exciting evening, and I am looking forward to it. But  I am actually  rising  tonight, Madam Speaker, to speak about the census. We are in the middle of the Census 2000. Officially, this past Saturday, April 1, was Census Day, and that was the day we wanted to have everyone counted where they are. It is a chance to get a snapshot of America that is taken every 10 years going back to 1790, when Thomas Jefferson conducted the first one. This is a chance to not only count people, and that is the constitutional purpose, to count people where they are so we can do apportionment and redistricting in this country, but it is also important to get that snapshot because the Federal government has grown so large over the past decades that it is in need of information to help fund those programs. Today, over $180 billion a year of Federal dollars will flow out of Washington to States and local communities based on census information. In addition, we have the money that flows out of State capitals, whether it is in Tallahassee or wherever  in  the United States. The money will  flow to the communities based on census data. So it is so critical to our own communities to get the most accurate count and not get undercounted, because the money will flow; and it is not right if a community gets underfunded. There is money for education, there is money  for health  care,  there  is money for highways. And if we have people there using those services, communities want to get their fair share of the money. So that is why this is so critical, so I encourage everybody to complete the forms if they have not. If a census worker comes knocking on the door over the next  few months, please cooperate and get those forms completed. The projected goal is a 61 percent response rate in the mail. Hopefully, we will do better. I am confident that we will do better than 61 percent. Somewhere between 65, 66 percent, I think, would be a great accomplishment. I would be very pleased if we can get that high. Because the higher the percentage we get in response, the fewer people we have to send out knocking on doors to get that information. So if the forms do not get completed, what will happen is that community runs the risk of not getting an accurate count, and second of all, the Federal Government just has to spend money going out and knocking on the door to collect that information. And that is a waste of actual tax dollars. The Census Bureau  this year has done a good job in a number of areas. Paid advertising. For the first time in history, they have used paid advertising. And the advertising does more than just make people aware of the census. It is designed to help motivate people to complete the census forms. It shows this is important. It shows classrooms being affected, or emergency, or fire protection that is needed, and that is all related to it. The outreach efforts have been very successful. Census  in the Schools.  I have been going into schools to promote the census, and I think that is very useful. A  lot of Members have gone to public service announcements. I know many of my colleagues have developed them. I know I have in my area, and they have played often on the cable television. I know my ratings in Sarasota County is above the area in the State of Florida because of the response rate. So I am excited about the response rate so far, and we will know more by the end of this week. There has been a lot of controversy about this long form. And I know there is a lot of concern about privacy. We are always debating privacy concerning medical issues and for financial institutions, so the privacy issue will continue to be a problem faced by the Federal Government. But first of all, the questions, beyond the first core questions, which on the short form are the first six questions, are really needed for the constitutional purposes of redistricting and reapportionment. They really  are  important  questions  and they really will be kept confidential. There are very strict laws within the Census Bureau to not let any of that information out. Last week  the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. MALONEY) and myself were out actually helping with  the homeless count the other night. Before we went out with census workers, we had them raise our right hands and take an oath that we would not disclose that information. As Members of Congress we get all these other clearances for confidential information, but not with the Census Bureau. But there are very strict laws that have been enforced and will be enforced for anyone in the Census Bureau that discloses any  information. So I  feel confident this information will be kept confidential. Now, I know this area of distrust. I know a lot of people do not trust this administration  because  of  many things, but there are a lot of things contributing to it. My neighbor across the street was complaining because she had the long form, and my wife was helping her fill it out last week. One question she refused to fill out was her telephone number. Well, the State of Florida sold drivers licenses with photographs a couple of years ago, and so there  is that suspicion that government will disclose that information. It will not happen here. This information is not shared with the IRS; it is not shared with the FBI, the Secret Service. They cannot get the information. INS, Immigration and Naturalization, cannot get the information. So it will be kept confidential. So I ask everyone to please complete their forms. f THE MICROSOFT CASE ",2000
105,,106,-0.33,30,2000-04-03,Mr. INSLEE.," Madam Speaker, I am compelled to address the House tonight about the decision by the Federal District Court in the Microsoft case, and I rise today on behalf of two groups of people that I think deserve a voice in this debate. The  first group  is  the American consumers and the second group are the people who work and dedicate their  lives to the products they create for American consumers at Microsoft. I would like to address the beliefs of the American consumers first, because I will warrant that if we go out and we ask our constituents, Should the Federal Government break up Microsoft?, the answer will be a resounding no. From the State of Maine to the State of Washington, people do not believe that the Federal Government will help their lives, will advance the Internet, will  advance  software  one  inch  by breaking up  this engine of creative growth. And the Americans are right when it comes to this belief. American consumers are right in having the belief that this industry is healthy. This is not a sick industry that demands the physician of the Federal Government to come rescue it. And the evidence is clear: American consumers know that they are getting better products, faster products, less expensive products every day with Microsoft as it is currently configured. Look at the evidence. This industry has grown from 290,000 workers in 1990 VerDate 20-MAR-2000 03:46 Apr 04, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A03AP7.052 pfrm12 PsN: H03PT1 ",2000
106,,106,-0.386,37,2000-04-03,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I refer Members to an editorial from the New York Times on April 1. In it they criticize the congressional Republicans for undermining an accurate 2000 Census. They state, and I quote, ‘‘These comments are  irresponsible. Completing the Census form fully and accurately is not optional; it is a civic duty that is required by law.’’ I include this article for the RECORD. The article referred to is as follows: [From the New York Times, Apr. 1, 2000] CIVICDUTYANDTHECENSUS Some Congressional Republicans are seriously undermining the 200 census by suggesting that the national head count, which officially takes place today, is an invasion of privacy. That bizarre complaint could discourage the public from participating in a project that is crucial to the functioning of state and federal government. The question’s on this year’s long census form—including questions on household income, plumbing facilities and physical disabilities—have been part of the census for decades. The only new question asks  for  information on grandparents who are caregivers for children. In fact, this year’s long form is the shortest one in 60 years. All answers on census forms are kept confidential. Yet Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has suggested in recent days that people can simply ignore questions on the long form—which goes to one out of six American households—that they find intrusive. A spokesman for Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, has made similarly inappropriate  suggestions. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has said that people should fill out the forms, but that if he received a long form, he was not sure he would want to fill it out either. These comments are irresponsible. Completing the census form fully and accurately is not optional; it is a civic duty that is required by law. Senator Hagel now says that he does not want to encourage people to break the law, but will introduce legislation to make most of the questions on the long form voluntary. The federal government has spent billions of dollars trying to produce an accurate count as response rates have continued to decline with each decennial count. Accuracy is critical because the census is used to apportion seats in Congress, draw legislative districts within the states and distribute more than $185 billion in federal funds. The government uses information from the long form of the census to allocate money to communities for housing, school aid, transportation, services for the elderly and the disabled and scores of other programs. The data are also necessary to calculate the consumer price index and cost of living increases in government benefits. When individuals fail to give complete information about their households, they risk shortchanging their communities of government aid that they may be entitled to. That is why many state and local government officials are working hard to increase census response  rates  in  their  communities. The mindless  complaints  of  some  politicians could well sabotage those efforts. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Guam (Mr. UNDERWOOD), who is here  representing  the Asian Pacific American Caucus. Asians were terribly undercounted in the 1990 Census. The gentleman has been a leader on this issue. ",2000

Jack Brady, who passed away last week, worked for the House Foreign Affairs Committee for 26 years, including 17 as chief of staff. Jack’s personality suffused every activity of the Foreign Affairs Committee, from markups and hearings  to study missions abroad. A Committee Member could not walk  into  the hearing room without running into Jack, usually with a cigar  in hand, running down  the day’s agenda. He earned great respect from Members and staff for his vision and indefatigable tenacity. Mr. Speaker,  it  is no exaggeration  to say that Jack Brady was essential  to  the operations of our Foreign Affairs Committee—now known as  the  International Relations Committee—from the drafting of legislation to the filling of  the water pitchers. From 1976  to 1993, he was the personification of our Committee. Jack was extraordinarily highly qualified for his job. He had a doctorate in international relations from the London School of Economics and a master’s degree from Notre Dame. He was a combat veteran of World War II, having served as an enlisted soldier in Europe. He retired after 21 years of active duty in the U.S. Army as a Lt. Colonel. His awards and decorations included the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Mr. Speaker, Jack Brady was a man who took great pride in serving his country, which he did with distinction in a number of arenas. His service  to  this body was extraordinary, and I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring him and expressing our condolences to his family. f DEDICATION OF THE LATE JEREMIAH  F.

132,,106,0.36,15,2000-04-11,Mr. EHRLICH.," Mr. Speaker,  quick points. One, congratulations to the chairman, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MCCOLLUM). It is a terrific bill. Secondly, I share concerns with respect  to mandatory minimum  sentences. However, when  it deals with gun-toting criminals,  felons who are caught with guns, minimum mandatory sentences are clearly appropriate. Third,  contrary  to what we  just heard, the NRA and Handgun Control supports Project Exile. Handgun Control supports Project Exile. Fourth, contrary to what we  just heard with respect to allowable uses under Project Exile, under this bill we have police prosecutors, courts, probation officers, the juvenile justice sysfive tem, prison expansion, criminal history record  improvements, and case management program innovation. They are allowable uses under this bill. Fifth and finally, Mr. Speaker, my personal road here  is an  interesting one. I have complained an awful lot in this House about the failure of both sides to talk about gun control effectively. I heard a year and a half ago about Richmond. I have gone down to Richmond. I have talked to the prosecutors, the Governor,  the  gentlemen  down there. It just works. It may not be the gun control agenda from the left, but Project Exile just works, and it works because  the State  legislature  is  involved passing statutes that comport with the Federal statutes so we do not federalize the criminal justice system, prosecutors work together. Egos are put aside, unbelievably, in this town so that State and Federal prosecutors work  together. Thirdly,  the private sector funds the communications effort that educates the bad guys that they should not carry guns on the streets. That is what the minority party opposes today. Mr. Speaker, this is a great piece of legislation.  I again congratulate my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MCCOLLUM). ",2000

139,,106,0.559,50,2000-04-11,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the gentleman from New York, the subcommittee chairman, for yielding me the time. I will admit the fact that the gentleman from Texas comes to the floor, taking what is a positive piece of legislation, and tearing it asunder, because if there is genuine concern on the part of those who represent all 435 districts in this House about campaign finance abuses, Mr. Speaker, the first place we should look is down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. DOGGETT) just mentioned China. It is a sad  fact  that  the President of  the United States, on numerous occasions, sought the help of the Chinese Communists in his reelection campaign. It is a sadder fact that the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party was active in soliciting funds from the Chinese Government. I would  just ask Members of this body, if we want to have a real political donnybrook and tug-of-war, we can do that. Never mind the recent amnesia about the fact that every tax bill debate here comes under a closed rule. So we debate the merits of the tax bill. If my friends were interested in genuine reform, how curious it is that no action was taken in the Committee on Government Reform,  the  gentleman from  Indiana  (Mr. BURTON)  in  the chair. How curious it is that no one reached out to a Member of this body on the committee of jurisdiction, allegedly.  I  received  no  communication from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT) to take up this alleged reform. But how much more important it would be to do the substantive work to help people. ",2000

142,,106,0.426,57,2000-04-11,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and  colleague  from Colorado (Mr. MCINNIS) for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the floor another package of tax and fee increases proposed by the ClintonGore administration for the fiscal year 2001. This  legislation proposes additional taxes and fees totaling $116 billion over the next 5 years. Now, this body a few weeks ago and the Senate  just  last week and this week, hopefully, will deal with the conference report on our budget. The thing to keep in mind is that our budget does not raise taxes. In fact, it cuts taxes by $150 billion over the next 5 years. Our budget protects the Social Security Trust Fund. Our budget pays down the public debt. And we did this without asking our constituents and the American public to pay one more dollar of their hard-earned money to the Federal Government. We think  it  is better that they keep their money in their pockets than in Washington. This resolution exposes the ClintonGore tax-and-fee package for what it really is, $116 billion in new fees and taxes. The President and Vice President  propose  84 new  spending  programs. So as maybe some of the American public have watched the nightly news, they may have said, how do they do it? I hear them talking about spending or taking down the debt and expanding the  size of government. Well, what they are not hearing is the fact that in that proposal is $116 billion worth of new  taxes  to do  that. That  is  the smoke and mirrors. This package  raises,  for  example, $12.8  billion  on  insurance  products which Americans rely on to protect their  families. Since  I have gotten here, I fought hard to eliminate the death tax. This administration has proposed a stealth tax on our children, raising death taxes a whopping $3.8 billion. At the time that the price of oil and gas have risen to historic heights, and now leveling off, though, the President submitted a budget which included $1.6 billion in new energy taxes. Congress has made an effort to help our senior citizens by  locking away their Social Security and protecting Medicare. Now this administration submits a budget raising Medicare premiums and other health care costs by $3.2 billion. This is what we are fighting to save them from. Now, I could go on with many more specific examples. But, Mr. Speaker, I will not. There is something in this resolution for everyone to dislike. I, for one, plan to demonstrate my opposition  to  this  tax package and these fee increases; and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘no’’ to these fees and tax increases. ",2000
143,,106,-0.514,57,2000-04-11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a great honor for me to be a part of the Committee on Ways and Means and see that the Republican leadership is now sharing the tax writing authority with other members on their side. This, I think, is good and healthy. That way, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means does not have the responsibility of having to explain this tomfoolery that we are dealing with on the floor today. Because it just seems to me that anybody on our committee that would be talking about the President’s  tax  revenue  raises would also be talking about the President’s program. Because I would welcome the opportunity to vote for a $100 billion tax increase over a 5-year period if I thought for one minute that the majority party was prepared to repair the Social Security  system  for  our kids  and  our grandkids; if I thought there was just one  scintilla  of  interest  in having Medicare be held whole for those that follow up; if I thought this was the price that we would pay so that our senior citizens would have affordable prescription drugs; if I thought that this bill, which my colleagues  just pulled out the cost and the pain, that this would be something to allow us to reduce our Federal debt and the interest on that debt; if I thought for one minute that the Committee on Ways and Means was asking people to pay this increase in taxes because we were going to invest in our education system so that all of our kids, from whatever community, will be exposed to the education and the training that will be necessary  for this great Republic of ours to maintain our competitive edge in technology. But I do not know who would do this on our economy to just find out the cost of government and pull that out and say, why do they not pay for the pain when the majority party is not even concerned about the security of our Social Security system. Now, the reason I am not annoyed is because I know that they are not serious about this. And the reason I know it is because there are a series of socalled ‘‘tax bills’’ that would be reaching  the  floor. Far more exciting,  I would  think, and  far more creative and, of course, far more irresponsible is the idea that they are going to sunset the whole Code and they will do this on the week that Americans have to pay their income taxes. And I would suspect that when they go to sunset the Internal Revenue Code that they will say at some point in time in the distant  future they will substitute the Code with something else. Well, back in Harlem they call that a pig in the poke, that they do not buy what you do not know. And certainly they have not demonstrated the leadership to give us any alternative. I have been here on the Committee on Ways and Means. The chairman has no bill. The Speaker has no bill to substitute the Code. But we will pull it up by the roots and let America decide what we are going to do in the future. I know that they have to have something to go back home to at the end of these 2 years that they have been down here in charge, and so it does not bother me that that is the reason why they are bringing this to the floor. But it should bother some of the people on the tax writing committee that have to explain this. I mean, give the other fellows an opportunity to talk about taxes. But for those who have the responsibility to explain it, give us a break. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1530 ",2000
144,,106,0.231,64,2000-04-11,Mrs. KELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in support of the legislation before us. Today in the  financial services sector  the  laws,  rules and regulations of the 1930’s have little to do with safety and soundness of today’s banks. Before us we have legislation to bring some of the  laws pertaining  to commercial checking accounts into the 21st Century. While I do not consider  this package perfect,  it does constitute a reasonable middle ground to banks and industry which much be preserved as this legislation moves forward. This legislation contains a three year transition period that gives banks the ability to sit down with their business customers and decide how their accounts are best served. We must note that while banks have been prohibited from paying interest to their commercial accounts, they have been offering other services to attract their accounts. This three year transition period must be preserved. In this transition period we give banks the ability to expand their current sweep activities. Sweeps are a way that banks can currently pay interest on commercial accounts by moving a portion or all of the money out of the account into an interest investment, like treasury bills, which is then redeposited in the checking account at a specified time with interest. Currently, banks are only allowed to do this six times a month. This legislation increases this to 24 times a month so an account could be swept every night giving  those with smaller balances the ability to participate in these activities. One of  the  issues  that has  troubled me about this legislation is the new cost it will impose upon banks, particularly small banks. This is not the first time a bill with these provisions has come before the House, but in the past the cost of this legislation was at least in part addressed. Last year Laurence Meyer from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System came before  the Banking Committee and stated  in  this  testimony  that quote—The higher costs  to banks would be partially offset by the interest on reserve balances—end quote. The problem arises because the initiative that allowed Federal Reserve Banks  to pay  interest on reserve balances is not included in this bill now before us. I have introduced legislation with the sponsor of  this bill  [Mr. METCALF] and  the Gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. MALONEY] to address this problem. The chairman of the Banking Committee has been supportive of this effort by scheduling a hearing on this issue in the near  future.  I hope  that  if  this bill  is conferenced with a Senate bill  that contains the authority to allow Federal Reserve Banks to pay interest on reserves we could accept those provisions. If not, I fear that the cost of this legislation will simply be passed onto the commercial  customers  through higher  loan rates. Without the Federal Reserve Bank interest authority  the benefits of  this  legislation could be lost. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. ",2000

Mr. Speaker, I would  like  in particular to read the statement of the American Association  of Pediatrics, and that is that because firearms-related injury to children is associated with deaths and severe morbidity and is a significant public health problem, child health care professionals can and should provide effective leadership in efforts to stem this epidemic.

147,,106,-0.35,78,2000-04-11,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me  this time, and  I want  to commend  the chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BOUCHER), for bringing this important measure to this body. I stand in strong support of it and urge my colleagues to think as this bill moves  forward how America can,  in fact, be energy independent. b1845 We are two-thirds dependent on foreign sources of supply, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve offers us a temporary cushion here at home. I think, as the bill moves forward in the other body and as compromises are reached, I would urge my colleagues to consider swapping a portion of the oil that is in the reserve for ethanol and biodiesel, or even as new fuel is purchased and there is currently a gap in the reserve of several million barrels, to consider looking at ethanol as one of the ways in which America can become more self-sufficient in fuel production and usage. I would recommend a level of about 300 million gallons of ethanol and 100 million of biodiesel. Both of these are at competitive prices now if one looks at the market. And even if all of that were purchased and stored on farm, we would still only be looking at 1 to 2 percent of the entire fuel reserve being comprised of these biobased fuels. In terms of what  is happening  in rural America today, this is absolutely a way forward for our country. And if one looks at the State of Ohio, we are one of the biggest ethanol users in the Nation. About 40 percent of the additives in our fuels, as opposed to MTBE, is actually comprised of biofuels, ethanol being the leading one. So I would implore the chairman of the  subcommittee  and  the  ranking member, as these discussions proceed in the Senate, to please consider this. It would make economic sense. I think it makes defense sense. It certainly makes energy sense for our country in view of what is happening across our country with farmers facing the necessity of looking at new fuels. This is a wonderful new market. In addition to that, representing the coal belt of America,  from Pennsylvania through the Virginias, through Illinois, and so forth, I would also recommend looking at cleaning up coal and using the methane that can be spun off of that as another additive. I would hope that as these discussions proceed that those  in charge of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would also be  looking at energy self-sufficiency for the Nation as an imperative. I again commend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BOUCHER) for this measure and thank him for yielding me the time. ",2000
148,,106,-0.333,78,2000-04-11,Mr. BALDACCI.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. BOUCHER)  for yielding me the time and for his leadership in the committee. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman for his work in trying  to craft  this  legislation and move it forward in an attempt to reach out to everybody to advance the national interest. We appreciate that. I would like to thank my good friend and  colleague,  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. MARKEY), who was here when McCormick and Rayburn were here, as somebody else referred to in the hallway. He gave me that line. But I would also like to thank the leadership in the Northeast region with the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. and  the  gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. SANDERS) and the gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr. CAPUANO) and many other Members in the Northeast that have worked together bipartisanly so that we could work on this issue. There has been a gap in the authorization to be able to use the SPR and to be able to begin work on this reserve, but it is better late than never. This legislation is very good legislation. It is bipartisan. It recognizes that these events can happen on a regional basis. I guess to have been sitting in Boston at a summit that was held, in listening to the discussion go on, and to realize how dangerously low we were on inventory levels and to recognize that all jet fuel, diesel  fuel, gasoline and petroleum products had to be reconfigured into home heating oil, putting additional pressures on our gasoline market and  causing gasoline prices  to spike, we also were able to see how a regional shortage and concern was then developed into a national one and one which we are still dealing with to this day. So I think that this legislation is a good  insurance policy,  it  is a good beach head, it will protect us against those waves that come in again, and it will be able to help us to be part of a national policy that deals with a comprehensive energy policy that becomes less  energy dependent and becomes more energy independent so that we WEYGAND)  VerDate 20-MAR-2000 04:04 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11AP7.181 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",2000
149,,106,-0.281,85,2000-04-11,Mr. BISHOP.," Mr. Speaker, I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity today to take this time with some of my colleagues to pay tribute to the life of a good and a great Georgian, the late Chevene Bowers King. On last Monday, April 3, this House passed a measure, Senate bill  1567, which designated  the United States courthouse located at 223 Broad Avenue  in Albany, Georgia, as the C.B. King United States Courthouse. Oh, what a wonderful tribute, what a tribute to a life that has been given in unselfish service for so many people. Someone wrote the poem: GOODTIMBER ‘‘A tree that never had to fight For sun and sky and air and light, That stood out in the open plain And always got its share of rain, Never became a forest king, But lived and died a scrubby thing. A man who never had to toil By hand or mind in life’s turmoil, Who never had to earn his share Of sun and sky and light and air, Never became a manly man, But lived and died as he began. Good timber doesn’t grow in ease; The stronger winds, the tougher trees. The farther sky, the greater length, The rougher storm, the greater strength. By wind or rain, by sun or snow, In trees or man good timbers grow.’’ FORDBISHOP. We  Chevene Bowers King was a man who was great timber, he was good timber, and the legacy that he left in his beloved Southland is one that will be enjoyed and revered and remembered for many, many years to come. When we talked about  introducing the bill to name the courthouse after C.B. King, it was interesting that there were four chief cosponsors, two of them United States Senators from the State of Georgia, Senator PAULCOVERDELL, Senator MAX CLELAND, and  two of them House members from the State of Georgia, the honorable gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS), and myself, SANintroduced bills  in both houses to designate the courthouse on Broad Avenue  in Albany, Georgia, the C.B. King United States Courthouse. How ironic it is that two white U.S. Congressmen, perhaps the descendents of slave owners, and two African-American Congressmen,  perhaps  the  descendents of slaves, were able to come together with a common history in our beloved South to give tribute to a man who brought the races together and who helped to break down the walls of racial discrimination. Just as Robert Benham, Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, wrote a letter in support of legislation to name the courthouse, he described C.B. King as ‘‘A man who proved to be all things to all people. His vision, innovation, brilliant  legal reasoning skills, compassion, and courage  led to reforms that impacted not only the good people of the State of Georgia, but the entire Nation.’’ He felt that it was fitting that a Federal courthouse is named in his honor. ‘‘His leadership and legal mastery in several landmark cases established a groundwork for school desegregation, voting rights, and  jury selection reform. He worked tirelessly to promote equal access  to employment, health care, public facilities, and services on a national level.’’ b1945 There is no finer example of professionalism, he said, than C.B. King, extremely competent, a public servant, community activist, led the fight for the rights of all people; an organizer, a participant, an attorney for the Albany Movement. The Albany Movement was a series of demonstrations and sit-ins held during the early 1960s designed to help end discrimination and segregation in South Georgia and throughout the South. Dr. Martin Luther King viewed the Albany Movement as a pivotal campaign  in the civil rights movement. C.B. King was Dr. Martin Luther King’s lawyer, his  trusted  friend, his confidant. C.B. represented many noted leaders who were  forerunners  in the fight for equality; and as a result, he motivated  countless minorities  and women to become part of the noble legal profession. His shining example has inspired lawyers and judges everywhere. So I am just honored and humbled that I am able to come today to stand here in these hallowed chambers to pay tribute to a man who not only touched my life but touched the lives of so many others across Georgia and across this Nation. I have been joined by one of my colleagues who knew C.B. as I did, the honorable  gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS). In a moment I will yield to him after I make a few more brief comments about C.B. Chevene Bowers King was born October 12, 1923, in Albany, Georgia, the third of eight children of Clinton King, owner of an apparel shop and supermarket,  and Mrs. Margaret  Slater King. He attended Mercer Street Elementary School and Madison Street High School in Albany, Georgia, and after graduation he attended Tuskegee University and then he enlisted in the United States Navy. After his 3 years of service in the Navy, he enrolled at Fisk University where he earned his bachelor’s degree in political science. Pursuing his education further, he attended Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Case Western Reserve because for a young black college graduate in the South, there were no law schools for him to attend. So he had to go North. He went to Case Western. He graduated from law school, but unlike so many who  fled the South, C.B. was committed to returning to his homeland to make a difference, to try to break down the walls of discrimination and  the  racism  that  inhibited  the growth and development of millions and millions and millions of young people. So he returned to Albany, Georgia, and he started up the practice of law. He married Carol Roumain and he had a family; four sons, Chevene, Jr., Kenyan, Leland, Clennon, and a daughter, Peggy. C.B. practiced law for many years, and he truly made a difference. The kinds of cases that C.B. handled are the kinds of cases that inspired us and that ultimately transformed the South from a land that was dreaded to a land of opportunity and a land which now leads the Sunbelt in these United States. C.B.  is remembered, perhaps, most  for his  legal activism  in  the South. He became  the  leading civil rights attorney in southwest Georgia, being only one of three African American  lawyers  in the entire State of Georgia. He worked closely with the local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored VerDate 20-MAR-2000 04:04 Apr 12, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11AP7.202 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",2000

151,Senate,106,-0.309,120,2000-04-11,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I yield 8  minutes  to my distinguished  friend,  the senior Senator from Virginia.  ",2000
152,Senate,106,-0.266,127,2000-04-11,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am as upset by  the gasoline price  spikes as anyone else. Price  spikes  have been worse in California than in  any other State. Today, as I speak,  though prices have recently started to  come down a bit, they still average  more than $2 per gallon in some parts  of California.  Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose S. 2285, despite understanding the  sentiment behind it. The problem with  S. 2285 is that there is no way to guarantee that a reduction in the federal  gasoline tax will be passed on to consumers. Why is this? Because price is a  function of supply and demand, not  taxes. And right now, world oil markets are extremely tight, so prices are  high.  The way to relieve the pressure on  the market is to boost supply and reduce demand.  With regard to supply, fourteen nations sell oil to the U.S. under a cartel  known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. Like  any monopoly, OPEC controls the price  of oil by  limiting supply. Decreased  production in non-OPEC countries like  Venezuela, Mexico, and Norway has  also contributed to the squeeze.  Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law,  there are only a few things the U.S.  can do to encourage the cartel to increase  supply. The  preferred  alternative is diplomacy. Energy Secretary  Bill Richardson has had some success  on  this  front. OPEC ministers  announced  last month that the cartel  would immediately increase supply by  1.7 million barrels a day. Mexico has  also agreed to increase production by a  small amount.  It takes several weeks for production  increases to be felt at the pump, in  lower prices. And California has unique  problems affecting its supply. No other  State requires the kind of reformulated  gasoline that California does. So the  gasoline has to be refined in California.  And California refiners have had problems—including  two  fires—operating  their plants at full capacity. They are  at full capacity now.  Notwithstanding these problems, the  announcement of OPEC production increases has driven spot gasoline prices  down. They have dropped more than 40  cents, for instance, in the greater Los  Angeles area.  The spot price is the price of gasoline  on the open market without taxes and  other markups figured in. Spot prices  are usually good harbingers of  the  price movement we will eventually see  at the pump about a month or two  later.  But the increase in OPEC production  is, at best, a short-term solution. By  the middle of summer when demand for  gasoline will peak, we may be back in  the same predicament.  As  I  said a moment ago, S.  2285  doesn’t solve the problem of high gasoline prices. Under California law, if the  federal gasoline tax drops by 9 cents  per gallon or more, then the State tax  automatically rises to off-set the federal decrease. The law is designed to  protect  the Highway Trust Fund.  I  have spoken with members of the California legislature about this. They do  not seem inclined to change the law.  Even if the law were changed, the  price  still wouldn’t  drop. At  least  that’s what the chief executive officers  of the three major California refiners  told me. Collectively, they produce 70  percent of California’s gasoline. None  could guarantee that prices would drop  at the pump. They cited the  fundamental problem with supply, and also  pointed out that they have no control  over other entities in the supply chain.  What are our options?  The fact is, we have limited control  over supply. Too much of the world’s  oil  is produced  elsewhere. The one  thing we can control is demand.  The best way to reduce demand is to  require  that  sports utility  vehicles  (SUVs) and light duty trucks get the  same fuel efficiency that passenger vehicles  do.  If SUVs  and  light  duty  trucks had the same  fuel efficiency  standards as passenger cars, the U.S.  would use one million fewer barrels of  oil each day.  This  is roughly equal to the U.S.  shortfall before OPEC  increased production.  The Department of Transportation is  responsible for setting fuel efficiency  requirements under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE´) program.  Abut two-thirds of all petroleum used  goes to transportation, so boosting fuel  efficiency is an important way to wean  ourselves off OPEC oil and reduce the  price motorists pay for gasoline. Consider,  too,  the  significant  environmental and health benefits of higher  fuel efficiency.  But CAFE´ standards have not  increased since the mid- 1980s. And the  situation is made worse by a loophole  in the CAFE´ regulations. SUVs and  light duty trucks—which are as much  passenger vehicles as station wagons  and sedans—are only required to average  20.7 miles per gallon per  fleet  versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles.  Since half of all new vehicles sold in  this country are fuel-thirsty SUVs and  light duty trucks, this stranglehold on  energy  efficiency  has  produced  an  American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. We are going backwards!  According to the non-partisan American Council for an Energy Efficient  Economy, the U.S. saves 3 million barrels of oil a day because of CAFE´  standards. Close the SUV loophole, as I  said a moment ago, and save another  million barrels each day.  Overall, SUV and light duty truck  owners spend an extra $25 billion a year  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:13 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S11AP0.REC S11AP0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000

156,Senate,106,-0.443,162,2000-04-11,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, the  Teaching Hospital Preservation Act  that we are introducing today will restore much-needed support for the nation’s teaching hospitals by  freezing  the Medicare  Indirect Medical Education adjustment at 6.5 percent. The  so-called IME payments under Medicare go to teaching hospitals to help  defray their added costs of caring for  the sickest patients, training physicians, and providing an environment in  which clinical research can  flourish.  Under current law, the IME payments  will be reduced from their current level  of 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent for fiscal  year 2001 and 5.5 percent for fiscal year  2002 and future years. If these reductions take place, they will have a devastating impact on the nation’s teaching hospitals.  Enactment of this relief is essential  to complete the task we began  last  year in the Balanced Budget Restoration Act of 1999. Across the country,  teaching hospitals continue to suffer  severe  financial  losses. According to  the Association of American Medical  Colleges, even with enactment of last  year’s measure, the typical teaching  hospital will still lose more that $40  million in Medicare payments between  1998 and 2002. At the most recent meeting of the Medicare Payment Advisory  Committee, it was reported that the  margins of major teaching hospitals  dropped from 5.1 percent in 1997 to 2.3  percent in 1998. Notwithstanding major  efforts by the leadership of this institutions to reduce their costs, there  is  every reason to believe this ominous  trend is continuing.  In Boston, teaching hospitals lost $22  million just in the first quarter of the  current fiscal year, and Boston is far  from alone. The financial problems of  the nation’s pre-eminent teaching hospitals around the country are well-  known. Cutbacks in care for patients,  research, and teaching have already  been implemented by many of these respected institutions, and are being considered by many others. These teaching  hospitals  are  the  backbone  of  our  health  care  system,  and  Congress  should not stand silent in the face of  these distressing developments.  Teaching hospitals are  facing substantially higher costs for drugs, labor,  medical devices and new technologies.  The  tight  labor market  is pushing  wages higher and higher. Despite these  heavy financial pressures. Medicare is  scheduled to impose serious cutbacks  in its reimbursements to teaching hospitals. The result of this shortfall may  well be disastrous for these indispensable institutions.  A significant part of the problem was  caused by the excessive and unintended  Medicare reductions required by the  Balanced Budget Act  of  1997. Last  year’s Balanced Budget Restoration  Act delayed reductions in the IME adjustment. That relief was an important  first step, but it was only a first step.  The  legislation we  are  introducing  today will ensure that Medicare support for teaching hospitals remains at  its current level.  The pre-eminence of American academic medicine is at stake. The nation’s teaching hospitals provide the  highest quality health care to the sickest patients. They ensure the highest  quality physicians training, and an unparalleled research capability. In addition, teaching hospitals are the safety  net for 44 percent of the uninsured, despite comprising only 6 percent of all  hospitals. They perform a vast array of  services to their communities,  from  neighborhood health programs to drug  treatment programs to well baby clinics. All of these programs are in jeopardy  if the currently scheduled cutbacks take place. We cannot afford to  let teaching hospitals fail. I urge my  colleagues to join us in enacting this  important bill this year.∑  By Mr. BENNETT:  S. 2396.

157,Senate,106,0.331,162,2000-04-11,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to take a step in addressing the  long-term water  needs  of  Summit  County, Utah. The bill  I am  introducing  today,  to make a necessary  technical  correction,  authorizes  the  Secretary of the Interior to enter into  contracts with the Weber Basin Water  Conservancy District. This legislation  would  permit non-federal water  intended for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other uses to utilize federal  facilities of the original Weber Basin  Project for various purposes such as  storage and transportation.  In this case, the Smith Morehouse  Dam and Reservoir was constructed by  the Weber Basin Water Conservancy  District in the early 1980’s using local  funding resources in order to create a  supply of non-federal project water.  However, it has been determined that  there is currently a need to deliver approximately 5,000 acre feet of this non-  federal Smith Morehouse water in conjunction with approximately 5,000 acre  feet of  federal Weber Basin project  water to the Snyderville Basin area of  Summit County, Utah and  to Park  City, Utah.  In 1996, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy  District  entered  into  aMemorandum of Understanding and  Agreement to deliver this water approximately 14 miles from Weber Basin  Weber River sources within a certain  time  frame and dependent upon the  execution of an Interlocal Agreement  with Park City and Summit County.  The Warren Act requires that legislation be enacted to enable the District  to move ahead with this agreement  with Summit County and Park City to  deliver the water utilizing Weber Basin  Project facilities built by the Bureau  of Reclamation.  There is an immediate need for the  delivery of water to this area. The  Utah State Engineer halted the approval of new groundwater developments in the area last year. At the  same time, Summit County is experiencing tremendous growth; in fact it is  one of the highest growth areas in the  state. Within the areas to be served,  taxed by  the Weber Basin District,  there is a definite public need for an  adequate, reliable, and cost effective  water delivery project in order to meet  the future demands of this area.  Since there is precedent allowing the  wheeling of non-federal water through  federal facilities, my colleagues should  realize that this is a non-controversial  piece of legislation. Therefore, I hope  that Congress will move quickly to  pass this legislation next session and I  look forward to working closely with  my colleagues on the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources to move  it quickly.

I thank my original cosponsors on  this bill: Senators SCHUMER, DURBIN,  SANTORUM, SPECTER, MIKULSKI, SARBANES, and KERREY.  Our Nation’s organ procurement and  transplant system is in serious need of  change.  We  could  be  saving more  lives  through organ transplants in this country than we are at the present time.  The purpose of our bill and the goals  of our bill are threefold.  First, we want  to  increase  the  amount of organs that are being donated all across the country.  There are many more people who  need to receive organs to remain alive.  They need organ transplants, and there  are not a sufficient number of people  donating those organs. This bill attempts to address that issue.  Second, we want to bring greater  fairness to how we allocate scarce organs after they are donated.  Right now those organs are not allocated in the best possible way. And because of problems in our allocation system, people are dying unnecessarily.  We could be saving more lives.  The third goal of the bill is to seek to  implement many of the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:13 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S11AP0.REC S11AP0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000

America  is well aware that Dr. Jacobs is the founder and CEO of Qualcomm, home of  the CDMA wireless telecommunications standard.  In addition  to his work with Qualcomm, however, Dr. Jacobs is very active in San Diego’s technology community. Dr. Jacobs was named scientist of the year by the San Diego Chapter of Achievement Reward for College Scientists. Ms. Toni Nickell, the president of the San Diego chapter, said that Dr. Jacobs was given  this award  ‘‘because  of  his  great  contributions  to  technology’’. Specifically, Dr. Jacobs, as the CEO of Qualcomm, has been conducting research that would expand the use of cellular phones and make them the personal computers of tomorrow. Irwin Jacobs deserves our congratulations for a job well done. Thanks in no small part to him, San Diego County  is  the global headquarters  for CDMA wireless  telecommunications technology. I commend my colleagues to read this attached article from the San Diego Union Tribune of April 6, 2000 describing this most recent honor for Dr. Jacobs.

165,,106,-0.293,47,2000-04-26,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize one of South Carolina’s most talented journalists, Robert Ariail, who was  recently selected as one of the three finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning. This is the second time  he  has made  the  Pulitzer shortlist, having also been a 1995 finalist. Since joining The State newspaper in Columbia, SC in 1984, Mr. Ariail has informed and charmed South Carolina readers with a collection of original, insightful and finely-crafted cartoons. Having been a subject of his satire, I can personally attest to his talent. His work has earned him numerous national and international awards including the Overseas Press Club’s Thomas Nast Award, the National Headliner Award and the national Sigma Delta Chi Award.  I have  faith that three times will be the charm  for Robert Ariail and the Pulitzer; this prestigious award could not go to a more deserving person. f THE 150TH BIRTHDAY OF GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN ",2000
166,,106,0.311,47,2000-04-26,Mr. ABRAHAM.," Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the City of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which on May  1, 2000, will celebrate its 150th birthday. Residents of the city have been invited to  commemorate  the occasion with Mayor John Logie at the Grand Rapids Sesquicentennial Community Party, an event which will highlight the growth and development of a city that is still on the ascent. When a group of fur trappers, explorers,  loggers, and sod busters took a break  from their daily activities on May 1, 1850, to make Grand Rapids an incorporated city, the estimated population was 2,686 persons. The number of square miles that the city encompassed stood at four, the estimated number of city officials was sixteen, there were thirty two miles of road within city limits, and there was neither a police force nor a fire department. To be sure, the first mayor of Grand Rapids, Mr. Henry R. Williams, had his work cut out for him. Today, I think Mr. Williams would be extremely proud to see how far the city of Grand Rapids has come in its 150 years.  Its population now stands at 192,000 persons, and, when surrounding metropolitan areas are added to this, the  figure  grows  to  1,021,200. This makes Grand Rapids the second largest city in Michigan and the 58th largest city in the Nation. The city encompasses 45 square miles, employs over 2,000 city officials, has 562.81 miles of road within its limits, a police force of 379 officers and a fire department of 260 firefighters. Mr. President, I think it goes without saying that Mayor Logie also has a lot of work on his hands. The  City  of  Grand  Rapids  has planned many events to be included as part of  its Sesquicentennial Celebration. All elementary schools, public, private, and charter, will be  served birthday cake on May 1. The original city boundary will be marked with special historic 1850 signs. City officials have commissioned the designing of a parade float to participate in area parades, which depicts the Grand River and is fully equipped with jumping fish, fireworks, and depictions of historic buildings  and  neighborhoods.  Free coloring books entitled  ‘‘The City of Grand Rapids: Then and Now,’’ will be distributed on April 29, 2000. In addition, officials from the four sister  cities  of  Grand  Rapids— Omihachiman,  Japan;  Bielsko-Biala, Poland; Perugia, Italy; and Ga District, Ghana—will join in the celebration. A time capsule, to be built into the new Archive Center, will receive its first items. One hundred and fifty trees will be planted throughout the community to commemorate the birthday celebration. A beginning list of 150 historical sites in Grand Rapids will be released on April 29, 2000, and will be completed throughout the year. And finally, the Grand Rapids Press will publish four essays,  submitted  by Grand Rapids residents, as a tribute to the birthday, with the topics of these essays ranging from diversity to the city’s quality of life. Mr. President, in one hundred and fifty years, residents of Grand Rapids have experienced their  fair share of both prosperity and decline. At the end of World War II, the future of Grand Rapids looked bleak. Through the incredible efforts of thousands of individuals in the years since, though, the city has managed to turn the tables full tilt. As we enter the new millennium, Grand Rapids  is enjoying the greatest economic boom in its history. With  this  economic  prosperity  has come a remarkable turn in the overall quality of  life that residents enjoy. Also, it should be noted that Grand Rapids is one of Michigan’s most diverse cities, diversity which increases everyday as more and more jobs are created within city limits. The turnaround of Grand Rapids serves as a model, and an inspiration, to other cities, not only in Michigan, but throughout the Nation. Mr. President, I extend greetings to all those participating  in the Grand Rapids Sesquicentennial Community Party, and the many other events that have been planned for the celebration of the anniversary. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the City of Grand Rapids a happy 150th birthday. f DIABETES RESEARCH ",2000
167,,106,0.271,54,2000-04-26,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, yesterday, a group of 22 Washington State senior citizens boarded a bus in Seattle and drove to British Columbia in Canada to purchase their prescription medicine. Collectively, those 22 individuals saved $12,000 by taking that bus ride— an average of more than $550 per individual. It is stories like this that have taken place over the last 2 or 3 years that bring me here today. Every day, all across our northern and southern borders, Americans leave the U.S. in order to purchase products discovered,  developed, manufactured, and sold in the United States, but substances, prescription drugs, that are far less expensive in Canada, Mexico, and  for that matter,  in the United Kingdom and across Europe than here in the United States. My own office did an informal survey and found that for the ten most commonly prescribed drugs, prices in British Columbia average 60-percent  less than prices for the identical drugs in the identical quantities in the State of Washington. These lower prices don’t apply only in Washington State or in our northern border States. For example, Prozac, to treat depression, is 95 cents a pill in Mexico and $2.21 in the United  States.  The  allergy  drug, Claritin, costs almost $2 a pill in the United States and  41  cents  in  the United Kingdom. Rilutek, to treat Lou Gehrig’s disease, costs  $9,000  in  the United States and $5,000 in France. Now, it is simply unfair to impose these higher prices on citizens of the United States at the drugstore cash register, when  the  same  drugs  are being sold by the same companies at wholesale, at so much lower prices almost everywhere else in the world. What is the reason for this price differential? It is a simple one. Each of these other countries  imposes price controls on the price for which they allow  their purchasers  to pay. The American company, on the other hand, looks at the situation and says that price is too low to cover my costs of research and development, but I can impose all of the costs of research and development on American citizens. The marginal cost of manufacturing more pills and selling them in France, Mexico, or in Canada is really very small. So I can sell for half the price in Canada that I charge in the United States and still make a profit. The company makes out just fine. The American citizen pays the price. The American citizen pays the price more than once because the American citizen has already paid roughly 50 percent of the cost of developing that drug through our tax system, either through direct appropriations at the National Institutes of Health or through various research and development tax credits. Just on Sunday morning, the New York Times had an extensive article on a drug called Xalatan, which is used for glaucoma, an eye condition, developed by an NIH grant in the original instance at Columbia University, sold to an American drug company which did the rest of the research and development but sold today for one-third of the American price in Hungary, and barely half or a third of the American price in France and Canada and in the rest of the world. That is all due to the fact that these other countries are getting a free ride on the backs of American citizens, American purchasers, for the research, development, marketing, and sale of these drugs. Now, I have labored for the last 5 months to find an answer to this question, and my favorite answer to this question at this point is included in the bill. The bill is very simple. It builds on an almost  65-year-old precedent, which is the Robinson-Patman Act. In 1936, this Congress passed the Robinson-Patman Act and prohibited price discrimination, with very minor exceptions, in sales to U.S. purchasers from manufacturers and  from wholesalers, designed originally to prevent the big chain company  from getting such a price  break  from  the manufacturer that it could drive its smaller competitors out of business. It simply prohibited that kind of price discrimination. My bill amends that 65-year-old Robinson-Patman Act by extending that nondiscriminatory  provision  from interstate commerce to interstate and foreign commerce with respect to prescription drugs. Remember, this  law has applied to our American drug manufacturers for 65 years, as far as their sales within the United States are concerned. Now, if my bill passes, it will apply to their sales overseas, outside of our country. That will spread the cost of  research  and  development  fairly across all of the purchasers, not just the American purchasers, and will inevitably  result  in  lower  prices  for American  prescription  drug  users, which is exactly what we ought to do. We will give the drug manufacturers not only the opportunity, but the requirement that they treat their American purchasers  fairly,  just as  they have been required not to discriminate among American purchasers for more than six decades. As you know, we are in the midst of a national debate over prescription drugs  and, most  particularly,  over whether or not we should grant a prescription drug benefit to at least certain senior citizens who are the beneficiaries of our Medicare system. Just 2 weeks ago in this body, we voted on a budget resolution that authorizes up to $40 billion for such a drug benefit over the course of the next 5 years. I supported that budget resolution, and I will support what our proper committees report to us in response to that resolution. That will benefit one distinct group of senior citizens, those whose income levels are low enough to benefit from this assistance in purchasing their prescription drugs. It will do absolutely nothing for other seniors. It will do nothing for the 44 million uninsured in the United States. It will do nothing for the costs of health care insurance— for those policies that prescribe prescription drug benefits and, therefore, have that cost reflected in the insurance premiums at all. In other words, as important as it is to certain seniors, it won’t go to the heart of the problem—the high and increasing cost of prescription drugs. Part of those high costs are due to the great success of our drug companies. More and more, a greater share of our health care dollars go to the prescription drug feature every year because they are now successful in treating conditions that previously could not be treated at all or required hospitalization. We  should  hail  that progress. We certainly should support drug companies’ research and development of new medicines, but we should not  countenance  discrimination against American citizens and against American purchasers by allowing those companies to sell precisely the same prescription  in  almost  every  other country in the world at prices half or less than half of what they sell them for in the United States. I have been working on this proposition ever since a November 1999 cover story in Time magazine which first illustrated the stark nature of this problem and its costs. With all of this work and with my consultation over the last month with the drug companies themselves, which do not like my bill one bit, I have sought a goal. I am not wedded to a particular means. I think this bill is a good way to reach that goal, but it is not necessarily the only goal. I want the drug companies themselves to come up with an answer to this question. Members on both sides of the aisle have introduced so-called ‘‘reimportation’’ bills, which I find relatively attractive though rather bizarre. At the present time, my senior citizens can go up to Canada, as they did yesterday, and buy a 3-month supply of prescriptions for their own personal use and bring them back to the United States. But the pharmacy in Bellingham, WA, can’t go up to a wholesaler in Canada and get the lower Canadian price and pass  it on to that pharmacy’s customers  in the State of Washington. That kind of reimportation is barred, even though we are talking about precisely the drug that the Bellingham pharmacy is now required to buy directly from the manufacturer. Reimportation bills with certain limitations would lift that restriction and would  allow  the  bizarre  situation where  the drugstore  in  the United States could purchase an Americanmanufactured drug in Canada for less than it could buy it for in the United States. I think that solution may very well be the direction in which we ought to go. I am also convinced that there are other ways of doing it. I will say VerDate 26-APR-2000 03:38 Apr 27, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A26AP6.046 pfrm02 PsN: S26PT1 ",2000

In Nanjing, young Chinese men and women are being exposed to a quiet revolution  led by the growth of the Internet. A Times of London article, entitled ‘‘China Embraces Its Last Revolution,’’ underscores high tech’s role in opening up Chinese society. The article says China’s older generation now recognizes that the economic development on which China’s future depends requires a new openness to the world, the  encouragement of  the  Internet, entry into the World Trade Organization, and concentration on education and globalization. They know this will change the political and social balance of China. We can encourage this change. PNTR for China will maintain America’s technological leadership in the world and provide high-tech jobs for Americans. It will also provide the Chinese people with access to Western influence and ideas. The open technology of the Internet will force China to open their society to bring about positive economic and social changes.

170,,106,0.109,43,2000-05-04,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, after 16 years as the head of the New York Archdiocese and a  life of devotion, faith, and of  love  for  the Catholic Church and all of its parishioners, Cardinal John O’Connor passed on  last night. And as we say in the Catholic faith, entered eternal life. He was the voice of all of God’s people. He never forgot those in need. Soon after the Cardinal was ordained, he began an illustrious career in the Navy. Entering the Navy as a chaplain, he rose to the rank of a rear admiral after 27 years of service. He traveled the globe celebrating mass in foxholes and on aircraft carriers, spreading the word of God. He was a passionate defender of the rights of all workers. In fact, his father was a skilled interior painter and a union man. His  father passed  these views on to his son. And at a Catholic charities event not too long ago, the cardinal, who was a man of great humor, said jokingly, I told the Pope that there was only two requirements for the guy who replaces me. One is that he be Catholic and the other that he be a union guy. Cardinal O’Connor’s working-class roots remained with him throughout his career until the very end. His relations with people of all faiths were strengthened. He was a champion of the Jewish faith and helped the Vatican as it began to recognize Israel. His lifelong devotion to all those less fortunate and sick will not be forgotten. We will miss him terribly.

Mr. Chairman, this  legislation was introduced by the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. FOWLER) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN) and authorizes EPA grants for alternative water source projects to meet critical water supply needs. Water supply needs in many parts of our country are under increasing pressure. We simply do not have a nationwide program that is focusing on reclaiming and reusing water. This legislation addresses that gap by authorizing EPA grants for alternative water source projects. This bill has broad bipartisan support.  It  passed  the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure by unanimous voice vote.  It  is a very sound environmental bill, and I urge its support. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2000
172,,106,-0.416,50,2000-05-04,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, let me first congratulate the chairman of the committee for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank our distinguished subcommittee chairman for his great leadership and, of course, acknowledge our ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR) once again for providing great leadership. As our subcommittee chairman noted on the previous bill, this is a committee that works and it works in a bipartisan fashion and we are very pleased with that. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1106, the Alternative Water Sources Act of 2000. This legislation would establish a new program within EPA to provide financial assistance for alternative water source projects under the Clean Water Act. These projects would enhance water supplies by conserving,  managing,  reclaiming  or reusing water or wastewater, or by treating wastewater  in areas where there is a critical water supply need. As stated in the committee report, all the problems eligible for funding under  this program are within  the Clean Water Act definition of treatment works, and subject to the requirements of Section 513 of the Act relating to grants. H.R. 1106, as amended by the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, has a number of safeguards to ensure that water source projects supported by this program will receive appropriate scrutiny. First, entities are eligible for financial assistance only if they are authorized by State law to develop or provide water for municipal, industrial, or agricultural use  in areas with critical water supply needs. Second, the entities are required to contribute at least 50 percent of the project cost. Finally, projects greater than $3 million in Federal costs must be approved by resolutions adopted by either  the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure or the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. Chairman, eligibility for this new program would be open to all 50 States. However, language is included in this legislation  to prohibit projects  that have received funding under existing programs of the Bureau of Reclamation from also being funded under this program. In addition, this legislation would require the administrator of EPA to take into account the eligibility of a project for funding under the existing bureau programs when selecting projects for funding under this new program. This will assist in achieving regional fairness in funding these critical needs. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate  the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN) for her great leadership on this bill and the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. FOWLER)  for her hard work in assisting the committee in bringing this measure to the floor. I support this  legislation and urge an aye vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2000
173,,106,0.103,50,2000-05-04,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Chairman, traditionally our Clean Water Act programs have appropriately focused on how to keep water from getting polluted, and that makes a lot of sense. That is a matter of the highest priority. b1130 It is still a national objective to have all of our Nation’s waters fishable and swimmable. However,  less  attention has been paid to opportunities to reclaim or reuse water. However, to meet critical water supply needs  in some parts of the country, existing sources of water will not be sufficient. That is a sad commentary, but it is true. We are going to have to reclaim and reuse water. Water shortages are nothing new in the arid West. The Bureau of Reclamation has a water reclamation and reuse program for the 17 Western States and 4 U.S. territories pursuant to the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992, and that  is very appropriate. Some areas of the eastern half of the United States are now beginning to have water shortages as well. But due to the limited assistance available to water reclamation or reuse projects in the East, we are failing to preserve existing supplies of fresh water through water conservation and reuse. To address  this  issue, our distinguished colleagues, the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN) and the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Mrs. FOWLER), introduced H.R. 1106 to authorize EPA  grants  for  alternative water source projects to meet critical water supply needs. For all of those people who say, they never work together in Congress, they are too partisan, I say baloney. This is a good example of a Democrat and a Republican working together with a very productive  committee,  the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure, to address a legitimate problem in a responsible way. As amended by the committee, this new program will help all States meet these needs. However, projects  that have received funding from the Bureau of Reclamation are not eligible for assistance under the new authorization, and that makes sense. We do not want double-dipping around here. The bill also instructs the EPA administrator to take into account the eligibility  of  a  project  for  funding under the Bureau of Reclamation program when selecting projects for funding under the EPA program. Given the existence of this other program, we expect the administrator to recognize the importance of selecting and  funding projects that are not eligible for the Bureau of Reclamation program. Once again, we do not want to duplicate something. I want to commend the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN) and the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Mrs. FOWLER) for their fine work on this legislation.

174,,106,0.349,57,2000-05-04,Mr. REYNOLDS.," Mr. Speaker, we have had an opportunity to hear from a few speakers on the debate that do not favor this legislation. I would now like to introduce and yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California  (Mr. DREIER),  the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules, so he might comment on both the merits of the legislation but more importantly the merits of this rule as it comes before the House today. (Mr. DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2000
175,,106,0.478,57,2000-05-04,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  friend, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. REYNOLDS), for yielding me this time and for ably taking on what obviously is a challenging situation. This was not our first choice to be here under what is considered an expedited procedures rule, but we are here because negotiations were not going on into the night; it was staff paperwork that was really being completed well into the night. And while the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOAKLEY) prides himself on working  the Committee on Rules at 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, the fact of the matter is that some of the rest of us like to sleep at that hour, but the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. MOAKLEY) we  let him have that chance to sleep  last night and obviously it ruffled his feathers so he came down to oppose this expedited procedures rule. We are doing the right thing. As my friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL), knows very well, we have spent years working on this legislation. My very good friend from California (Mr. ROYCE), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on  Africa,  and  the chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on Trade of the Committee on Ways and Means,  the gentleman  from  Illinois (Mr. CRANE), have worked  long and hard on this. This is a very important piece of legislation. We have 700 million people in sub-Saharan Africa who are going to be impacted by this. We have a chance to improve  the quality of  life  for  the American people, and I believe that we have done the right thing in proceeding with this rule. The reason is that last night at 10:30 when we found that we were going to be doing this and we were assured that we could first thing in the morning make available on the World Wide Web a copy of the conference report, we did just that. If we had met at 5:00 this morning,  the difference would have been just a few hours, and while the gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr. MOAKLEY) would have, of course, after his morning run been at his desk at 6:00 to carefully scrutinize the conference report, most of the rest of our colleagues would most likely have waited until 10:00, which is exactly when it was filed. So this is really a question of whether or not we are going to proceed with important legislation that my friend, the gentleman  from New York  (Mr. RANGEL) and the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. CRANE) and many of the rest of us have strongly supported for years and years and years, or are we going to try and block it because, guess what, Mr. Speaker,  this  is  the one chance that we had to do it. This is our opportunity to do this. Why? Because we have lots of important legislation that we need to consider in the coming weeks. We have scheduled it for this week; and unfortunately, it took a little more staff time than we would have liked overnight to get the work completed. We have this procedure so that we can move ahead in an expeditious manner on very important legislation. So I encourage my colleagues  to  support both rules that we have and then to vote in favor of the conference report so that we can finally lay the groundwork for a win/win/win issue, which is going to improve the quality of life for the American people and our friends in Africa, and I believe make great strides in blazing the trail for an even more important trade vote that we are going to be having the week of May 22.

177,,106,-0.491,64,2000-05-04,Ms. KILPATRICK.,"  Mr.  Speaker, today is a great day. As my colleagues will remember in the 105th Congress, this House did pass this bill. The Senate did not. I am happy that in the 106th Congress  the Senate and  the House has now acted on the African Growth bill, and I commend the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Chairman CRANE), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL),  the  gentleman  from New York (Mr. RANGEL), and the other leaders for making sure that this is brought to the House floor. We all are a bit disturbed about the process that it did move quickly; but if my colleagues will remember, it has been on the House calendar in some form over the last couple of years. I was a cosponsor then, and I am a cosponsor  today  of  both  the African Growth bill and the Caribbean Initiative bill. It is time. And I applaud this Congress and its leadership for making it a reality and bringing it to the House floor. I visited Africa on several occasions, as many of my Members know, many of us have. It is trade that our countries need  so  the  children  can prosper in those countries, so that the families can take care of themselves, and so that, again, we grow American’s jobs on this side of the Atlantic. Mr. Speaker, over 300,000 jobs will be created with the signing of this law in our country. Many more children in Africa and in the Caribbean nations will find housing, health care, education services that they do not now have because of the stimulation of the business opportunities that this bill will provide. It is a wonderful opportunity to grow not only in this country, not only to satisfy and  fortify our own communities and grow businesses, but to do the same across the Atlantic and in the Caribbean. I applaud the leadership. It is the right step to take. The bill, the underlying bill must be passed. I urge my colleagues to pass the rule. Yes, we could have spend more time on it, but pass the rule and then vote for the underlying bill. ",2000
178,,106,-0.577,64,2000-05-04,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Speaker, everyone here  recognizes  that  sustained  economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to sub-Saharan Africa, but there is a crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa now has close to 30 million men, women and children testing positive with HIV/AIDS. Mr. Speaker,  the HIV/AIDS  crisis threatens the whole workforce in subSaharan Africa. Mr. Speaker, to have a successful  trading  relationship with sub-Saharan Africa, it requires urgent and expedited action to meet the HIV/ AIDS crisis. Less than 10 months ago when we debated this bill, the House added language, which I am very pleased that was added, to place emphasis on that, that addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis must be a major component of our foreign policy in all of Africa; that significant progress in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS is necessary to sustain a mutually-beneficial trade arrangement there; and that that HIV/AIDS crisis is a global threat that merits further attention through expanded public, private, and joint efforts and through appropriate American legislation. And, as I say, I am very pleased that that language was retained. When the bill went to the other side of the Capitol, language that strengthened the capacity for individual countries to have the ability to negotiate and determine the availability of pharmaceuticals and health care for their citizens and, particularly, with respect to the HIV/AIDS epidemic was added, and that language unfortunately has been lost from the legislation. Mr. Speaker, some 50 Members of the House  supported  that  language and asked that it be retained. I am very disappointed that the language is not there, because it would have greatly expanded our capacity to deal with AIDS  in Africa, which dealing with that is critical if there is to be a beneficial trading relationship. Mr. Speaker, I do intend, in spite of the disappointment that we have lost that strengthening language, the weakening of the bill in the conference, to support the bill and the conference report today. I simply want to remind my colleagues that as a sense of Congress we did recognize a year ago that the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Sahara Africa is a global threat and that we must greatly  expand  public,  private,  and joint public-private efforts through and beyond  legislation  passed  by  this House. ",2000
179,,106,-0.19,64,2000-05-04,Mr. DOOLEY of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. For  the  past  decade,  the United States has been an island of economic prosperity. We have seen the greatest amount of job creation, the greatest growth in our GDP, and we have seen real wages growing twice the rate of inflation. Times do not get much better than this. When we are in this time of economic prosperity,  it  is  important  for  this country to reach out with a policy of economic engagement with many countries throughout the world who are struggling. The bill we are voting on today is clearly that policy. ",2000
180,,106,-0.512,71,2000-05-04,Mr. BECERRA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, H.R. 434, and its conference report. First let me begin by acknowledging the men who made this bill possible. Certainly this is a bill that was born of sheer determination on the part of a number  of  individuals.  Principally those that I know of, the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL), who did not allow this bill to ever see anything but light; and certainly the chairman, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. CRANE); the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARCHER); and, of course, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), who I know worked tremendously on this bill as well. I would like to applaud their effort, because for many moments many did not believe this bill would ever get to the President’s desk. Certainly here we see that sheer will can get you there. H.R. 434 left the House in a troubled state. There were legitimate concerns raised over the rights of workers, the misuse of African nations as mere stopping points  in the transshipment of textiles from other countries trying to dump their products in America. But I am very pleased to say that H.R. 434 has come to this floor prepared for signature by the President of the of the United States. The transshipment language is the best we have seen to date,  the  textile provisions are  improved from what came out of committee, and the labor provisions certainly face us in the direction we need to be heading with all of our trade agreements. Our partners in Africa and the Caribbean deserve to know we are serious about our partnerships with them and that we are serious about building relationships that are meaningful and that they will work in the future. They are ready in Africa and the Caribbean, they are willing, and now they are simply waiting. Mr. Speaker, I will support this legislation because it recognizes that it is time for us to treat the African nations and the Caribbean the way we would treat some of our partners we have negotiated with for many years, and let them know we are with them in partnership, to have them advance and become solid, meaningful trading partners with America. It is time for this bill to become law. I am pleased to be able to support this legislation. ",2000

He gave so many good, concrete examples of the discipline problem we have in our public school system. It is a very real thing.  I appreciate him bringing this up and the fact that we know why we are having this, with all the mandates and requirements. I want to tell you a story. You talk about the discipline problems. I want to give a concrete example of how one ended up in doing a great disservice to the children of Oklahoma and other places. I have kind of a unique situation at home. I have a wife and two daughters, all  three  of whom  teach  or  have taught. My wife taught back in the fifties, when we were first married. As our four children were growing up, I remember so well the youngest one—I call her the runt of my litter—Katie, always wanted to be a schoolteacher just like her mom, and her mom’s discipline was accelerated math. So Katie was in school. She got her degree and got her master’s in math education. She  is  really an accomplished teacher, because she loves the kids.

188,,106,-0.351,183,2000-05-04,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President,  I would like to offer a few brief remarks to underscore several of the points that my colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, made when he introduced the ‘‘Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000,’’ a bill I gladly cosponsored. The first point is that Governors Island is truly a national treasure. It has played a  significant  role  in nearly every American battle from the Revolution through World War II. During the War of 1812, it is credited with preventing a direct British attack on the City of New York—then the Nation’s principal  seaport.  It  served  as  the Union’s foremost recruiting depot and as a Confederate prison during  the Civil War. The second point, Mr. President, is that its historical structures have been placed in no small degree of danger by the statutorily mandated Fiscal Year 2002 sale date. If the Island should be sold then ‘‘at fair market value,’’ there simply is no guarantee the Castle Williams,  Fort  Jay,  Building  400—a McKim, Meade & White masterpiece thought to be the largest single Army barrack ever constructed, the 1708 Governor’s house, and the entire Governors Island National Historic Landmark District will be protected. When the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was being negotiated, Congress  faced seemingly intractable, structural deficits. We had to make a great many difficult and, if I may, extreme choices to bring the Federal budget  into balance. Three years  later,  our  circumstances  are quite different. Fiscal austerity has paid its dividends and we are approaching an era of surpluses much sooner that we might have otherwise imagined. Should we still be proposing to sell off such an  important piece of American history? Finally, Mr. President, my colleague mentioned the issue of fairness. New York gave Governors Island to the national government  in 1800. No complaints. The British and the French were then poised to attack our young nation. Now the Federal government has no use for Governors Island—the Coast Guard found it too expensive to maintain—it is only right that the people of New York get their property back. The Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000 will do just that. In addition, it will establish the Governors Island National Monument which will provide all Americans—for  the  first time—with the opportunity to learn of the  Island’s  rich  contributions  to American history while experiencing the spectacular views of New York Harbor from this idyllic setting. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. ROBB, ",2000

190,,106,-0.326,190,2000-05-04,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to introduce the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000. Congressman STARK is  introducing a companion bill in the House. This legislation is, without a doubt, ambitious. It is a deliberate effort to try to ignite a national commitment to the goal of insuring all of our children. For some, that is an idealistic proposition that does not seem achievable. With this bill, I want to call on the public and my colleagues to consider once again the clear and convincing case  for  investing the necessary resources in the health of our children— and therefore, in the well-being of their families and our entire country. I will continue to work hard on every possible  step  to achieve  this ultimate goal, but with this legislation, I urge lawmakers, health care professionals, and citizens to recognize the imperative of reaching that goal sooner rather than later. Our children are not only our future, they are also our present. What we do for them today will greatly affect what happens tomorrow. Yet even though we recognize these facts, we still have not found a way to guarantee health coverage for children. Without health insurance, many of  these children go without health care all together. Children are the least expensive segment of our population to insure. They are also the least able to have control over whether or not they have health insurance. Yet we now have over 11 million  uninsured  children  in  this country. And this number is steadily climbing higher and higher every year. Our success  in expanding Medicaid and  passing  the  State  Children’s Health Insurance Program was a meaningful, significant start at closing the tragic gap represented by millions of uninsured children.

Mr. Karmon served as President of  the Bronx Chamber of Commerce  for  four consecutive  terms after serving on  its Boards since 1953 and holding the positions of Treasurer, Second Vice President and First Vice President. His dinner attendance record of 930 people at  the Chamber’s annual dinner  in 1979, with David Rockefeller as the guest of honor, has never been equaled. Mr. Speaker, along with Dr. Ramon S. Velez and Michael Munoz, Mr. Karmon created the South Bronx Board of Trade, an organization aiding the businesses of the borough, particularly minority-owned enterprises. Today, as honorary Chairman, he still continues his activities with the organization. As Chairman of the Building Fund Committee of  the Bronx Board of Realtors, Karmon was instrumental in negotiating the purchase of its present building in 1992. Karmon is also the Chairman of the Annual Essay Contest, a contest he initiated in 1975 among students of the public and private high schools in the Bronx and in Manhattan, for the Bronx-Manhattan Association of Realtors. A civic  leader  in  the Bronx  for 60 years, Karmon has been active  in many business, civic, health, service and humanitarian organizations. To name a few, in 1949 he founded the Prospect Avenue and Neighborhood Businessmen’s Association, Inc. and served as its president for 12 years. In 1954 Karmon served as Chairman of the Bronx Urban League Advisory Board, being a founding member of the Bronx Branch. His  involvement with Einstein College began around 1955 with the organizational committee that brought about this College of Medicine. Karmon and his late wife, Sylvia, are members of  the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. One of the founders of the Ponce de Leon Federal Bank in 1959, he stills serves on the board and is presently its Treasurer. HONORING MICHAELA K.

As a leader in the California wine industry, Michaela used her organizing and business acumen  to  found Women  for WineSense, a national organization promoting wine as a part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Michaela has a long history of involvement in wine industry issues. She has served on the boards of the California Wine Institute and the Napa Valley Vintners Association. She is currently on the board of  the American Vintners Association and  in  1999 was  elected  chair  of  their Meritage Association. Michaela  is chief executive officer  for St. ´ Supe ry Vineyards and Winery  in Rutherford, CA. Michaela dedicates her personal and professional talents to local charities, the arts and women’s support organizations. In 1998, she chaired  the Napa Valley Wine Auction,  the largest grossing wine auction  in  the United States,  raising a  record $3.8 million. She speaks at professional conferences around the world to promote the wine and tourism industries of  the Napa Valley as well as conferences  that promote and  foster women’s success in the business sector. Ten years ago, Michaela founded the premier worldwide grassroots organization  for women  interested  in  wine. Women  for WineSense continues to serve as a moderate, non-biased, non-profit educational and promotional organization to ensure all women and men have accurate information on the cultural, social, and health effects of moderate wine consumption. Mr. Speaker, today we honor an industry visionary  and  community  leader. Michaela Rodeno’s professional and  civic dedication has encouraged and supported many individuals in our community and beyond. I join the other members of Women for WineSense in honoring Michaela K.

Officer Burgstiner  is serving as a U.N. police officer in Kosovo, he is a hero by any other name. In late March, 2000, in a war torn Kosovo, an abandon baby lay by the side of a road wrapped in a bloodied blanket and bleeding  from  its umbilical cord. The baby’s good  fortune  began  when  Officer  Bill Burgstiner was returning from a meeting and driving through the village of Prilep, about 50 miles southwest of  the provincial capital of Pristina. A villager flagged him down and took Officer Burgstiner to the baby, who was lying on a step, wrapped in a blood soaked blanket. Bill used a  table cloth  to stop  the bleeding. He then whisked  the child  to  the  Italian military hospital, rushed through the front gate and delivered Fortunato (the baby’s new name) into the arms of Roberto Bramati, a doctor. Doctor Bramati credited Officer Burgstiner with saving the precious life of little Fortunato. A Savannah native, Bill  joined  the Brunswick Police Department after graduating from the police academy. He served from 1990 to 1993, and helped organize  the department’s K–9 unit. A role model in the local community he has again shown that his compassion and strength of character crosses international borders. It is with great pleasure that I recognize Officer William ‘‘Bill’’ Burgstiner for his kind humanitarian and heroic act. f IN TRIBUTE TO CLAIRE HOPE, SBA VETERAN  ADVOCATE  OF  THE YEAR HON.

Claire Hope is the founder and president of Claire Hope Enterprises  in Camarillo, California, in my district. She has more than 30 years experience  in human  resources management, and has offered that experience probono to many veterans. Since 1992, she has served on  the California Employer Advisory Council Veteran Committee. She specializes in assisting veterans  to become small business owners. Claire Hope is also President and Founder of the Industry Education Council of Eastern Ventura County, implementing strategic plans that  included  the employment of veterans. Other avenues she has used to promote employment of veterans and small business ownership by  veterans  include: Regional Vice President of the California Employer Advisory for  six  years, Committee Member  of  the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce Education Committee, and Task Force Member for Workforce Development for the Conejo Valley Community Foundation. Claire also served as President of the Simi/ Conejo Valley Employer Advisory Council (SCVEAC). In 1997, SCVEAC was chosen as the outstanding EAC in the State of California and outstanding EAC in the United States for encouraging veteran business ownership. Claire Hope is a very capable and dedicated advocate for veterans and is very deserving of this honor. I have the pleasure of working with Claire on Ventura County Stand Down 2000, which she founded and chairs and for which I serve as honorary co-chairman. A Stand Down  is where homeless  veterans gain  rest  for a weekend from the daily battle for survival, by sleeping in comfortable tents and taking advantage of services that could lead to jobs and housing. Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Claire Hope for her recognition as the U.S. Small Business Administration Veteran Advocate of the Year and in thanking her for all her hard work and dedication on behalf of our veterans.

Sam’s mother, Zohra Tabaja, has traveled to Lebanon and was allowed to visit with her son for half an hour. During the visit,  she was  surrounded by bodyguards. Zohra has been informed that she will never see Sam again, and she has heard nothing since her visit. The problem of  international child abduction is a disgrace. We should be displaying the same amount of outrage for American children that we did for Elian Gonzalez. I urge my colleagues to support the efforts to bring American children back to America, their home and their rightful place. Bring H. Con. Res. 293 to the floor and bring our children home. f IRANIAN JEWS (Mr. DEUTSCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2000
198,,106,-0.324,11,2000-05-17,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again bring notice to this Congress of 13 Jews who are accused of spying in Iran, who have been imprisoned for over a year without formally being charged. Jews have been living in Iran for 2,700 years, the oldest Jewish Diaspora community and the biggest in the Middle East after Israel. At least 17 Jews have been executed in Iran since 1979, most of whom were accused of spying for Israel and the United States. These Jews who have been held have had their due process violated, even under Iranian law. Thirteen Jews have been denied the right to choose their own lawyers. Ten of the defendants imprisoned for over a year without legal representation had lawyers chosen for them by the court, after the court rejected the lawyers picked by the defendants’ families. Three of the 13 have been released on bail but none of the others were allowed to consult attorneys  until  hours  before  the  trial opened. Since that time, the  lawyers have only had brief periods with their clients and only the most limited contact with their court-appointed attorneys. There has been a closed trial. No members of  the Jewish community diplomats or human rights activists were permitted in the courtroom by order of the  judge. The  trial comes amid a power  struggle  between  President Khatami and the hardliners opposed to his social and political reforms. This is about  hardliners’  opposition  rather than the actual action of the defendants. f PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4205, FLOYD D. SPENCE, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 ",2000
199,,106,-0.432,18,2000-05-17,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. I am disappointed with the rule as it stands before the body. But the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001  is very urgent  for  the United States. I strongly urge my colleagues on the Committee on Rules to reconsider their decision on many amendments that do not appear before the House today. The bill before us builds upon last year’s achievements and continues our efforts to improve the quality of life for our military personnel retirees and their  families.  I  am  particularly pleased that the bill includes several provisions, which I support, to improve the military health care system, particularly for our Medicare-eligible retirees and their families. This year, the Year of Health Care, we have made  significant  improvements in the military health care system in response to concerns raised by service members, retirees, and their families. The health care provisions of this bill will greatly  improve  their quality of life, particularly for Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents. The TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program will restore access to the National Mail Order Pharmacy, the network retail pharmacies, and the out-ofnetwork pharmacies. It is a major step towards improving health care for our Medicare-eligible retirees. We have improved access to TRICARE. We have reduced and streamlined the administrative costs, and we are using the savings to improve health care benefits for our military personnel, retirees and their families. I am particularly pleased that this bill includes provisions which we have supported on our side of the aisle, and I am particularly pleased to have been able to work with the gentleman from Indiana (Chairman BUYER) to see that everything has been included. It includes improvements to pay, it reduces out-of-pocket housing costs for service members, and provides funding for the Military Thrift Savings Plan. These provisions help us build upon our achievements of last year, which was the Year of the Troops. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation  to  the gentleman  from South  Carolina  (Mr.  the chairman,  and  the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr. SKELTON), the ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services, for their leadership in producing a bipartisan bill that will improve the lives of our service members. I  particularly want  to  commend again the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUYER) for working with me and other members on the committee to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the quality of life that they deserve. ",2000
200,,106,0.32,25,2000-05-17,Mr. SPENCE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUYER). ",2000
201,,106,0.435,25,2000-05-17,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman that just spoke, but I extend my even greater admiration to the chairman of the full committee, who extended the ability of this committee to finally put our arms around all of those demo programs. This bill provides the road map actually to extend and remove these barriers and extend that benefit the military retiree is entitled to. Any Member can stand in this well and embrace the military retiree and the Veteran, it is easy. But how do we finally put our arms around all of these demos and actually deliver the right program that is in the best interests? That is what this bill lays out, the road map, and I thank the chairman for giving me the ability to do that. ",2000
202,,106,0.433,25,2000-05-17,Mr. RILEY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise today to voice my strong support of H.R. 4205, the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. Before I speak to the bill itself, I feel it is important to recognize the outstanding work of six very distinguished Members of our Committee on Armed Services. We will certainly miss the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. KASICH), the gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr. BATEMAN),  the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. TALENT), the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. PICKETT) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. FOWLER). I applaud  their great work and  their tireless work on behalf of the men and women in uniform, and I wish them the very best. Mr. Chairman, I believe it is fitting that this bill will bear the name of our distinguished chairman, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SPENCE). He has  guided us  through  recent  lean years and his leadership and tenacity has resulted in our men and women in uniform ending up every year more than what had been proposed at the outset. Some have been quick  to  scream pork, but everyone on this committee, Mr. Chairman, knows what shape our military would be in if those funding victories had not been won. Mr. Chairman,  I applaud the gentleman from South Carolina (Chairman SPENCE), the subcommittee chairman and their staffs for the hard work they put in to securing the $4.5 billion additional funding. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I appreciate the chairman for yielding me the time. ",2000
203,,106,-0.408,88,2000-05-17,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Chairman, I thank my  friend, the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. SKELTON), for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I very, very strongly oppose this amendment. I think this sends the absolute wrong message and is really the height of the wrong way we ought to go. I chair the Albanian Issues Caucus. I have put a lot of time and effort into the situation in Kosovo. Let me say something. What we have  done  in Kosovo is working. It is working. We have saved lives. It is true that the Europeans ought to be doing more but this will have the exact opposite effect. Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen says this is counterproductive to peace in Kosovo and will seriously  jeopardize  the  relationship between the U.S. and our NATO allies. Joe Lockhart, the White House Press Secretary, says this is the wrong message being sent at the wrong time, and presidential  candidate George Bush says this is wrong and it is legislative overreach. A letter from General Wesley Clark says these measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-out by the United States. We ought to be proud of the role we have played in saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and the United States ought not to cut and run. We are the leaders of the world and the leaders of the free world. No one gave us that mantle. We took it and we ought to follow it through. It is working. People have gone to Kosovo. There are going to be bumps and grinds in the road but essentially what we have done is working. We cannot pull out. We need to work with our European allies, not cut and run. This is not what America should be doing. We cannot go back to the days of isolationism. There are people that never wanted to be in Kosovo in the first place. I am proud of the role that this administration  played  and  that  the American people played in saving the lives of so many people. So I just want to say that a bipartisan no vote ought to be here and we ought to very, very strongly reject this amendment. We have saved the lives of thousands of people. Let us continue the job. MAY11, 2000. Thank you for your letter of 10 May and the  opportunity  to  provide my  personal views on the amendment adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee governing the future of U.S. troops in Kosovo. While I support efforts of the Congress and the Administration to encourage our allies to fulfill their commitments to the United Nations mission in Kosovo, I am opposed to the  specific measures  called  for  in  the amendment. These measures,  if  adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would  invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut US leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, VerDate 17-MAY-2000 04:48 May 18, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17MY7.012 pfrm12 PsN: H17PT1 ",2000
204,,106,-0.401,95,2000-05-17,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I cannot help but express my severe disappointment  that  this measure, which is inferior to the bill introduced with  the gentleman  from California (Mr. DREIER) on this subject is the best we can do here on the floor. I must point out that the better bill that the gentleman from California and I introduced won unanimous support in the Committee on International Relations. It provides for a 30-day review, which is the proper time period. Why should computers be subjected to a lengthier time review than tanks and missiles? It is preposterous. I realize that there are Members of the House, some have called them cold warriors, who disagree. But they are a small minority. If the Committee on Rules had allowed the 30-day bill on the floor, we would have seen a huge bipartisan vote for that amendment for that better approach. The leadership instead offers this weaker remedy, and it is a darn shame that we have lost this opportunity to do fully and completely what  the White House and Democratic House leadership has asked for for years, a bill that provides for a 30-day review of computer exports. Mr. Chairman, our Committee on International Relations whip count indicated we would have had a floor vote of about 300 Members for a 30-day bill, with more Democrats in favor than Republicans.  Democrats  would  have outshined  the Republicans  on  this. That, Mr. Chairman, is why this 60-day bill is the only amendment made in order. The Republican leadership wants to look tech friendly, but here, I believe,  they are putting partisanship ahead of good policy. I agree that the current export policy is wrongheaded. It means that children’s toys, for example, the Sony Playstation 2 that was categorized as a supercomputer cannot be exported for half a year while we update our technology policy in the export arena. The current policy is disastrous. This amendment that is before us is, in fact, an improvement over current policy, but it is far short of what we could have done. I am greatly disappointed. I hope that in the end we can somehow rescue the 30-day provision. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2000
205,,106,-0.321,102,2000-05-17,Mr. REYES.," Mr. Chairman,  I will defer, I will close. I am the last speaker on this segment. ",2000
206,,106,-0.272,102,2000-05-17,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Chairman, as I stated before, I am for arresting terrorists and narcotraffickers, but, my friends, the dockets of the judges who border the United States and Mexico are overloaded. They are having to look for places to incarcerate hard-core criminals. All I am saying is let us be responsible, let us come up with a plan. I have five presiding judges, there are 89,  89  judicial  Federal  districts throughout  the United  States, my friends, and five of these judicial districts, five carry 24 percent. Yes, I am for  arresting  traffickers  and narcotraffickers. I used to arrest them when I was sheriff, but let us come with a responsible plan. It may be my friend can help me by coming up with a bill that will give these judges help, give the United States marshals help, but this is not the place for the military to be involved in. ",2000

208,Senate,106,0.068,137,2000-05-17,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the leader for entering the order  giving me 30 minutes for a statement  this morning. I have sought that time  to speak on what I believe to be one of  the most important issues which will  be presented to the Congress this year;  that is, the issue of permanent normal  trade relations for the People’s Republic of China.  The Senate is scheduled to take up  this issue sometime next month, depending upon what the House of Representatives does. The House of Representatives  is scheduled to consider  this matter next week. I thought it appropriate to make this statement at  this time, to give my views on important issues of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation, insights  which  I gained,  in  large part,  from  serving  on  the Senate  Intelligence  Committee for some 8 years, including  2 years as chairman during 1995 and  1996, and other insights on related matters which I have seen in my capacity  as  chairman  of  the Judiciary  subcommittee on oversight of the Department of Justice.  My own record has been that of a  strong  free trader. I have supported  NAFTA,  the North American Free  Trade Agreement. I have supported free  trade with the Caribbean nations.  I  supported, last week, free trade with  the African nations. I believe the long  tugs and pulls of the economy, both domestic and international, strongly support the notion of free trade.  But I am opposed, strongly opposed  to granting permanent normal trade  relations to the People’s Republic of  China because of their record on nuclear proliferation, of weapons of mass  destruction, because of their record on  human rights, and because the executive branch, the administration, has  not imposed sanctions as required by  law to stop or inhibit such nuclear proliferation but, in fact, has taken affirmative action to grant waivers. So it  is necessary for Congress to exercise  our  constitutional  responsibility  of  checks and balances and congressional  oversight of the executive branch, to  see to it the national interest is preserved.  The Congress has authority under the  Constitution. There are some constitutional inhibitions which prohibit the  Congress from delegating that authority to the executive branch. I am not  necessarily  saying  that  permanent  trade with China would be such an unconstitutional delegation, but at the  very minimum it is an unwise delegation, based on this state of the record,  based on the necessity to impose restraints on conduct of the People’s Republic of China, not only as to human  rights—fundamental, important human  rights—but of greater magnitude, the  threat to international peace through  their proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction.  During my tenure on the Intelligence  Committee I saw many instances of the  People’s Republic of China supplying  rogue  nations,  nations which  constitute a threat to world order, with  weapons of mass destruction.  For example, the People’s Republic  of China provided M–11 missiles  to  Pakistan back in 1992. Those missiles,  now armed with nuclear warheads, are  pointed at India, creating a nuclear  threat to the subcontinent, the possibility of a nuclear exchange between  India and Pakistan, and threatening  world peace.  The People’s Republic of China has  assisted North Korea’s missile program  by  providing  specialty  steel,  accelerometers, gyroscopes, and precision grinding machinery. The People’s  Republic of China is providing assistance to Libya’s long-range missile program by assisting in the building of a  hypersonic wind tunnel which is useful  for designing missiles and cooperating  in the development of Libya’s Al Fatah  missile which has a range of some 600  miles, threatening peace and stability  in that area.  The People’s Republic of China has  helped Pakistan,  Iran, North Korea,  and Libya in a way which is very destabilizing.  What has been the reaction of the  Clinton administration to these issues?  The transfer of M–11 missiles to Pakistan falls under category 1 of the Missile Technology Control Regime, which  is set up to establish gradations in seriousness of violations. That is category  1.  The 1991 National Defense Authorization Act mandates the President to  deny for not less than 2 years certain  licenses, and we find not only has the  President not  taken  those  steps on  sanctions, but has, in addition, moved  ahead and granted affirmative waivers  to  facilitate developing China’s ballistic missile capability. Those waivers  were granted in a celebrated case on  the application of Loral Space and  Technology.  A series of events, beginning in 1992,  involving both Hughes and Loral demonstrates a very serious problem on  transmitting to the People’s Republic  of China high-level technology.  On December 21, 1992, a Chinese Long  March 2E rocket carrying a Hughes  manufactured satellite crashed shortly  after takeoff. Without attaining the required State Department license, the  Hughes personnel engaged in a series of  discussions with Chinese officials, giving them very important information.  On January 26, 1995, a Chinese Long  March  2E missile  carrying  another  Hughes  satellite  exploded  approximately 50 seconds after takeoff. A 1998  State Department assessment showed  that,  ‘‘Hughes directly supported the  Chinese space program in the areas of  [accident analysis] . . . .’’  The Cox committee reviewed these  matters and called for a very detailed  investigation as to what had actually  occurred.  On February 15, 1996, the People’s Republic of China’s Long March 3B missile exploded with a communications  satellite on board built by Loral. Following  these  explosions, Loral  and  Hughes transmitted to the People’s Republic of China their assessments of  why  the  rockets  failed. The assessments required a prior license from the  Department of State which had not  been obtained.  In May 1997, a classified Department  of Defense report concluded that Loral  and Hughes significantly enhanced the  guidance and control systems of the  People’s Republic of China’s nuclear  ballistic systems. As a result of the Department of Defense report, the U.S.  Department of Justice began a criminal investigation of Loral and Hughes.  Then Loral applied for a waiver from  the Clinton administration to launch  another satellite from a Chinese rocket.  The Department of Justice weighed  in and objected to a Presidential grant  of a waiver on the ground that such a  waiver would have ‘‘a significant adverse impact on any prosecution that  might take place based on a pending  investigation of export violations by  Loral.’’  Notwithstanding  the  very  serious  issue of China having sold M–11 missiles to Pakistan creating a threat of  nuclear war, notwithstanding the fact  that Loral and Hughes gave an assessment to China which significantly enhanced their nuclear capability system, notwithstanding  the  fact  that  there was  a  criminal  investigation  pending by the Department of Justice,  notwithstanding the fact that the Department of Justice objected to the  grant of a waiver on the ground that it  would have an adverse impact on their  criminal investigation potential prosecution, the President on February 18  of 1998 granted the waiver.  What are we to make of all of that,  and why, in fact, was the waiver granted?

I have hunted since I have been a  kid. I will take on anyone over there in  trap shooting. That is not what this is  about. It is not about law-abiding people who like to hunt and own guns to  hunt with, or somebody who needs one  for self-protection in their home. That  is not what this is about.  That’s why I have to take issue with  those who are always misinterpreting  the Constitution of the United States—  misinterpreting it. When you look at  the Lott amendment before us,  the  first thing he says is the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects  the right of each law-abiding U.S. citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-defense or  recreation.  Please tell me where in the second  amendment and  the Constitution  it  says that. You can go out to the NRA  building, and on the side it says, ‘‘‘The  right of the people to keep and bear  arms shall not be infringed,’ the second  amendment to the Constitution.’’ Anybody can take anything out of context,  Mr. President. You can prove there is  no God by reading the Bible. All I ask  you is to open the Bible to Psalms 14:1.  Guess what it says;  ‘‘. . .there is no  God.’’ I ask my friend from Idaho if he  has ever read Psalms 14:1. It says there  is no God, in the Bible. But what does  it say right before that? ‘‘The fool said  in his heart there is no God.’’  What relation does that have to the  second amendment  to  the Constitution? Everybody has this book in their  desk. It is not that big a deal to read  this. It says:  A well regulated Militia, being necessary  to the security of a free State, the right of  the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not  be infringed.  So what do they do? They take it out  of context. I suppose somebody could  take the Bible out of context, too. You  have to put it into contextual framework. The framers of the Constitution  knew  they  didn’t want  a  standing  army. They wanted a militia, like the  National Guard,  for people  in  their  homes to keep arms  for protection.  Read your history books. These people  out here who want to reinterpret the  Constitution  for their own ends are  doing our people a great disservice.  Now, take another look at the Lott  amendment. The Lott amendment has  a finding in the end. Here is the sense  of the Senate that—get this:  The  right  of  each  law-abiding United  States citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-defense or  recreation, should not be infringed.  The right of each law-abiding United  States citizen. It doesn’t have an age  limit. Does that mean a kid 13 years  old can have an Uzi for recreational  purposes?  It doesn’t say that there.  There is no age limit on it. It could be  a 5-year-old kid or a 10-year-old kid. I  will say one other thing. ‘‘For any legitimate purpose,’’ it says. Does that  mean—  ",2000

This bill will designate a post office in my district the Everett Alvarez, Jr. Post Office Building. During his  life, Mr. Alvarez has  faithfully served his nation as a distinguished military officer and public servant. He joined the Navy in 1960 after earning a bachelor of science in electrical engineering  from  the University of Santa Clara. He also holds a master’s degree in operations research and systems analysis as well as juris doctorate. He served in program management at the Naval Air Systems Command before leaving the Navy  in1980. He was appointed Deputy Director of the Peace Corps in 1981 and was appointed by President Reagan to be Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration in 1982 where he stayed until 1986. After  leaving  the Veterans Administration, Mr. Alvarez served as vice president for government services for the Hospital Corporation of America before forming his own consulting company, Conwal, Inc. A dedicated civil servant, Mr. Alvarez is best known to the public as the first American aviator shot down over North Vietnam. He was taken prisoner of war on August 5, 1964, and held in North Vietnam for 81⁄2years, until the general release of prisoners on February 12, 1973. Mr. Alvarez holds numerous military decorations for his courageous service. He has been honored with the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit  (with combat  ‘‘V’’),  two Bronze Stars (with combat  ‘‘V’’),  the Distinguished Flying Cross, and two Purple Heart medals. He continues to serve America and America’s  future by serving on  the Board of Regents of the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences [USUHS], the Board of Directors of the National Graduate University, and the Board of Fellows of Santa Clara University. He has also served on the White House Fellows Selection Committee  and  on  the Board of Directors of  the Armed Services YMCA of the USA. Mr. Alvarez’s life stands as a testament to patriotism, courage, and perseverance. His story is an inspiration and it is with humility that I introduce this bill to honor him so.  CONGRATULATING THOMAS C. NORRIS ON HIS RETIREMENT HON. WILLIAM F.

218,,106,0.336,235,2000-05-17,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, in September of 1952 I began my teaching, coaching and counseling  career at Kennard Dale  Junior Senior High School in Fawn Grove, PA. Besides teaching and counseling, I coached basketball, football, and baseball. On my football team was a tall, skinny lad from Stewartstown. He was my quarterback on  the JV Football team that trounced Red Lion 56–6. He was a forward on the basketball team and first baseman on the baseball team. He will be always considered the all-American boy—a lad every parent could wish was their own. Of course  I expected big  things  from  this young man, because his aunt was my wonderful, wonderful teacher in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a one-room setting where she was  the reading, writing, and arithmetic teacher as well as the music, art, special education teacher, counselor, psychologist and yes, she was also the custodian. When I moved into the counseling position, one of the first people I helped with their effort to get scholarship money was this same allAmerican young man. The scholarship  that was available was  the  first P.H. Glatfelter Company scholarship. The winner was  this same young, all-American lad. Now as Paul Harvey would say, ‘‘That was the rest of the story.’’ You know the story of this  lad’s adult  life. The  first P.H. Glatfelter scholarship recipient became the CEO of the P.H. Glatfelter Company and a very active member of the community. This skinny lad, who has now filled-out quite a bit since the tenth grade, is none other than the man of  the hour you are honoring  this evening. He was ‘‘Tommy Norris’’ who is now reverently known as ‘‘Thomas C. Norris.’’ This remarkable gentleman has come a long, long way since his days as a small town boy from Stewartstown, PA. I wish only the best for him and his family as he enjoys his retirement years. ",2000

He comes to the floor of the Senate and  reminds Members, whether in support  of or in opposition to the death penalty, it is fundamental to the American  system of justice that we insist on fairness.  In my State of Illinois, some 13 people who were on death row preparing to  be executed by the State of Illinois  were found by scientific testing to be  innocent and were released. Because of  that, the Governor of our State, a Republican, George Ryan, made what I  consider to be an important and courageous decision. He suspended the death  penalty in my home State of Illinois.  The Senator  from Wisconsin, Mr.  FEINGOLD, reminds Members that the  experience in Illinois is not unique. In  State after State, we have found people  who have been called to justice and  have received virtually no representation before the court of law.

244,Senate,106,-0.223,97,2000-06-06,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President,  it  is  somewhat difficult to get back to the  somewhat arcane subject of how many  nuclear weapons are needed after listening to the recitation of the Senator  from Alaska of a short, very moving  statement that in many ways gets to  the heart of the mood we ought to be in  when we are discussing our defense authorization bill, which is not just trying to answer the question how we authorize and defend the United States of  America but how we give honor to  those who have given the highest and  most in service to this country.  I appreciate very much the presentation by the Senator from Alaska of  that memorial because I think it puts  us indeed in the correct mood, which  is, we ought to be writing this law so as  to enable all of us to take action to defend  the United States of America  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, without regard to some previous  ideology that we have held onto for a  long time.  We ought to do the right thing and  not worry about whether or not we are  going to find ourselves subject to criticism as a consequence of some group  saying we didn’t do enough, or we have  done too much, and so on and so forth.  It is that kind of thinking that is required if we are going to get the right  number of nuclear weapons. We spend  $15 billion to $20 billion a year on our  nuclear weapons force structure. It is  an oppressive effort.  I happen to have the privilege of not  just serving the people of the State of  Nebraska but in the State of Nebraska  is an effort and an organization known  as STRATCOM. STRATCOM’s entire  mission is to operate the strategic nuclear  force. The current STRATCOM  CINC and I have a very good relationship, as I have with all other CINCs, because this mission is very important to  the people of the State of Nebraska and  to the people of the United States of  America. I have had the opportunity on  many occasions to be briefed, and I can  state to my colleagues that we get our  money’s worth. These men and women  work very hard. They are tireless in  the execution of  their duties. They  want to make certain they follow the  command and the orders that are given  by the people’s leaders—in this case,  the Commander in Chief—who instruct  STRATCOM on what to do through a  Presidential directive. They are  following orders.  They put  together  target  requirements. They put together a list of requirements that are called SIOP. SIOP  determines what  targeting  is  being  done. Then it comes back to us, and it  says this is what we need in order to  follow the civilian orders. They come  to us and say these are the resources  we need in order to be able to accomplish that objective.  It is very important for us to follow  that because often times it will turn to  the  military.  We  turn  to  the  STRATCOM and say such things as:  Tell us the minimum level of deterrence. They come back and say: The  minimum  level  is 2,500. We have to  have 2,500 warheads.  Remember, that 2,500 number comes  as a consequence of an order they have  been given by a Presidential directive.  They have been given an order. That is  where it comes from. Change those requirements and the number of warheads is going to be changed. It may be  that a Presidential directive comes and  says we need more. I do not know. But  right now, without  the  lengthy  review—I appreciate the  lengthy  force  structure review that is in this authorization. That  is  basically  the  substitute—that we have a lengthy review  that is going to be done.  I urge my colleagues to think of several things.  One, the Russians, first of all, are no  longer the military threat they were in  the cold war. It is a democratic nation.  They have had three elections. They  just elected their second President. We  have partnerships with them in many  different areas. We want their experiment in democracy and free markets to  succeed.

245,Senate,106,0.548,104,2000-06-06,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Warner amendment, maybe I  can offer a  little solace to my colleague from Nebraska, which I think is  consistent with the intent of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  First of all, as the Senator from Colorado pointed out, the primary point of  the Warner amendment  is to ensure  that two specific studies are done; that  this cannot be done just on the certification of the President. That is the primary distinction between this amendment and  the amendment  from  the  Senator from Nebraska.  With respect to those two studies,  one of them is the quadrennial review.  That is the review that Congress now  requires of the President every 4 years.  It is a very long set of requirements  that take all of the defense needs of the  country into account in a coordinated,  structured way.  It is in that context that I believe,  incidentally,  Governor  Bush  would  probably want  to have  this  review  done. I can’t speak for Governor Bush.  But I am certain after having talked to  him that he has in mind approaching  our defense structure generally  in a  somewhat different way than the past  administration has. He has some different strategies in mind.  My guess is that he would want the  nuclear review to be done consistent  with the quadrennial review so that  the Nuclear Posture Review would be  coordinated with the quadrennial review. That is precisely what the Warner amendment calls for. It says:  The secretary of defense shall submit to  Congress in unclassified and classified forms  as necessary a report on the result of the Nuclear Posture Review concurrently with the  Quadrennial Defense Review due in December of 2001.  The Senator from Nebraska is quite  correct. That report would be accelerated some. As a practical matter, however, it is not going to be accelerated  to the point that would occur in the  year 2000, and as a result it would, in  fact, occur during the next administration—not this administration, the way  the amendment is written, at least as I  read it.  While it does not tie the Nuclear Posture Review to a specific date, it does  say that it should be submitted concurrently with the QDR, whenever that  happens to be submitted.  I think that is the answer to the Senator’s question. I think this is a very  reasonable approach. I hope the Senator will support the amendment for  that reason.  I again go back to primarily the  point that was made, and that is that  we have two different approaches. One  relies on just the certification of the  President that he thinks this is a good  thing to do. The other specifically requires him to do the Nuclear Posture  Review and the quadrennial review and  to  submit  those  two  concurrently.  Then the President can,  if need be,  bring the force structure down.  I would like to make one other point,  if I could. If the Senator from Nebraska  wishes to interrupt me, that is fine.  The second point I want to make is  this: There is a tendency to speak in  just sort of hypothetical terms about  numbers: Well, 6,000 is a lot or 3,000  seems more reasonable.  What everyone really needs to understand is that we are talking about one  of  the most complex  sets of  interrelated considerations that exist in our  defense strategic posture.  The Senator from Nebraska, as the  vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee until very recently, appreciates  this point as well as anyone. I know  that. Among the things that have to be  considered,  for example,  in bringing  the number of warheads down, are two  things: First, though we all talk  in  terms of warheads, the Senator from  Nebraska knows and the chairman of  the Armed Services Committee knows  that isn’t what we really count. We  count delivery systems. Those delivery  systems  include  ICBMs, missiles on  submarines, and bombers, which are  the three legs of the triad that deliver  the warheads.  Here is just one consideration that  goes  into this equation. The United  States has a need to project its conventional forces. We are the superpower of  the world. We try to keep peace  in  parts of the world when other nations  cannot do  so because among other  things, we have the reach to get to  those  places. We  recently  involved  those forces in Kosovo, and before that  we did it in the gulf war. In both cases  we used our bomber forces.  Some of these bomber forces, such as  the B–2 bomber, clearly count in terms  of strategic warheads. If we were to  bring the strategic warheads down too  far, the result of that would be to take  out of service bombers which we need  not just for strategic purposes but for  conventional purposes as well.  That is why this gets to be a pretty  complicated  matter  and  why  it  shouldn’t be done quickly. It certainly  shouldn’t be done merely for political  reasons. I am not suggesting that any  President would do that.  That is why clearly a Nuclear Posture Review is critical to any proposal  that the President would make in this  regard or any decision he would announce. Because you are talking about  the interrelationship between conventional and strategic forces, you should  tie this to the QDR as well.  That is why the Warner amendment  very wisely says the Nuclear Posture  Review, and  the quadrennial  review  should be submitted concurrently, and  that when  they  are,  the President  could make a decision to reduce our  warheads below that called for by this  agreement.  One more point in response to a point  that the Senator from Massachusetts  made earlier. The inference of his remarks was now that START II has  been ratified by both the United States  and Russia, there is no reason why we  can’t  bring  these warhead numbers  down. But that is not true. START II  has not been ratified unconditionally  by the Duma. The Duma in Russia ratified START  II with conditions, and  until  those conditions are  satisfied,  Russia will not submit its articles of  ratification. They will not become effective. Until they are deposited with  the  appropriate  international  body,  and I believe it is Geneva, Switzerland,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:45 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S06JN0.REC S06JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000
246,Senate,106,0.551,111,2000-06-06,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I wish to  share with my colleagues a moving  autobiographical  article written  by  Ward Connerly. Mr. Connerly’s intelligence and personal experience with  racism blend together into a truly insightful analysis and I encourage my  colleagues  to  read  about  Mr.  Connerly’s uniquely American story.  Mr. President, I ask that the article  which appeared in the June 2000 edition  of The American Enterprise be printed  in the RECORD.  LAYINGDOWNTHEBURDENOFRACE  (By Ward Connerly)  Not long ago, after I’d given a speech in  Hartford, Connecticut, I saw a black man  with a determined look on his face working  his way toward me through the crowd. I  steeled myself for another abrasive encounter of the kind I’ve come to expect over the  past few years. But once this man reached  me he stuck out his hand and said thoughtfully, ‘‘You know, I was thinking about some  of the things you said tonight. It occurred to  me that black people have just got to learn  to lay down the burden. It’s like we grew up  carrying a bag filled with heavy weights on  our shoulders. We just have to stop totin’  that bag.’’  I agreed with him. I knew as he did exactly  what was in this bag: weakness and guilt,  anger, and self-hatred.  I have made a commitment not to tote racial grievances, because the status of victim  is so seductive and so available to anyone  with certain facial features or a certain cast  to his skin. But laying down these burdens  can be tricky, as I was reminded not long  after this Connecticut meeting. I had just  checked into the St. Francis Hotel in San  Francisco to attend an annual dinner as  master of ceremonies. After getting to my  room, I realized that I’d left my briefcase in  the car and started to go back to the hotel  parking garage for it. As I was getting off  the basement elevator, I ran into a couple of  elderly white men who seemed a little disoriented. When they saw me, one of them  said,  ‘‘Excuse me, are you the man who  unlocks the meeting room?’’  I did an intellectual double-take and then,  with my racial hackles rising, answered with  as much irritation as I could pack into my  voice: ‘‘No, I’m not the man who unlocks the  rooms.’’  The two men shrank back and I walked on,  fuming to myself about how racial profiling  is practiced every day in subtle forms by  people who would otherwise piously condemn  it in state troopers working the New Jersey  Turnpike. As I stalked toward the garage, I  didn’t feel uplifted by my righteous anger.  On the contrary, I felt crushed by it. It was  a heavy burden, so heavy, in fact, that I  stopped and stood there for a minute, sagging under its weight. Then I tried to see  myself through the eyes of the two old men  I’d just run into: someone who was black,  yes, but more importantly, someone without  luggage, striding purposefully out of the elevator as if on a mission, dressed in a semi-  uniform of blazer and gray slacks.  I turned around and retraced my steps.  ‘‘What made you think I was the guy who  unlocks the meeting rooms?’’ I asked when I  caught up with them.  ‘‘You were dressed a little like a hotel employee, sir,’’ the one who had spoken earlier  said in a genuinely deferential way. ‘‘Believe  me, I meant no insult.’’  ‘‘Well, I hope you’ll forgive me for being  abrupt,’’ I said, and after a quick handshake  I headed back to the garage,  feeling  immensely relieved.  If we are to lay this burden down for good,  we must be committed to letting go of racial  classifications—not getting beyond race by  taking race more into account, as Supreme  Court Justice Harry Blackmun disastrously  advised, but just getting beyond race period  as a foundation for public policy.  Yet, I know that race is a scar in America.  I first saw this scar at the beginning of my  life in the segregated South. Black people  should not deny that this mark exists: it is  part of our connection to America. But we  should also resist all of those, black and  white, who want to rip open that scar and  make race a raw and angry wound that continues to define and divide us.  Left to their own devices, I believe, Americans will eventually merge and melt into  each other. Throughout our history, there  has been a constant intermingling of people—even during the long apartheid of segregation and Jim Crow. It is malicious as  well as unreasonable not to acknowledge  that  in our own time the conditions  for  anger have diminished and the conditions for  connection have improved.  We all know  the  compelling  statistics  about the improvements in black life: increased social and vocational mobility, increased  personal  prestige  and  political  power. But of all the positive data that have  accumulated since the Civil Rights Act of  1964—when America finally decided to leave  its racial past behind—the finding that gives  me most hope is the recent survey showing  that nearly 90 percent of all teenagers in  America report having at least one close personal friend of another race.  My wife Ilene is white. I have two racially  mixed children and three grandchildren, two  of whose bloodlines are even more mixed as  a result of my son’s marriage to a woman of  half-Asian descent. So my own personal experience tells me that the passageway to  that place where all racial division ends goes  directly through the human heart.  Not long ago, Mike Wallace came to California to interview Ilene and me for a segment on ‘‘60 Minutes.’’ He seemed shocked  when I told him that race wasn’t a big topic  in our family. He implied that we were somehow disadvantaging the kids. But Ilene and I  decided a long time ago to let our kids find  their way in this world without toting the  bag of race. They are lucky, of course, to  have grown up after the great achievements  of the civil rights movement, which changed  America’s heart as much as its laws. But we  have made sure that the central question for  our children, since the moment they came  into this world, has always been who are  you, not what are you. When we ignore appeals to group identity and focus instead on  individuals and their individual humanity,  we are  inviting  the principles of  justice  present since the American founding to come  inside our contemporary American homes.  I won’t pretend this is always easy. While  a senior at college, I fell in love with an effervescent white woman named Ilene. When  Ilene’s parents first learned how serious we  were about each other, they reacted with dismay and spent long hours on the phone trying to keep the relationship from developing  further. Hoping for support from my own relatives, I went home one weekend and told  Mom (the grandmother who had raised me)  about  Ilene. She was cold and negative.  ‘‘Why can’t you find yourself a nice colored  girl?’’ she blurted out. I walked out of the  house and didn’t contact her for a long time  afterward.  Ilene and I now felt secretive and embattled. Marrying ‘‘outside your race’’ was no  easy decision in 1962. I knew that Ilene had  no qualms about challenging social norms,  but I was less sure that she could deal with  exclusion by her family, which seemed to me  a real possibility. Nonetheless, she said yes  when I proposed, and we were married, with  no family members present.  I called Mom the day after and told her.  She apologized for what she’d said earlier.  Ilene’s parents were not so quick to alter  their position. For months, the lines of communication were down. Sometimes I came  home from work and found Ilene sitting on  the couch crying.  Finally her parents agreed to see her, but  not me. I drove her up to their house and  waited in the car while she went in. As the  hours passed, I seethed. At one point I started the engine and took off, but I didn’t know  the area and so, after circling the block,  came back and parked again. When Ilene finally came out of the house, she just cried  for nearly the entire return trip.  Today, people would rush to hold Ilene’s  parents guilty of racism.  But even when I was smoldering with resentment,  I knew  it wasn’t  that  simple.  These were good people—hard working, serious, upstanding. They were people, moreover, who had produced my wife, a person  without a racist bone in her body. In a sense,  I could sympathize with my new  in-laws;  there were no blacks in their daily life, and  they lived in a small town where everyone  knew everything about everyone else. Our  marriage was a leap nothing in her parents’  lives had prepared them to take.  But their reaction to me still rankled.  After having to wait in the car that afternoon I vowed never to go near their house  again.  For a long time we didn’t see Ilene’s parents. But we did see her Aunt Markeeta and  Uncle Glen. They were wonderful people.  Glen, dead now, was a salt-of-the-earth type  who worked in a sawmill, and Markeeta had  a personality as piquant as her name. They  integrated us into their circle of friends, who  became our  friends too.  In those healing  days, we all functioned as an extended family.  If I had to pick the moment when our family problems began to resolve themselves if  would be the day our son Marc was born.  Not long after, we were invited to come for  a visit. This time I was included in the invitation.

When Federal  Judge Thomas Penfield  Jackson recently issued his ruling, he gave  credence to the flawed logic upon which the  government has built its case.  That flawed logic should have precluded  the federal government from bringing the  case in the first place. Washington bureaucrats shouldn’t be in the business of choosing  winners and  losers  in the private sector.  That responsibility belongs to consumers.  The government’s theory behind the case  is that America’s high-technology industry  has been victimized by Microsoft’s stifling  competition  and  squelching  innovation.  Every piece of the federal government’s theory is an insult to the free-enterprise system  and the will of consumers.  First, there is no more competitive industry in the world than America’s high-tech  market. That is as true today as it was before the federal government’s five-year, $30  million attempt to regulate free enterprise.  There are thousands of companies selling  software products today, far more than at  the start of the trial.  And in the time since the federal government and 19 state attorneys general filed  their suit, America’s technology  industry  has produced one-third of the nation’s economic growth.  Those facts hardly would support the government’s characterization of the information technology industry as a shell of its  former self.  As for innovation, consider the change in  the simple matter of personal computing  since 1995. In 1995, the personal computer was  just starting to have its potential realized  with the development—among other innovations—of Windows 95. Just as Windows 95 has  since been rendered obsolete by Microsoft  itself, so now is the debate beginning about  the future of the personal computer as we  know it. Many believe the PC soon will be replaced  by  Internet-based  appliances  in  phones, televisions and hand-held computing  devices. The  technology  industry  in  2000  looks nothing like it did in 1995.  Just as many of the technologies of the  mid-’90s now are obsolete, so are the issues  the government has raised in this case. The  high-tech market has moved—and will continue to move—too quickly for any government to keep tabs on it through regulation.  By the time federal bureaucrats get around  to fixing rules, the market will change them.  That is the way of the new economy, built on  competition, innovation and customer service.  The  federal  government’s  case  against  Microsoft attacks all three principles.  Instead of the self-regulating competition  that has enabled Microsoft to lead the technology industry to its current heights, the  government favors either breaking up the  company or regulating away its freedom to  innovate and compete. The federal government’s ‘‘remedy’’ would insert bureaucrats  into the technology market in ways never  before imagined. Those Washington bureaucrats would be involved in questions of product design and marketing. That would empower pencil-pushing Beltway bureaucrats to  second-guess  innocent  computer programmers and entrepreneurs. The new arrangement would enable regulators to pick winners and losers in the marketplace, stripping  consumers of their rights.

248,Senate,106,0.506,10,2000-06-16,Mr. GRAMS.," Mr. President, I will  take a few minutes this morning to  talk about an industry that is very important to the State of Minnesota, and  that is our dairy industry.  June is National Dairy Month, and I  come to the floor today to pay tribute  to the family farmers who rise early  every morning to supply fresh milk to  our Nation. We as consumers assume  there will always be dairy products in  our grocery stores, without considering  the hard work that is a daily requirement to get them there.  I grew up on a dairy farm myself, and  I can remember those early morning  milkings before going to school and  again, of course, when I got home. I  don’t take for granted the hard work  required of dairy farmers to make a  living. Unfortunately,  for Minnesota  dairy producers, it is becoming harder  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:22 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S16JN0.REC S16JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000
249,Senate,106,-0.352,24,2000-06-16,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I would  like to take a few minutes to discuss  an  issue of considerable  importance,  one I feel very strongly about and one  that I think the Senate should address  before the end of this Congressional  session, and that is Mr. President, the  issue of the digital divide. The digital  divide is one of the key issues the Congress is currently facing—and will continue to face—in the foreseeable future.  Right now we are wrestling with how  to best encourage growth in this new  economy, but at the same time, how to  ensure that growth is evenly spread,  that everyone in our society has an opportunity to participate  in this new  economy and  reap  its economic  rewards.  Mr. President,  these  are  amazing  times in which we live and the new  economy is responsible for much of this  nation’s unprecedented prosperity: the  stock market is soaring to unimaginable heights. IPO’s are occurring at a  record pace and creating literally thousands of millionaires in this country.  The  innovations  of  the  new  technologies are astounding: You can order  a Saturn online and the very next day  a new car shows up in your drive-way.  Each day 25,000 new E-BAY subscribers  sign up for the world’s largest auction.  The  NetSchools  program  provides  every child with a kid-proof laptop PC  that is connected to teachers and classmates  using wireless  infared  technology and has had tremendous results  improving academic achievement, attendance, and parental involvement in  extremely disadvantaged communities.  A surgeon in Boston can direct a doctor in the Berkshires to do a biopsy by  using telemedicine equipment. These  innovations and hundreds more  like  them are changing how we live.  The wealth creation—for  those on  the right side of the divide—generated  by this New Economy is breathtaking,  Mr. President: College  students  go  from the dorm room to the board room  as high tech moguls, like Jerry Yang  and Michael Dell. Starting salaries for  high tech jobs even for students coming out of  college  can  range  from  $70,000–$100,000—even more with stock  options. Pick up the San Jose Mercury  News  job section each day and—literally—you will  find advertisements  for upwards of 10,000 high tech and information technology jobs. Silicon Valley has created more than 275,000 new  jobs since 1992—and median family income has soared to $87,000 per year—  the third highest in the country.  But as we all know Mr. President,  the new economy has not evenly spread  its wealth to all Americans and income  disparity in this nation continues to  grow. One of the greatest challenges we  currently face is to connect those not  participating in the new economy with  the skills, resources, and support necessary for them to do so. A January  2000 study by the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities and  the Economic  Policy  Institute  found  that  in  two-  thirds of the states, the gap in incomes  between the top 20 percent of families  and the bottom 20 percent of families  grew between the late 1980s and the  late  1990s.  In  three-fourths  of  the  states, income gaps between the top  fifth and middle fifth of families grew  over the last decade. By contrast, inequality declined significantly in only  three states. Clearly Mr. President, the  digital divide and the economic divide  are closely interrelated and must be responded to as such.  Mr. President, the new economy is  more than the latest and greatest innovations in information technology and  the highest-flying Internet companies.  It  is a knowledge economy, with a  large share of the workforce employed  in office jobs requiring some level of  higher education. It is a global economy—the sum of U.S. imports and exports rose from 11 percent of gross domestic product in 1970 to 25 percent in  1997. This emerging economy is driven  by innovation in every arena from traditional manufacturing to health care,  and even farming and fishing.  The new economy is powerful and exciting, but the digital divide is real and  cannot afford to be ignored. Let me describe to you what this divide looks  like.  The Digital Divide:  61.6% of those with college degrees  now use the Internet, while only 6.6%  of those with an elementary school  education or less use the Internet.  At the highest incomes ($75,000+), the  White/Black divide for computer ownership decreased by 76.2% between 1994  and 1998.  Whites are more likely to have access to the Internet from home, than  Blacks or Hispanics have from any location.  Black and Hispanic households are 2/  5 as likely to have home Internet access as White households.  Forty-four million American adults,  roughly 22 percent, do not have the  reading and writing skills necessary for  functioning in everyday life. And an estimated 87 percent of documents on the  Internet are in English. Yet at least 32  million Americans speak a  language  other than English and they are—again  and again—left behind on the Internet.  Those with a college degree or higher  are over eight times more likely to  have a computer at home than the  least educated and nearly sixteen times  more likely to have home Internet access.  The ‘‘digital divide’’ for Internet use  between those at the highest and lowest education  levels widened by 25%  from 1997 to 1998.  Those with college degrees or higher  are  ten  times more  likely  to have  Internet access at work as persons with  only some high school education.  Mr. President technology is changing  our world. Technology is changing our  lives, how we work, and how we learn.  But this is not just a new economy, it  is our economy. And ours  is not a  newly divided society. Mr. President,  this country has always been a society  of haves and have nots, and so although  we must respond to the unique challenges presented by the changing economy and the changing world of work,  we must also understand that bridging  the digital divide is about more than  just computers and the  Internet.  In  order to meet the challenge of bridging  the digital divide we must assist the  have nots with basic necessities, like a  good public education system, a safe  and clean place to live, and adequate  health care. We must recognize what I  hear from business leaders, teachers,  students, parents—everyone—the biggest technology  issue  in the United  States today is education. And we need  to make that connection.  Originally when we  talked  about  technology and education—the earlier  days of our awareness that there was a  growing digital divide—we were  focused on wiring schools and outfitting  them with equipment. Now, thanks in  large part to the success of the E-Rate  program, which we worked hard on in  the Commerce Committee and which  we pushed  through  to passage, now  technology and education is about so  much more. In just a few years most of  our schools have gotten on-line. And  now the focus is on training teachers  to effectively use the technology, to integrate technology into the classroom,  and to improve parental involvement  through technology.  What we can do and what we must do  Mr. President, is work to harness technology to grow our economy and enlarge the winner’s circle. What we can  do and what we must do is work to  communicate  this  single  reality:  to  keep  the  economic  growth moving  ahead, we need to work together to ensure that we have a workforce and a  generation of young people capable of  working with the best technology and  the very best  ideas  to  raise  living  standards and expand the economy—  and that is why we must close the digital divide.  The digital divide goes  far beyond  technology to encompass basic human  needs. Mr. President, if we can ensure  that there is a computer in every classroom—for  every  student—the  technology will not be effectively used,  learning will continue to be challenged  if the child does not have a safe and secure home to go to at the end of the  day. If a child attends a school that is  falling apart, does it matter how many  computers are  in the classroom and  whether or not the school is wired? If a  child lives in a dangerous and violent  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:22 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S16JN0.REC S16JN0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000

251,,106,-0.392,9,2000-06-28,Mr. WEXLER.," Mr. Speaker, this Republican bill is bad medicine. Instead of providing prescription coverage for seniors, this bill provides political coverage for Republicans. Premiums are 40 percent higher than the Democratic plan. Worst of all, it puts seniors desperate  for  life-saving  drugs  at  the mercy of greedy HMOs. Sorry Mom, one year you are covered, the next you are not. Instead of helping seniors get well, this plan helps  insurance companies get wealthy. Mr. Speaker, seniors deserve a second opinion by allowing a vote on  the Democratic  plan  which  guarantees Medicare drug coverage. Republicans are  guilty  of  congressional  malpractice. And since they killed the Patients’ Bill of Rights, we cannot even sue them. Who will this bill truly cover? Republicans on election day. ",2000
252,,106,0.32,9,2000-06-28,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  strong  support of  this  rule, which will allow the House to debate a plan to give seniors access to affordable prescription drugs. This bipartisan plan is voluntary, affordable, and covers all Medicare beneficiaries. Yet, the other side wants to change the subject. They want to divert our attention away from the fact that this Congress is about to vote on one of the most significant  issues we  face this year by trying to bring this House to a halt and to prove their claim that we are a ‘‘do nothing Congress.’’ It has been their plan all along. Before this rule was even written, they had the press release out celebrating their dramatic walk-out on the debate this morning. Regardless of how many substitutes, amendments, hours of debate,  their rhetoric and antics would be the same. Well, methinks thou doth protest too much. My colleagues know full well that, under this fair process, the rule provides that both Republicans and Democrats get one bite of the apple, one for them and one for us. I would remind my colleagues that even this basic fairness was never guaranteed until the Republicans took control of the House and ensured that a motion to recommit would always be available to the minority. But they do not want a fair fight. They want an unfair advantage. The Democrats do not want to debate the issue. They are throwing a temper tantrum to divert attention away from the merits of this bill. Well, frankly, it is a transparent political strategy and it is irresponsible. But these political stunts are not surprising. It has been clear for some time that the issue of prescription drugs has been a political game to the Democrats all  along. And  every minute  they waste, every dilatory tactic and every delay they employ will show their real intentions. They did not walk out on us, Mr. Speaker. They walked out on American seniors. And shame on them. Mr. Speaker, I think the American people deserve better. They deserve an honest debate about the merits of the Medicare prescription drug plan that is before this House. Unfortunately, the Democrats’ political grandstanding is designed to eclipse an honest debate on the merits. But we will walk through it if we must. We will do it cheerfully. The American people deserve no less. They want to hear an honest debate. I urge my colleagues, come back from their grandstanding, their press conferences, their parade, and let us get to work. I urge my colleagues to support this fair rule. ",2000
253,,106,-0.416,16,2000-06-28,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker, this process, this rule is an outrage against the American people. It has been said that the Republican plan is a bipartisan plan. It is not a bipartisan plan. There  has  been  no  conversation about this plan and the putting together of the plan with the members of our Committee on Ways and Means. There has been no conversation between  the  leadership on either  side about how we could build a bipartisan plan to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. This process is a grave disservice to all Americans. The debate is being shut down on the most important issue to American seniors since the creation of Medicare. The decision of the majority does more than deny the view of the Democratic minority to be heard, it denies the American people a vote on a plan that would provide real affordable, definable, and guaranteed prescription medicine benefits  for America’s seniors. This debate, like so many of the debates we have held in this Congress this year, is always my way or the highway. b1300 Bipartisan is defined by: Are you for our partisan bill? Not: Can we work together to find real bipartisanship? I believe the other party is stooping to this level simply for politics. They are intent on passing anything that is called ‘‘prescription coverage’’ in order to avoid the issue being raised in the November elections. It is the passage of a press release. It is the passage of a statement of intent. They want to ram through their bill and shut down debate so that the American people will not know what this sham bill really is. Their posters said it best when Glen Bolger told them, and I quote, ‘‘It is more important to communicate that you have a plan than it is to communicate what is in the plan.’’ This is a PR effort. It is a sham. It is a hoax. It is public relations. It is electioneering. It is not writing a plan that will help the American people. Mr. Speaker, instead of making prescriptions more affordable for seniors, they want to hand a huge subsidy to the insurance industry, which has said it will not write these plans. The head of the association came and said, we will not write these plans. Why will they not write these plans? They will not write them because this  is not what insurance companies do. They underwrite risk. We have fire policies on our houses. Why? Because most houses do not burn down. The lucky people pay for the unlucky people. When we come to prescription drug benefits, everybody makes a claim, because everybody needs prescription drugs. It is a benefit, not an insurance plan. That is why the basic supposition of the Republican plan that they are going to turn this over to insurance companies is completely flawed, and completely wrong. Mr. Speaker, we believe this should be done through Medicare. We believe it should be affordable. We believe it should be definable. We feel it should be equal all over this country. What  is really happening today  is what  really happened  35 years ago. This is the same debate we had over Medicare. The Republicans wanted to privatize Medicare; we wanted to have Medicare run through a Medicare system. They want to set up a new bureaucracy in the Government to run this program; we say we can run it through the Medicare system. Republicans have never believed in Medicare. As former Speaker Gingrich once said, ‘‘Medicare would wither on the vine because we think people are voluntarily going to leave it.’’ The majority  leader  once  said, Medicare should not be part of our society. We should not have to be in this program. Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends in the Republican Party, that is an honest debate. If my colleagues want to get rid of Medicare, say so. If they want to privatize it, try to do so. But let us have an honest debate. Let us have real alternatives on the floor. Our plan is a real benefit, it is definable, it is affordable, it is equal for everybody in this country.  It would have catastrophic coverage so that people over $4,000 a year of costs would have all of their Medicare costs picked up. I was in a press conference with seniors a few days ago. A woman who had a heart transplant got up and said her costs are $1,300 a month for her drugs. She said her Social Security benefit is $1,300 a month. And then she broke down and cried, because she could not figure out where the money to live on was going to come from. Mr. Speaker, we need a plan that offers a real benefit to people like that who right now in today’s world are facing this problem. Vote against this rule, vote to defeat this plan, let us get back to writing a real bipartisan plan that will help the seniors citizens of this country. ",2000
254,,106,0.316,58,2000-06-28,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  the  bipartisan  prescription  drug plan. It is bipartisan. I want to pay special tribute to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON), a member of the other side of  the aisle, a Democrat who worked hand-in-hand with all of us on the Prescription Drug Task Force to craft this truly bipartisan, pragmatic plan. I thank the gentleman for putting the interests of Minnesota seniors ahead of politics. We should all put the interests of America’s seniors ahead of politics and pass  this bipartisan plan  today.  It truly  is, Mr.  Speaker,  all  about choices. The question we must ask ourselves, if health care choices are okay for Members of Congress, why are some so opposed to expanding choices for our seniors? Let us not try to have it both ways. Let us expand choices for seniors. Seniors deserve choices  in their health care just like younger Americans, just like Members of Congress. This bill, this bipartisan bill, guarantees all seniors access to at least two different health plans. Do not take choices away from seniors. Let us give them the choices, the access, to prescription drugs that they deserve. ",2000
255,,106,-0.266,58,2000-06-28,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I hope today’s debate  represents bipartisan consensus that we need to help our seniors with the high cost of prescription drugs. The choice, however, presented on the House floor falls far short of meeting  that need, because we will only be allowed to vote on the proposition that we should take Federal dollars, send it to insurance companies and hope that they provide benefits to seniors. Mr. Speaker, I used to be an insurance commissioner. I regulated insurance companies. The dollars that the majority would propose for insurance companies will go to sales commission, it will go to insurance company executive salaries, it will go to fancy office buildings. It will not go to the hard coverage that our seniors need for the high cost of prescription drugs. It is not the way to go. The way to go is the alternative that we will not be allowed to vote on, Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. It is time to update the coverage of the Medicare program and offer the protection our seniors need. North Dakota’s seniors want Medicare  coverage  for  prescription drugs, not an insurance company sham. ",2000
256,,106,0.382,65,2000-06-28,Mr. BLILEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Environment of the Committee on Commerce. ",2000
257,,106,0.382,65,2000-06-28,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in support of H.R. 4680, the Medicare RX 2000 Act. The addition of prescription drug coverage to the Medicare program is one of the most important things we can do this year. I am saddened, Mr. Speaker, by the strictly partisan and political debate that has arisen on this vital issue and by the efforts to continuously interrupt these proceedings with nonsensical procedural motions. This conduct reinforces my sincere belief  that  the Democratic  leadership does not want to take real action this year on this issue, just like they failed to address  the problem  for over  40 years when they controlled the House. This is a critical concern for seniors throughout the country, and it should not be reduced to merely a political issue or to one of spite. I am reminded of a debate in the 104th Congress when we worked successfully to save Medicare  from bankruptcy. At that time the Democratic  leadership  exploited the crisis facing Medicare by engaging in demagoguery for political gain. The Washington Post editorial board rightly  labeled them  ‘‘Medagogues.’’ Now they are playing politics with seniors in desperate need of prescription drugs. In the words of the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, ‘‘There they go again.’’ Many of the latest drug and biological  therapies  are  targeted  at  preventing or curing diseases that affect senior citizens and persons with disabilities. However, the Federal health insurance program serving these individuals, Medicare,  currently,  as we know,  lacks coverage  for most prescription drugs and biologicals. As a result,  one-third  of Medicare  beneficiaries have no drug coverage at all. The  two-thirds of beneficiaries who have  coverage  have  to  obtain  it through a variety of sources, often at considerable expense. Last year, I introduced legislation to help the neediest and sickest seniors now. The bill before us, although not perfect, helps those seniors in greatest need and those who are the sickest and, thus, has my support. There is always room  for  improvement,  but  in  the meantime, we can help the most vulnerable seniors now.

258,,106,-0.33,72,2000-06-28,Mr. WEYGAND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this proposal, as I did earlier today, as we have been doing all day long today. What has been happening to the American public is outrageous that, indeed, in fact, that the Republicans will propose today a bill that will actually cost us more in the long run, provide us less with prescription drug coverage and do a disservice to all of our seniors. I ask all of our Members to vote no on the bill. I ask all of our Members not to even entertain any inkling of an idea that this will be good for our senior citizens, and I hope that all of us will be able to come back with a real bill for prescription drug coverage that will be part of Medicare, not part of a bailout for insurance companies. ",2000
259,,106,-0.362,72,2000-06-28,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, as Republicans deny us a chance to offer real prescription benefit under Medicare, I think of my mother and the millions of seniors  like her across this country who may not understand Washington politics, but know all  too well  the every day struggle to buy their medications. Like so many seniors, my mother relies solely on her Social Security benefit, and yet her drug costs totals more than half of her monthly income. Mr. Speaker, very simply stated, the Republican plan is the first step towards privatizing Medicare and denying Democrats the opportunity to provide the only real Medicare benefit. ",2000
260,,106,0.366,79,2000-06-28,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4680, the Medicare Rx 2000 Act, and urge its adoption. We all know that American society is growing older and there is a lot of discussion about the best way to prepare for this reality. Despite the fact that older Americans make up only 13 percent of our population,  this age group consumes more  than one-third of  the prescription medicines in our country. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office recently found that, in three years, the average senior will spend $2,075 annually on medication. Compare  that  to 1970, a year when surveys revealed that people over the age of 65 spent an average of $56 on prescription drugs. That equates  to $247  in  today’s dollars, which is a mere fraction of the cost citizens are currently paying. This  is a steep increase by any measure. The bipartisan plan we have before us  is eminently fair. It provides reasonable choices for consumers. Every consumer is guaranteed a choice of a least two prescription plans. We should reject the ‘one size fits some’ solution that some Members advocate. I think a recent New York Times (June 18, 2000) subtitle says it all: ‘‘Democrats’ Prescription Plan Calls for ‘One Size Fits All’—G.O.P. Offers Choice’’. The  American  people  saw  through  this scheme in 1994 when they rejected the Clinton health plan and they do not want to see a repeat of this mentality. The bipartisan plan ensures  that our nation’s neediest  seniors  receive prescription drug coverage. This vital safety net ensures that no one will be left without coverage. The bipartisan plan fits within the framework of the budget resolution this Congress adopted. I sit on the Budget Committee and we responsibly set aside $40 billion specifically for a prescription drug benefit. In fact, I would remind my colleagues that substitutes offered by the Ranking Democrat on the committee, Mr. SPRATT, and the Blue Dog Coalition both offered $40 billion—exactly the same figure we are using today. Some Members advocate busting the budget  through a $100 bill scheme. Like every household, we have to live within our means, especially since we are at the dawn of the balanced budget era. With all of the pomp and bluster of the prescription drug issue it is easy to lose sight of the bigger, more important issue: overall Medicare modernization. The bill we have before us is a nice step but we need to do more to address this critical issue. I look forward to the day when we  turn our  full attention  towards saving and strengthening our Medicare system. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the bipartisan prescription drug plan. ",2000
261,,106,-0.491,79,2000-06-28,Mr. KILPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill, H.R. 4680, the Medicare Drug 2000 Act. I am outraged and frustrated that my colleagues across the aisle gave us no opportunity to vote or debate our Democratic alternative. That is ironic when you consider the opposition likes to champion itself as the party choice; yet, we are denied the opportunity to vote for a different choice today. It is either the Republican plan or no plan. Can it be  that  they are afraid  to have  their bill measured against a more affordable and comprehensive  prescription  drug  proposal  that Democratic Members sought to offer but were denied by the majority? The Republican plan cannot stand up to the rigors of a full, fair and honest debate. I oppose the legislation not only on procedural grounds, but for reasons of substance as well. I believe that a prescription drug benefit under Medicare must adhere  to  three principles: the benefit must be universal, it must be comprehensive, and it must be affordable. The Republican proposal  fails on all  three times tests. This bill lacks universality. I believe a Medicare prescription drug program  should be available to eligible senior citizens or disabled persons from Michigan to Maine, from Oregon to Ohio,  from Alaska  to Alabama. This bill does not guarantee prescription drug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries at an affordable price. It is restricted to only those who can afford to purchase private market drug plans. The Republican plan lacks a comprehensive package  of  benefits. My Republican  colleagues point out that their plan is not a ‘‘one ´ size  fits all’’ plan. That  is a cliche without meaning. I would suggest it is important to define by what ‘‘one size fits all’’ means. If one size  fits all means a comprehensive set of pharmaceutical products,  then  I am  for  it.  If one size fits all means that new drugs become available to everyone then I am for it. If one size  fit all means  that  the prescription drug program is responsive to the needs of our severely disabled, then I am for that, too. The Republican plan is far from comprehensive. The Republican bill creates a multi-tiered system of coverage with  the  lowest beneficiaries  limited  to bargain basement plans. The Republican plan subsided private health insurance companies  to offer  ‘‘Medigap-like’’ policies providing prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. Even the president of the Health Insurance Association of America  (HIAA) has said  that private  insurance VerDate 11-MAY-2000 07:57 Jun 29, 2000 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28JN7.061 pfrm06 PsN: H28PT1 ",2000

The reason I was not ruled in order is probably  the  same  reason my  colleagues were not ruled in order is because we cannot spend money in this House that we do not yet have. But we all know in this room that we expect new estimates within a month. It would have, I think, been irresponsible on our part to not move forward on prescription drugs and to keep this process moving forward to get a prescription drug plan. And I support that. But I would not want to have held that back to get a fix on more Medicare fixes this year and in the year starting in October just because we do not have the budget estimates yet. And that is the nature of this. I have kind of taken this up as my personal cause on this side of the aisle. I think some of my colleagues sitting here know that I make it a pretty regular effort to do things in a bipartisan way, whether it is on low-power radio or Superfund or a whole variety of other things we are working on, Baca land in northern New Mexico, and quite a few things in the Committee on Commerce. That is just kind of who I am, and that is my style. I commit to work with those of my colleagues who are concerned about Medicare reimbursement rates and the disparity in different parts of the country to try to make this work as soon as we have the budget estimates to do so. I give my colleagues my personal word on that. ",2000

268,,106,-0.205,219,2000-06-28,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr.  President, today, along with Senator THOMPSON, I am introducing a bill at the request of the administration to amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. The bill is designed to improve the federal government’s role in managing both its personal and real property. By  granting  agencies  enhanced tools to handle their assets, the bill’s goal is to bring federal asset management into the 21st century. I invite comments on the administration’s proposal and  look  forward to reviewing them. By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. MIKULSKI): S. 2806. A bill to amend the National Housing Act to clarify the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to terminate mortgagee origination approval  for poorly performing mortgagees; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. CREDITWATCHACTOF2000 ",2000
269,,106,-0.435,219,2000-06-28,Mr. SARBANES.,"  Mr.  President, today  I  am  introducing,  ‘‘Credit Watch,’’ a bill that will authorize the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to  identify  lenders who have excessively high early default and claim rates and terminate their origination approval. This legislation is necessary to protect the FHA fund and take action against lenders who are contributing to the deterioration of our neighborhoods. A recent rash of FHA loan defaults have  led to  foreclosures and vacant properties in a number of cities around the country. In Baltimore, the effects of high foreclosure rates are acute. In some neighborhoods, there are numerous foreclosed homes, now abandoned, within just a few blocks of each other. This can often be the beginning of a neighborhood’s decline.  It creates a perception that the property and the neighborhood is not highly valued. In turn,  these  neighborhoods  become physically deteriorated and often attract criminal activity. It’s like a rotten apple in a barrel. The rundown appearance of one home spreads to the surrounding neighborhood. Neighborhoods that are struggling to stabilize and revitalize  find their efforts undermined by the presence of abandoned homes. The Department  of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD), community activists, and local law makers have come together to examine the  loans being made in neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates. In Baltimore and other cities, these groups found that careless lenders are offering FHA insured loans to families who cannot afford to pay them back. Early default or claim of these loans frequently leads to foreclosure of the home. A foreclosed property can easily turn into an uninhabited home, which can either begin or continue a cycle of decline. In an effort to reduce the number of loans that end in foreclosure, the FHA developed several new oversight methods. One of which is ‘‘Credit Watch.’’ ‘‘Credit Watch’’ is an automated system that compares the number of early foreclosures and claims of lenders in the same area. This legislation authorizes FHA to revoke the origination approval of  lenders who have  significantly higher rates of early defaults and claims than the other lenders in the same area. FHA is currently targeting lenders with default rates over 300% of the area average. They estimate that in Baltimore this threshold would allow them to terminate the origination privileges of three major lenders that account for 40% of early defaults and claims. The legislation accounts for differing regional economies by ensuring that lenders are only compared to others making loans in the same community. It also provides a manner by which terminated lenders may appeal the decision of the FHA, if they believe there are mitigating factors that may justify higher rates. When lenders make loans with no regard for the consumer or the health of the community, the FHA must be able to take action  in a timely manner. This practice is a costly abuse of the FHA insurance fund. Quick action not only protects the health of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund, but it protects neighborhoods from the detrimental effects of high vacancy rates and consumers from the pain of foreclosure and serious damage to their credit. Lenders that offer loans to individuals who cannot afford them should not be able to continue making those loans. It is a bad deal for taxpayers. It is a bad deal for neighborhoods. It is a bad deal for the families who take out the loan. Credit Watch is an effective and efficient way that the FHA can prevent these unfortunate  foreclosures  from happening. While we need to address the larger issue of predatory lending in our communities, ‘‘Credit Watch’’ is an obvious and immediate solution to one part of the problem.

Last fall, I introduced the ‘‘Medicare Preservation and Improvement Act of 1999’’, with Senators BREAUX, KERREY, and HAGEL. This was the first bipartisan attempt to comprehensively reform Medicare in the program’s 35 year history.

272,,106,-0.244,247,2000-06-28,Mr. MALONEY of Connecticut.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my concern about the deep  cuts  in  the Veterans AdministrationHousing  and  Urban  Development—Independent Agencies  (VA–HUD) Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001. This legislation not only slashes funds for programs that have enhanced economic development and improved housing in Connecticut and the 5th Congressional District, but also short changes our nation’s veterans and NASA programs. My support for the VA/HUD Appropriations bill is conditioned on a conference agreement that increases funding for HUD, the Veterans Administration and NASA. If allowed  to stand,  the cuts  to HUD programs will have a significant  impact on  the State of Connecticut and on my own congressional district, affecting both economic development  initiatives and a variety of housing services. The Republican budget cutters have dug deep into initiatives that have proven track records of success. There is simply no reason to reduce our efforts to provide economic development for our towns and cities in the form of Brownfields monies and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) funds. By doing so, we will  set our  communities and our economies backwards, rather than spur them forward. My colleagues, the VA/HUD Appropriations legislation cuts  funding  for key NASA programs. Specifically,  the bill  that passed  the House  reduces aerospace  technologies by $322 million as well as cutting $60 million for Human Space Flight. This shortsighted action jeopardizes our country’s leadership in space and our national security. Unless NASA funding is restored in conference, this legislation should not pass this Congress. I supported this bill because it contains an increase of $2.6 billion from last year funding for  the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House-passed budget for the Department will go a long way toward helping our nation care for  its veterans. For example,  I am encouraged that the House provided $20.3 billion in funding  for veterans medical care  in Fiscal Year 2001. This is an increase of $1.3 billion over last year’s funding. Funding totaling $351 million for veterans medical and prosthetic research also increased by $30 million from last year. Our veterans’ cemeteries at the national and state  levels were  funded  fairly as well. However, we need  to do more  for our veterans. There are a number of underfunded areas that require our attention. These include resources for veterans’ extended care facilities and for the benefits they deserve. It is also essential that the Congress find additional funding to improve VA facilities across the country. I supported the VA/HUD Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 because it restores badly needed funds for the Veterans Administration. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in working to reverse the housing, CDBG, economic development and NASA cuts in this bill. If this important  funding  is not  restored,  I  reserve judgment on a Conference agreement on the final version of the bill. I urge you to do the same.

273,,106,0.216,8,2000-07-11,Mr. LAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. There are two other sponsors of the bill that I wanted to recognize for their hard work. One is the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRANKS) and the other is a tireless advocate, the gentleman from New York (Mr. GILMAN). I just wanted to emphasize with a personal story, Mr. Speaker, the cruelty and the injustice of the current status of Syrian Jews and talk about a person who has the potential to make a great difference in our society. Joseph Durzieh. Joseph was a brilliant medical student at the University of Damascus, one of the handful of Jews allowed to pursue a higher education in Syria. And just for an aside, Mr. Speaker, I would note that it was not so long ago that Jews were not permitted to hold a government position or to work in a bank in Syria. There was that level of bias and discrimination. Joseph came to America in 1992 and immediately  proceeded  to  pass  his United  States medical  equivalency exams with flying colors. He completed his internship in New York and now is working in a State University of New York fellowship program in Brooklyn. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Durzieh is a well-respected physician. He  is highly  esteemed by his  fellow doctors. He  is highly valued by his employers. He is highly beloved by his patients. Yet because he has been unable to obtain a green card, he cannot obtain a license to practice medicine in America. When his fellowship expires next year, Dr. Durzieh will have no choice but to leave the medical field. Mr. Speaker, if that were to happen, we will all be the poorer for it. We will all be the poorer if because of an emigration law technicality the people of New York are deprived of the services of a gifted physician. We will all be the poorer if because of the vindictiveness of a Syrian regime we do not allow Dr. Joseph Durzieh to use his talents as a healer. Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity here to see that justice is done, to ensure that the taste of freedom that all others enjoy are enjoyed by Syrian Jews. I urge the House to strongly, strongly support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2000

277,,106,0.293,29,2000-07-11,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr.  Chairman,  I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, this may be the most ill-conceived amendment that we have considered during debate on this bill. Some have called this nothing more than corporate welfare. Well, I will tell my colleagues that in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, what the Federal Government has done, at a cost of $1 million apiece, is they have reintroduced wolves into the State of Idaho as ‘‘nonessential  experimental  populations.’’ They are costing ranchers and farmers thousands and  thousands of dollars. Not only are they costing ranchers and farmers money, they are decimating our elk and deer herds. Ranchers would like to take care of this  problem  themselves.  Unfortunately, there are substantial penalties and  fines  involved. It has been said that the Fish and Wildlife Service does not use other nonlethal means of trying to maintain control of these predators. The fact is that we capture them, we trap them, we have taken them to other parts of the State, as far away as 300 and 400 miles; and we  find that within 2, 3, 4 days, a week, they are back in their original location, oftentimes. In fact, last week I was in Idaho in the  Saw  Tooth Mountains,  and  I bought this book; and I would like to take just a moment to reintroduce my colleagues or introduce my colleagues to the Saw Tooth pack of wolves in the State of Idaho. Now, I have to admit, these are beautiful animals. In fact, if we look at this page here, this is their class picture in the nice, soft focus. This is Komoto, the alpha leader. He is regal, confident and benevolent. This here is Moto. He is of middle rank. He is bright, curious and energetic. He also initiates play. Unfortunately, let me  show my  colleagues what  play looks like to Bambi. This is what play looks like to Bambi. Now, I will tell my colleagues, they are causing great problems in the State of Idaho. But we knew as part of the deal of reintroduction of these wolves as a nonessential experimental population is that we would have to manage some of them. We would have to kill some of the wolves that got out of control. That was part of the deal. Unfortunately, we have had to do that. Anyone that thought we were going to reintroduce wolves into Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Minnesota, or New York had better be prepared to deal with the problem wolves that occur. It is not just in the wilderness. We have mothers that are standing by school buses in Salmon, Idaho, because wolves are on the borders of the communities. ",2000
278,,106,0.29,36,2000-07-11,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. SKEEN), the chairman, for yielding me the time, and I rise in opposition to this amendment. Mr. Chairman, all of us here are supportive of providing better access to prescription drugs to those that need them. Just 2 weeks ago, we fought all day to provide greater coverage  for older Americans. We all agree that no person, particularly  the older people,  the  elderly, should ever have to choose between food and medicine. But as we work to provide greater coverage and access, we do not want to undermine today’s private scientific research and medical innovation that will continue to find tomorrow’s cures, which I believe this amendment does. Mr. Chairman, in our collective excitement to do more here, some today appear to be determined to do just that with a number of seemingly attractive amendments to this agricultural appropriations bill. They seek to do so by promoting poorly disguised price controls, by throwing out Food and Drug Administration  protections  for  consumers, by  suggesting  that all  imported drugs are  safe,  reliable and fresh, and we know they are not; by holding up Canada as a model of health care delivery and  inexpensive medicines, which  it  is not; by requiring price disclosures that no other American industry has to comply with; and by demanding research and development  information and denying their product approvals if not forthcoming and by ignoring the fact that about 25 cents on the R&D dollar actually results in an approved FDA product or new medicine. And they seek to do so, Mr. Chairman, by suggesting that it is only the National Institutes of Health that does basic research and that the taxpayers are being ripped off by the pharmaceutical companies. While the rhetoric fits the times, the facts deserve some weight. With  specific  regard  to  the Allen amendment,  I believe we are better served by promoting research partnerships between government and the private sector that yield new medicines and cures, not by discouraging them. This amendment deserves to be soundly defeated. The  CHAIRMAN.

280,,106,0.24,78,2000-07-11,Mr. JONES of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker, I come back to the floor after several weeks of not being on the floor to talk about our men and women in uniform that are on food stamps. This photograph is of a Marine that is getting ready to deploy for the Balkans. In his arms he has his daughter, Bridgett, and on his feet is a little 2year-old girl named Megan. Mr. Speaker, we have done a great deal to help our men and women in uniform in the 6 years I have been here in office as we have tried to increase their pay, to improve their quality of life, and we have made some great strides. But, Mr. Speaker, the problem is, we still have men and women in uniform that are on food stamps. Mr. Speaker, I feel, as do most Members of this House, that anybody that is willing to die for this country when called upon to protect our freedoms, they  should not be under any circumstances on food stamps. I felt somewhat compelled after July 4th, being home, and, like most Members here, I went to several parades, and at a couple of these parades the Marine Band was there and the Honor Guard, and I saw those Marines in their dress blues, and it just reminded me, not just of Marines, but any man or woman in uniform, whether it be the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force or the Coast Guard, that we would have those in uniform that are on food stamps. Here we are this week, again we will be debating another foreign operations bill, yet we find millions of dollars to send overseas. I know there is a need to have foreign aid, I am not saying that we should not be, but I think we do have an obligation to protect those in uniform first, those that are on food stamps. Quite frankly, I am quoting Daniel Webster who said, ‘‘God grants liberty to those who love it and are willing and prepared to defend it.’’ Mr. Speaker, we are  fortunate  to have the men and women in uniform that we have in the Armed Services of America, but, yet, again, I came to the floor because we have a bill that I introduced a year ago, H.R. 1055, that would help our men and women in uniform. I have over 100 signatures, Mr. Speaker, and that is both Republican and Democrat, and I continue to encourage my leadership, as I hope that Democrats who have signed this bill are encouraging  their  leadership,  to say that we will not leave this year in October without helping those on food stamps, to do the very best to make sure that we have no one in uniform on food stamps. That might be somewhat idealistic, but I think it is worthy of our efforts to do that, to make sure that they are not on food stamps. I want to share with you, because I have military bases, Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, Cherry Point Marine Air Station in Havelock, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, and also a Coast Guard base in Elizabeth City. Recently  the  Jacksonville  paper, which is the home of Camp Lejeune, they did a feature on men and women in uniform that are at the bottom of the ladder, so-to-speak, as it speaks to their income, and this article said that there are 145 Marine families in Camp Lejeune, which again  is  in Jacksonville, that receive a total of $25,000 a month in food stamps. I ask this, Mr. Speaker, that if we have 145 that are identified that go to the social services for food stamps, how many do we have in that area that are not going because of pride or because of some other reason? So, again, I am encouraging our leadership this year, Mr. Speaker, before we leave in October, to please, let us work together in a bipartisan way to make sure that when we leave, that no one is dependent on food stamps in the military. Mr. Speaker, I would like to close with a poem that I think is very appropriate for all of us in the Congress, as well as anyone in this country that maybe has not served in the military, to remember that the freedoms that we enjoy are guaranteed by those in uniform. The poem was written by Father Dennis O’Brien, United States Marine Corps. ‘‘Who has given us freedom of the press? It is the soldier, not the poet. Who has given us freedom of speech? It is the soldier, not the campus organizer. Who has given us  the  freedom  to demonstrate? It is the soldier, Who salutes the flag, Who serves beneath the flag, Whose coffin is draped by the flag, Who allows the protester to burn the flag.’’ Mr. Speaker, I close with that, because, again,  I want to remind the Members of the United States House of Representatives that we do have over 6,000 men and women in uniform which are on food stamps, and I would hope we would do everything possible  to make sure when we leave again in October that we have very  few  in the military on food stamps. b1800 ORDER OF BUSINESS The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. SIMPSON).

Even the Cubans understand that our senior citizens are getting ripped off and everybody in the world gets a better deal on prescription drugs than we do. That is really telling. I compliment the gentleman on his remarks. I also want  to mention  the gentleman from Arkansas has been a leader, not only in our Prescription Drug Task Force, but in his sponsorship of the legislation that would allow senior citizens of this country, and all of us, to be able to buy drugs in Mexico or Canada, and we can do that legally. Obviously that is where we would all buy them because they get them for less than half the price that we are having to pay for them. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. GREEN). The  gentleman from Texas and I served, not only here together, but in the State senate before. He is a leader on the Committee on Commerce on this issue, and he has worked long and hard to try to bring some fairness to prescription drug prices and to provide some benefit for our senior citizens of this area of great need.

283,,106,-0.324,85,2000-07-11,Mr. GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to  thank  the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. TURNER), my good friend and former Texas State representative, and I served with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. TURNER), Texas State senator, former mayor, and now Member of Congress, for putting together this Special Order tonight. This is not a national security issue where everybody is only going to have to listen to folks from our part of the country tonight. We have the gentlewoman  from  Connecticut  (Ms. DELAURO) and also the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), so they will not have to hear Texas and Arkansas accents all this evening on this important issue. But it is a national issue. I know people just like to hear us because we talk a little slower. But no matter how we talk, I think we are united on this one issue because we know that, from Texas, we call it buying a pig in a poke. I think what the House passed the week before the 4th of July was a travesty. It was something that the seniors can see through, and we said that on the floor. That is why I think it only passed by three votes as the gentleman from Texas said. I am glad we are using this time to continue to explain the fallacy of that bill that was passed, that our Republicans  colleagues  had  succeeded  in passing a prescription drug benefit that provides more political cover than it provides for prescription coverage for our Nation’s seniors. The  legislation was designed to benefit the companies who make the prescription drugs and not necessarily our seniors. Just like the Patients’ Bill of Rights and education funding, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are using their same old strategy. They water down legislation. They pass a caption that sounds good, but it does not have any benefit to our folks. Ultimately, it will be a failure because all they want to do is get them past the November election. Congress, our own budget office, concluded that more than half of our Medicare beneficiaries who do not have drug coverage today would not be covered by the Republican private  insurance plan. I cannot stress that too much. It is an insurance plan. Like the gentleman from Texas said, it  is  like buying  insurance against haircuts. Everyone of us needs one, although I have to admit some of us do not need as many as we did a few years ago, but we still get them even though we do not need them as much. What is more frustrating is we did not even get the chance to offer an alternative plan. Again, not only is their plan bad, but they were so afraid to defend it that they thought maybe an alternative plan, and again we have a Democratic plan I will talk about in a minute, but any alternative they did not even want to have a vote on. b1900 So not only do they pass a bill that I think is hurting seniors, but they are even subverting our process here in the House. All of us ought to have an opportunity to give choices. In fact, it is interesting, I believe in free enterprise, just like my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but I believe in competition. On the prescription drug benefit they did not want to have competition on their bill because it could not hold water to the alternative plan we had.

285,,106,-0.267,120,2000-07-11,Mr. DORGAN.," I think the Senator from California is right. I was thinking also about the alternatives. We have had a lot of discussion and will have, I assume, a great deal more discussion on the ability to pass a family farm on to the children, and I certainly support that. I want to have an exemption that will prevent the estate tax from snaring in its web the passage of the family farm from parents to children. I will say to my friends who raise these issues, if you want to help family farmers, we have an amendment that will enable you to do that. But then you go further and say: We want to provide the richest 400 people in America a $250 billion tax break during the second  10 years. That  is  triple  the amount of money each year that we now spend on the farm program. We have this Freedom to Farm bill which is just devastating family farmers. Grain prices have collapsed. They have been collapsed for a long time. Perhaps we could take just a third of the amount of money they want to give in tax relief to the wealthiest estates in America—just a third of it—and say: Let’s have a farm program that really keeps family farmers on the farm. It is not a priority for some. See, that is the problem. It would be nice, for example—just in terms of what people think priorities are—if we could all go to an auction sale at some point. Arlo Schmidt, an auctioneer in North Dakota —he is a wonderful auctioneer—told me about a young boy about 8 years old who came up and grabbed him by the leg at the end of an auction sale. This boy was the son of a farmer whose machinery and land were being sold. This little boy grabbed the auctioneer around his  thigh and, with tears in his eyes, looked up at him, pointed at him, and said: You sold my dad’s tractor. This little boy was very angry. He said: You sold my dad’s tractor. Arlo said: I patted him on the shoulder and tried to calm him down a little bit. This was after the action was over. His dad’s equipment was gone, and so on. The  little  boy had none  of  this calming. The little boy, with tears in his eyes, said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big. The point is, we have a lot of things happening in this country that relate to family values and our economy and to what kind of country we are. One of them I care a lot about, because I come from a farm State, is the health of our family  farmers and  their ability  to make a decent living. For those who would come to the Senate and say, let’s get rid of the entire estate tax, I would say, regarding the wealthiest estates in our country, for you to flex your muscles and exert your energy to lift the burden of the estate tax from estates worth $1 billion, I do not understand it. I do not understand it when we have so many other needs, such as the need for income tax relief for middle-income families —not the wealthy estates—the need to enact a family farm program so the farmers have a decent chance to make a living, the need to adopt a Patients’ Bill of Rights, the need to include a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare  program—and  do  it  soon. There are so many needs, and what you have done is elevate the need for lifting the burden of the estate tax on the largest estates in our country, saying: That is job No. 1. That is our priority.

291,,106,-0.429,190,2000-07-11,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Bayside Times, a weekly community newspaper in Bayside, New York in the borough of Queens, which is hosting its 65th anniversary celebration on Thursday, July 13, 2000. The Bayside Times was  launched by  the Alison family early in the last century. The first issue hit the newsstands on July 2, 1935 with the front page headline ‘‘Bayside’s Own Newspaper Makes Its Appearance.’’ That first edition  included stories on  local marriages and birthday celebrations,  the Bayside American Legion and the Bayside Pet Show. The newspaper attracted many loyal readers and established a  strong  identity  in  the area. The ‘‘Bayside Times’’ was actually the first community newspaper that I had ever seen. Then on July 10, 1989, Steve Blank, who had a vision of creating a daily newspaper that published  once  a  week,  purchased  the Bayside Times from David Allison Jr., a second generation owner of the publication. Steve Blank brought  years of experience  in  the newspaper business  to  the Bayside Times. After graduating with a journalism degree from Boston University, he held positions at weekly newspapers  in  the Massachusetts area,  the Daily Record in his native New Jersey and the Post Standard in Syracuse, New York. He was also a court house correspondent and an award winning  investigative  reporter  for  the Kansas City Star. In addition, he obtained experience on the business side of the industry as a media buyer for Savermart, a major chain of consumer electronics stores. Steve Blank used his  impeccable credentials  to  transform  the Bayside Times  into a model  for community  journalism. Under his leadership, the quality of writing and reporting of local news events became second to none. Steve Blank also afforded  local businesses and merchants, the opportunities to reach their customers  in an efficient and cost-effective manner. He redesigned the periodical to give it a more contemporary look and reorganized it to make it easier for readers to find information. He also boosted the newspaper’s circulation, computerized its operation and increased the editorial and business staff. From 1991 to 1998, Mr. Blank expanded his operation  to  include newspapers  throughout the Borough  of Queens. Operating  under Queens Publishing Corporation, Steve Blank presently publishes 13 newspapers  in  the Times/Ledger chain. Yes,  from Humble  beginnings—including loading newspapers into the trunk of his car— to winning numerous  local and state  journalism awards, Steve Blank has built  the Bayside Times into a newspaper heavyweight in  the new millennium. Yet he continues  to stay on the original mission that the Bayside Times set 65 years ago—to provide  local news coverage  in a  fair, accurate and balanced manner. Whether through the breadth of its stories, the quality of its editorials, the informative advertisements, the Q-Guide or its web site—www.timesledger.com—the Bayside Times remains on the cutting edge of community journalism. Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in congratulating Steve Blank and the entire staff of the Bayside Times and the Times/Ledger newspaper chain for a terrific 65 years of service to the Bayside community. I am confident that the Bayside Times will continue to enjoy success for many more years to come. f TRIBUTE TO MARCELLA R. BROWN ´ HON. JOSE E.

292,,106,-0.382,13,2000-07-17,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3125, The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, a bill that threatens the continued growth of e-commerce as well as the privacy rights of individuals. The Department of Justice, high-tech companies and socially conservative organizations agree—H.R. 3125 is fatally flawed. By prohibiting some types of gambling and expanding others, H.R. 3125 puts an inappropriate burden on high  tech companies and  interferes with the civil liberties of Americans. The legislation is rife with loopholes. Betting on horses and dogs is allowed; sports and casino-style games are not. Jai-alai is in, while state lotteries are out. This arbitrary patchwork of exemptions and prohibitions seems  to be rooted in the degree of power of a particular interest group rather than sound public policy. H.R. 3125 imposes new and unprecedented regulatory burdens on  the  Internet  that are shortsighted and  threaten our civil  liberties. The  notice  and  take-down  provisions  are overbroad, too burdensome for ISPs, and give the government too much power. Finally, the blocking provisions in H.R. 3125 threaten to intrude on individual privacy. This Congress is still in the process of drafting legislation aimed at assuring the privacy of individuals using  the  Internet. H.R. 3125 would leap over that thoughtful process and attempt to regulate what many Members have vowed to allow—freedom on the Internet.

302,,106,0.382,314,2000-07-17,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I rise today to express my strong support for the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000. This much-needed bill has had a long and difficult journey in getting to this point where we can pass it in the Senate. Passage will occur today; and, as we did in 1999, the Congress will send legislation  to help married  couples being hurt by marriage tax penalties to the President. I  congratulate my  colleague,  the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH,  for his very effective leadership on this issue. I realize that this matter has not been an easy one for Chairman ROTH this year, because he has been unfairly criticized by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for taking the approach on marriage tax penalty relief that is reflected in this bill. Let me explain. The Senate last year, led by Chairman ROTH, passed a marriage penalty relief provision in the Taxpayer Refund Act, which used a different solution to the marriage penalty problem than the one included in the bill before us today. Last year’s bill would have solved the marriage penalty problem by allowing married couples the option of filing as single taxpayers on a combined joint return. I supported that bill as did a majority of our colleagues. It was a good approach to solving a major tax problem for American families. Last year’s bill was effective in relieving the marriage penalty. However, it left untouched another glaring family tax problem that I will call the single-earner penalty. I would like to illustrate this with a hypothetical example of three Utah families. Let’s suppose we have three families, all neighbors living on the same street in Ogden, UT. These families are nearly identical, in that they each have three children  and  household  incomes  of $80,000 per year. The only differences in these three families are in the marital status of the parents and in who earns the  income. In the  first  family, the Allen family, the parents are married and both work outside the home and earn $40,000 each for a total of $80,000. The second family, the Brown family, are also married but only the husband works outside the home, earning $80,000 per year. The third family, the Campbell-Clark family, are unmarried parents and each of them earns $40,000 per year for a total of $80,000. As you can see from this chart, under current law, the Allen and the Brown families each pay about $9,200 in income tax each year. The CampbellClark  family, however, because they can file as single taxpayers, pay only a combined  $7,900. Because  the Allens each earn one-half the family income, if they were to divorce and file as singles, they could reduce their combined ",2000

309,,106,0.518,10,2000-07-24,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4002, the Famine Prevention and Freedom From Hunger Improvement Act of 2000. Before I talk about the legislation, I want to thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BEREUTER) for his leadership in this effort. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DAVIS) for agreeing to be the lead Democrat on this bill and make this truly a bipartisan effort. I also appreciate and commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. GILMAN) and the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. GEJDENSON),  their staffs working so well together to ensure this bipartisan legislation could be considered today. Finally, most importantly, I want to thank one of my constituents, Dr. Ed Price from Texas A&M University, who came to me with the framework for this legislation after working on behalf of the Board of International Food and Agriculture Development, and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. Without the help of Dr. Price and Texas A&M University,  it  is unlikely we would be considering this legislation today. Briefly, Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act, which is known as the Famine Prevention and Freedom From Hunger Act, was enacted in 1975 to increase world  food production and to identify solutions to food and nutrition problems in developing countries. According to USAID, the goal to increase world food production has been met. That is the good news. Unfortunately, USAID believes that we have not been as successful at solving the other goal, food and nutrition problems, in developing countries, poorer countries. Specifically, under H.R. 4002, we address that problem. We broaden the scope of agriculture to reflect a more modern industry, and we expand the ability of participants to be eligible to participate in Title XII programs so that the valuable resources of our universities will be better utilized. We also encourage nongovernmental organizations  to work with universities; and these changes, we believe, will result  in better partnerships with the Agency for International Development, improved service to the assisted countries, and greater trade and research benefits to us here in America. This legislation will also help America’s agriculture. As Title XII is currently written, we  focus on ag  research, but this modernization is designed to make extension a more implicit part of Title XII. This will help bring the lessons we learn overseas to our farms, which is important because developing nation markets are the fastest growing markets  for U.S.  farm products and anything we can do to help  speed along  their development will help our farmers. Improved agriculture is necessary to meet the objectives of U.S. foreign assistance,  such  as  improved  human health,  child  survival,  democratization, and free enterprise. Furthermore, improving foods for health, flavor and productivity require the assistance of international programs such as those sponsored under Title XII. Madam Speaker, as the ag industry and our Nation’s international development efforts have changed over the past 25 years, the time has come to update this important section to again emphasize the vital role U.S. universities and others can have in our country’s international ag development efforts. With over  800 million people worldwide  still  suffering  from  inadequate  food  supplies and associated malnutrition, this update is needed. ",2000
310,,106,0.426,24,2000-07-24,Mr. GEKAS.," Madam Speaker, H.R. 4700 grants the consent of Congress to the Kansas and Missouri Metropolitan Culture District  to facilitate cultural development  in  the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. The Compact being considered is uniquely designed to encourage cross-state cultural and  intellectual development. Like  the original Kansas-Missouri Metropolitan Culture Compact approved by Congress in 1994, the Compact proposed by H.R. 4700 allows voters from both states to jointly support cultural activities benefiting the bistate region. While nearly identical to the Culture Compact approved by Congress in 1994, the Culture Compact proposed by H.R. 4700 expands the definition of cultural programs  to cover sport activities and facilities. It also changes the composition of the Culture Commission to maintain balanced  representation  from both KAREN MCCARTHY,  states. Finally, like its predecessor, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated  that implementation of the Compact would have no fiscal impact on the U.S. Treasury. Passage of the 1994 Kansas and Missouri Culture Compact has brought  cultural and aesthetic renewal to residents of the Kansas City metropolitan  region while obtaining a broad measure of bipartisanship in the member states and in the Congress. With our help, Kansas and Missouri will continue the cultural invigoration of  the greater Kansas City area and I urge your support of the bill. ",2000
311,,106,-0.513,38,2000-07-24,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Speaker, I am introducing a bill to enable veterans exposed to radiation to be considered for medical assistance without regard to their particular level of exposure. The bill, also, expands the definition of radiation-risk activity to include veterans exposed to residual contamination. The destroyer U.S.S. Brush entered the waters of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, an area contaminated with  radiation from a large number of ships that had served as  targets during  two atmospheric nuclear tests. Crew members of the U.S.S. Brush ate fish and drank water distilled from the bay and crew members made trips to the target vessels to retrieve souvenirs. There was no dosimetry data collected on the U.S.S. Brush or at the Kwajalein Atoll to determine levels of exposure. No safety precautions were taken to prevent exposure and the crew was unaware of the dangers of ionizing radiation. Veterans who served on the U.S.S. Brush now suffer from a number of diseases that can be linked to radiation exposure. However, their disability claims have repeatedly been denied because they were not onsite participants in an atmospheric nuclear test and they were exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. Congress has assisted veterans exposed to radiation  in  the  past.  In  1988 Congress passed the Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act (PL 100–321). This law covered veterans which participated in a radiation risk activity. The law has three definitions of radiation risk activity. They include: onsite participation in a nuclear detonation, occupation of Hiroshima  or Nagasaki,  Japan,  by United States forces during the period beginning on August 6, 1945 and ending on July 1, 1946, and internment as a prisoner of war in Japan during WWII which resulted in the opportunity for exposure to ionizing radiation comparable to that of veterans occupying Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Clearly, this language does not cover those veterans exposed to radiation while in the service of their country. VA claims that lab tests on these veterans show that levels of residual radiation are not sufficient to sustain their claims for disability. However,  these dose  levels were based on lab  tests, not data collected on sight at  the Kwajalein Atoll. This  is  important because Congress has previously concluded that determining the level of exposure, unless collected onsite,  is a  futile exercise. Disability claims must be considered without regard to whether any particular level of radiation was measured for that individual especially when exposure is not denied. Congress must act to ensure that veterans exposed to ionizing radiation either on site or residually be considered for benefits. Without this legislation radiation exposed veterans do NIGHTSIDE CHAT ",2000

314,,106,-0.342,73,2000-07-24,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, it is with great admiration that I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000. A long-standing advocate and leader in the fight for tribal self-determination, Bernie Whitebear was an outstanding role-model for tribal and nontribal people alike. Known for his vision, humor and commitment, he lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone who knew him. Bernie Whitebear was born on September 27, 1937 on the Colville Indian Reservation  in Eastern Washington. Born into a large family, Bernie grew up confronting many of the barriers facing reservation children, including poverty and discrimination. As an adult, he moved to Seattle, attended the University of Washington and worked as an engineer for Boeing. He later joined the Army as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division and served as a Green Beret. During the activism of the late 1960’s, Bernie Whitebear emerged as one of the central tribal leaders in the Pacific Northwest and was a tireless advocate for American Indian recognition and empowerment. We often remember his social action, seen through his leadership in the ‘‘invasion’’ of Fort Lawton in Seattle in 1970. Bernie and others occupied the Fort Lawton property after plans were announced to list the Fort as surplus property for the city to designate as a park. He felt local tribes had a historic right to the land, which could be better used as a central service base for Seattle’s largely unserved urban Indian population. The 3-month occupation, civil arrests and resulting media attention prompted Congress to order the city of Seattle to negotiate a settlement, which included a 99-year lease on a 20-acre parcel for Whitebear’s group. The settlement provided space for construction of  the Daybreak Star Art Center, which currently stands  in Discovery Park. I want to share with the Senate one of my  favorite memories of Bernie Whitebear. Bernie had invited me to attend the Mini-Pow Wow in my state on February 7, 1998. He asked me to stop by  to  talk about  the People’s Lodge, to see the artwork, and to have a quick look at some of the traditional dances. I told Bernie I would stop by, but that I only had a short while because I had a lot of events I needed to attend that day. I remember when I arrived at the University of Washington Bernie welcomed me with his big bright smile and an  outstretched  hand. We watched some of the traditional dances, and then I realized that if I didn’t leave soon I would be late for my next event. It was one of those days when I was trying to meet as many people as possible. Well Bernie didn’t let me just meet the people at the Mini-Pow Wow, he made me stay and understand them. He started by introducing me to everyone in the room. Then Bernie leaned over to me and explained that it was customary for a visiting United States Senator to move to the front of the dancing group. You know, it was one of the many Native American  traditions Bernie  told me about that always sounded a little invented to me. Like another old tradition he told me about: That anytime a U.S. Senator stepped foot in Discovery Park he or she had to pay a visit to the Daybreak Star Center. Well there was Bernie asking me to move to the front, and who could say no to Bernie? He had his arm around me. He was leading me to the front. Everyone was watching, and I went along. The next thing I knew, I was leading about 300 people in a tribal dance. Even though I was not born to be a dancer and I certainly  didn’t know  that  particular dance, Bernie made  it easy. He had such an open,  loving, and  compassionate nature that you just couldn’t help but feel a part of it. As I looked around, people were smiling, and there was a real sense of comradery and respect shared by everyone in the room. About two hours later, as the event was winding down, I said goodbye to Bernie, and I got into my car. As I drove away, I realized what Bernie had really done for me that day. He helped me understand Native American cultures from the inside, not as someone sitting on the sidelines watching, but as someone in the middle of the festivities. I felt the sense of community and respect that Bernie was always so proud of. Anyone can talk about those qualities and traditions, but Bernie let me experience them, and he did it with a big grin on his face. I know I’m better off for that experience. That day shows  just how effective Bernie was at getting us to shed our expectations, to realize what we have in common, and to work together. Throughout his life, Bernie used his own unique style and generous heart to accomplish many things. He founded the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, which provides education and counseling resources for the estimated 25,000 American Indians in the Puget Sound area. Along with the Daybreak Center and the United Indians Foundation, he worked to sensitize Seattle police  to urban  Indian  issues. Recognizing the persistent need for American Indian health services, he also helped create the Seattle Indian Health Board and later served as its first executive director. For his many contributions, Bernie Whitebear was awarded numerous honors.  In  1997, Governor Gary Locke named him a ‘‘Citizen of the Decade.’’ He recently received Seattle’s Distinguished Citizen Medal. In 1998, the University of Washington gave him the Distinguished Alumnus of  the Year Award. Bernie was a remarkable man with spirit and a warmth that touched everyone he encountered. My thoughts and sympathies are with all of Bernie’s family and friends. Bernie Whitebear acted as a beacon for compassion, cultural understanding and tribal sovereignty  in the Puget Sound Region. His legacy is left in all of us who have tremendous respect for the history and cultures of the tribes, a history Bernie would draw us into, by his passion, by his words and by his deeds. I will miss him. f TRIBUTE TO CARDINAL HILL REHABILITATION HOSPITAL ",2000
315,,106,-0.652,6,2000-09-06,Mr. FILNER.," Madam Speaker, I returned home, like all of my colleagues, to my district in August. And what did I find in my hometown of San Diego? In a word, disaster. San Diego is the first area of California to fully deregulate its electrical utility industry. The result is that in just 3 months the double and tripling of electrical rates by the price-gouging electrical generators; seniors on fixed incomes wondering whether to turn up their air conditioning or pay for their medicines; small businesses wondering how long they can hold out; hospitals, libraries, youth centers, schools, the military, all their budgets thrown into turmoil. While the State legislature has just administered a Band-Aid to stop the bleeding, we need stronger and longerlasting action. I am asking the House today to pass legislation to roll back the wholesale rates for electricity in the western region and roll those back retroactively. Those who have gouged our consumers for more than $350 million in the last 3 months should pay the bill for their actions. We need to take this action now. So, my colleagues, welcome back, but look closely at San Diego. We are the poster children for the nation. Many of my colleagues have deregulation bills  in their States and we have deregulation bills on our floor. Deregulation cannot work when the basic commodity is controlled by monopolies. Take heed, Congress. f DEATH TAX OVERRIDE (Mr. BALLENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2000
316,,106,0.464,6,2000-09-06,Mr. BALLENGER.," Madam Speaker, author Pearl S. Buck once wrote, ‘‘Our society must make it right and possible  for old people not to  fear the young or to be deserted by them, for the test of a civilization is the way that it cares for its helpless members.’’ Yet our Nation’s tax policies do desert the elderly. The IRS bureaucrats tax seniors who work, scrimp, and save all their lives to build a business or a family farm. Their property and profits are taxed yearly. They even pay taxes on their employees. And what  is  the  result? Upon the death of the owner, a successful business is hit with a death tax of up to 55 percent of the business’ worth. Most family businesses cannot survive such crippling taxes, and families are forced to sell. The death tax is uncivilized. Let us override the Clinton veto of the death tax. f CONGRESS  SHOULD  LOOK  INTO CHINESE  MONEY  LAUNDERING SCHEME AND ATTORNEY GENERAL’S  REFUSAL  TO  INVESTIGATE (Mr. TRAFICANT  asked  and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2000
317,,106,0.316,6,2000-09-06,Mr. EHLERS.," Madam Speaker, when I was a young lad, I grew up successively  in  two different  farming villages. One had 800 occupants. Another had 200. And I became acquainted with the work of the farmers. They work very, very hard. They struggle to build their  farms. They  reinvest  in  their farms. And when they die, they want to leave it to their children. But unfortunately, because of something called the death tax, established in order to finance World War I, they frequently are not able to leave that farm to their children. The death tax can be as high as 55 or 60 percent. They simply cannot afford to pay the tax in order to keep the farm. They do not have the cash. Their money is tied up in the land. We passed a bill in the House and the Senate to get rid of the death tax. The President vetoed that plan. He and the Democrats in this Chamber argue that this is a tax cut for the rich. They should go talk to some farmers. They will find out they are not rich. Their money is tied up in the land. It is not in their wallets. I urge that we override the President’s veto and make things right for these people. The rich escape the estate tax. They have attorneys who show them all the ways to get rid of it. The farmers cannot afford to hire those attorneys. I urge an override of the veto. INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION (Mr. LAMPSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) ",2000
318,,106,0.414,27,2000-09-06,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, something sad happened back home in Kansas last week. Cancer took the life of one more of our State’s citizens. Our State has many treasures: beautiful sunsets, rolling prairie hills, city factories, waves of wheat, meadowlarks, cottonwood trees, and grazing cattle. But what matters to us Kansans most, what makes our place the State we choose to call home is our people, Kansans. The death of one Kansan takes something away from every Kansan. With the death of Janice Hardenburger, the loss is evident. Janice is the epitome of who we are and what we would like to be, one who knew reality of how things are, yet one who could envision how things ought to be. A  fighter  for  her  beliefs,  strong willed and plain spoken, devoted to her family as a wife and mother and grandmother,  she was generous with her time, a farmer, a rancher, a listener and a doer, a supporter of others and, for the last 8 years, a State senator, a public servant. For more than 25 years, Janice has been my friend. For 4 years she was my colleague in the State senate. Born in the small north central Kansas town of Haddam, Janice had a lifelong love for education and politics. She graduated valedictorian from Haddam Rural High School before attending Kansas State University and graduating with a degree in home economics and education. She married her husband in 1952, and due to his career in the Air Force, she and her  family moved often. During these years, she kept busy as a volunteer and raising two sons, Joseph and Thomas. With Bill’s retirement from the military in 1971, the Hardenburgers moved back home to Kansas. Janice got involved  in her  community,  and  she sought a seat on the Washington County Commission. She recognized the importance of health care in rural communities, and she developed the first rural health initiative project in Kansas. She chaired Ronald Reagan’s campaign for President in our State and served the Reagan administration  in the Department of Health and Human Services regional office in Kansas City. She worked hard every time to see that her fellow Kansan, Bob Dole, would be elected President. In 1992, she decided she could even do more  for others and was elected to State senator for the 21st district. She was reelected  in 1996 and was campaigning for reelection at the time of her death. During her time in the Kansas senate, she worked hard on health care issues and fought for local control. She believed that government should be local and limited. She chaired the elections on  local government committee. Janice was ill during the last session of the legislature. She could not eat, and she had pain. But despite huge impediments, she worked all session long to fashion an ethics law worthy of passage. As State Senator Dave Kerr indicated at her memorial service, that legislation now stands as a lasting tribute to one highly ethical lady who gave her waning strength to bring higher standards of ethics in all elective politics in Kansas. Senator Hardenburger never became silent about things that mattered. For those of us who are privileged to work in public service, where the toll for entry can be excruciatingly high and the price of staying even higher, we do not always expect to find true friendship, true loyalty, and a true devotion for making things better. We had  that  in State Senator  Janice Hardenburger. Our State and its people are better off because of one life, a life that will be greatly missed. I offer my condolences to Janice’s family, but we also praise God for a life well lived and the legacy she leaves behind. f LORI BERENSON TO GET NEW CIVILIAN TRIAL IN PERU ",2000
319,Senate,106,-0.301,97,2000-09-06,Mr. MOYNIHAN.,"  I oppose this  legislation with due  apologies to my friend. And he is my  friend—a man of great wit, of great  stature, a man of natural grace, a student, a scholar, a teacher—PATMOYNIHAN. I apologize to him for having to  vote against this bill, but I shall do it  with gusto.  The framers established the Senate  as a forum for unlimited debate and  unlimited amendment. Or did  they?  They certainly did so with respect to  unlimited amendments. But for several  years, there was the previous question  here  in the Senate by which debate  could be limited. But when Aaron Burr  completed his tenure as Vice President  of the United States and made his farewell address to the Senate, in early  March of 1805, he recommended that  the previous question be dropped from  the rules. It had only been used 10  times in the previous years from the  inception of the Republic. When the  rules were revised in 1806, the previous  question was dropped. It was then that  unlimited  debate  reigned  pure  and  undefiled and unchallenged in the Senate of the United States. So this is a  precious birthright.  By the way, there were no limitations placed upon debate  from that  time—1806 or 1805—until 1917, when the  present  rule XXII—not  exactly  the  present rule; it has been changed some  since then—but a rule providing for the  invoking of cloture was adopted in the  Senate in 1917.  But this group of Members—I do not  know who they are, and I am not sure  that such a group exists, but I will take  rumor for truth at this point because it  very well could occur to some Members  to want a ‘‘clean’’ vote, up or down.  This group of Members, I read, want  a  ‘‘clean’’ vote, up or down, on the  House-passed bill. They, and a number  of House Members, do not want a conference. And they do not want a second  vote in both Houses on a conference report. So  these Senators—well-intentioned, well-meaning—are determined  to defeat every amendment, I hear, to  this bill, regardless of merit. So having  heard it, let me accept it as the truth  and proceed accordingly. I am embarrassed to read that. I hope that it is  not true, that Members of this body  would relinquish a critical Senate prerogative, especially over so important  an issue. Perhaps they would say: Well,  it isn’t exactly relinquishing a prerogative. Other  Senators may  call  up  amendments, but we will vote them  down. They shall not pass.  If it is true, then we are just spinning  our wheels here, are we not, by trying  to fulfill our Constitutional role of regulating foreign commerce? We are just  spinning deep ruts in the Senate floor  by attempting to offer amendments to  improve this bill before we close off our  opportunity to annually review and affect our relationship with China.  I have reviewed the House bill, somewhat cursorily, I admit. It is not that  the House-passed bill is a bad bill. It  contains a number of reporting requirements that attempt to assuage concerns about human rights and  labor  rights in China. But without the goal  of an annual renewal of NTR status behind it, what force does a report have  to affect behavior in China? How can a  report  protect  American  workers  whose jobs are in jeopardy because of  unfair actions  in the trade  field by  China? How can a report protect American missionaries in China or Chinese  citizens who wish to practice their religious beliefs? How does a report turn  back a shipment of missile technology?  How does a report turn back threatening words and actions directed at another nation like Taiwan?  The goal of this administration, and  of the past few administrations—and I  say this most advisedly; I have been in  Congress now 48 years—and every administration since  I came to Washington, Democratic  and Republican,  has been the same way, always singing  the same old tune, and is guided, it  seems to me, by the State Department.  The goal of all of these administrations, including the present one, has  been to, bit by bit, eat away at the constitutional powers of this body to regulate foreign commerce. This is the message behind limiting mechanisms such  as fast track. The argument is that our  trading partners do not  like agreements to be amended so it is take it or  leave it for the Senate. But the Senate  must make judgments based on our national interest.  Trade is a matter of increasing national interest. No one would dream of  making the argument that we cannot  vote  for  reservations or changes  in  arms control treaties because it would  upset our negotiating partner. The Soviets  promptly  renegotiated  the  changes we made with respect to the  INF treaty, a very fundamental change  on the question of the very definition  of the missiles that were the subject of  the treaty. So are we to conclude that  we can amend arms control treaties  but not trade agreements, or even legislation  dealing with  trade  agreements?  Trade has now become a varsity  sport  in America, especially here  in  Washington. It  is very  important to  our well-being, important to millions  of workers, important to the quality of  our  environment,  important  to  the  world’s environment. It is important to  large industrial and service sectors, a  matter of  such  importance  that we  should at least pay careful attention to  our constitutional responsibilities. The  final product will be more in the national interest and Senators will have  done their duty to their constituents  and to our Nation, as it was envisioned  by our Founding Fathers, if we debate  this matter at length and if we offer  amendments,  debate  them  in  good  faith, and have votes up or down on  them and let the chips fall where they  may.

321,Senate,106,-0.308,139,2000-09-06,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce a package of legislation (S. 3005 and S. Res. 348) that addresses the increased amount of smuggled and mis-labeled ginseng entering  this country.  This  legislation provides  for  some  common sense reforms that would require  country-of-origin  labeling  for  ginseng  products,  and  express  the  Sense  of  the Senate  that  customs  should put a stop to the flow of smuggled ginseng into the United States.  My legislation will push for stricter enforcement of ginseng importation and  allow consumers the information they  need to determine the origin of the ginseng they buy.  SMUGGLING-LABELINGPROBLEM  Mr. President, Chinese and Native  American cultures have used ginseng  for thousands of years for herbal and  medicinal purposes.  In America, ginseng is experiencing a  newfound popularity, and I am proud  to say that my home state of Wisconsin  is playing a central  role  in  ginseng’s resurgence.  Wisconsin produces 97 percent of the  ginseng grown in the United States,  and 85 percent of the country’s ginseng  is grown in Marathon County.  The ginseng industry is an economic  boon to Marathon County, as well as an  example of the high quality for which  Wisconsin’s  agriculture  industry  is  known.  Wisconsin ginseng commands a premium price in world markets because  it is considered to be of the highest  quality and because it has a lower pesticide and chemical content.  With a huge market for this high-  quality ginseng overseas, and growing  popularity for the ancient root here at  home, Wisconsin’s  ginseng  industry  should have a prosperous future ahead.  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious  problem—smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is considered  so superior to ginseng grown abroad  that smugglers will go to great lengths  to label ginseng grown in Canada or  Asia as ‘‘Wisconsin-grown.’’  Here’s how the switch takes place:  Smugglers  take Asian or Canadian-  grown ginseng and ship it to plants in  China, allegedly to have the ginseng  sorted into various grades.  While the sorting process is itself a  legitimate part of distributing ginseng,  smugglers often use  it as a ruse to  switch Wisconsin  ginseng with  the  Asian or Canadian ginseng considered  inferior by consumers.  The smugglers know that while Chinese-grown ginseng has a retail value  of about $5–$6 per pound, while Wisconsin-grown  ginseng  is  valued  at  roughly $16–$20 per pound.  To make matters even tougher for  Wisconsin’s ginseng farmers, there is  no accurate way of testing ginseng to  determine where it was grown, other  than testing  for pesticides that are  legal  in Canada and China but are  banned in the United States.  And  in some cases, smugglers can  even  find ways around the pesticide  tests.  A  recent  ConsumerLab.com  study confirmed that much of the ginseng sold in the U.S. contained harmful  chemicals and metals, such as lead and  arsenic.  And that’s because the majority of  Ginseng  sold  in  the U.S. originates  from countries with  lower pesticide  standards,  so  it’s vitally  important  that consumers know which ginseng is  really grown in Wisconsin  CONSUMER/PRODUCERIMPACT  For the sake of ginseng farmers and  consumers, the U.S. Senate must crack  down on smuggled and mislabeled ginseng.  Without  adequate  labeling,  consumers have no way of knowing the  most basic information about the ginseng  they  purchase—where  it was  grown, what quality or grade it is, or  whether  it  contains  dangerous  pesticides.  The country of origin labeling is a  simple but effective way to enable consumers to make an informed decision.  And putting the U.S. Senate on record  in support of cracking down on ginseng  smuggling is an important first step  toward putting an end to the illegal  ginseng trade.  The lax enforcement of smuggled ginseng also puts our producers on an unfair playing field. The mixing of superior Wisconsin ginseng with lower quality foreign ginseng root penalizes the  grower and eliminates the incentive to  provide the consumer with a superior  product.  Mr. President, we must give ginseng  growers the support they deserve by  implementing country-of-origin labeling  that  lets  consumers make  in  formed choices about the ginseng that  they consume.  We must ensure when ginseng consumers  reach  for a quality ginseng  product—such as Wisconsin grown ginseng—that they are getting the real  thing, not a cheap imitation.  By Mr. ASHCROFT:  S. 3006.

322,,106,-0.404,174,2000-09-06,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in tribute to St.  Andrew’s  African Methodist  Episcopal Church of Sacramento. On October 1, 2000, St. Andrew’s will be celebrating its 150th anniversary. It is the oldest church of its kind on the Pacific Coast. As the Congregation members gather to celebrate, I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in saluting this monumental achievement. St. Andrew’s was  founded  in 1850,  three months before California was admitted as the 31st state to the Union. It is the first African Methodist Episcopal Church and the first African-American  religious  congregation  established on  the Pacific Coast of  the United States. In  the beginning, a small group of worshipers gathered in Sacramento at the home of Daniel Blue. Under the leadership of Barney Fletcher, this group would form the church that would later be known as St. Andrew’s A.M.E. Church.  In  the  fall of 1850, Reverend  Isaac Owen, pastor of the Seventh Street Methodist Episcopal Church, participated  in  the  formal organizing of the church. The  first  trustees, James R. Brown, John Barton, George Fletcher, John L. Wilson, and Chesterfield Jackson purchased part of the lot in the square between G and H Streets. At this site,  the  first church was erected and named the Methodist Church of Colored People of Sacramento. In 1851, the members of the church petitioned the Indiana Conference for admission  to  the African Methodist Episcopal Church and officially became the Bethel African Methodist Church. Later  in  the 19th century, the church acquired its current name, St.  Andrew’s  African Methodist  Episcopal Church. St. Andrew’s has been a pioneer in organizing an educational and religious haven for people of color. In 1854, the first A.M.E. Sunday School  in  the  far west was organized. This also became the site of the first public school organized for children of African, Asian, and Native American descent.  In 1855,  the church was the site of the first statewide convention of  the colored citizens of California. This was the first organized political activity by people of African descent in California aimed at securing citizenship rights. During the following years of westward expansion in the United States, St. Andrew’s became a pivotal point in the far west for African Methodism, and it hosted numerous political, secular, educational, and cultural activities for African Americans. The church helped to develop educated and trained leaders of the African American community, even before the end of slavery. Today, St. Andrew’s continues to shine as a pillar for the community. In 1995, the church was  recognized as a California Registered Landmark for being the oldest African-American Church on  the Pacific Coast. For 150 years,  the church has admirably served  the ethnically diverse Sacramento community. Mr. Speaker, as the exceptional people of St.  Andrew’s  African Methodist  Episcopal Church gather to celebrate their 150th anniversary, I am honored to pay tribute to one of Sacramento’s most  outstanding  institutions. Throughout their proud history, the people of St. Andrew’s have maintained an impressive tradition of service  to  the African-American community and other minority communities in greater Sacramento. I ask all my colleagues to join with me in wishing the people of St. Andrew’s continued success in all their future endeavors.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 345, which addresses the need to create a cataloged list of the thousands of public war memorials in the United States. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is the product of over a decadelong effort by Vietnam War veteran Brian Rooney and the nonprofit organization he founded, Remembering Veterans Who Earned Their Stripes, otherwise known as RVETS based in North Ridge, California. Mr. Rooney believed that war memorials preserve the memories of our veteran’s  sacrifices and  serve as a  reminder of America’s history. He discovered that today there is no detailed index or record of the thousands of public memorials dedicated to America’s involvement in military conflicts, more importantly, dedicated to those who gave their lives for freedom. Mr. Rooney investigated conditions for years. He found that these memorials suffer from neglect, disrepair and have been relocated or stored in facilities where they are not accessible to the public. Currently, the Federal Government monitors only those memorials that are federally funded. We have relied on the hard work of individuals like Mr. Rooney who have conducted this arduous task. H. Con. Res. 345 urges the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service,  to collect and maintain information on public memorials  commemorating military  conflicts of the United States. It urges a coordinated effort between the Federal Government and other entities  like RVETS  in collecting and maintaining  this  information which would then be made available to the public. RVETS already has cataloged over 7,000 monuments. They already have done most of the work needed to establish the database. H. Con. Res. 345 is a bipartisan effort to honor our veterans. I want to thank Brian Rooney  for his dedication not just to the country as a Vietnam war veteran, but  for  the decade he has spent conducting this search so that veterans could be honored. I understand, Mr. Speaker, that this morning there has been some partisan bickering going on with  respect  to some of these resolutions, but I would just urge all of my colleagues to put that aside today so that we can appropriately  honor  veterans who  have served our country and who have given their life and service for our country, and vote to support this bipartisan resolution.

H.R.  2883 would  restore fairness to our immigration law by removing the burdensome requirement that U.S. citizen parents apply for naturalization  for  their  foreign-born adopted children. What our current immigration policy says to parents is that adopted foreignborn children are not equal to their biological siblings and are not worthy of automatic U.S. citizenship. Requiring foreign-born adopted children to apply for naturalization is insulting and it’s wrong. with the passage of H.R. 2883, we are  sending a clear message  to American parents  that,  should  they choose to adopt a child from another country, U.S. citizenship will be awaiting that child once he or she sets foot on U.S. soil. As the aunt of Koreanborn Jamie and Natalie,  I  strongly identify with this issue. The birthright of all children of U.S. citizen parents, whether they are biological or adopted should be automatic U.S. citizenship. This bill will simplify the already complicated and complex process parents undertake when they embark on an international adoption and I applaud its passage. ",2000

329,,106,0.596,82,2000-09-19,Mr. CANNON.," Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would  like to thank the subcommittee chairman,  the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BACHUS), for his efforts to bring this bill to the floor, and also my  colleague  from Utah  (Mr. COOK), for his hard work in moving this issue forward. As many of the Members know, it takes 290 cosponsors on a bill to move a commemorative coin bill forward, and that takes a lot of effort. So I would also like to thank all of my colleagues who have worked with us to cosponsor this bill and bring it to this stage. We are going to have the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in February of 2002, and while in Utah we like to think of these as our Olympics. In fact they are America’s Olympics, and it has been wonderful to work with our colleagues to help support that  idea that this is the American Olympics. I am personally proud of the Olympics because about 80 percent of the venues are going to be in my district, and frankly I know there are a lot of Congressmen who believe  they have beautiful districts, but none are nearly so beautiful as mine. And so we invite everyone to come to the Olympics and to see another one of these areas in my district like Moab, where we have the Great Red Rock country where people go down and bike. This commemorative coin is really about athletes; and now that we have the Summer Olympics going on in Sydney, it is good to consider just for a moment the benefits that they will get. We expect that this commemorative coin will raise about $6 million, which will be split evenly between the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, and the proceeds of that money will all go to training athletes. So this is a great way to perpetuate the American tradition of winning the Olympics, as we are currently doing. ",2000

332,,106,0.43,103,2000-09-19,Mr. BLUNT.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and the life of Reverend William F. Askew, a man whose life touched so many in southwest Missouri and around the world because of his dedication to serving others. In World War II, the Marine Corps taught him that duty, honor, country was more than a motto. It was a commitment to the ideas that he instilled in others as a drill sergeant and a commitment  that  followed him all his days. Coming back from the war and beginning a career in civilian commercial radio, he accepted Christ; and his faith became the driving center of his life. Service to others was natural for Bill Askew. He was a founding pastor of the Arlington Heights Baptist Church  in Jacksonville,  Florida;  but  he  also found time to serve as the chaplain of the Duval County Fire Department. He sought opportunities to serve the spiritual and emotional needs of firemen from around Florida and the victims of the fires they fought. Service to others was his focus when he moved his wife, Doris, and seven of their nine children to Springfield, Missouri, in 1968, to help found the area’s first Christian radio station. He served as general manager of KWFC serving portions of four States until his death last week. Despite the responsibilities he faced in running a radio station, he also committed to serving residents of northern Greene County as the pastor of the Noble Hill Baptist Church, often traveling back roads to meet the needs of a large rural area as well as those of the surrounding communities. Service was the keynote of his life, whether he was helping form the North Springfield Betterment Association or teaching classes at Baptist Bible College. Bill, or ‘‘Mr. A’’ as many of his friends called him, was dedicated to making a difference  in the  lives of those he served. Some of those now serve as missionaries, as business leaders, government officials; and they reflect his inspiration for their lives. He was a confidant, a mentor, an advisor, a friend to so many; and he often did it with so little fanfare. Bill Askew was a family man. Even though he gave much to others, he was happiest when surrounded by his children, his grandchildren and his great grandchildren. He shared their joys and comforted their pain. Madam Speaker, with his passing, southwest Missouri has  lost a great spiritual and civic leader, a friend and a guiding force for many in our community. I ask that God bless him and his family as we share in their loss. f THE VETERANS ORAL HISTORY PROJECT ",2000
333,Senate,106,0.572,166,2000-09-19,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I sat  here and listened to my good friend  from West Virginia on trade. I believe  I should speak from a position of representing a State that has benefited  immensely from the trade agreements  that we  have  passed  recently—the  North American Free Trade Agreement  and the General Agreement on Trade  and Tariffs.  Exports from the State of Colorado,  which I represent, have increased dramatically. In fact, we have experienced  the greatest growth in exports of any  State in the Nation on a percentage  basis. The economy of the State of Colorado is based greatly on agriculture.  My friend from West Virginia talked  about agriculture to a certain degree.  We grow a lot of wheat. We raise a lot  of livestock, and we do make an attempt to expand our markets to the  Pacific rim countries, which includes  China.  We have a very modern economic  base in the State. We work a lot on exporting  high  tech. Many  high-tech  companies do business in the State of  Colorado. On a concentration basis, we  have the highest concentration of high-  tech employees of any State  in the  country. So we benefit from exporting  goods, and the North American Free  Trade Agreement has helped the State  of Colorado, and GATT has also.  I happen to think that an agreement  with China for normal trade relations  will help agriculture, and it will help  States such as Colorado because these  are markets where we can compete and  have been competing.  My  colleague  from West Virginia  talked a considerable amount about  the trade deficits we are experiencing  in this country. I come at the trade  deficit issue from a different perspective than my colleague from West Virginia. I have looked at what happened  historically with trade deficits. If we  look at the time of the Great Depression in this country, the trade deficits  were low. If we look at the time when  we were suffering, when we had the  misery index—and this is at the latter  part of the 1970s, during the Carter administration—the  trade  deficit was  low. We had high double-digit unemployment. We had high double-digit inflation, and we had high double-digit  unemployment. But our trade deficit  was low. I happen to believe when we  look at the trade deficit, it is more of  a reflection of what is happening economically in this country. Our country  has  experienced high  trade  deficits  when our economy has been doing well,  just like during the period of time we  are in today.  So the figures he presents to you on  trade deficits, in reality, they do happen. What is the significance to the  economy? I happen to believe it has the  opposite  impact. Many  times, when  people are evaluating the impact of the  trade deficit, they look at it only from  the perspective of one industry. If you  look at the total economy, the total  growth of jobs within this country, we  benefit, in many cases, by importing  products.  How does that work? Let’s take an  automobile, for example. Some State  may have a company—maybe in Michigan,  for example—that could be  impacted by trade policies. But does that  have a net impact on jobs in the United  States? Many times, when you take it  into total consideration, there is a net  gain  because  there  are  jobs—union  jobs—created when you have to unload  those cars at our ports. There are jobs  created when you have to clean up the  cars when they come into the country.  There are jobs created when you have  to  transport  those  cars  across  the  country to get them to a point of sale.  Somebody has to sell the cars. Jobs are  created there. Somebody has to buy  the cars. There is insurance sold in relation to the purchase of the car. Goods  and services relating to that go into  the marketplace. Those cars have to be  maintained and operated and  fixed.  Many times, they go into a resale market at some point in their lifetime.  These are all jobs that are created as  a result of having imported that product. So I am convinced that our best  policy is to work in a free market environment, and  the problem we have  right now is not that we don’t place a  lot of the tariffs and restrictions on  Chinese goods coming into this country, but China is the one that is placing restrictions on our goods going into  their  country—particularly  agricultural products and goods related to the  high-tech industry. That is why I think  this particular effort to create normal  trade  relations  is  beneficial.  Isolationism doesn’t work. Isolating a country and saying that is going to help  human  rights—I  don’t  think  that  works. That is one reason why Taiwan,  for example, supports our efforts to try  to establish permanent normal trade  relations with China.  So I think that in order to prevent  human abuse, to protect human rights,  we need to open up China. When our  business people go into China, they expect a  certain  standard. They  just  won’t do business with Chinese companies without those standards. They will  have to abide by their contracts. If  somebody doesn’t honor the contract,  there has to be a court system of some  type that will help enforce those contracts. And these all carry with them  democratic principles.  When Chinese businessmen interact  with American businessmen, they will  understand how the free enterprise system works, how democracy works. I  think we export democracy when we  enter  into a  free market agreement  where we take down trade barriers and  increase the interaction between countries—particularly when we are talking  about a democratic county as opposed  to a Communist one. They see there is  a different way of doing things and  prospering that yields benefits far and  above what they have been told in a  country where the leaders restrict information and restrict freedoms.  I think it is important we pass this  piece of legislation that says we will  have permanent normal trade relations  with China.  I see my colleague from North Carolina.  ",2000
334,Senate,106,0.536,187,2000-09-19,Mr. ASHCROFT.," Mr. President, I rise  today to talk about a significant vote I  will cast—a vote in favor of permanent  normal trade relations for China. It is  significant, but difficult. Difficult because the Chinese have shown—in everything  from predatory trade practices, to threatening our national security, to total disregard  for religious  freedom  and  human  rights—a  disturbing lack of trustworthiness. And  furthermore, the current administration seems trapped in a cycle of failed  policy. I deeply regret that our President, on behalf of the United States,  has squandered multiple opportunities  to protect U.S. interests and to promote American values in trade matters.  The vote is significant because about  one-fourth of the people in the world  live in China. When we talk of China,  we need to remember that we are talking about people, many of whom seek  to embrace the same values that made  America great, such as religious freedom, freedom of expression, and capitalism. They want to live free, while  many of their  leaders want only to  amass power and rule with a heavy  hand.  I do not argue, as some do, that dropping the annual review of China’s trading status will usher in all of these  freedoms. Nor will it further protect  U.S. security interests. That argument  is tenuous, at best.  The only thing that will usher in the  freedom to express religious or political beliefs, to organize, to obtain a fair  trial, and to be free from governmental  intrusion, will  be  a  transformation  among China’s highest government officials. This will not happen in the absence  of  a  well-formulated  policy  underpinned by moral  leadership on  the part of the U.S. Presidency. The  leader of the free world must lead the  world toward freedom. For the sake of  the Chinese people, it is my hope that  the next President of the United States  will take the initiative in a calculated  and consistent manner to be a leader in  this area, without the need to be prodded by Congress at every turn.  Furthermore, the key to U.S. security interests lies in the hands of the  Commander in Chief. If China joins the  World Trade Organization, the United  States does not alter its ability, or its  responsibility, to protect our interests  at  home  and  to  promote  security  abroad. While the WTO agreement has  an explicit exception that states that  WTO  trade  obligations  do  not  supercede national security decisions,  the fact is that the United States does  not need the exception. The most fundamental role of the U.S. government  is to protect the security interests of  its people, period. We can count on  other countries to attempt to steal our  national secrets and to violate our security interests. It is the way of history, the conflict of powers. The breakdown in U.S. security with the Chinese  has occurred because this Administration has not been vigilant to protect  our interests. It did not and does not  have to be that way in the future.  Granting permanent normal trade relations to China does not alter the  President’s responsibility to promote  American values or to protect U.S. security  interests. However,  granting  PNTR to China does have a substantial  impact on our ability to enforce our  trade agreements. I would like to discuss this issue fully today because I believe  it  is central to the ability of  American  farmers and companies to  crack open  the Chinese market—on  which Chinese officials, at times, appear to have a death grip.  As we all know, China has been trying to accede to the WTO for over a  decade. In order for this process to be  complete, China has to negotiate the  terms of the trade agreement that are  satisfactory to the United States and  other WTO members and must receive  a favorable vote from the WTO members. Also,  for the United States to  benefit from those new terms, Congress  has to grant to China what is known as  ‘‘permanent normal  trade  relations’’  status. The Administration has concluded a trade agreement with China,  and the President, Vice President, and  entire Administration are now asking  Congress to support PNTR.  A fair trade relationship with China  has  the  potential  to  give Missouri  workers and farmers the ability to sell  goods in a new market of more than  one billion people. However, a relationship  is not  built  on  commitments  alone. It must include accountability.  In China’s case, we have a new and improved trade agreement, but we must  also be able to enforce those commitments.  On  the  first  issue—a  solid agreement—there  has  been  substantial  progress made. China should open its  market on equal terms to the United  States. The U.S. market has been fully  open to China for years. Although I  would like to see complete reciprocity,  I have reviewed the proposed agreement for China’s WTO accession, and I  believe  it  is a  forward step toward  opening China’s market for U.S. products and services. This is a good deal  for American jobs and Missouri’s long-  term economic growth.  On everything from automobiles to  agriculture, Missourians are prepared  to  embrace  the  opportunities  the  agreement could provide: overall average tariffs will go from 24 percent to 9  percent by 2005; agricultural tariffs will  be cut nearly in half (31 percent to 17  percent); businesses will be able to bypass state-trading  ‘‘middle-men’’; import standards for U.S. food goods will  be based on sound science; competition  will increase in all of the service sectors, like telecom, insurance, banking;  the Internet will be open to U.S. investment; and the list goes on.  The Missouri economy at  large  is  poised  to benefit  substantially  from  further opening of the Chinese market.  From the early to late 1990s, Missouri’s  exports increased by about 120 percent,  going from about $65 million in 1993, to  about $145 million  in 1998. Most recently, China  ranked  in  the  top  10  countries for Missouri exports, up from  the 16th position in 1993.  Agriculture is the largest employer  in my home state, and in fact, Missouri  ranks 2nd in the nation in its number  of farms. As I’ve traveled around the  state, stopping in every county over  the last few months, Missouri farmers  and ranchers have expressed to me the  importance of approving the agreement  that has been reached on agriculture.

336,Senate,106,0.014,243,2000-09-19,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be able to introduce today,  along with Senators ENZI, KENNEDY,  and REID, the Needlestick Safety and  Prevention Act. This legislation will  ensure that our nation’s health care  workers, who tend to our citizens when  care is urgently needed, will no longer  be risking their own health, and, perhaps, their own lives, when providing  this life giving work.  Statistics paint a stark picture of the  risks from accidental sharps injuries  that health care workers face daily on  the job, injuries that can be prevented,  and, when Congress passes this legislation, will be prevented. The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that as many as 800,000 injuries from contaminated sharps occur  annually among health care workers.  Due to these injuries, numerous health  care workers have contracted fatal or  other serious viruses and diseases, including the human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis  C.  ‘‘Needlesticks’’  refer  to  the broad  category of injuries suffered by workers in health care settings who are exposed to sharps, including items such  as disposable syringes with needles, IV  catheters, lancets, and glass capillary  tubes/pipettes. The true shame in these  alarming statistics is that accidental  needlestick injuries can be prevented.  Technological advancements have led  to the development of safer medical devices,  such as  syringes with needle  guards or sheaths.  The heart of the ‘‘Needlestick Safety  and Prevention Act’’ is its requirement  that employers identify, evaluate, and  make use of effective safer medical devices. And the legislation emphasizes  training, education, and the participation of those workers exposed to sharps  injuries in the evaluation and selection  of safer devices. The Act also creates  new  record keeping  requirements, a  ‘‘sharps injury log,’’ to aid employers  in identifying high risk areas, and in  determining the types of engineering  controls and devices most effective in  reducing or eliminating the risk of exposure. Importantly, the legislation we  introduce today will not impede, but  will encourage technological development, as it does not favor the use of a  specific device, but requires an employer to evaluate the effectiveness of  available devices.  I urge all my colleagues to join us in  supporting the ‘‘Needlestick Safety and  Prevention Act.’’  I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of this bill be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 3067  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Needlestick  Safety and Prevention Act’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) Numerous workers who are occupationally exposed to bloodborne pathogens have  contracted fatal and other serious viruses  and diseases, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C from exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials in their workplace.  (2) In 1991 the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration issued a standard regulating occupational exposure to bloodborne  pathogens,  including the human  immunodeficiency virus, (HIV), the hepatitis B virus  (HBV), and the hepatitis C virus (HCV).  (3) Compliance with the bloodborne pathogens standard has significantly reduced the  risk that workers will contract a bloodborne  disease in the course of their work.  (4) Nevertheless, occupational exposure to  bloodborne pathogens from accidental sharps  injuries in health care settings continues to  be a serious problem. In March 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that more than 380,000 percutaneous  injuries from contaminated sharps occur annually among health care workers in United  States hospital settings. Estimates for all  health care settings are that 600,000 to 800,000  needlestick and other percutaneous injuries  occur among health care workers annually.  Such injuries can involve needles or other  sharps contaminated with bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV, HBV, or HCV.  (5) Since publication of  the bloodborne  pathogens standard in 1991 there has been a  substantial increase in the number and assortment of effective engineering controls  available to employers. There is now a large  body of research and data concerning the effectiveness of newer engineering controls, including safer medical devices.  (6) 396 interested parties responded to a Request  for Information  (in this section referred to as the ‘‘RFI’’) conducted by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration in 1998 on engineering and work practice  controls used to eliminate or minimize the  risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne  pathogens due to percutaneous injuries from  contaminated sharps. Comments were provided by health care facilities, groups representing health care workers, researchers,  educational institutions, professional and industry associations, and manufacturers of  medical devices.  (7) Numerous studies have demonstrated  that the use of safer medical devices, such as  needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections, when they  are part of an overall bloodborne pathogens  risk-reduction program, can be extremely effective in reducing accidental sharps injuries.  (8) In March 2000, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention estimated that, depending on the type of device used and the  procedure involved, 62 to 88 percent of sharps  injuries can potentially be prevented by the  use of safer medical devices.  (9) The OSHA 200 Log, as it is currently  maintained, does not sufficiently reflect injuries  that  may  involve  exposure  to  bloodborne pathogens in health care facilities. More than 98 percent of health care facilities responding to the RFI have adopted  surveillance  systems  in  addition  to  the  OSHA 200 Log. Information gathered through  these surveillance systems is commonly used  for hazard identification and evaluation of  program and device effectiveness.  (10) Training and education in the use of  safer medical devices and safer work practices are significant elements in the prevention  of  percutaneous  exposure  incidents.  Staff involvement in the device selection and  evaluation process is also an important element to achieving a reduction in sharps injuries, particularly as new safer devices are introduced into the work setting.  (11) Modification of the bloodborne pathogens standard is appropriate to set forth in  greater detail its requirement that employers identify, evaluate, and make use of effective safer medical devices.  SEC. 3. BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS STANDARD.  The bloodborne pathogens standard published at 29 C.F.R. 1910.1030 shall be revised  as follows:  (1) The definition of  ‘‘Engineering Controls’’ (at 29 C.F.R. 1930.1030(b)) shall include  as additional examples of controls the following:  ‘‘safer medical  devices,  such  as  sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems’’.  (2) The  term  ‘‘Sharps with Engineered  Sharps Injury Protections’’ shall be added to  the definitions (at 29 C.F.R. 1910.1030(b)) and  defined as ‘‘a nonneedle sharp or a needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or administering  medications or other fluids, with a built-in  safety feature or mechanism that effectively  reduces the risk of an exposure incident’’.  (3) The term ‘‘Needleless Systems’’ shall be  added  to  the  definitions  (at  29  C.F.R.  1910.1030(b)) and defined as  ‘‘a device that  does not use needles for (A) the collection of  bodily fluids or withdrawal of body fluids  after initial venous or arterial access is established, (B) the administration of medication or fluids, or (C) any other procedure involving the potential for occupational exposure  to  bloodborne  pathogens  due  to  percutaneous  injuries  from  contaminated  sharps’’.  (4) In addition to the existing requirements  concerning exposure control plans (29 C.F.R.  1910.1030(c)(1)(iv)), the review and update of  such plans shall be required to also—  (A)  ‘‘reflect changes  in technology that  eliminate or reduce exposure to bloodborne  pathogens’’; and  (B)  ‘‘document consideration and  implementation  of  appropriate  commercially  available and effective safer medical devices  designed to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure’’.  (5) The following additional recordkeeping  requirement shall be added to the bloodborne  pathogens standard at 29 C.F.R. 1910.1030(h):  ‘‘The employer shall establish and maintain  a sharps  injury  log  for the recording of  percutaneous  injuries  from  contaminated  sharps.

337,,106,0.339,257,2000-09-19,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my most profound opposition  to H.R. 4892, the so-called Scouting for All Act, which would repeal the federal charter of the Boy Scouts of America. As an Eagle Scout, a member of the Scout Council, and a lifelong advocate of Scouting,  I am both saddened and dismayed by  this misguided attempt  to bully one of the finest youth organizations in America. Since its inception in 1910, the Boy Scouts have  instilled  in  tens of millions of young men the ideals of good citizenship, patriotism, and service to others. Perhaps no organization  in our nation’s history has done more to prepare America’s youth for the challenges and responsibilities  they will  face as adults. I hope the irony of this legislation is not lost on my colleagues. In the name of tolerance, the author of this bill is attempting to harness the  power  of  the  federal  government  to change an organization  simply because  it does not share her views. This bill represents an incredibly arrogant attempt to impose the beliefs of a small minority on a private institution. And it seeks to demonize one of the most fundamentally decent groups in America. Mr. Speaker,  the Scout Oath  includes  the pledge that a Scout will keep himself ‘‘morally straight.’’ Whether one believes homosexuality is inconsistent with that oath or not, the Boy Scouts of America are entitled to interpret their oath, as well as set their own criteria for membership, as they see fit. I would submit to my colleagues that denying them that right would demonstrate a  supreme disrespect  for  the right of people to associate freely, which the Constitution guarantees. The problem with this legislation should be obvious to anyone who respects the right of Americans  to organize  themselves as  they choose. The legislative power of this Congress should not be used as a tool to shape the policies of private organizations in ways that are pleasing to the political class. In an age when America’s young people are fed a steady diet of violence and obscenity, it is absurd that Congress is targeting an institution as wholesome as the Boy Scouts. In an age when school shootings capture headlines and we busy ourselves combating teen drug use, it is shameful that some of my colleagues would assail an organization dedicated to such principled goals as the Boy Scouts. I urge my colleagues  to reject  this offensive  legislation and send a clear message  to  the nation’s Scouts that they have both the support and admiration of the United States Congress.

These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns. I submit these statements in the CONGRESSIONALRECORD, as I believe that the views of these  young persons will benefit my  colleagues. HON. BERNARDSANDERSINTHEHOUSEOF REPRESENTATIVES ONBEHALFOFHEATHERMOYLAN, GEORGE (BUD) VANA, IVANDMATTHEWJENNESS REGARDINGGENDERREQUIREMENTIN AFFIRMATIVEACTION—MAY26, 2000 HEATHER MOYLAN: Today we would like to propose that new legislation be introduced regarding gender  equity,  legislation  that would repeal any sections of affirmative action that make reference to gender in the workplace. Affirmative action is defined as actions taken to provide equal opportunities as an admission for employment for minority groups or women. Traditionally society has dominated by the male gender. Today, however, advancements have been made for women in regards to jobs, sports and education. Affirmative action legislation and its close cousin, Title 9 have had a lot of important and beneficial progress for women in all of their endeavors. In most cases quality is already a reality. Statistics show in some cases there is a female advantage and of course there is still progress to be made. The legislation and enforcement by the government, once crucial, has run  its course. The American people have become accustomed to gender equality. States have created their own legislation. Institutions and public and private sectors have their own regulations, and in summary the law has done all that it can do. The danger now exists that the law may be abused with so-called reverse discrimination suits. MATTHEW JENNESS: Last night I went out and I found information to back this up; with looking at the job rate between male and female and I found that the participation rate percentage was in 1948, 32 percent female and 86.9 percent male. In 1979, 50 percent female and 78 percent male, and in this year, 2000, 75 percent male and 60 percent female. So from that I figure that a 60 percent—there is a pretty good margin there, it is close, and the ten percent may be people who chose to be—females choosing to take traditional roles in the family. GEORGE VANA, IV: I get to show you some stuff, I guess. Now this is a graph of high school attendance percentage. These are 14- and 15-year-olds. This right here is the male bar and that represents 80.2 percent attendance and this represents  female attendance which is 85.6 percent, and this is I guess preliminary to what we are getting to here. CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: So that chart shows there are more girls in high school than boys. GEORGE VANA, IV: This is college enrollment and it is the same trend basically. 41.7 percent of 18- and 19-year-old males attend college, and I guess it is 51.3 percent of females, age 18 to 19 years old attend college. These are based on the United States Census Bureau. And then we are also going to look at male versus female education accomplishments, and you can see here that education attainment which basically signifies some degree of some sort is much, much higher nowadays within females. These are numbers in the thousands, 46,888,000 females now attain higher educational status compared to 29,343,000 males. And current college enrollment, also in the millions, is we have about 6,905,000 males in college right now as opposed to 8,641,000 females, so a gap exists now I guess and that would almost be in favor of females where affirmative action legislation many years ago served to  increase these numbers.

The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 2572 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Apollo Exploration Award Act of 1999’’. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) On July 20, 1969, Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. ‘‘Buzz’’ Aldrin Jr., became the first humans to set foot on another celestial body, during the Apollo 11 mission, accompanied in lunar orbit by Michael Collins. (2) Between 1969 and 1972, ten other Americans  courageously  completed  the  first human exploration of the lunar surface, accompanied by five command module pilots: (A) Apollo 12—Charles J.  ‘‘Pete’’ Conrad Jr., Alan L. Bean, and Richard F. Gordon Jr. (B) Apollo 14—Alan B. Shepard Jr., Edgar D. Mitchell, and Stuart A. Roosa. (C) Apollo 15—David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M. Worden. (D) Apollo 16—John W.

Swigert Jr., and Fred W. Haise Jr., valiantly made a safe return from the Moon on the Apollo 13 mission, after their command module was disabled by an explosion. (4) The enormous successes of the Apollo lunar landing missions were only possible due to the pioneering work of the previous Apollo missions, which performed critical testing of the spacecraft and methods, and conducted the  first human travel to the Moon: (A) Apollo 7—Walter M. Schirra Jr., Donn F. Eisele, and R. Walter Cunningham. (B) Apollo 8—Frank Borman, James A. Lovell Jr., and William A. Anders. (C) Apollo 9—James A. McDivitt, David R. Scott, and Russell L.

342,,106,-0.292,41,2000-09-26,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1248 which would reauthorize the Violence Against Womens Act  (VAWA), landmark  legislation  that has made a difference  in  the  lives of children, women and families. As an early cosponsor of H.R. 1248, I am  relieved  that  this measure has been brought to the floor before its authorization expires in five short days. Enacted  in 1994, as part of  the Omnibus Crime Bill, VAWA provided  for new  federal criminal provisions and grant programs to improve the criminal justice system’s response to domestic  violence and  sexual assault and stalking, and to provide critical services to victims. Since passage, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services have awarded over $1.6 billion in VAWA grants nationwide. VAWA grants provide critical support for the work of prosecutors, law enforcement officials, the courts, victims’ advocates, health care and social service professionals, and intervention and prevention programs. The domestic  violence  hotline  established  under VAWA has logged over half a million calls. Despite the advances we have made under VAWA, domestic violence still devastates the lives of many women and children with nearly 900,000 women experiencing violence at the hands of  their partners every  year. Even today, with the heightened attention domestic violence receives, nearly one-third of women murdered each year die at the hands of their partners. In addition  to reauthorizing VAWA  for  five years, H.R. 1248, as approved, expands numerous programs, such as a domestic violence hotline, law enforcement grants for victims’ services, prosecution of perpetrators of violence, battered women’s shelters and services, counselors,  rape prevention education, programs against stalkers, and other related services. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1248, legislation to reauthorize VAWA, a vital part of the campaign against violence and crime. Moreover, Mr. Speaker,  I would also urge  the Republican leadership  to build on H.R. 1248 and make the Violence Against Women Office at  the U.S. Department of Justice permanent, by statute, as provided for under H.R. 4848.

The Justice Department’s states nearly 25 percent of surveyed women and about 7 percent of surveyed men say  they have been raped and or physically assaulted by a current or former spouse or partner at some time in their lives. This figure, however, is a conservative one that substantially understates the actual number of families affected by domestic ",2000
344,,106,0.435,83,2000-09-26,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I want  to express my strong support of this legislation expanding the Gettysburg National Military Park. The Wills House is an important historical property in the borough of Gettysburg. It is important in a number of ways. The Battle at Gettysburg was critical to preserving  the Union, and was  the high water mark of  the Southern  invasion of  the North while the victory was hardly decisive, or even much more than a draw, it nevertheless was a pivotal point in the Civil War. But it is a legitimate question as to whether Gettysburg would be  remembered as much today were it not for the Gettysburg Address by President Abraham Lincoln. Arguably,  the Gettysburg Address  along with the Declaration of Independence, are the most known documents to Americans. Many of the phrases in the Gettysburg Address are among the only famous passages recognized by most Americans. Some simple—‘‘four score and seven years ago’’ and ‘‘government of the people, by the people, for the people’’—and some more  complex—‘‘our  fathers brought forth on  this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.’’ Garry Wills, a brilliant author who is sometimes very wrong-headed, has written one of the best books I’ve ever read. It is titled ‘‘Lincoln at Gettysburg, The Words That Remade America.’’ He lays out the background of the speech, of the times, and, most importantly, the significance of the words themselves and their impact. This remarkable short address shaped how we think about ourselves as a nation. Building on his book on  the Declaration, Wills demonstrates  that  the Gettysburg Address redefined much of how we view government and our Nation. Lincoln did this without mentioning Gettysburg, slavery, the North, the South, or even the Emancipation Proclamation. In other words,  he  didn’t  speak  to  the  immediate issues before him but in a timeless way about the principles of our Nation. Gettysburg today is not just about the battle. But it is also about the Address, in how it helped turn the bitterness of the Civil War into nationally uniting themes. The Wills House is a key site to Gettysburg. Not only did President Lincoln spend the night before his speech at  the Wills House, and probably did his final editing at the home, but without David Wills efforts there would have been no ‘‘Gettysburg Address.’’ David Wills had studied  law under Thaddeus Stevens,  the Radical Republican  from Pennsylvania who was  key  leader  in  the House for many years. He owned the largest house on the Gettsyburg Town Square. As a leading citizen, he put an end to land speculation for the burial of soldiers killed at Gettysburg, and formed an interstate commission to collect  funds  for  the cleansing of  the battlefield. But in Garry Wills book on Gettysburg, he points out that David Wills had another goal. ‘‘He wanted to dedicate the ground that would hold  them even before  the  corpses were moved. He  felt  the need  for artful words  to sweeten the poisoned air of Gettysburg.’’ First, David Wills asked  the poets  to appear—Longfellow, Whittier  and Bryant—but they declined. But he was able to attract Edward Everett, perhaps the foremost orator of the  time. President Lincoln was kind of an afterthought,  included among many officials. No one really understood the potential impact he would have, or even understood it at the time. But key  facts  remain—it was David Wills who led the effort to create the cemetery and he specifically hoped to accomplish what Lincoln actually did accomplish, an act of healing aimed at the ages. In a historical sense, it is a bonus that Lincoln actually stayed at  the Wills House,  finished  the polishing of  the speech at  that house, and delivered a brief  speech  that evening to those gathered to greet him at the house.  It  is  indeed a site worth  inclusion  in this national battlefield so vital to our national memory. Furthermore, this can be an important part of resolving some of the conflict at the most recent battle of Gettysburg. Clearly Gettysburg needs to move its visitor center from the critical area of the battlefield. It  is also essential  that additional storage space  for priceless artifacts, with proper climate control, be created as rapidly as possible. Because the new location is farther from the town,  in which many  local businesses have developed concessions dependent upon visitors to the park, there is concern that the new visitor center could result in financial damages to the borough of Gettysburg. While I disagree with this concern because I believe a new visitor center will draw more visitors  for  longer periods, regardless of one’s views on that subject, it is clear that development of the Wills House  site  in  town,  along with  creative changes around the cemetery to better highlight the exalted place in American history of the Gettysburg Address, would draw visitors to the village itself. It would probably also add to the length of stay of the visitors, which would also benefit those in the borough. And, from a national perspective, this Wills House site and further highlighting the memorable address that stands as a seminal document in understanding who we are as Americans, will make every American-including the thousands of schoolchildren who visit Gettysburg each year—much richer. Address delivered at the dedication of the cemetery at Gettysburg. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and ",2000

350,,106,-0.203,153,2000-09-26,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, I ask a question of my good friend from Nevada. The Senator  from Florida has raised  some  interesting  questions about a particular group of people whom we, under our amendment, would seek to not give automatic citizenship to but the opportunity to apply. The Senator from Rhode Island has spoken eloquently about a fairly large group of applicants who are just seeking an opportunity to apply. Does the Senator know that there is a very large group of people from Honduras that are living in the New Orleans area of Louisiana with  families that will really be disrupted and separated if we don’t provide some kind of response? I wish  the Senator could perhaps shed some light on how difficult it is going to be for me to have to go back to Louisiana and explain to my business leaders that I am trying to help them get visas for people to build the ships we need, to build powerplants to fuel this economy, and to bring people into this Nation, but yet I am not able to get our Senate to help us keep people who are already there employed and working in shipbuilding, running our hotels, and our hospitals. The leader has done such a good job. I just wanted to come to the floor to say it is going to be very difficult for me to go back and say: While we gave you some help with visas for people to be brought in to help, we are taking people away from you who are already employed, and we weren’t able to correct that. Could the Senator shed some light for people who are following this debate on how it doesn’t seem to make sense that on the one hand we are giving new visas to people to come into our country, and yet we are telling employers who are desperate for workers, particularly in my State of Louisiana in the New Orleans area, that we are going to actually take good workers away from them and ship them back to either Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador? ",2000
351,,106,-0.314,174,2000-09-26,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. As I indicated to the majority  leader, this may be a unique bill not unlike  the one my friend, the Presiding Officer, has on sex trafficking on which he has worked so hard. This doesn’t even have  those problems. This has 415 Members of the House voting for it; 3 voting against it; 71 cosponsors in the Senate. I am willing to predict, if we can agree to bring it up without amendment, we will get 85 to 95 votes. This is in the category of a no brainer. HENRYHYDE is a sponsor of it. It is the Biden-Hatch bill. The only point I make, and I will be brief, time is running out. The Violence Against Women Act expires this Sunday, September 30. It took me 8 years to get this thing done. It took 3 years after it was written just to get it considered. It took that long to get it passed. It has been in place for 5 years. There are no additional taxes required to pay for this bill because there is a trust fund that uses the salaries that were being paid to Federal officials who no longer work for the Federal Government; it goes into that fund. As I said,  if there was ever a no brainer, this one is it. Democrats like it; Republicans like it. As Senator Herman Talmadge from Georgia, said to me one night regarding another issue when I walked into the Senate dining room: What’s the problem, JOE? I guess I looked down. He was chairman of the Agriculture Committee.  I  said:  I’m having problems with such and such an issue. He said: What is the problem, son? I repeated; I thought he didn’t hear me. He said: No, you don’t understand. Republicans like it; Democrats like it. So just go and do it. Well, that is where we are tonight. Democrats  like the bill; Republicans like the bill; the House likes the bill; the Senate likes the bill; women like the bill; men  like the bill, business likes the bill; labor likes the bill. So why don’t we have the bill? And I have been hollering about this for 2 years now. Hopefully, in light of what the majority leader said, maybe we will get to it. I was beginning to get a little despondent. I was even thinking of attaching the bill to the Presiding Officer’s bill to make sure we get it done. Today the Washington Post,  in an editorial  entitled  ‘‘Inexplicable Neglect,’’ noted: ‘‘There seems to be no good reason, practical or substantive, to oppose the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.’’ I ask unanimous consent the totality of  that editorial be printed  in  the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: INEXPLICABLENEGLECT There seem to be no good reason, practical or substantive, to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Originally passed in 1994, the act provides money to state and local institutions to help combat domestic violence. It is set to expire at the end of the month. Its reauthorization has overwhelming bipartisan support. But House and Senate leaders have yet to schedule a vote. Versions of the bill have been favorably reported by the judiciary committees of both chambers. Both would expand programs that during the past five years have helped create an infrastructure capable of prosecuting domestic violence cases and providing services to battered women. Since the original act was passed, Congress has devoted $1.5 billion to programs created by it. The House and Senate bills differ, but both would authorize more than $3 billion in further support during the next five years. There is room to debate the proper  funding  level relative to other priorities, a matter which will be determined later by appropriators; and the programs won’t end  immediately  if  the act lapses, because funds have been approved for the coming year. But failing to reauthorize would send the wrong message on an important  issue  and, more  important,  could threaten future appropriations. With time in the 106th Congress running out, the Violence Against Women Act may become a casualty for neglect rather than of active opposition. But that’s no comfort. Congress ought to find the time to pass it before leaving town. ",2000
352,,106,-0.53,258,2000-09-26,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, our nation was built on the dreams of immigrants who came here to create a better life for themselves and their families. The ethnic diversity of the American patchwork quilt makes this nation strong and has helped our nation become the envy of much of the world. I am proud to be from a state whose ethnic heritage can be seen in our faces, our foods and families. Wisconsin is a state made up of settlers who came from the far corners of the world to build their businesses, raise their families and stake their claims for a piece of the American Dream. There is an exciting new project underway in my congressional district that has national and international implications. The Swiss Center of North America is proposed to be located in New Glarus, Wisconsin. This new center will  facilitate historical  research, cultural exchanges and business partnerships extending beyond  the beautiful  rolling  countryside of America’s Dairyland. Like many ethnic groups, the Swiss came to North America in large numbers in the 19th Century, settling  in each state of  this Union and every province of Canada. They brought their traditions, culture, languages, foods and a rich heritage that have made a lasting impact throughout this continent. The Swiss government helped these new immigrants by setting up colonies  for  their countrymen and women on this side of the Atlantic to ease the transition into the New World. One such colony remains largely intact, located in New Glarus, Wisconsin. This community, which I am honored to represent in Congress, continues to celebrate its Swiss heritage, attracting Swiss immigrants and welcome visitors from around the world. Many in North America are not aware of the accomplishments  of  their  Swiss-American neighbors. The Swiss have brought a multicultural background encompassing elements from German, French, Italian and Roman heritages. Many thing of Switzerland as a land of Alpine meadows,  decorated  cowbells  and colorful window boxes. Yet  this  fails  to  fully recognize  the very modern, multilingual and multi-cultural aspects of this small, yet diverse, nation. Those of Swiss descent  in North America are very proud of their heritage, as Switzerland has made many important contributions to the world. Yet, unlike many other nationalities,  there  is no permanent venue  to showcase Swiss cultural, economic, historic, and social contributions in North America. I hope that is about to change. The Swiss Center of North America aims to be a state-of-the-art  facility  located  in New Glarus, Wisconsin. It will highlight the contributions of the Swiss of yesterday, today and tomorrow. With historical exhibits, modern interactive displays, genealogical research facilities and premiere meeting space, the Swiss Center will help spread the word that Swiss living in the United States, Canada and Mexico continue  to offer much  to  the North American melting pot. The State of Wisconsin has already committed $2 million to this project and an international fund-raising drive is now well underway. I support the Swiss Center of North America not just because it will be located in my district. I support it because those of Swiss heritage need a place to house their artifacts and tell their story. This is a valuable project, in part, because learning more about where we come from helps guide us to where we are going. The more  future  generations  learn about  this nation,  the more  they understand about our rich diversity. The Swiss Center of North America will help foster a better understanding between cultures and will offer us the promise of a broader appreciation of the heritage of our international ancestors. f THANKING WOLODYMYR LUCKHAN FOR  HIS  SERVICE  TO  THE UNITED STATES DURING WORLD WAR II HON.

353,,106,0.122,258,2000-09-26,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker, I thank one of my constituents, Wolodymyr Luckhan, for the heroic action he took during World War II to save an American tank division from an enemy ambush near Swizel, Germany, in April 1945. Mr. Luckhan, seized by the Germans into forced labor, overheard the impending attack against an American  tank force approaching  the  city of Swizel. Mr. Luckhan commandeered a boy’s bicycle and peddled through German lines, risking his life to reach the Allied forces. Without his timely warning,  the  loss of American  lives would have been considerable. Mr. Luckhan’s example once again demonstrates that the virtue of selflessness merits recognition. After  the war, Mr. Luckhan came  to  the United States, became a citizen and raised a family. At age 91, Mr. Luckhan still recalls the event that changed the course of history for so many. Walt Whitman wrote  that  ‘‘To have great poets, there must be great audiences, too.’’ I present Mr. Wolodymyr Luckhan as a spokesperson  for  freedom whose stage  for heroism was made possible by the great audience of men and women who gave their lives in service of our country and  those who, thanks  to  the efforts of people such as Mr. Luckhan, have survived to share in the quality of life that only this great nation can afford. f SERBIA DEMOCRATIZATION ACT OF 2000 SPEECHOF HON.

355,,106,0.278,43,2000-10-04,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker, I was the sponsor of the pipeline bill; and it passed August in 1973 because we were in an embargo. The OPEC countries placed an embargo and our gasoline went from 23 cents to 54 cents, and we were frankly out of oil. We passed it here in 1973. We told the companies to build it in 3 years, and they did; and in 1976 they had the first barrel of oil that flowed through that line. And by the way, it all went to the United States. It did not go to Japan. All of it went to the United States. And we have produced about 16 billion barrels of oil. At the crisis of the Gulf War, for instance, we were producing 2,200,000 barrels a day. It averaged a million barrels a day. It has the capacity of 2 million barrels. But we put that pipeline in with all the safeguards that we can possibly have available in those days. That has been a long time, approximately 28 years ago. We put crossings for caribou to cross over at the cost of about $50 million. And by the way, they do not use them. They crawl under the pipeline because they like to be under the pipeline. The caribou herd has increased dramatically many  fold over. Actually, the wildlife all the way around has increased. We have had, they say, a thousand spills. That is pure poppycock if I may say so. Because up there they call it a spill and they are very good about reporting it. If there is one drop of oil somewhere from a squirt gun or an oil can or the bottom of a truck, that is reported. There has been no major spill at all in this pipeline from the time it was constructed. The one people hear about is the Exon Valdez. That was the responsibility of one man, one captain that made an abrupt turn; and why we will never know. But in the meantime, I remind the American people that that oil which you receive is oil that we would not have to buy from the OPEC countries; and if we could produce 2 million barrels  a  day, which we  could with ANWAR, and, remember, it is your oil, if we could produce 2 million barrels a day, that means we would be that less dependent upon  those  foreign countries.

361,,106,0.28,155,2000-10-04,Mr. FITZGERALD.," Mr. President, there are a number of other articles that have been written over the years about how the State gave out the riverboat gambling licenses in Illinois. The record is replete with problems that the State had, or questions that were raised about how  the  licenses were awarded. They  just happened  to be awarded to people who seemed to be involved in the political process. That was something I was concerned about at the time. I was in the State senate at that time; this goes back to 1994. There is an article in the Chicago Sun-Times that discusses how I was seeking competitive bidding on those State riverboat licenses. This is an article from April 10, 1994, entitled, ‘‘Riverboat Deal is Plum For Insiders,’’ by Dennis Byrne of the Chicago Sun-Times: The agreement between Mayor Daley and Gov. Edgar to bring riverboat gambling to Chicago should make a lot of people happy: Chicago taxpayers and schoolchildren, who will benefit from the additional revenues, and the thousands of casino/entertainment center employees. But the folks who should be the happiest are the well-connected insiders who are already raking it in from the state’s 10 suburban and Downstate riverboats and who stand to make hundreds of millions more from the Chicago riverboats. That would be thanks to a little-noticed part of the agreement changing the law that bans owners of one riverboat license from having more than a 10 percent interest in a second. If approved by the Legislature, they could own a second license and up to a 10 percent interest in a third. So folks such as Eugene Heytow, chairman of the politically connected Amalgamated Trust & Savings Bank, where William Daley, the mayor’s brother, once was president, could keep his stake in a riverboat in Galena while buying a chunk of one in Chicago. And William Cellini, a powerful friend of Edgar and former Gov. James R. Thompson, could buy into Chicago big-time while keeping his lucrative  interest  in the Alton Belle. So could Gayle Franzen, the Republican candidate for DuPage County Board chairman. And so on. You could argue that they should get a piece of the Chicago action because the state is changing the rules of the game, that when they invested in the suburban and Downstate boats they believed they wouldn’t face any competitive risk from Chicago. However, it’s not a very convincing argument in the face of the obscene profits that they have  already harvested  from  their state-protected monopolies. State Sen. Peter G. Fitzgerald (R-Inverness), a banker, has calculated that the profits have been great enough to cover initial investments in only a matter of months—the kind of return that might make Hillary Rodham Clinton envious. In the case of the Alton Belle, a $20 million or so capital investment (and a paltry $85,000  for a state  licensing  fee) seeded a company that now has an estimated market value approaching a half billion dollars. Let me read that again. This is from Dennis Byrne, ‘‘Riverboat Deal is Plum for Insiders.’’ In the case of the Alton Belle, a $20 million or  so  capital  investment—and  a  paltry $85,000 for a State licensing fee. The guys who got the riverboats gave the State $85,000. The State gave them a license and ceded a company that now has an estimated market value approaching $.5 billion. Not a bad deal if you are giving the $85,000 and they are giving you the license. It is worth, at that time they say, $.5 billion. What did the taxpayers get out of this with no competitive bidding? They had  their  income  taxes raised during that time. For an initial outlay of just a couple hundred grand  21⁄2 years ago,  investors now would own tens of millions of dollars worth of stock. Cellini himself plucked $4.9 million when he sold some of his stock when the company went public, but still retains some $60 million worth of stock. And if they invest in Chicago boats? Using the city’s figures, Fitzgerald calculates that annual net income on each boat could approach $50 million, and that the market value of each boat (at five times earnings) could exceed a quarter of a billion dollars. Thankfully, though, they’d have to sink more into the Chicago boats, because, unlike the  license  for  suburban  and Downstate boats, the city licenses would be competitively bid. Who gets the license will depend, in part, on how much the bidder is willing to give to the city in admission, franchise and other  fees.  Unfortunately,  though,  the state’s 20 percent gaming tax on gross receipts will not be raised, for the Chicago or Downstate boats. Nor do we know if other municipalities that are granted new boats will be able to demand competitive bidding. Fitzgerald believes that even if the 20 percent state tax were raised significantly, to as high as 60 percent, the owners still would make a nice profit. So if we truly believe VerDate 02-OCT-2000 02:40 Oct 05, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04OC6.163 pfrm02 PsN: S04PT1 ",2000
362,,106,-0.303,162,2000-10-04,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to Little Flower Manor of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a nonprofit skilled nursing home which  is celebrating  its 25th anniversary of compassionate, loving care and service to the community. The Carmelite Sisters  for  the Aged and Infirm operate Little Flower Manor under the auspices of the Diocese of Scranton. This exceptional facility opened its doors in 1975, a living tribute to the vision, dedication and persistence of the Most Reverend J. Carroll McCormick, the late Bishop of Scranton, and the generosity of the faithful of the Diocese. This dedication  to provide service  to  the aged continues under  the  leadership of  the Most Reverend James C. Timlin, the present Bishop of Scranton. At Little Flower Manor, each resident is given the attention required to enable him or her to maintain personal dignity, individuality and independence. A 25th Anniversary Gala will be held Nov. 3, 2000, at the Woodlands Inn and Resort with Judge Peter Olszewski as guest speaker. Sister Jeanette D. Lindsay, administrator and chief operating officer of Little Flower Manor, will present the inaugural Crystal Rose Award. The honored recipients are Mr. and Mrs. John D. McCarthy and the late Bishop McCormick. Jack and CeCe McCarthy have been outstanding supporters of the values, commitment and mission of Little Flower Manor, practicing stewardship by giving unselfishly of their time, talents and treasure. Mr. Speaker, I send my congratulations and best wishes to the McCarthys, the Carmelite Sisters, the Diocese of Scranton, and everyone who plays a part in Little Flower Manor’s continued service to its residents.  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UKRAINIANAMERICAN YOUTH ASSOCIATION HON.

363,,106,0.54,176,2000-10-04,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, there are few occasions more joyous and historic in a family’s life than a 25th wedding anniversary. On October 11, 1975, Don and Cathie Hunsberger were married. Today, a quarter-century later, their bonds of matrimony are stronger than ever. As each of us in Congress knows, leadership in all walks of life means, more than anything  else,  setting  an  example.  The Hunsbergers’ commitment  to each other,  to their families, and to their communities is just such an example and inspiration to us all. They began  their partnership as college sweethearts  at  DePauw  University  in Greencastle, Indiana. Cathie was studying to become a teacher. Don was preparing for law school. Even then, Cathie was convinced that the education of our children was the key to our future, and Don was committee to improving the way of our laws and our government serve the people. Their sense of caring and responsibility made a lasting impression on all of  their many  friends, most  particularly Cathie’s adopted ‘‘sister’’ and roommate, my wife, Rebecca. Cathie and Don were soon married, and shortly made their way to Orange County, California. As a renowed educator, Cathie has made a positive difference to hundreds of our children in Orange County. Don’s leadership in the law and his community service have improved the lives of  families  throughout Southern California. Twenty-five years of marriage have produced  four children. As parents, Don and Cathie have passed along  their values and their sense of honor, duty, and patriotism to Lauren, Ashley, Alec, and Evan. As a result, Orange County and our Nation will long profit from their example. Along with  the  rest of  their  family and friends,  the Hunsbergers will be celebrating this memorable occasions on October 11, 2000 in Yorba Linda, California at the home of Cathie’s parents, George and Mary Ries.  I know all of my colleagues join me in wishing Don and Cathie Hunsberger a splendid 25th wedding  anniversary,  and many more  to come.  EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TAIWAN’S PARTICIPATION IN THE UNITED NATIONS SPEECHOF HON.

364,,106,-0.149,15,2000-10-11,Mr. PICKETT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I appreciate the kind remarks from the gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr. SKELTON). I also want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Chairman SPENCE) for his leadership on the Committee on Armed Services, and particularly I want to thank the gentleman WELDON), from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on Military Research and Development, for being such a pleasure to work with on this subcommittee. The conferees are to be commended for this conference report, and in particular, for the military research and development program. The level of authorization for R&D provided over and above  the  administration’s  request, some $1 billion more, provides an impressive total of $38.8 billion for research, development, tests, and evaluation. The report strikes an excellent balance between mature R&D programs and  investment  for additional  leapahead technologies. Major programs, such as the F–22 Raptor, Comanche, and Army Transformation Plan, will continue as programmed. In addition, the report deals responsibly with  the  Joint  Strike Fighter program, given recent program slippage, and also robustly funds antisubmarine warfare initiatives. The outcome for the DD–21 program should  give  the Department  ample room to make successful adjustments in this program. Investments for leapahead  technologies  included  in  this conference  report  represent an even greater commitment to confront the evolving asymmetrical threats of the future. The conferees agreed to provide additional assistance for combatting terrorism,  for  overhead  reconnaissance capabilities, and for enhancing the security measures for information systems. Other provisions also provided additional investments for an assortment of promising battle management systems, next-generation night vision capabilities, radars, lasers, and sensors. This  is  a  conference  report  that strikes a constructive balance between short-term and long-term investments. I urge its adoption. ",2000
365,,106,0.329,15,2000-10-11,Mrs. FOWLER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the conference report on the fiscal year 2001 defense authorization bill. This will be my last time to come to the well to support a defense authorization bill. This is the eighth one in my eighth year, and this is one of the best we have had. I want to thank the generous and kind remarks that were made by my chairman and some of the members of the Committee. I first want to pay tribute, again, to a really dear departed colleague, Herb Bateman, who worked so hard on the readiness portion of this bill. Herb’s contributions to this legislation were critical, and this bill may be the best evidence ever of his unyielding commitment to our Nation’s military readiness and our men and women in uniform. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it, we do have a readiness crisis in our military today. Last year, during a visit to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, I learned that only four of 21 P– 3 aircraft based there could even get off the ground due to spare parts shortages and other maintenance shortfalls. I checked back on the status of the wing just last month, a year later, to see how many of those aircraft now were rated mission capable. The number had risen. Now seven out of the 21 could fly, but of those seven, only two were fully mission capable. Meanwhile,  this  administration’s own Defense Science Board Task Force on Quality of Life has found that the majority of our military and  family housing  is  unsuitable. The  current Navy  building  replacement  rate  is roughly 175 years. In the Air Force alone today, we have a real property maintenance backlog of some $4.3 billion. Our most recent readiness reports indicate that over half of the Army’s combat  training  centers  scored  the lowest possible rating, a C–4. I want to just quote a General commanding one of those elite training schools: ‘‘This mode of operation cannot be sustained another year without incurring unacceptable safety risks and severe training quality degradation.’’ These are not the exceptions, these are the rule. They should remain troubling to every Member of this body. This outstanding bill goes to correct some  of  these  troubling  readiness issues. Among other things, this bill would authorize a $1 billion  increase  in  funding  for critical readiness accounts,  including an additional $335 million for Depot Maintenance; $223 million for spare parts; and $428 million for real property maintenance. These budget adjustments reflect badly needed increases to deal with serious  readiness problems  facing our military today. Aside  from authorizing key programs,  this bill contains many important policy measures aimed at improving our ability to track military readiness. Moreover, the bill includes a modified version of H.R. 3616, the Impact Aid Reauthorization Act of 2000, including provisions to speed payments to heavily impacted school districts, authorize the Secretary of Education to provide grants to school districts unable to raise funds through local bond efforts to renovate and repair schools, and other key steps. This outstanding bill  strongly merits  the House’s support. It contains landmark legislation to provide health care and pharmacy benefits  to our military  retirees, addresses  the health care needs of our nation’s nuclear workers,  and  achieves  significant  savings through multiyear procurement authorities. It is a  fitting  tribute  to  the man  for whom  it  is named, Armed Services Committee chairman FLOYDD. SPENCE, who has labored tirelessly for months to produce the excellent bill before us today. I also would take a moment to express my deepest appreciation  to  the committee staff for their hard work. I urge adoption of this outstanding legislation. Mr. Speaker,  this bill merits  House support. the VerDate 02-OCT-2000 01:24 Oct 12, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11OC7.034 pfrm02 PsN: H11PT1 ",2000
366,,106,0.375,22,2000-10-11,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4205, the FY 01 Defense Authorization bill. Of particular  interest  to my constituents in southwest Ohio—particularly those in western Hamilton County—is the provision based on legislation that I have cosponsored that establishes a new Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. This program will assist workers exposed to radiation, beryllium and other toxic substances in the course of carrying out their work in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. Many of these workers have become sick from illnesses that can be  traced  to  that exposure. The  former Fernald Feed Materials Production Center, which is located in my district, was part of our nuclear weapons production complex for nearly 40 years  from 1951  to 1988. Too often, these workers were not even aware of  the hazards they faced in their jobs—hazards that have frequently had serious health effects. What we are considering today will provide covered workers and their survivors at Fernald and around the Nation with the compensation they deserve that guarantees a specific minimum benefit and medical expenses.

367,,106,-0.455,43,2000-10-11,Mr. FARR of California.," I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise on the issue of drug reimportation. I am on the committee. I support the agricultural bill, I think it is a good bill, but I think there is a part of it that we have got to wake up. The question is, when is drug reimportation not an  importation? I hope that the Members of this Congress and particularly the press will take a look at the small print in this bill, specifically, the technical amendments to the underlying bill. Take a  look at page 41, for example. That bill is the one that talks about reimportation of drugs. On page 41 we see a subsection entitled F which says ‘‘Country Limitation.’’ If you go to the language, it reads, ‘‘Drugs may be imported only, only from the countries that are listed in subparagraph A of section 802(b)(1).’’ That is not in this bill, so you have got to go someplace else and look it up. Here is the sham. If you turn to that section in existing law, one finds that it only lists those countries where American drug companies  can  send unapproved products. That is the title of that section, ‘‘Unapproved Products.’’ Here is the trap. American companies can send out but cannot reimport, because we do not allow unapproved products  to  come back into the United States. I hope the American press can do what the congressional staff has failed to do and that is to tell the truth about this section. The drug provisions are a sham. There is no reimportation. I ask for a no vote on the rule. Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. EMERSON). ",2000
368,,106,0.4,57,2000-10-11,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this agriculture appropriations bill. I think we all have to be reminded constantly that this is a bill that helps agriculture  first and foremost. But before I mention a couple of specifics, Mr. Speaker,  I think  for the record this Member at least has considered it a tremendous honor to work under the leadership of the gentleman from New Mexico (Chairman SKEEN) in this process. He is a person who sets the highest standard of integrity and brings to work every day the highest commitment. The character and the determination that he brings every day to work  for the betterment of agriculture in America is something that I will always, always remember. He  is not going anywhere. But  I think I speak for many of us on the subcommittee who just cherished the time that we have had working under his leadership on this subcommittee. I want to specifically mention that this bill, again, does deal with a lot of important aspects of agriculture assistance and relief, drought, other natural disasters. Commodity prices over the years have dealt a bad hand to many of our producers in this country. There is a lot of assistance in this bill for that; $3.5 billion in economic assistance that does not need to be held up in Washington any longer. I know that there are Members who do not like that certain commodities have received assistance in this bill as well. We have attempted to do the right thing and address all commodities that have suffered. We should not sit here and pick and choose who we help and who we do not based on whether or not we like what we grow or the farm programs that they operate under. They did not set the programs. Congress did. Now we must help all areas of rural communities survive in this very difficult time. The bill also goes the extra mile to support  farmers and  ranchers. Agriculture credit programs are increased by $14 million over fiscal year 2000, and agriculture research has increased by $86 million. The boll weevil eradication program is funded at $79 million. These are just a few examples of how this bill will help our farmers and ranchers and all of us who have large rural agriculture communities. The word ought to get out that there is a true commitment in a bipartisan way to help these folks who were really the salt of the Earth, the producers of this country who were trying to compete  in  international markets with other countries sometimes that subsidize their producers in unfair ways. There is a tremendous commitment by many of us, again, in a bipartisan way to do what is right in this Agriculture appropriations bill. I stand in strong support and would urge all of my colleagues to do the same. ",2000
369,,106,0.406,64,2000-10-11,Mr. WATTS of Oklahoma.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 4461, the FY2001 Agriculture Appropriations Act.  I would  like  to thank Chairman SKEENand the members of the Subcommittee for their leadership in drafting this legislation and I rise in strong support of its passage. Included in this bill is significant funding for the boll weevil eradication program. Boll weevil eradication has been a federally sponsored initiative  for  the  last  twenty-five years which has successfully eradicated  the cotton pest from many states. The remaining states with on-going eradication programs  include New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. While all these states do receive some direct  federal grants, it is nowhere near the percentage received by those states where the eradication program has already been completed. Instead, our states are  required  to call upon cotton growers in the State to self-finance the cost of most of the eradication program. The federal government’s percentage of support for these programs has steadily declined over the last few years and today, the federal contribution is only a few percentage points of the cost of the overall program.  In  lieu of direct  federal grants, the Congress has provided these remaining states with access  to  low  interest USDA loans, some grant money, and ‘‘in-kind’’ federal assistance.  In most  instances,  the state governments have been  required  to ‘‘step up to the plate’’ and provide significant financial support  to  replace  the  lost  federal aid. In Oklahoma, our state  legislature created the Oklahoma Boll Weevil Eradication Organization, or OBWEO, as a state agency in 1993 to coordinate  the state-wide effort.  In 1995, the  legislature amended  the powers of  the OBWEO  to enhance  its  financial capabilities so that OBWEO could apply for and receive USDA  low-interest  loans, as well as  issuing state bonds, the interest from which would be exempt from federal income tax. Shortly thereafter, OBWEO organized the State’s growers and began its eradication efforts. Unfortunately, neither of  the  two  financial tools with which OBWEO was  equipped proved to be useful. Due to quirks in USDA loan regulations, OBWEO has never been eligible for USDA loans. Moreover, OBWEO has not been able  to  issue  federal  tax-exempt bonds because of a restriction in the Internal Revenue Code  regarding  ‘‘private  activity bonds’’. The  inability of OBWEO  to use  the tax-exempt feature has resulted in additional interest costs as well. All told, OBWEO has seen its financing costs increase by almost $2 million, which is a tremendous amount in light of a total program cost of just under $17 million. In other words, OBWEO is experiencing a more than 15% program cost over-run because it cannot get access to loan programs available to other states. This bill  takes  the necessary steps  to get the eradication program in Oklahoma back on track with that in other states. Furthermore, it provides the necessary resources for the cotton producers nationwide  to  implement aggressive, successful eradication programs  to rid  their  crops of  these destructive pests. Other benefits for the cotton producers across the country include an increase in the limitation on Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) and Market Loan Gains (MLGs)  to $150,000  for 2000 crops of cotton, grains and oilseeds, $78 million for the federal cost share contribution to boll weevil eradication, and $100 million in lending authority for the eradication program. Also included in this bill is funding for the Retired Educators  for Agricultural Programs, or REAP. REAP is an organization which was established in 1994 to address the diminishing numbers of African American agricultural education teachers in Oklahoma and the scarcity of African American youth enrolled  in vocational agriculture and programs such as  the Future Farmers of America.  Initially, REAP was operating in five counties in Oklahoma. It has since begun  to operate  in other areas throughout the State. The mission of REAP is to build a foundation that promotes personal and economic opportunities in agriculture for African American youth through project development and partnerships with educational and other community resources. One of  the primary goals of REAP is to emphasize citizenship, economic development,  leadership and scholarship  to the African American youth  involved  in  the program. REAP extends its outreach to the parents and community members by means of programs, forums and opportunities to chaperone student activities. The program encourages this participation  in  the hope  that  the adults will become better  informed, more  involved and more supportive of  the reasonable and achievable aspirations of their young people. REAP exemplifies a model that can be easily replicated. It is a program of vision, partnerships and commitment that is timeless in focus and  limited only by  the parameters of  the imagination.

370,,106,0.466,211,2000-10-11,Mr. MACK.," I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for making a point with which I strongly agree: the waiver authority in this legislation is intended to be used on each case or for each asset, but not to be used as a de-facto veto. In drafting this language and negotiating with the administration over the past several months, we believe firmly that using blocked assets of terrorist states to satisfy  judgments  is completely consistent with the intent of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, and more significantly, is consistent with our national security interest. Simply stated, making  the  terrorists who harm or kill Americans  in acts of international terrorism pay for their acts makes for good policy. It should deter future acts of terrorism, as well as provide some small measure of justice to current victims. ",2000
371,,106,-0.266,211,2000-10-11,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," I am pleased have worked with Senators LAUTENBERG, MACK, and KYL in getting this legislation to this point. The national security  interest waiver  should be used only when there is a specific national security interest greater than the interest  in  taking effective action  to combat  terrorism  against American citizens; and it should be exercised on a case-by-case basis. The judiciary Committee never  intended to divide victims, helping some and not others. We must ensure that all American victims of terrorism able to successfully hold foreign states responsible to the satisfaction of U.S. courts are treated fairly and aided by this and future administrations to collect their damages.

374,,106,0.75,74,2000-10-19,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act. The communities in my district have learned first hand that the Army Corps of Engineers has become a large, bloated and intransigent bureaucracy. Now is the time for reform, and while  I commend  the Transportation Committee  for  their efforts  to bring about some reform in the area of peer-review for projects in S. 2796, I believe more work must be done, and more efforts to shrink the size and power of  the Corps of Engineers should be made. To illustrate the point, I am enclosing for the the  following Op-Ed  I recently submitted  to  the Aurora Sentinel  regarding  the need for reform in the Army Corps of Engineers. On a related topic, I believe that the public image and reputation of  the Corps of Engineers might be  improved  tremendously  if  it would adopt some of the recommended policy changes  suggested  by  the  1999 National Recreation Lakes Study Commission. Specifically, I believe it is time for the Corps to reverse its long-standing opposition to costshare proposals that would rehabilitate facilities on the recreational properties it leases to non-federal entities such as the State of Colorado. Over the last year and a half, I have worked with  the  interested parties  to encourage  the Corps  to enter  into a cost-share agreement with the state of Colorado to improve the recreational facilities of Cherry Creek Reservoir, Chatfield Reservoir, and Trinidad Reservoir State Parks. Cherry Creek, Chatfield, and Trinidad Reservoirs are each operated and maintained by the Corps, while the State manages all parks and  recreation  facilities on  the surrounding federally-owned  land. These  reservoir-parks are the most valued sources of water recreation in Colorado, a state where virtually no natural large body of water exists. The three parks combined host almost 3.5 million visitors annually. Most  recreational  facilities  in  these parks were constructed over 25 years ago. Entrance RECORD gates,  trails, campsites, and outhouses are near states of disrepair. Worse, public safety is at risk if water, sewer, and Americans with Disabilities Act compliance improvements are not addressed. The State is not financially capable of meeting  the  repair and  renovation needs without matching federal assistance. In a recent meeting with Assistant Secretary of  the Army  for Civil Works, Dr.  Joseph Westphal,  I  was  assured  by  Secretary Westphal that the Corps is committed to beginning this cost share agreement as a pilot project. Governor Bill Owens has also committed the State of Colorado to meeting its financial obligation for the cost share program. Unfortunately, the project has not progressed as planned. As was  demonstrated  by  previous  recreational  facility cost share agreements with the Bureau of Reclamation, these agreements are a tremendously efficient way to leverage federal dollars and  to help preserve Colorado’s quality of life. In addition, the facilities provided through the cost shares enable the Corps to meet their legal obligation to provide recreation on these three reservoirs. Because of the lack of an agreement, I proposed a policy  reform  in  the  form of an amendment  to S. 2796  that  instructed  the Corps of Engineers to submit a plan in no less than one year on how it could implement costshare programs with non  federal entities  for recreational purposes. While the amendment was not made in order, I intend to craft legislation that will seek to reform and improve the operations of the Corps of Engineers, and introduce  the  legislation when  the 107th Congress convenes. A BRIGHTLIGHTSHEDONTHEARMYCORPSOF ENGINEERS (By Congressman Tom Tancredo) The evidence is in, and it is conclusive. The Army Corps of Engineers has tried to throw a blanket over the heads of American taxpayers  in order to advance their own projects and agenda, and the citizens around the Cherry Creek Dam and Reservoir have been a top target. The Washington Post released an article on February 24th entitled  ‘‘Generals Push Huge Growth for Engineers,’’ which details an internal push to expand the budget, size, and scope of the Army Corps of Engineers. At the surface, the Corps has internally planned for growth of their budget to $6.5 billion by 2005, more than $2 billion greater than their 2000 budget, which breaks down more specifically within the agency. The  information obtained by the Washington Post also shows that Corps officials had been pressured by superiors to ‘‘get creative with cost-benefit analysis in order to greenlight major projects.’’ The Cherry Creek Dam controversy that has developed between the Corps, the local community and local public officials over the expansion of flood controls around the dam is even more alarming with the information contained in the Corps report proposing a  ‘‘program with  targeted  studies that should lead to target construction activities with continuation of historical success rates.’’ This answers a few questions I had surrounding the proposed addition of flood controls to the Cherry Creek Dam. Why the conflicting facts and figures from the Corps? And why have they suppressed the concerns of local citizens and elected officials, myself included? The answer to those questions is evident  in the report, the growth of the Corps is first and foremost.

378,,106,0.096,102,2000-10-19,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as  the Ranking Member on the Science Committee, I rise  in strong support of  the VA–HUD Conference Report, which is a much more satisfying bill  than  the one which passed  the House in June. I am especially pleased to see that the Conferees were able to find funds for important programs at NASA and NSF  that this body didn’t seem to have access to four months ago. In June, the President’s request for NASA was slashed by $377 million. One of the most troubling cuts in that bill was the elimination of funding for the Space Launch Initiative, a program that directed at developing advanced, reusable  launch vehicles  that will dramatically reduce the cost of launching government and commercial payloads. The high cost of access to space is the single largest impediment to our ability to reach our full potential in space. Fortunately, the bill we are considering today fully funds the Space Launch Initiative. In  funding NASA at $14.285 billion,  this Conference Report provides  the  resources needed to ensure the successful development and assembly of the International Space Station and the continued safe operation of the Space Shuttle. H.R. 4635 also provides a healthy level of funding for NASA’s important Science, Aeronautics, and Technology activities. Finally, I am pleased that H.R. 4635 requires NASA  to provide  for annual  life and micro-gravity sciences  research missions on the Space Shuttle. I have long supported a vigorous program of life and micro-gravity sciences flight research, and believe that such flights ultimately will deliver significant scientific returns. At the same time, we will need to ensure that such flights do not adversely disrupt the assembly of the Space Station, which will be  the ultimate venue  for path-breaking biomedical research in orbit. As for the National Science Foundation appropriations, again, this conference report is a great improvement over the House-passed bill, which cut the Administration’s request by $500 million. I know that in June the Committee did the best  that  it could with  the hand  it was dealt. But, had  the cuts prevailed, NSF—an agency with a critically important role in sustaining  the nation’s  research and education capabilities in all fields of science and engineering—would have been severely damaged. These cuts would have been short-sighted because basic  research discoveries  launch new industries that bring returns to the economy far exceeding the public investment. The Internet,  which  emerged  from  research projects funded by the DOD and NSF, strikingly illustrates the true investment nature of such research expenditures. In fact, over the past 50 years, half of U.S. economic productivity can be attributed to technological innovation and the science that has supported it. I am pleased that the conference report recognizes NSF’s important role by providing an historic increase of $539 million, or nearly 14 percent, above  the previous year’s budget level. This increase will enable the Foundation to expand its investments in exciting, cuttingedge research initiatives, including information technology, nanoscale science and engineering, and environmental research. Moreover, this new funding will enable NSF to increase average grant size and duration, as well  as  increase  the  number  of  new awards. Last year alone, NSF could not fund 3800 proposals that received very good or excellent ratings by peer reviewers. Finally, the increases provided by the conference report will begin to address a growing imbalance in federal support for fundamental research  in  the physical sciences and engineering relative to the biomedical fields. This is a serious matter because for any field of science progress  is dependent on advances made in other fields. This point was recently made by the past director of  the National  Institutes of Health, Nobel Laureate Harold Varmus: ‘‘Most of the revolutionary changes  that have occurred  in biology and medicine are rooted in new methods. Those, in turn, are usually rooted in fundamental discoveries in many different fields.’’ For  the past half-decade, we have been very  free  in our support of biomedical  research. I consider that to be a very good thing for all of our people. However, investing too narrowly in medical fields without investing in all  the other  sciences—sciences  that  contribute to the base of knowledge necessary for medical breakthroughs—will  lead  to a slowdown in medical progress in the long-run. I want  to congratulate  the Conferees on their work in this bill and to particularly thank them  for  finding  the resources necessary  to keep our Nation at the forefront of progress in space and science.

At 12:30,  the Senate will recess for a party caucus meeting until 2:15 p.m. It is hoped  that the Senate will receive the HUD-  VA appropriations conference  report  and/or the continuing resolution from  the House by early afternoon. The Senate may also have a procedural vote  with respect to the bankruptcy reform  bill during today’s session. Therefore,  Senators can expect up to three votes  this afternoon. As usual, Senators will  be notified as votes are scheduled.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.  MORNING BUSINESS  ",2000
382,Senate,106,-0.231,200,2000-10-19,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I would  say this is not the case; that we have  both Republicans and Democrats alike  entered into an enthusiastic, willing,  and self-confessed role as coconspirators to the raiding of the surplus.  Our colleague from Arizona, Senator  MCCAIN, stated  it clearly  last week  when he chided his fellow Republican  colleagues.  ‘‘We didn’t come  to  the  President with clean hands—we came  with  dirty  hands,’’  said  Senator  MCCAIN.  In another example of the lack of fiscal discipline—and it is part of the bill  that we are going to be asked to vote  upon this afternoon—the President vetoed the appropriations bill covering  energy  and water  projects  because  there had been added to the appropriations bill a provision prohibiting, under  certain circumstances, the use of funds  to revise the Corps of Engineers’ Missouri River Master Water Control Manual. This was not an issue of spending;  it was an issue of the management of  the Missouri River and who  should  have ultimate responsibility for that  management.  Nevertheless, when  this bill came  back from the President’s office with  his veto, the response was to revise the  bill by excising the provision which  had led to the veto and then adding $26  million  in additional water projects.  This spending spree is not limited to  the appropriators. Others have eagerly  joined in the party.  Other spending and tax cuts which  are being considered in the final hours  include increases in spending for Medicare providers. I mentioned that earlier  as an example of a provision that we  are likely to get with no opportunity  for debate or amendment. News reports  indicate that this may total $28 billion  over the next 5 years and perhaps as  much as $80 billion over the next 10  years. We are about to be asked to do  that without any debate, without any  opportunity  to  amend  or  give  the  thoughtful consideration for which this  institution is supposedly empowered.  We passed a military retiree health  benefit that will add $60 billion over  the next 10 years—again, with no open  debate or opportunity to amend.  We repealed the Federal telephone  tax, a provision that was tucked away  in the Treasury-Postal appropriations  bill. That will reduce revenues by $55  billion over 10 years.  I understand that there may be further proposed tax cuts that could have  a cost of $200 to $250 billion over the  next 10 years.  These are just examples of the almost total absence of any sense of fiscal discipline. It is possible to support  many of these proposals, but I am concerned that we are operating without a  blueprint. Congress is flying blind, and  our plane has no global positioning system. In fact, we do not even have a  hand compass to give us general direction as to where we should be going.  You might ask, What difference does  it make? Why should Americans care  this fall in the year 2000 as to what we  are doing? Don’t we have an enormous  surplus? Can’t we afford to do all of  these things?  Americans can and do care because  Congress is frittering away the hard-  won surplus without a real plan for utilizing those surpluses and without addressing the big  long-term problems  facing our Nation.  Americans should care because by  sleepwalking through the surplus, we  are denying ourselves the chance to  face these major national challenges.  A  few days ago, the Congressional  Budget Office released  its  long-term  budget  outlook.  The  Congressional  Budget Office findings are not encouraging, but  they are not  surprising.  That may explain why that report garnered  such  little  attention  by  the  media and by Members of Congress.  What were those Congressional Budget Office findings? The Federal Government spending on health and retirement  programs—Medicare, Medicaid,  Social Security—dominates the  long-  term budget outlook. Why? The retirement of the baby-boom generation will  drastically  increase  the  number  of  Americans  receiving  retirement and  health care benefits. The cost of providing health care  is growing  faster  than the overall economy. The number  of Americans working to support that  much larger retirement segment of our  population will  be  essentially  stabilized.  Saving most or all of the budget surplus that CBO projects over the next 10  years—using those savings to pay down  the debt—according  to  the Congressional Budget Office, would have a  positive impact on those projections of  future  obligations  and  substantially  delay the emergence of a serious fiscal  imbalance.  Despite the clear delineation of the  long-term  problems,  and  the  even  clearer outline of the short-term steps  Congress can take to begin to address  those problems—primarily, saving the  surplus and paying down the debt—  Congress seems content on frittering  away the surplus.  We have an obligation to not let this  happen. In fact, it is not necessary.  There are  some basic principles  to  which we could  recommit ourselves  which would avoid the path that I fear  is about to take us over the canyon  cliff.  First, we should return to that admonition that guided us so effectively just  2 years ago, and that was: Save Social  Security first. The surplus should be  used to pay down the debt. The kind of  direction which the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives  has suggested to us—that we should  use 90 percent of the fiscal year 2001  surplus for debt reduction—is not only  a good idea for the fiscal year 2001 but  should be a guiding principle into the  future until we have met that first obligation of saving Social Security first.  We also need to establish some priorities.  In those ugly days of deficits, we  were taught some valuable lessons. One  of  those  lessons was  the  need  to  prioritize. The tool that forced us to do  that was a requirement that for each  additional dollar of spending enacted, a  dollar of spending had to be reduced or  a dollar of taxes had to be raised. That  was a firm discipline.  The  surplus has  eroded  that discipline. Many of the proposals being  enacted in these waning days are desirable. Perhaps they are even more desirable than commitments that are already on our law books.  We are failing the American public  by not having an honest, open debate  about the tradeoffs that are necessary  to enact these programs.  If we are  going to add a substantial new benefit—whether  it be to Medicare providers or whether it be to military veterans—we should be prepared to answer  the question, Where are we going to  pay for that new commitment, either  in  terms of  reducing  spending elsewhere or raising taxes to pay for it?  We should not be eating away at the  surplus which is going to be the basis  upon which we can meet some of the  long-term significant challenges that  face our Nation.  There are few Congresses in the history of this Nation which have had  such a wonderful opportunity to face  and respond to important challenges to  our Nation’s  future. Few Congresses  will be judged so harshly for avoiding,  trivializing, and ultimately failing to  seize that opportunity.  I urge my colleagues in Congress, as  well as those in the White House, to  stop acting as the proverbial children  in the candy store and start acting as  statesmen and  stateswomen. At  the  very least, let us follow the admonition  given to all healers, which is: First, do  no harm.  I regretfully announce that  I will  have to vote against this appropriations bill because it fails to comply  with  the  fiscal discipline we established for ourselves, first in 1997 as part  of the Balanced Budget Act and then  this year in the development of our  own budget resolution. I hope there  will be a sufficient number of my colleagues who will join me in expressing  our outrage as to what we are doing in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:25 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S19OC0.REC S19OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000
383,Senate,106,0.549,228,2000-10-19,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, this  Capital and in the world too seldom do  people of real achievement, people who  have given of themselves sacrificially  for others, receive proper recognition.  As Leo Durocher once said, ‘‘Nice guys  finish last.’’ But, today there is good  news. I want to celebrate the fact that  good things do happen to those who  serve in America. Often, it takes time,  often it comes only after long years of  service, but our country still remains  capable of recognizing excellence.  Today I want to describe for you the  magnificent contributions to children,  to teachers, to community and to the  highest ideals of education and enrichment that have been made by Alabama’s Distinguished Principal of the  Year, Mr. Terry Beasley. The Greeks  once said that the purpose of education  is more than technical learning, it was  to make a person  ‘‘good’’.  In those  days, people apparently didn’t have the  difficulty distinguishing between good  and the bad that we seem to have  today. In addition to academic excellence, in abundance, Terry Beasley exemplifies ‘‘the good.’’  Although I did not know he was being  considered for this award and had absolutely nothing to do with his selection,  the name  ‘‘Mr. Beasley’’ has always  held the highest position in our family.  You see, he taught our children at  Mary B. Austin elementary School, a  part of the public school system in Mobile County, AL, my home. He taught  math and his name was mentioned  with the greatest respect, even awe, by  my children.  You could tell just the way they said  ‘‘Mr. Beasley’’ and how often the name  ‘‘Mr. Beasley’’ was repeated, that they  knew he was special.  My wife, Mary, a former elementary  school teacher herself, was a regular  volunteer parent in the classroom at  Mary B. Austin. She knew Mr. Beasley  then and the fire reputation he had  with teachers, principal, parents and  students. People still talk about the famous school playday when Mr. Beasley  would not only play ball with the children but would race the bases and slide  into home. Our friends, also, with children in the school, frequently discussed  his remarkable skill as a teacher and  his dedication to teaching.  Before he became a teacher. Terry  Beasley was a minister and youth director at a Mobile church. He considered that perhaps teaching could be a  calling too, and decided to give it a try.  In fact, the scripture lists ‘‘teacher’’ as  a person who can be called. So he decided to give it a try. It was a divine  inspiration, indeed. As he told me recently, it soon became clear to him  that ‘‘I had found my calling in teaching’’. His first job was at Mary B. Austin. Certainly, his later skills as a principal benefitted from the fact that he  was able to work under and observe the  great  leadership  skills  of  Glenys  Mason, who was principal at Austin at  the time, and to work with excellent  teachers.  Later, he moved across Mobile Bay to  the Baldwin County school system and  became principal at Fairhope Elementary School. They have 370 students  and 36 teachers in the second and third  grade school. Under Mr. Beasley’s leadership the school has flourished.  Last year the school was recognized  as having the best physical fitness program in Alabama, and was also recognized for its Kindness and Justice Program which teaches kindness and consideration to others with reference to  the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther  King.—We need to be intentional about  these character programs. Finally, the  school was also recognized as having  the  best  elementary  environmental  science program in Alabama. In fact,  the  third graders drafted a  statute  which became Alabama law to name  the Red Hill Salamander as the state  amphibian. As a result of this work,  and the efforts of the teachers, the student scores on the Stanford Achievement Test  showed a  significant  increase.  Fairhope Elementary is a wonderful  school with a diverse student population. 23 percent of the students are  on free or reduced lunch and 18 percent  are minority students. Mr. Beasley has  created a learning environment that is  dedicated to helping each child reach  his/her fullest potential. He is in the  classroom constantly, assisting teachers, training teachers, and insisting on  excellence. His leadership is extraordinary. Being a good teacher has certainly helped him be a great principal.  As he told me, ‘‘Math is my love, I  don’t claim to be an expert, but I love  it. If we can’t make math real then  kids won’t learn.’’ These are not just  words for Mr. Beasley. His intense interest in helping children led him to  study how they learn. His experience  caused him to write a paper on ‘‘writing math’’.  Ohio  State University  wants to publish it. In this technique,  Mr. Beasley encourages  students  to  write out in their own words exactly  the processes they are going through  when they do their math calculations.  From  this  experience,  the  student  comes to understand what they do not  know and the teacher is able to help  them. It helps them to relieve their  anxiety about math and makes them  more comfortable with it. Mr. Beasley  quotes John Updike as saying, ‘‘Writing  helps me  clear  up my  fuzzy  thoughts’’. He adds, ‘‘Write about math  and it becomes clear.’’ A principal is a  valuable thing indeed, as is an exceptional teacher. This nation needs to  venerate them, to lift them up and to  celebrate their accomplishments. Hundreds of thousand of them strive daily  to help each child learn too often with  little recognition.  As Mr. Beasley notes, the scripture  lists teaching as a ‘‘calling.’’ It is good  for us to praise and give thanks to  those who touched us with their work  and those who daily work to prepare  the next generation for service.  Terry Beasley is a great American  with a powerful determination to fulfill his calling—to help make young  people better and to help them learn.  He  is a native of Waynesboro, Mississippi, and his wife, Charlotte, also  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:25 Dec 04, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€0SENATE\S19OC0.REC S19OC0 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2000
384,Senate,106,-0.37,235,2000-10-19,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, it has  been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until  we act, Democrats in the Senate will  read the names of some of those who  have lost their lives to gun violence in  the past year, and we will continue to  do so every day that the Senate is in  session.  In the name of those who died, we  will continue this fight. Following are  the names of some of the people who  were killed by gunfire one year ago  today.  October 19, 1999:  Jerry G. Bowens, 25, Memphis, TN;  Nathaniel Bryan, 20, Washington, DC;  Wayne Butts, 43, Atlanta, GA;  Arnold Handy, 19, Baltimore, MD;  Paul Johnson, 31, New Orleans, LA;  Russell Manning, 52, Dallas, TX;  Rebecca Rando, 25, Houston, TX;  Mark Smith, 31, Dallas, TX;  Kirk Tucker, 32, Chicago, IL;  Jermaine Wallace,  22,  Baltimore,  MD; and  George Williams, 19, Pittsburgh, PA.  We cannot sit back and allow such  senseless gun violence to continue. The  deaths of these people are a reminder  to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.  f  VOICE OF AMERICA EDITORIAL  ",2000
385,Senate,106,-0.314,235,2000-10-19,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, on October 18 the Voice of America broadcast  an editorial entitled  ‘‘Terrorism Will  Fail,’’ strongly condemning the terrorist bomb attack on the U.S.S. Cole  in Aden harbor, which took the lives of  17 U.S. sailors. The editorial concluded:  ‘‘U.S. policy remains unchanged. The  U.S. will make no concessions to terrorists. The U.S. will bring to justice  those who attack its citizens and interests. The U.S. will hold state sponsors  of terrorism fully accountable.’’  This is unambiguous language, which  reflects not only United States government policy but also the feelings of all  Americans.  Unfortunately,  however,  the bureaucratic road from writing, to  approval, to broadcasting this editorial  was  anything  but  unambiguous.  In  fact, it revealed both initial bad judgment by the State Department, and the  need for better vetting procedures of  VOA editorials by the appropriate authorities.  VOA  editorials  are  statements  of  American policy, so they are rightly  cleared by the State Department for  consistency with official U.S. Government policy. Regrettably, in this case  the State Department initially vetoed  the editorial’s language. The reason for  stopping the editorial was totally unjustified. It was dead wrong to stop the  editorial because of fighting and casualties that were occurring elsewhere  in the Middle East. American service  men and women were tragically killed  in this terrorist attack and a clear  statement by Voice of America condemning the action should have gone  out immediately.  Subsequently, the State Department  fortunately disavowed the earlier veto  of the editorial memo, saying that the  initial veto memorandum ‘‘in no way  reflects the views of the Secretary of  State, the Department or the Bureau of  Near Eastern Affairs.’’ Moreover,  it  stated  that  the  initial veto memorandum had not been vetted or approved through appropriate channels.  It is inconceivable to me how anyone  could advocate deleting an editorial  condemning the cruel, cowardly, terrorist murder of American service men  and women.  I hope and trust this occurred because of the understandable stress officials at the Department of State were  under due to the tragic deaths from  this  dastardly  act  of  terrorism  in  Yemen occurring at the same time the  crises in the Middle East was also absorbing the attention of the Department.  Fortunately, as I mentioned earlier,  the Voice of America did broadcast the  editorial in its entirety.  f  AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS  BILL  ",2000

387,,106,-0.207,312,2000-10-19,Mr. PHELPS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize one of my district’s leaders in veterans affairs, Mr. Paul H. Kralman. A lifelong resident of Effingham,  IL, Mr. Kralman  first served his country in World War II. Since that time he has been a member of the Effingham American Legion Post No. 120, and he has held many offices within the post including Department Vice-Commander of  the Fifth Division of Illinois. Mr. Kralman also served as the Veterans Service Officer with the state of Illinois for many years. His most recent efforts have been with  the Effingham County Veterans Assistance Commission where he  resides as superintendent. At  the end of  this year Mr. Kralman will retire at the age of 82. Mr. Kralman has helped numerous veterans in my district receive  their benefits. He was awarded the site for a Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic which has helped numerous veterans  receive medical help close  to home. Through his dedication and hard work,  the Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic  is a great success. It is with this, Mr. Speaker, that I say congratulations to Mr. Paul Kralman on his excellent accomplishment. Due to his dedication to his fellow veterans, it is clear that Mr. Kralman is an asset to our country and the people who fought for it.

388,,106,-0.465,319,2000-10-19,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Stephen E. Petersen, founder of the Annual Petersen  Invitational Golf Tournament. The tournaments have been held on some  of  the  finest  and  challenging  golf courses along the Atlantic Coast from Myrtle Beach to Charleston, South Carolina. The purpose of the tournaments are to promote comradery, good  food,  fellowship, and hospitality among  friends. The  tournaments also provide an opportunity for participants to engage in the finer points of competitive golf. Throughout the years, more than six hundred friends and colleagues have participated  in this event. Stephen has unselfishly invested his inspiration, time, sweat, and funds in order to make these events successful. His love for people and passion for the game of golf together, distinguish him. They explain his sense of kinship with all those who know him. Stephen’s efforts have been highly successful in enriching lives and providing enjoyment to all who have participated in his tournaments. Many have fond memories which will remain with them for the rest of their lives. Many more gained insight and appreciation for what great golf tournaments are really all about. I, and  the many  friends, colleagues, and participants of these golfing events wish to extend our sincere appreciation, admiration, and VerDate 11<MAY>2000 08:35 Oct 20, 2000 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A19OC8.006 pfrm04 PsN: E19PT1 ",2000
389,,106,-0.402,326,2000-10-19,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Pastor Charles Sims, Jr. for his ten years of dedicated service to Saint Philip Lutheran Church in Gary, Indiana. One of the longest tenured Lutheran pastors to serve in the city of Gary, the members of St. Philip deeply appreciate Pastor Sims unfailing dedication  to strengthening the parish community. To recognize his commitment to St. Philip Church, his parishioners are hosting a celebration dinner in his honor, entitled ‘‘Staying the Course, Answering the Call,’’ on November 11, 2000. From modest beginnings, St. Philip has grown  into an  integral part of  the area and neighborhood. The community activism and social awareness displayed by the congregation has made a lasting difference to the citizens of Gary. The parishioners’ outreach and concern for their fellow man can be attributed in large part to the efforts of Pastor Sims. He has consistently shown the courage and leadership necessary to effect change in his community. Originally  named  Tarrytown  Lutheran Church, St. Philip was constructed in 1956 to serve the spiritual needs of African-American Lutherans living on the far west side of Gary. During its dedication service on January 20, 1957, the congregation renamed the Church. On October 22, 1967 the members of the parish dedicated a new educational wing to the church. Located at 3545 West 20th Place in Gary, the church has been a foundation of the community for many years. Many ministers sustained St. Philip during its  first 34 years of existence. Some of  the preachers held permanent assignments, while others worked on a part-time basis. On October 21, 1990 the loyal congregation of St. Philip was blessed to have Pastor Sims, a graduate of Chicago University’s Lutheran Seminary, accepted the call to lead the St. Philip parish. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Pastor Charles Sims, Jr. for his decade of tireless service to the members of St. Philip Lutheran Church and the Gary community. We are  fortunate  to have such an outstanding leader in our community, and I hope the people of St. Philip enjoy many more decades under Pastor Sims’ spiritual guidance. His vision and spiritual mission have made Northwest Indiana a better place to live and work. f RETIRED MARINE COLONEL BRIAN QUIRK SEEKS PROPER BURIAL FOR WWII WAR HERO REMAINS HON. WILLIAM O.

390,,106,-0.447,333,2000-10-19,Mrs. NAPOLITANO.," Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute  to Mr. Mark Haller, an outstanding  individual who passed away on October 10, 2000 at the age of 87. Mr. Haller was born on June 27, 1913, of a Serbo-croation immigrant mother newly arrived in Steelton, Pennsylvania. Orphaned at  the age of five when his mother passed away, Mr. Haller found himself surrounded with politically aware  immigrant men  from Central Europe while being  raised by a  foster mother  in a boarding house. Mr. Haller left his foster home as a  teenager and hitch-hiked  to Seattle, Washington, where  he  became  active  in grassroots politics. Mr. Haller was an active participant in the union movement, and  the peace, civil rights and  feminist movements of  the 1960’s.  In 1961, Mr. Haller and his wife, Frankie, a very dear  friend of mine, co-founded  the Midway Democratic Club to function as an issues oriented Democratic Party Club. Since that time, the Midway Club has met every month, and until recently, the Midway Newsletter has featured Mr. Haller’s monthly columns. For  the last six years of his working life, he was union representative for the members of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers at the Longview Fibre Company  in Bell, California. In addition to his passion for political activism, Mr. Haller was also well known for his dedication  to his  family. He  is survived by Frankie, his wife of 52 years, his sons, Michael  and Marko,  granddaughter, Regina Allen, grandsons Michael and Kenneth, his dog, Buddha and cat, Snoopy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to join me and Mark Haller’s family and friends in paying  tribute  to an outstanding American whose lifelong dedication and zeal exemplified the highest ideals of citizenship. f SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG WOMEN HON.

391,,106,0.325,8,2000-10-27,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the minority leader again today, as I did the last time that he made this same speech calling for bipartisanship and all working together. I am all for that. I think we ought to do that. But it is interesting. Almost immediately after he made the speech last week, all we heard from his side of the aisle was more partisan attacks, not even related to the issues that we were dealing with. Of all of the things that we have heard talked about today,  I do not think more than one or two of them had to do with appropriations. We are here today to deal with an appropriations matter, not all of these other issues, these authorizing issues, these legislating issues. I find it difficult to keep track of what bill is before the House when we hear all of the rhetoric that in my opinion is purely campaign rhetoric. I think that those campaign speeches that we  just heard this morning,  I think that is about the 69th time that I have heard those same speeches in the last 60 days, and I think we should give them all a number. We could save the time of the House so that we could get about our business if we just took each one of their arguments and gave it a number. When they stand up, say ‘‘Argument Number 2, Argument Number 10,’’ we could save a lot of time, because we have memorized their speeches. Those speeches that should have been reserved for the campaign trail, because that is where they belong, not in this House where the people’s business has to come first. We are also criticized for working at night. We work a  lot of nights. We work all day long. And we work at night too. And not only the Republican side; the Democrats do too. Despite some of the accusations about secret meetings, in all of the negotiations the Republican Majority and  the Democratic minority have been involved together and most of them have included representatives of the President from the White House. We have tried to be as totally fair as we possibly could be. We did not learn that was the right thing to do from the time that we were the minority, because we were never given those kind of opportunities. We were never allowed to participate in the decisionmaking, and so we vowed that the minority party would have the opportunity that we did not have as a minority when we gained the majority. And I think we have been pretty true to that. I do not think that there is any room for any criticism that we have excluded  the minority  from any of these conversations. Now, it is suggested that we ought to do  everything  that  the  President wants. Well, we are trying to accommodate the President, because he is the President and he has as much power at this stage of the appropriations process as two-thirds of this House and twothirds of the Senate. Because if he decides to veto a bill, it takes two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to override that veto. So he becomes very powerful  in this process and that is why we have worked very diligently with  the President’s  representatives  to  try  to accommodate him to the best of our ability. Mr. Speaker, I will give an example on education. We have proposed in our legislation  to  provide  considerably over a billion dollars more money for education than the President requested in his budget. The big holdup has been, we believe, that the local school officials, the elected school boards, in our counties and our districts should have the opportunity to decide if they need new school buildings? Do they need more teachers? Do they need more special education? Do they need books? Do they need supplies? They should make those decisions, not somebody sitting here in Washington. The minority side would like people to believe that Republicans really do not support education. That is just as phony as it can be. We are strong supporters of education. Let me give an example. Most of my colleagues in the House are very much aware that for all of the years that I have been here, I have spent most of my time dealing with national defense issues, national security and intelligence. And that is a fact. I have spent a lot of time on that because that is important to our Nation. If we do not have a secure Nation, we do not have much else. But after making all the speeches about national defense, let me suggest this. If we are going to sustain our position in the world due to high technology  and  state-of-the-art weapons and systems, and if we are going to sustain the ability of our young men and women to function with these systems and to operate them, we have got to have the best educational system possible. And I know that our strong national defense, our strong intelligence capabilities, our strong state-of-the-art technology, and the creation of new technology, do not happen if we do not have a strong and effective educational system. Republicans  believe  that. That  is why we are so committed to having a very strong educational system. One of the issues that the minority leader mentioned just a few minutes ago was about the tax bill. That is not what is before us this morning. But he mentioned  some of  the groups  that might have been affected by that tax bill. But one of our colleagues on our side,  the gentleman  from California (Mr. THOMAS) just the other day read off a list of the people and the groups who supported the tax bill, and the groups that he mentioned were all supporters of the tax bill. They did not oppose it. They supported it. It  is  interesting when the government has a huge surplus of money, there are those who believe that surplus  belongs  to  the  government. Wrong. Wrong. That surplus belongs to the taxpayers of this great Nation. And just because it is there does not mean that the government should spend it. So the tax bill I think is supported dramatically by the American people. Now, if we have a large surplus, how did it come about? We came into this ",2000

Thank you for bringing to our attention that clarification. ",2000
396,,106,0.379,9,2000-12-04,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 5637. The purpose of this bill is to authorize certain appropriations contained in the fiscal year 2001 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act. Without the specific authorizations  contained  in  this bill,  the amounts already appropriated will not be available this budget year. Section 1 of the bill authorizes the Coast Guard to spend $100,000 to reimburse  the owners of  the Cape May Lighthouse, formerly a Coast Guard facility, for the cleanup of lead contaminated soil found at the site of the lighthouse. Section 2 of the bill authorizes the Coast Guard to transfer $200,000 and project management authority to the Traverse City Area Public School District for the purposes of demolition and removal of a building at a former Coast Guard property  located  in Traverse City,  the district of  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. STUPAK). I urge the Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2000
397,,106,0.391,20,2000-12-11,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator SLADEGORTON. During the course of working with over the past several years, I have come to know a dedicated, intelligent  individual who  is  recognized throughout Congress as a work horse. He is a life-long public servant who began his political career in the Washington state legislature, where he was elected by his Republican peers to the position of State House Majority Leader. After his tenure in the state house, he continued to serve the fine people of Washington  as  Attorney  General. While serving in this position he argued fourteen cases before the Supreme Court, winning much acclaim for his proficiency as a lawyer. We come from opposite coasts, yet there are many common  ideological threads we share.  I respect SLADE’s commitment to fighting for the blue collar worker—the  salt-of-the-earth, hard working individuals who I am also pleased to represent—along with his strong support for the law enforcement community and for states’ rights. More importantly, I admire SLADE’s determination, a trait which enabled him to serve three terms in the United States Senate. Senator SLADEGORTON is a straightforward individual whose candor will be greatly missed, and I feel that I can speak for all of my colleagues when I express my gratitude for his countless contributions to the Senate. I wish him and his wife Sally health, happiness, and success in the years to come. ATLANTIC STRIPED BASS CONSERVATION ACT ",2000
