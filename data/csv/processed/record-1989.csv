0,15,3,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Speaker, last Wednes day in this space I criticized the proposed fi nancing scheme for the S&L bailout. I also in serted a timely article  from yesterday's Wall  Street Journal.  I take this opportunity to bring a second arti cle on  the  topic  to  the attention of my col leagues.  It  is  from Thursday's Washington  Post and is by Kathleen Day. The message is  much the same;  if we hide the bailout by re sorting  to off-budget  financing, we  raise  the  cost of the bailout significantly, and I think un necessarily.  And  the  taxpayer will pay  this added cost  because, under the administration's proposal,  the Treasury pays the  interest on  the bonds  ",1989
1,41,3,Mr. PEPPER.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield 2 minutes  to my distinguished  colleague and friend, the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. HALL].  ",1989
2,41,3,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise in support of title I of House  Resolution 84, which  establishes  in  this Congress the Select Committee on  Hunger. This title of the resolution in corporates House Resolution 20,  of  which I am pleased to be an original  cosponsor.  I have been a longtime supporter of  the Select Committee on Hunger, and  I have enjoyed the privilege of chair ing its  international task force since  the Select Committee's inception  in  1984.  Before  the creation of  the Select  Committee  on Hunger,  jurisdiction  over hunger issues was divided among  8 of the 22 standing committees and  numerous subcommittees. Creation of  the Select Committee on Hunger has  provided a single, unified forum for  the consideration of the diverse issues  related to hunger-both domestic and  international.  There  is no question  that hunger  continues to be a critical  issue  that  merits  the special focus of the U.S.  Congress. Each day, 40,000 people die  of hunger and complications related to  severe malnutrition. An estimated 14.6  million people die  from hunger and  malnutrition each year. More than 20  million  people  here  in  the United  States, including 4 million children, go  hungry at some point during  each  month.  Since 1984, the Select Committee on  Hunger has made important contribu tions to the work of the Congress on  issues relating  to both domestic and  international hunger. The record dem onstrates that the Select Committee's  work has complemented that of the  standing committees with jurisdiction  over hunger. As  the Select Commit tee's progress report on its activities in  the  lOOth Congress  indicates,  it has  succeeded  in  directing  attention  to  issues  that might not have  received  such congressional consideration with out its work. There are many exam ples of  this that I could cite, but I  would like to take a moment to high light just a few that were of special in terest to me in the 1 OOth Congress.  Domestically, the Select Committee  made several contributions  to provi sions of the Emergency Hunger Pre vention Act of 1988-Public Law 100435. Hearings by the Select Committee  on Hunger led to legislation which was  incorporated into this law to encour age greater use of farmers markets to  bring nutritious commodities to  low income women, infants, and children.  The Hunger Committee also partici pated in the crafting of provisions of  Public Law 100-435 designed to simpli fy  application  procedures  for  food  stamps, Medicaid, and aid to families  with dependent children CAFDCJ.  I was  especially pleased  that  the  Emergency Hunger Prevention Act in cluded provisions based on my bill to  establish a national gleaning clearing house within the Department of Agri culture. The Select Committee had  been working with me since the 99th  Congress on hearings and legislation  to promote  the gleaning of surplus  farm crops for use in private emergen cy  food  distribution  programs.  signed  into  law,  the gleaning provi sions authorize the Secretary of Agri culture  to provide  technical  aid  to  State and local agencies for encourag ing  public  and  private  nonprofit  agency  involvement  in gleaning pro grams, and for collecting and sharing  information  relating  to gleaning ef forts.  As  chairman of  the  International  Task Force, I am especially pleased by  the contributions made by the Select  Committee to numerous international  hunger issues. In the lOOth Congress, I  had introduced H.R. 1693, the Global  Basic Education Enhancement Act.  Funding provisions of the Foreign Aid  Appropriations Act <P.L. 100-461> re flected the thrust of this bill and of  other basic education activities of the  Select Committee. For  fiscal  1989,  As  there is an earmark of $64. 7 million  for basic primary and secondary edu cation spending by AID. This fallows  an earmark of $42 million  in  fiscal  1988. It is my hope that this type of  funding commitment demonstrates a  growing consensus about the vital role  of basic education in efforts to sustain  development in Third World nations.  Since fiscal 1985, the Select Commit tee has made prominent contributions  to securing increased support for the  Child Survival Fund. Last year,  the  Select Committee called attention to a  disturbing trend in AID's support for  child survival activities: a decline of 20  percent in funding for these activities,  including a 30 percent decline in child  survival spending for African children,  from  fiscal 1987  to  fiscal 1988. The  Select Committee worked with  the  Foreign Operations Subcommittee on  language  in the Foreign Aid Appro priations Act to encourage AID to in crease funding for child survival activi ties-and especially those for African  children-in fiscal 1989  to a  level at  least as high as that of fiscal 1987.  In  the  lOOth Congress,  the Select  Committee on Hunger continued  its  strong support for programs to combat  both  blindness  and  malnutrition  through the increased use of vitamin  A. An earmark of $8 million for AID's  Vitamin A Deficiency Program was in cluded in the fiscal 1989 foreign aid  appropriation.  The Select Committee also support ed initiatives to achieve the worldwide  eradication of Guinea worm disease  and to increase the U.S. commitment  to fight river blindness.  Further, the Select Committee advo cated an earmark of $75 million for  micro-enterprise credit  in  the  fiscal  1989 foreign aid appropriations legisla tion-an amount which ultimately was  approved.  I was pleased to work with Select  Committee  on  Hunger  Chairman  MICKEY LELAND on  legislative  initia tives, such as H.R. 4049,  to promote  the role of women in development. I  also worked with Chairman LELAND on  measures to address food emergencies  in Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia,  Mozambique, Angola, and other Afri can nations.  With  respect  to Ethiopia,  I was  grateful  that 232  of my colleagues  joined as cosponsors of House Concur rent Resolution 237, a resolution I in troduced to encourage early action to  prevent the loss of life in Ethiopia and  other drought-stricken nations in sub Saharan Africa. I also appreciated the  opportunity to work with the gentle woman from New Jersey <Mrs. RouKE MA) on an initiative to urge the Soviet  Union  to use  its  influence with  the  Ethiopian Government to help secure  the delivery of food relief to the needy  in the embattled regions of Ethiopia.  ",1989
3,54,3,Mr. CONTE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in sup port  of  the  resolution  to  reconstitute  the  Select Committee on Hunger. Since its estab lishment,  the select committee has brought  painful and often tragic issues into our nation al  debate.  In doing  so,  it has served  the  Nation and the world.  The  select  committee  has  accomplished  much, both at home and abroad. Its work  is  compassionate and effective. But hunger  in  any form has few easy solutions, and will not  be defeated without consistent effort.  If we  hope in the future to prevent disasters like the  famines  in Ethiopia, Mozambique, and  the  Sudan, and to end the malnutrition and scarci ty that shame our own country, we must rec ognize that the select committee's job is not  over.  The victims of hunger are  not powerful.  They depend on others to be their advocates  and  to help  them escape  their pain. The  select committee has been their advocate and  if it has not found  the solution, it has begun  the search. It gives a chance  for life  to mil lions of people around the world. It gives the  dream of a better future to families throughout  America. I hope every one of my colleagues  will join me in voting to reconstitute the Select  Committee on Hunger.  ",1989
4,54,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise in sup port of House Resolution 84, establishing the  Select Committee on Hunger; the Select Com mittee on Children, Youth, and Families; and  the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and  Control.  With respect to the Narcotics Select Com mittee,  it was created because the Congress  thought it appropriate for there to be a single  committee to address all aspects of the drug  problem.  Unlike  the  standing  committees,  which have fragmented, piecemeal jurisdiction  over drug trafficking and drug abuse, the Nar cotics Select Committee is the only committee  in the Congress that is mandated to devote its  entire efforts to monitoring and overseeing the  complex issues pertaining to the illicit produc tion, trafficking and consumption of drugs. The  committee's  resolution  requires  that  certain  standing committees be  represented on  the  select committee. Thus our Narcotics Commit tee works closely with  the standing commit tees regarding their legislative initiatives in this  area.  As a senior member of the Narcotics Select  Committee and of the Foreign Affairs Commit tee,  I can assure my colleagues that there is  perhaps even a greater need  for a narcotics  committee today than there was at its incep tion. This country is suffering from a drug epi demic. Our Nation is reeling under the impact  of crack, a smokable, highly addictive form of  cocaine, which has brought drug abuse and  drug-related crime and violence  to  terrifying  new  levels. Our  criminal  justice  system  is  overloaded  by  international  drug  criminals,  and our drug treatment centers are swamped  by more requests for help than they can pos sibly meet.  The Narcotics Committee played an  impor tant role  in  researching, developing, and en acting the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and  1988. The Narcotics Committee held exten sive hearings on all aspects of the drug prob lem which were addressed by  the omnibus  drug laws, including provisions relating to drug  abuse education, Federal assistance to State  and  local governments  for narcotics  law en forcement, interdiction, treatment and preven tion programs, and on  international narcotics  control efforts.  In  the  last Congress we made  some  progress in addressing this problem. The 1988  Anti-Drug Abuse Act provides  important new  tools and new resources  for  the war against  drugs. The Congress created  the position of  director of national drug control policy to for mulate and  implement a comprehensive, co ordinated national drug strategy. The antidrug  legislation  included  initiatives  to  combat  money laundering, to end the use of American  made chemicals  in drug production, to esca late our efforts to eradicate and interdict drugs  produced abroad, and to work harder at home  in antidrug education and treatment and reha bilitation. But  there  is still much more  to be  done.  During the last Congress our select commit tee held 25 hearings, including oversight hear ings  to assess  the  implementation of pro grams established under the Anti-Drug Abuse  Act of 1986. If we are reconstituted, the com mittee  intends  to hold a series of oversight  hearings on  the  recently passed 1988 Drug  Act, as well as on the Federal drug strategy to  be promulgated by the ""drug czar.""  Madam Speaker, narcotics  trafficking and  drug abuse have  reached epidemic propor tions, both here in the United States and over seas.  In our Nation alone  illicit drug dealing  represents an estimated $140 billion a year  untaxed activity. Our cities, towns, and school  districts  are  hemorrhaging  under  the  on slaught of drugs. The executive branch's anti drug  activities, with  17 Departments  and  Agencies involved, has resulted in a fragment ed effort. That  is why Congress created a  drug czar-to coordinate  the entire Federal  Antidrug Program. To prevent  the Congress  from being  itself  fragmented  in  the antidrug  effort, the select narcotics committee was cre ated.  No single standing committee has the time,  resources, or expertise to monitor all aspects  of the drug problem, but by working together  the standing committees and  the Narcotics  Select Committee can effectively prod the ex ecutive branch  in  implementing our antidrug  legislation and  in developing a comprehen sive, coordinated drug strategy.  Madam Speaker, as we know, the illicit pro duction, trafficking, and consumption of drugs  are diverse problems that require comprehen sive  full  time attention. Accordingly,  in  an  effort to provide that full time oversight of the  drug problem, I ask that my colleagues vote in  favor of House Resolution 84.  ",1989
5,54,3,Mr. BEREUTER.," Madam Speaker, I urge my  colleagues  to support  reauthorization of  the  Select Committee on Hunger  for  the next 2  years. There has never been more rapid tech nical progress against world hunger and nutri tionally draining  illnesses  such as diarrhea  than  in  the past 5 years since  the Select  Committee on Hunger was created. The rates  of death and disabling illness due to hunger,  malnutrition,  and  related  causes  like  inad equate health knowledge, disease, and unsafe  water supplies are  falling at record speed  in  many parts of the world.  Yet UNICEF's recent report on the State of  the World's Children reminds the world com munity,  including  those  countries  like  the  Soviet Union which have  traditionally done  almost nothing  to support positive develop ment in the Third World, that ""some fourteen  million children are still dying each year from  common illnesses and undernutrition, most of  which could be prevented by relatively simple,  relatively  low-cost methods."" The next  few  years provide an historic opportunity  to con solidate  the gains of  the  last decade and  spread them on a worldwide basis through the  kind of practical leadership and good manage ment that have always been the goal of U.S.  programs in the areas of emergency relief and  development assistance.  The work  of  the Select Committee  on  Hunger in recommending integrated and cost effective  solutions  to  international  hunger  problems has helped  the American people  become  the opinion  leaders of  the world  in  the amazing progress against hunger and dis ease worldwide  during  the  decade of  the  1980s. The creation of AID's Child Survival  Program and support for coordinated action in  food aid and measures to improve the health,  education,  and  productivity of  the  poorest  people in the world are some of the initiatives  the  select  committee  has  encouraged.  UNICEF estimates programs put in place just  since 1980 save the lives of an additional 21/z  million children each year who would have  died but  for  the programs  like  immunization,  oral rehydration  therapy, and growth monitor ing that have been put in place through these  initiatives.  This experience contributes  to a growing  consensus which  is emerging among  leaders  of nations, private voluntary groups, and inter national organizations  like UNICEF and  the  World Health Organization that there is a truly  historic opportunity  in  the decade ahead  to  achieve a minimal level of nutrition and health  for all the people in the world. The American  people and the U.S. Congress have been the  leaders in the fight against world hunger, and  we should continue  to  lead.  I urge my col leagues  to  support  reauthorization  of  the  Select Committee on Hunger so that the anal ysis and care  required  to promote the most  cost-effective approaches  to nutrition  for all  the world's people can continue be part of the  work of this body.  ",1989
6,54,3,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today  in strong support of House Resolution 84,  to  reestablish the Select Committee on Narcotics  Abuse and Control, the Select Committee on  Hunger, and  the Select Committee on Chil dren, Youth, and Families.  It  is essential  for Congress  to act on  the  problems  these select committees  focus on  because it is unclear if the current administra tion will. These three select committees pro vide  important  information and  resources  to  this body, and to this Nation. Problems like il legal narcotics traffic and abuse, hunger, and  child welfare will not go away by themselves,  Congress must continue its efforts to find ef fective solutions.  Representatives  RANGEL,  LELAND,  and  MILLER have provided outstanding  leadership  to  their committees. The most difficult social  problems confronting us  today demand our  ",1989
7,67,3,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, every year, this  time  the American public  is reminded of the  struggle of black Americans in this great coun try of ours. It is Black History Month again.  It seems that all we can recall in the history  of black Americans is the pain, the hardships,  and the constant uphill battle for respect and  acceptance in our own Nation. What is often  overlooked  is  the  fact  that black Americans  have made a solid contribution to the strength  and vitality of America. It has not been all pain  and suffering for us. Our many years of bond age and our clashes  in  the streets against  ",1989
8,80,3,Mr.  POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker,  I want  to  thank  the gentleman  for  this opportunity  to  recognize Black History Month. As a former  history teacher  I'm acutely aware of  the nu merous contributions made by black Ameri cans throughout this Nation's history. I'm also  aware of  the need  to make  those contribu tions more well known and this is one way of  doing that.  My district in the most southern part of Illi nois experienced  the struggle  for civil  rights  like others did during the sixties and early sev enties. That effort of course continues today.  One  the  prominent  organizations  helping  make changes take place is the National As sociation  for  the Advancement of Colored  People, and I would like to thank the Carbon dale Chapter, which serves my entire district,  for its efforts.  Right alongside the more well known names  in black history, Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., Jackie Robinson, are hundreds of  less well-known names, perhaps more quiet in  their diligence, perhaps simply less recognized  for their contributions, great and small.  In my  area we can boast of  three men  from one  town, Centralia, who've made  their mark  for  their contributions and accomplishments.  I'm speaking of Donald McHenry, U.N. Am bassador in the Carter administration, William  Norwood, the first black pilot of United Airlines  who graduated from SIU and now serves on  its board of trustees, and Roland Burris, an other Centralia native and SIU graduate who  as comptroller for the State of Illinois was the  first black elected  to statewide office  in  Illi nois.  These are just a few of the people from my  district who've helped make a difference, and  there are many more on  the way. Not  long  ago  the Carbondale NAACP announced  its  Image Awards,  for contributions  to  the black  community. Dr. Nathaniel Felder,  the director  of planning for computing at SIU, is also local  president of the NAACP. Dr. Felder tells me  the association found  itself in the position of  pointing out areas where lack of effort and in attention were obvious, almost at the cost of  forgetting to recognize those in the community  making positive contributions. Out of this rec ognition sprang the Image Awards. If I might, I  woud  like  to make  the  record  for some of  those recognized.  The  top  Image Award went  to Dr.  John  Guyon, president of Southern Illinois Universi ty-Carbondale. Dr. Guyon was honored for his  courage and integrity, exemplified by his deci sion to place a number of black professionals  in  important positions on campus,  including  vice president for academic affairs, vice presi dent for student affairs, budget director, and a  special position of assistant to  the president  for affirmative action. These are high-profile  and demanding jobs within the university, the  NAACP thought that should not go unrecog nized.  Numerous awards also went to southern Illi nois community members who are  following  the examples of black leaders we're honoring  now and who are setting examples for others  to  follow and  learn about  in  the years  to  come.  The Public Service Award went to the No. 9  Community Development Corporation. No. 9 is  an  old mining  camp which  it would  seem  progress has  left in  its wake. The  leaders in  No. 9 are actively working to bring sewer and  water lines to the community,  fighting for pri mary services so many of us take for granted.  Their example is local, yet still historic.  Mr. Gajeef McNeil was honored for his ef forts in the area of social service. Mr. McNeil  helped organize and direct a number of com munity programs  for  the people of Carbon dale.  Dr. Seymour Bryson was the Image Award  winner  for education. Dr. Bryson  is  the  first  black dean at SIU, and  in  that capacity he's  made it possible for large numbers of minority  students to attend college by admitting them  to his college and assisting with financial sup port.  He also helped sponsor the Chico Vaughn  basketball camp, which I'll talk more about in  a moment.  In the area of religion, Rev. Dan Cross was  recognized for his efforts at bringing a church  to  the community of Colp. Reverend Cross  teaches at  the high  school  in Carbondale,  coaches basketball, and still finds time to start  a church  in an area where hope  is often a  scarce resource.  The Image Award for art went to Ms. Shir lene Holmes, who developed poems,  litera ture, and artistic works for young people in the  black community.  For business,  the  Image Award was given  to Ms. Jean Dorsett-Robinson, president of  Quality of Life Services,  for her work  in  the  local  business  community  providing  health  services for the homebound.  In medicine, the NAACP's Image Award re cipient was Dr. Wrophas Meeks,  the  only  black  radiologist  in  the area, and an active  supporter of numerous community projects, in cluding being president of  the High School  Booster Club.  In athletics, Stephen Bardo was honored for  his contributions on and off  the basketball  court. Stephen, one of the finest athletes ever  from my area,  is a starting guard on the Uni versity of Illinois Basketball Team, which has  been rated  in  the Top 20 all year  long. Ste phen  is a young man able  to negotiate  the  rigors of basketball and academics at one of  the Nation's most prestigious schools, and he  always comes back home to spend time with  impressionable youngsters who find a reliable  role model in his life.  Honorable mention in this category went to  Chico Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, a  recordsetting  high school player and  the all-time  leading  scorer at SIU, recently returned to the univer sity to finish his degree in physical education.  For that, the NAACP wanted to recognize him,  for his determination to overcome some of the  obstacles placed in his way and persevere is  certainly something worth emulating.  I would hope as we  remember  the great  and prominent names, Justice Thurgood Mar shall, James Meredith, James Baldwin, and  Shirley Chisolm, that we would also remember  our local heroes and heroines, who are side  by side with those more prominent names in  shaping our Nation's direction.  Every Member has residents of his or her  district who fit this example. I'm proud to say I  have many. I hope our efforts help us develop  hundreds and thousands more.  ",1989
9,80,3,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  join our colleagues in the celebration of Black  History Month. Every February, America  re flects upon the achievements of its black citi zens and, each year, during  this month we  see how our Nation's character has become  richer and better. When  I entered  the U.S.  House of Representatives in 1955, few would  have envisioned  that a black man could run  for President or serve on the Supreme Court.  These are milestones which are a tribute  to  where we are  in  the  journey  to Dr. King's  ""promised  land."" However, we must remem ber how far we still must go.  America  has made great  strides  toward  racial equality during the 20th century, but we  must continue  to make  them. Eighty years  ago, a group of 60 black and white Americans  founded  the National Association  for the Ad vancement of Colored People.  In  the years  following the founding of the NAACP, America  endured the Great Depression, saw its emer gence as a world power, and witnessed  the  civil rights struggles of the 1950's and 1960's.  From the southern fields to the northern facto ries, day  in and day out, blacks gave  their  sweat, tears, and sometimes their lives to ad vance themselves and improve their lives. Yet,  during this time, the richness of the flourishing  black culture went largely unnoticed by a ma jority of Americans.  In a sense,  this  is what  Black History Month is about; we reflect upon  the black community's contributions to our na tional history and heritage, and look ahead to  the day when we reach  the end of the  long  journey against  racial  injustice and  intoler ance.  As  the NAACP  and  other  organizations  fought  for equality, Americans'  eyes were  opened to the scourge of racism. The sacrific es made by millions of Americans, both black  and white,  to end segregation  in  the United  States were unprecedented. While we do not  know all of their names, we must never forget  these brave men and women who  fought for  ",1989
10,119,3,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President, I rise  to join my colleagues on the Environ ment and Public Works Committee to  stress the need for immediate action  on comprehensive amendments to the  Clean Air Act.  In  past  sessions,  our  committee  made several attempts to make needed  changes in the act. Our efforts were  greeted with outright opposition from  the Reagan administration.  Those years of denial and procrasti nation have made this task much more  difficult. The quality of the Nation's  air has deteriorated.  The costs associated with improving  our air quality have increased greatly  as a result of our inaction during the  1980's. Today, we begin the process of  enacting a comprehensive package of  Clean Air Act amendments.  Clean Air Act amendments are the  No. 1 priority of the committee during  the  lOlst Congress.  These  amend ments will constitute the major envi ronmental vote of this session.  There has been a great deal of dis cussion concerning global warming in  recent months. We can do more to di rectly  address  this problem,  in  the  near term, by enacting clean air legis lation in this Congress.  As the saying goes, ""it takes two to  tango."" For the first time in nearly a  decade, we  have  an  administration  which  is publicly committed  to sup porting enactment of a clean air bill.  We have a .new Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency who  has pledged to work with the Congress  in fashioning Clean Air Act amend ments. This is a positive starting place.  But there is a long road ahead of us.  If we are  to enact a comprehensive  clean air bill, every region of the coun try must be part of our deliberations.  Some of the issues concerning acid  rain are the most divisive of the clean  air debate. I am confident that a solu tion, which takes into account the circumstances of each region of the coun try, can be reached.  Any  compromise  concerning  acid  rain must be neutral with regard to  existing and future coal markets. If we  abandon the polluter pays principle to  assist the cleanup in the Midwest pow erplants,  then  full  credit must  be  given  to  those areas which have ex pended millions of dollars during the  past decade for air pollution controls.  The committee  is open  to sugges tions from all Members of the Senate.  We intended to complete action on the  Clean Air Act amendments during this  Congress.  I urge other Members  to  make their views known.  We  intend  to enact a  strong bill  which addresses this Nation's serious  air pollution problems. We intend to  enact a bill which will give the Envi ronmental  Protection Agency,  and  State and local governments a frame work  to effectively and aggressively  deal with this major threat to the Na tion's public health.  It is  time  for  action. Let us get on with the task.  I urge my colleagues to join with us  in this vital effort.  I thank the Chair.  CLEAN AIR AGENDA  ",1989
11,119,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, the  quality of life and the quality of our  environment are inseparable. We have  made good progress on the quality of  the environment in many areas.  But our progress is being overtaken  by events. In 1970, when the first com prehensive Clean Air Act was signed  into law, Americans registered 108 mil lion cars and drove 900 billion miles.  In 1987, we registered 177 million cars  and drove more than 1. 7 trillion miles,  with no decline in sight.  The U.S. consumes more energy per  gross national product than any other  developed  nation.  This means we  produce large quantities of sulfur di oxide and oxides of nitrogen, even if  consumption were unchanged. Experts  now predict that without further man dated reductions, there will be a about  a 2-million-ton increase in sulfur diox ide emissions by 2000.  Americans felt the consequences of  more  cars  and  inefficient  uses  of  energy last summer.  Health alerts then told residents of  urban areas not  to exercise, warned  older people and those with asthmatic  or pulmonary conditions  to stay  in doors and suggested that small chil dren not play outside.  In the Washington, DC, metropoli tan area last summer, 34 days exceed ed  the occupational standard for air  quality. That means  it would have  been illegal to expose a factory worker  to  the  air Washington  residents  breathed, and children played in, for  over a month last summer.  Recently  released EPA data  indi cates that 15 million more people are  exposed to unhealthy levels of ozone  than they were before  last summer.  This means  that 150 million Ameri cans are  living  in areas where  it  is  often unhealthy just to breathe.  The increasing ozone levels affect all  areas, including so-called clean areas.  At Mount Desert Island on the coast  of Maine, where  nearly  5 million  people come  to escape  the summer  heat of the cities, monitoring stations  reported several violations of the Fed eral air quality standards.  Dr. Morton Lippman, professor of  environmental medicine at  the New  York  University  Medical  Center,  warned in July:  Until  recently we  had  the  impression  things were improving, but what we see this  summer shows us that we are back where  we started from.  Dr. Lippman is right and the EPA  data confirms  this. Despite consider able  progress  in  controlling  some  forms of air pollution, we must do  more.  Paradoxically,  there  is  reason  for  hope. For we have found that just as  neglect of pollution controls means  dirtier air, emphasis on those controls  can mean cleaner air.  Americans are suffering from a man made phenomenon that can be con trolled by man. We have developed the  technologies of control.  We  have  the  resources  to  apply  those  technologies. Until now, what  we have lacked is the political will to  do so. We must now develop that will.  We cannot, with one piece of legisla tion, reach all the factors that contrib ute to dirty air. Nor can we expect any  remedy to be cost free. We must keep  these fundamental facts in mind as we  consider legislation.  Air pollution is not just a  regional  problem, not just an industry problem,  not just something that affects people  in the Los Angeles basin or the North east alone. Air pollution is a national  problem. It affects all of America, and  all Americans.  Experts from every branch of medi cal science have told us that breathing  dirty air is simply not a matter of dis comfort. It impairs the ability of lungs  and blood to carry oxygen. It may per manently damage the lungs.  No one has control over the air he or  she breathes. No one can control the  direction in which pollutants move in  the atmosphere. No one can  isolate  himself from the quality of the air. It  is not a matter of choice, or a con scious assumption of risk.  It is an involuntarily imposed health  threat, affecting everyone. The univer sality of the threat dictates that solu tions must be broadly based.  A solution that penalized one part of  the country, or one segment of indus try, would be unfair and unrealistic.  We  have  an  integrated  national  economy. None of our  regions  can  ",1989
12,132,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield  the floor.  JAPANESE ASSISTANCE TO THE  GOVERNMENT OF BURMA  ",1989
13,132,3,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  to express my gravest concern  about the decision of the Government  of Japan on February 16  to extend  formal recognition to the military gov ernment of Burma, as well as my hope  that Japan will not abandon its com mitment  to  human  rights  in  that  country. I  trust that Japan will not  follow its off er of recognition with an  off er of financial assistance, nor of in creased  economic  ties.  Japan,  and,  indeed, the other nations of Asia and  of the world should continue to with hold assistance from Burma until the  Rangoon regime demonstrates a com mitment to free elections and national  reconciliation. The announcement of  elections in May 1990 is an encourag ing move, but much clearer commit ments are necessary-a cease-fire  in  the civil war so that all Burmese may  participate, freedom for political orga nization by opposition parties, a pre cise election timetable, and a mecha nism for international observation. A  premature offer of aid by Japan will  serve as a reward to the Burmese mili tary for failing to live up to its com mitments, and for brutally suppressing  prodemocratic dissent.  Burma  has  been  in  turmoil  for  nearly a year. A democratic uprising  drove  out  one  government  in  the  spring, and then another. When the  military  took  formal control of  the  government  in  September,  Japan  earned  the world's  admiration  for  withholding assistance from the new  government and demanding democra cy. Burma had clearly become ungov ernable. A civil war has left much of  its outlying provinces in the hands of  ethnic groups fighting for federalism  and democracy, and thousands of civil ians, many of  them university  stu dents, have fled  to border camps. As  many as 3,000 of  their compatriots  never made it, for they were shot by  the military.  I am certain the Japanese Govern ment will recognize that there can be  no profit in investing in Burma. Most  of its unexploited natural resources gems,  teak, oil, and minerals-lie  in  parts of the country where civil war  makes  development  impossible.  Burma's universities  are  closed and  their students are dying of malaria in  border camps, rather than training to  become engineers, doctors, and techni cians. Burmese currency is worthless,  and has been partially supplanted by  jade, precious stones, and opium  in  black market border trading.  I understand that some elements of  the Japanese Government continue to  resist moves  to strengthen  ties with  the Burmese military. Their position  is  commendable and  I  expect  their  voices will be heard. No aid should be  provided, nor should Burma's debt be  renegotiated or interest payments sus pended or forgiven, until democracy is  restored.  Similarly,  the Mitsubishi  group should not continue with  the  construction of  the airport  in Ran goon.  Japan's policy was until days ago a  guiding example of  the proper ap proach to the Burmese crisis. Despite  this  regrettable move,  I  hope  that  Japan's expectations of the Burmese  military regime will be more clearly  defined.  This is a most crucial moment in the  crisis, and a most inopportune moment  for a country as important as Japan to  make such an overture, for at this very  moment  the United Nations Human  Rights Commission is considering the  human rights violations of  the Bur mese regime. The American delegation  will make every effort to highlight the  Burmese tragedy. I trust the Japanese  delegation will join us, for silence on  the part of an Asian democracy would  be interpreted as tacit approval of the  Burmese regime.  Let us, Japan and the United States,  and all other democratic nations, with hold assistance until firm and verifia ble steps are taken to end the killings  in Burma, to restore democracy and to  hold free and fair elections. The val iant protesters of Burma are looking  toward us. We must not and cannot let  them down.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a copy of a letter several of  my colleagues and I sent to the State  Department regarding human  rights  in Burma, and a copy of the State De partment's response, be printed in the  RECORD at this time. I also ask unani mous consent that two recent articles  about human rights  in Burma from  the New York Times be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, January 26, 1989.  Hon. ARMANDO VALLADERES,  Chairman, United States Delegation  to  the  United Nations Human Rights Commis sion, Department of State, Washington,  DC.  DEAR AMBASSADOR v ALLADERES: we  trust  that you will find occasion to bring up the  repression of human rights in Burma when  the U.N. Human Rights Commission con venes in Geneva on January 30th. Specifi cally, we urge that you make every effort to  ensure that a resolution concerning Burma  be considered by  the Commission at  this  year's meeting. As you know, on August 11  of last year the Senate unanimously passed  a resolution <S. Res. 464) that condemned  the military government of Burma and that  called upon the Secretary of State and the  Permanent Representative  to  the United  Nations to encourage the restoration of de mocracy in Burma and to condemn the kill ings and mass arrests committed there.  Last summer, after 26 years of authoritar ian  rule  and  economic  stagnation,  the  people of Burma took to the streets in pro test. Their demands were elemental and  just.  They  sought  free  elections.  Free  speech. An accounting of  the victims of  police  violence. For  a  brief moment  it  seemed they would carry the day. But then  the army cracked down. The military took  formal control of  the state apparatus on  September 18,  and made clear  it would  never share power, nor permit opposition.  Soldiers  fired  into crowds with machine  guns, mortars, and  recoiless  rifles. Thou sands  of  unarmed  demonstrators  were  killed. Over 6,000 civilians, fearing for their  lives, have fled to the Burmese-Thai border.  What is more, the extraordinary display  of brutality in Rangoon and in other cities  last summer has for many years been a com monplace  feature of  the Burmese army's  treatment of ethnic minority peoples living  within Burma's borders. In an August, 1988  report, Amnesty  International  found evi dence of ""a consistent pattern of unlawful  killing  and  ill-treatment of members of  Burma's  ethnic minorities  by  security  forces."" Countless villagers belonging to the  Shan, Kachin, Karen, Palaung, Wa and the  many other minority groups of Burma have  been beaten,  tortured, or killed for  their  suspected allegiance  to government oppo nents. The army has forcibly conscripted  many of them to carry heavy loads down  jungle  trails,  and  to  sweep minefields.  Young Burmans in Rangoon are now being  similarly conscripted, destined to die anony mously in the mud of a rain forest.  All  this has happened  to a people that  have demonstrated a  remarkable faith  in  America and in our capacity for moral be havior. After the passage of S. Res. 464, our  embassy in Rangoon became the focal point  of pro-democracy demonstrations, such that  ",1989
14,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," Well, I am not here to  be a nitpicker or a complainer. I do  not want to use the Finance Commit tee as an example. I am not the rank ing member, and I am not the chair man. The distinguished Senator from  Alaska is absolutely right, that there  is a Joint Committee on Taxation, but  I think it is also fair to point out that  that committee deals with trade, Medi care, Medicaid, Social Security, cata strophic  illness-all  of  those mam moth problems.  The thing that bothers me is that  what happens  is  that by giving an  across-the-board percentage  increase  of 10 percent, basically what you have  done, and I know it shades a little bit,  is to compound inequities.  In other words, if a committee is get ting what you might say is too much,  by giving it 10 percent, you are giving  it 10 percent of $5 million, a lot more  than 10 percent of $2.7 million. I am  not saying the other committees are  starved. I do not think there is a single  committee here than cannot get along  with the amount that the Rules Com mittee has given them. I am not here  to plead for more. I am here to say  that it just appears that we are being  extravagant.  If indeed you are going to so-called  zero budgeting, starting at the begin ning and examining, now, why does  the Labor Committee have to have 124  employees and more money-twice as  much as  the Agriculture Committee  and the Banking Committee? If you  are doing zero budgeting, when does it  start? As I understand, that is a 2-year  budget.  ",1989
15,145,3,Mr. FORD.," That  is correct. They  would start at the beginning, hopefully, of the lOlst Congress, at the over sight hearing.  ",1989
16,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE., The 102d.  ,1989
17,145,3,Mr. FORD.," The 102d;  I am sorry.  We will have oversight and begin to  work methodically and have hearings  periodically, and hopefully at the end  of this Congress, we will be able  to  make  a  recommendation  to all  the  committee chairmen that will be satis factory. It will be irritating to most of  the chairmen.  ",1989
18,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE., No question.  ,1989
19,145,3,Mr. FORD.," I hope that the Senator  respects my reluctance to get into it,  but I intend to do that, and I suggest ed that to every chairman and ranking  member that came before  the Rules  Committee. Yes,  there is a historical  base here, but it is also a base that we  held down for the last 2 years at zero.  Now,  this  year we  are  giving  a  modest 3 percent. When one looks at  the Finance Committee and at all the  costs of the information that is needed  for  the committee,  it has gone up  more than 3 percent. They are absorb ing a great deal of inflationary costs,  and that will be a 4-year period, not  just a 2-year period, because we zero  based them for the last 2 budget years,  and only a modest 3 percent increase  average over the next 2 years. So when  you take the COLA's that all of our  employees are entitled to and you give  that  to  the chairman and  ranking  member to pay both the majority and  minority, then you find yourself in a  little  less  than  3  percent  average  growth over the next biennium.  ",1989
20,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," Well, I do not want to  beat this to death here, but the distin guished Senator from Kentucky men tions 3 percent several times. As I look  at this, this was roughly 10 percent. Is  the Senator saying because it is over 2  years?  ",1989
21,145,3,Mr. FORD.," No. There is a 4.1-per cent COLA that is automatic. That is  the pay increase that all Government  employees received, or Senate employ ees received. Take that 4.1  from  the  10, and it gives you 5.9, and 2 percent  for the next year, and that is a little  over 7. So it is roughly a little better  than 3 percent or average 3 percent  growth over each of  the next years  beyond  their normal pay  raise  that  the Senator's staff,  the  committee  staffs, earn, and other employees are  also entitled to it.  ",1989
22,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," The Senator means  outside of pay, which is the COLA's?  ",1989
23,145,3,Mr. FORD., That is correct.  ,1989
24,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," It is 2 percent or 3  percent, whatever it may be.  ",1989
25,145,3,Mr. FORD., Roughly around 3 per cent average over  the next 2 years  each year.  ,1989
26,145,3,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, will  you yield a second?  ",1989
27,145,3,Mr. FORD., I yield.  ,1989
28,145,3,Mr. STEVENS.," That includes the in crease of cost of training, travel, sub scriptions, everything; at a time when  the cost of living is 4 percent, we are  requiring the committees to hold their  office cost down on an annual basis. I  am sure the Senator understands that.  We  did  limit  the Committees  in  terms of their possible expansion.  ",1989
29,145,3,Mr. FORD.," I might say to the good  Senator we have already started moni toring workload productivity and rank ing for the Senate committees and we  can  tell  the Senator almost  to  the  committee how they rank in produc tivity, how they ranked in workload,  and how  they  ranked  in employees  versus the number of hours spent. So  we are beginning to get into it, and  hopefully we are on the right track  and one that the distinguished Sena tor  from Rhode  Island would agree  with.  ",1989
30,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.,  I believe that prob ably uses my time anyway.  ,1989
31,145,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator has 36 seconds remaining.  ,1989
32,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I com mend the Senator for his efforts  in  this in trying to get some kind of a ra tional, if I might say, basis to establish  on what basis  the budgets are ap proved,  that is,  the workload. It has  obviously got  to be more  than bills  considered or bills. In another commit tee I am on, the Environment Commit tee, something like the clean air bill is  one bill but it is a monstrous bill and  to equate that-",1989
33,145,3,Mr. FORD., You have to take those  by sections. You have various sections  on that bill and have to look at time  spent on hearings and hours of staff  input in order to come up with the  workload  to  substantiate whatever  budgets we look at as it relates to the  zero budgeting procedure.  ,1989
34,145,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Senator CHAFEE's time has expired.  Who yields time?  ,1989
35,145,3,Mr. FORD., I will yield him my time.  ,1989
36,145,3,Mr. CHAFEE.,"  I guess we  are all  going to be here in the 102d Congress,  so I look forward to seeing this zero based budget come into effect because  I think it is the right way to proceed.  I know the chairman has a very dif ficult job. No one comes to him and  says, ""Cut my budget,"" and indeed I  did not.  I appeared before him and,  like a stalwart, I stood for my commit tee budget. Who does not? I guess it is  the  feeling  everybody wants  to be  treated fairly. If something is  to be  had, they want it proportionately, ob viously.  I commend the distinguished chair man and ranking member to look at  this from a fresh look, even though it  is 2 years away. I hope it is successful.  ",1989
37,145,3,Mr. FORD., Let me just say to my  good friend that we  look forward to  his input. We ask him to come before  the committee and testify and to make  a record as it relates to how his feeling  is as to the appropriations or the ap,1989

39,184,3,Mr.  CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  designate the Juan Bautista de Anza  Trail as a component of the National  Trails System. The bill is identical to  legislation  being  introduced  in  the  House  by  Congressman  GEORGE  MILLER.  In 1775, Juan Bautista de Anza, a  second-generation frontier soldier, set  forth from Horcasitas, Mexico to open  up the first overland route to upper  California. Crossing the border near  the city of Nogales, the expedition fol lowed a route north along the Santa  Cruz River past Tucson,  then west ward along the Gila River to Yuma,  and across  the Colorado River back  into Mexico. Reentering  the United  States near El Centro, the expedition  continued northward through Imperi al, San Diego, Riverside, Los Angeles,  Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis  Obispo, Monterey, San Benito, Santa  Clara, and San Mateo Counties, finally  reaching San Francisco in June 1776.  The de Anza expedition proved that  overland travel between the Mexican  province of Sonora and upper Califor nia was possible and resulted in the  initial settlement of San Francisco and  the founding of the presidio and mis sion there.  Pursuant to legislation I sponsored  in  the 98th Congress,  the National  Park Service conducted a  feasibility  study of including the Juan Bautista  de Anza Trail in the National Trails  System. I'm pleased to report that this  feasibility study /environmental assess ment concluded that the de Anza Trail  meets the criteria for designation as a  national historic trail. The study fur . ther found  that there  is substantial  public support for the designation and  that State and local agencies and pri vate organizations are prepared to con tribute their resources to the endeav or.  The bill I am introducing today im plements the recommendations of the  National Park Service study. It desig nates the Juan Bautista de Anza Na tional Historic Trail, comprising ap proximately 1,200 miles from Nogales,  AZ, to San Francisco, CA, and provides  that the trail be administered by the  Secretary of the Interior. The bill also  calls for the Secretary to encourage  the participation of volunteer trail or ganizations  in  the development and  maintenance of the trail.  Mr. President, enactment of this leg islation will give national recognition  to an  important pioneer  route and  commemorate an event significant to  the course of American history and  the settlement of California.  I  ask  unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed at this point in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 465  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

40,184,3,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, Today I  am introducing a bill to address what  has become  a major public health  problem in America-the abuse of ana bolic steroids. And  I  am pleased  to  have the Senator from South Carolina  join me in this effort. Senator THUR MOND  and  I have been working  for  many years  to deal with  the drug  abuse problem, particularly among our  young people.  Young people use steroids not only  because they want to be better ath letes, but also because they want to  look better. What they do not under stand is that steroids have proven ad verse medical consequences. The medi cal problems associated with steroids  include  coronary  artery disease-in cluding  heart  attack  and  stroke,  cancer,  liver  disease,  sterility,  in creased  cholesterol  levels,  stunted  growth  in adolescents, and-in some  rare cases-death. There is also some  limited evidence that steroids can be  psychologically addictive.  Unfortunately, while most  people  think that steroids are only a problem  among the elite circle of world-class  Olympic athletes, steroid abuse perme ates every level of amateur and prof es sional sports. In a recent survey, 7 per cent of the male high school athletes  said they had or were continuing to  use steroids. And it's almost unbeliev able  that 40 percent of  these users  began before the age of 16. Applied  nationwide, it could mean that 250,000  to 500,000 male high school students  are using steroids.  Not  surprisingly,  this  incredible  demand for illicit steroids fuels an un derground  black market  that  has  become a $400  to $500 million indus try. And in an ominous trend, profes sional drug traffickers have been lured  by these profits and are beginning to  push a new set of poisons upon our  children.  Last year, I added an amendment to  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 that  increased the penalty for illegal distri bution of steroids from a misdemeanor  to a  felony, punishable by up  to 3  years imprisonment.

41,223,3,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President,  acts of terrorism appear to be on the  rise  throughout  the world. Far  too  often in the news we learn of new ter rorist actions taking the lives of inno cent and unsuspecting people. While  most of these incidents occur abroad,  often their impact is felt thousands of  miles away from the crime itself, and  we are reminded that no one is com pletely isolated or insulated from ter rorism. The  recent bombing of Pan  Am flight 103 clearly shows us  just  how far-reaching the effects of terror ism can be.  Unfortunately, a number of my con stituents  in  Connecticut  recently  learned about the power and potency  which terrorism has, even to those not  directly involved in the incident.  A few weeks ago, Patrick Finucane  was killed in his home in Belfast. Ac cording  to  reports,  three Protestant  paramilitaries broke  into his home,  shot him  twice  in  the stomach and  once in the head, and then proceeded  to shoot his wife in the leg. Tragically,  this whole incident was witnessed by  their three young children.  Patrick Finucane was an attorney in  Northern  Ireland who  represented  people of all religious affiliations. Al though he was a Catholic, he showed  no  preference  to  Catholics  over  Protestants. In fact, Patrick had a rep utation for being apolitical. His recent  decision to represent a member of the  IRA appears to have precipitated his  death. Even  though Patrick  treated  this case like so many he had taken up  before, apparently others did not ap prove of his work.  Patrick Finucane was killed for pur suing the duties and responsibilities of  his profession. The right of an attor ney to represent a client is fundamen tal right in modern day democratic so cieties. Those who decided  that Mr.  Finucane must die for his professional  pursuits not only infringed upon his  civil  rights, but also needlessly  took  the life of a good and decent man.  This  deplorable  incident  brings  home  the  senseless violence  taking  place between Protestants and Catho lics in Northern Ireland today. Cases  of human rights abuses and killings  are pervasive in this war-torn country.  Needless killings and injuries occur to  the innocent citizens of Northern Ire",1989
42,249,3,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Speaker, once again, a  national publication has declared what  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  people I represent have known all along, the  city of Birmingham. symbolizes  the best of  what  the New South has  to offer. With  its  ever-growing economy and cultural diversity,  Birmingham  combines  that  bustling  energy  and driving heartbeat of a big city with  the  warmth,  friendliness, and easy-going manner  of small-city life.  The February 6, 1989,  issue of Newsweek  spotlights Birmingham as  the ""perfect"" place  to  live.  It describes ""The Magic City"" as ""a  friendly, prosperous city  feeding on a high tech blend of biomedical research, engineer ing, and telecommunications."" It notes particu larly the vital  importance of the University of  Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center  to  employment and economic growth, as well as  the  ""fast-growing"" Southern Research  Insti tute, a $40 million nonprofit laboratory.  The article cites  the diversity of  the city,  saying,  ""In all,  some 67,000 service-sector  jobs have been created  in  the Birmingham  area over the past decade-a 27-percent in crease."" Yet,  ""while economic development  has brought excitement to the town, residents  still praise Birmingham as a great place  to  relax.""  So, whether its ""good jobs or good fishing,""  as  the  article  concludes,  Birmingham  has  something  for  just about everyone. With  its  southern hospitality economic base, Birming ham  is  the kind of city  that attracts exactly  what it has to offer, the best and the brightest,  and all of its residents are mighty proud.  TRIBUTE TO AL LARAMORE  HON. C. THOMAS McMILLEN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 1989  ",1989
43,249,3,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to pay tribute to a man who dedi cated his life to the youth of Annapolis, MD.  Who,  through his commitment to excellence,  reenforced our belief in striving for the best. Al  Laramore, affectionately known as  ""Big Al,""  was a longtime teacher and coach at Annap olis High School. His untimely death on Janu ary  i o of  this year, at  the age of 53, cuts  short a coaching career unrivaled  in  its suc cesses.  Mr. Laramore joined the staff at Annapolis  High after graduation from West Virginia Wes leyan University. Over  the years he  led  the  ""Fighting Panthers"" to a 156-68 record over  23 football seasons and registered more than  100 victories  in basketball, securing a State  championship in 197 4 along the way. In 1983  and 1984 his  lacrosse  teams won State  re gional  championships-the highest  level  of  competition available at the time.  Coach  Laramore was  a  respected  rival  known for getting the most from his players but he gave  the most as well. He was a  deeply religious man and a longtime member  of  the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. His  presence will be sorely missed at Annapolis  High, but his memory will live on.  I'm sure you will  join me  in  this well-de served tribute to Coach Laramore and  in ex tending condolences to his family and friends.  3037  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L.  WALKER  HON. JOSEPH M. McDADE  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 1989  ",1989
44,249,3,Mr. MCDADE.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  pay tribute to a former constituent whose un heralded  work may  have  pioneered  the  present equal employment opportunity  laws  which prohibit discriminatory questions in  job  applications and interviews.  Robert L. Walker, a former computer expert,  consultant, and engineering recruiter, drafted  a legislative bill of rights for equality [BORE] in  the  late 1960's to minimize various types of  employment discrimination that existed at that  time. The comprehensive JOB BORE proposal  contained a number of specific proposals on  unfair preemployment questions which eventu ally became law. Walker's proposals on elimi nating  or  restricting  questions  relating  to  height and weight, marital  status,  national  origin, citizenship, family situations and mem bership in organizations are nearly identical to  current law.  Walker's proposal originated from his expe rience in the early 1950's when he supervised  an  industrial employment operation. While re cruiting engineers, he noticed a prevalence of  questions on employment application blanks  which he  felt violated  the applicant's privacy  and were  irrelevant  to prospective  job per formance. The information gained from these  unnecessary questions could be used to elimi nate job applicants on the basis of stereotyp ing and discrimination.  For example, Walker  felt  that questions  about the number of children an applicant had  could bias an employer against hiring  that  person. He proposed  that questions on  the  number of dependents not be allowed on pre1 iminary or supplementary employment appli cations. Current  law allows an  interviewer to  ask whether an applicant has responsibilities  that would interfere with specific work sched ules, but not about dependents, children, or  child care plans.  Walker submitted his legislative proposal to  the Wisconsin Congressman who represented  him at the time. The BORE plan was subse quently brought to the attention of the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission. Later,  many of Walker's ideas were incorporated into  public law.  Before his death  newspaper reporter,  Everybody likes to receive credit for his  work, particularly when it is done voluntari ly on one's own time. However, the impor tant  thing at this  time  is  the knowledge  that, due to my efforts, millions of people  have  the  legal machinery available  to re dress grievances  in situations where  they  feel  they have been subjected to employ ment discrimination or unwarranted  inva sion of privacy.  Mr. Walker's selfless work to correct an in justice is deserving of the highest praise. His  legislative  initiative shows  that one person  truly can make a difference. His widow, Helen  Walker, brought her late husband's efforts to  my attention  last  fall, and  I am pleased  to  in 1985, Walker  told a  ",1989
45,262,3,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  in troducing a  revised version of House Joint  Resolution 462,  legislation I introduced in the  1 OOth Congress  to  reform  the War Powers  Resolution  Secretary of State Baker proposed recently  that Congress and  the administration  ""agree  to disagree"" over the constitutionality of the  War Powers Resolution. He  advocated  a  ""gentleman's agreement""  in  its place, pre sumably one that would allow the President to  pursue any military adventure he chooses, so  long as he chats with a  few congressional  leaders first.  The Constitution charges the President with  the responsibility to ""take care that the laws  be faithfully executed."" The War Powers Res olution is the law of the land. It is not for the  President or his officers to rule on the consti tutionality of a law;  that question  is reserved  to the courts. There has never been a judicial  determination  of  the  validity  of  the War  Powers Resolution. Until  there  is,  the Presi dent is obliged to fulfill its requirements to the  best of his ability. That's the theory. Unfortu nately, it hasn't worked that way in practice.  ",1989
46,288,3,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, it is always inspiring  to watch the outstanding achievements of our  next generation. One such inspiration is a 22year-old St. Louis native named Erik McMillan.  Erik  is earning a  reputation as an up-and coming National Football League star. After  an explosive year as a rookie defensive back  for the New York Jets, the Associated Press  named him  the National Football League's  Defensive Rookie of the Year.  Erik McMillan  follows a  family  tradition of  excellence in sports. His father, Ernie McMil lan  is a  former  standout Cardinal  football  player and his uncle Shellie achieved national  acclaim as Sweet Charlie Brown, a snappy  dribbler for the Harlem Globetrotters.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to con gratulate Erik McMillan on his  fine perform ance and  to wish him every continued suc cess.  I am also happy to share with my col leagues a sampling of press reports about the  triumphs of Erik McMillan.  [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch]  JETS' McMILLAN MAKES HIS MARK IN NFL  DEBUT  (By Dan Caesar>  Whether he's playing  in  the defensive  backfield for the New York Jets or roaming  the streets of the nation's largest city, Erik  McMillan suddenly finds himself thrust into  a new and unfamiliar situation.  Last year, McMillan was the top defensive  player at the University of Missouri, where  he had more unassisted tackles < 203 > than  anyone  else  in  the  team's history. This  season, he is one of two rookies starting in  the Jets' defensive backfield. And he has  discovered it is a  long way from Columbia,  Mo., to New York City-both on and off the  field.  ""This city has  tons of people, and half  don't even know what  they're doing or  where  they are,"" McMillan said. ""I don't  like New York. It's not my style of living.  I'm just here to play ball. At least I don't  have to live here after the season.""  But this fall, he's a New York City area  resident. And McMillan, son of former Car dinals tackle Ernie McMillan, has taken ad vantage of the Jets' desire to revamp what  was a porous defense. He started at free  safety Sunday in the Jets' 28-3, opening-day  loss at New England, and  received high  marks  for his performance. The Patriots  threw two touchdown passes, both to Irving  Fryar-who beat veteran cornerback Bobby  Humphrey each time.  ""Erik played  real well,"" Jets secondary  coach Mike Faulkiner said. ""The only knock  was that he dropped one ball that was right  in his hands that he should have intercept ed.  It hit him  right  in  the  chest and  bounced off.  I  told him  that  if  it was a  bullet, he would have been shot dead.""  But Faulkiner said  that was about  the  only thing he could say negative about Mc Millan's debut  in  the National Football  League.  ""We had him doing a lot of things,"" Faul kiner said. ""We play a 4-3, and we had him  at linebacker some of the time, where he  came up and played the run. He never had  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to cover a receiver one on one, but he did  cover the running backs that way sometimes  and did a fine job. We even sent him in on a  blitz a time or two.""  That is an unusually diversified role for a  rookie, especially one playing  in his  first  regular-season game.  ""We asked him to do things other defen sive backs don't do,"" Faulkiner said. ""He  does a lot more than a rookie is expected to  do. But I don't really consider him a rookie  anymore. He's played  in  four  preseason  games, one  regular-season game and  two  scrimmages. That's seven games, almost as  much as a full college season.""  The Jets have big hopes for McMillan,  who Faulkiner said was in for all 71 of the  Jets' defensive plays Sunday. They like his  speed, versatility and perhaps most of all,  his aggressiveness.  ""I don't want this to sound wrong, but  he's an intimidating hitter and he's the kind  of hitter that it could be another Darryl  Stingley  situation with  him,""  Faulkiner  said. Stingley was a New England receiver  who was left paralyzed by a hit from Oak land's Jack Tatum in 1978.  ""Erik's leverage when he hits somebody is  something else,"" Faulkiner said. ""I don't  mean to sound bad, but he could be deadly.  He's a weapon.""  But after one pro game, McMillan hasn't  developed  that  reputation  yet. And  he  knows the workload will increase as oppos ing quarterbacks zero in on seeing if he and  fellow rookie James Hastey, who plays right  cornerback, can handle their jobs.  ""We'll get all the work we'll need,"" McMil lan said. ""They'll be testing us a  lot. I'm  ready for that. I enjoy the aggressive part  of the game. And we'll be getting lots of on the-job training.""  At Mizzou, McMillan played cornerback,  weak safety, and strong safety. But he said  he never had the responsibility he does now.  For the Jets, McMillan runs the defensive  backfield. He  calls plays,  and barks out  alignment assignments.  When told of what his son did Sunday,  Ernie McMillan was not happy. Erik made  four unassisted tackles and was in on three  other tackles. The seven tackles in which he  was involved was the most for anyone in the  defensive backfield.  ""I hate to hear that,"" Ernie said. ""That's  way too many for someone in the backfield  to be in on. That doesn't speak too well of  what's up front <on the defensive line>.""  Erik is following in this father's path in  more ways than one. Besides both being in  the NFL, Ernie also started his first game  when he was a rookie in 1961 and then went  on to become an All-Pro during his 14-year  playing tenure with the Cardinals.  ""Everything fell into place for me,"" Ernie  said. ""<Kenneth> Panfil got hurt and I got  the job right off the bat. Then Erik gets to  start right away, too-that's nice.""  But not too nice.  ""I really hope everything works out for  him, because that's an awesome responsibil ity he has there,"" the elder McMillan said.  ""To  jump  right out  there,  especially at  safety, is a big load for somebody still learn ing.""  And McMillan knows his son will receive  plenty of early tests.  ""He's playing in a passing division, with  <Miami's Dan) Marino and <Buffalo's Jim)  Kelly,"" Ernie said. ""He's going to have to  learn to be careful not to settle back at free  safety and get lulled when they do a run ning play or two and then not protect the  guy coming across the middle. It's a tough  assignment.""  February 28, 1989  But both father and son are excited about  Erik's situation.  ""I talked to him right before the game,  and I had a hard time settling him down,""  Ernie  said.  ""He was  talking  so  fast,  I  couldn't slow him down.  I knew he was  pretty pumped up.""  And Erik said he knows his dad is exhila rated about the situation.  ""He's really  fired up,"" Erik said. ""He's  given me a lot of advice over the years, and  it's nice to be able to attain this level. We're  proud of each other.""  Missouri coach Wood Widenhofer thinks  McMillan can end up as a star in the NFL.  ""Erik has all  the  tools  to be a  great  player,"" Widenhofer said. ""He is, as far as  athletic ability, right up there with the big  time. He's the kind of guy you build a de fense around. He was our big-play man all  last year.""  McMillan was  ecstatic when  the  Jets  drafted him, in the third round. He quickly  discovered that he had a legitimate shot at  starting as a rookie, because the Jets were  searching for a way  to  tighten a defense  that ranked 20th in the league in pass de fense last year.  ""I didn't want to ride the bench,"" McMil lan said. 'Tm just fortunate enough that  the Lord has been behind me and put me in  a good situation. It's really a learning expe rience. I'm trying to pick up what I can.  ""I just have a lot more calls to make than  I did in school. The players are about the  same size, but the  tempo  is  taken up an other notch. It's more intense.""  McMillan also will be keeping one eye on  the fortunes of Mizzou's football team this  fall. It seems that he is blind to Mizzou in  the other eye.  ""I think they'll do better because  they  have a lot of returning players on defense,  but I don't know anything about  the of fense,"" he said. ""Never did. I didn't pay any  attention to the offense when I was there,  so  I  really don't know anything about  it  now.""  McMillan knows  plenty  about defense,  however. He was burned his share of times  at Mizzou, but he also returned three inter ceptions for touchdowns last season, tying a  National  Collegiate Athletic Association  record.  ""I  really  think he can be a  good pro  player,"" his father said. ""I know he has the  athletic ability. If he can put everything  else together, he'll go far.  ""It's a tough thing, though. Believe me, I  know. But he has the ability to be some thing special.""

47,301,3,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker,  I'd  like  to add my support  for House Joint  Resolution 22,  ""Federal Employees Recogni tion Week."" The week, March 6-13, marks a  time when we can pay special  tribute  to a  group of people that get far less praise than  they deserve.  There are 3 million Federal employees  in  this Nation-more than 50,000  living  in  the  Fourth Congressional District. The tasks these  people perform often go unnoticed by us, but  are vital to the operation of important services  we  depend  on  everyday:  the  handling  of  Social Security checks; monitoring  the skies  over airports; and patrolling our shores in de fense of the Nation. We have come to depend  on these services, but often forget that there's  a person who must do each and every task.  These unsung heroes of the Nation deserve  a national thank you and a week to recognize  their  effort.  Their  job  requirements  often  demand  them  to go above and beyond  the  call of duty. One group estimated that every  year Federal employees donate between $600  and $800 million in uncompensated overtime.  This, at a time when  their pay and benefits  are often  reduced. Two years ago Federal  employees' pay was  temporarily  frozen and  retirees received no cost-of-living adjustment  [COLA]  for  inflation.  This  year  President  Bush's budget  is proposing a similar 1-year  freeze on COLA's for Federal and military re tirees as a means  to balance  the budget.  These public servants are not the ones who  should be expected to pay for the excessive  budget deficits run up over the last 8 years.  Federal employees have contributed more  than their share to the growth and betterment  of America. Since 1945, 38 Nobel Prizes  in  medicine or physiology have been won by  people employed by  the Government or  re ceiving Government support. It was a Census  Bureau accountant who was  responsible  for  one of the early breakthroughs in computers,  and a Department of Defense scientist who  developed the first integrated circuit.  Our Nation cannot begin to repay the debt  to Federal employees and retirees. Their self less service often goes unnoticed-but not  this week. This week we pay tribute to these  unsung heroes-a tribute that's long overdue.  ",1989

51,301,3,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 33  other Members from both parties, including 18  from California,  I am  introducing  today a bill  which  treats semiautomatic assault weapons  in exactly the same manner as current law for  full automatic machineguns.  Assault weapons are not traditional hunting  weapons. Assault weapons have no practical  value to a civilized society.  If anyone can  tell me why the AK-47, the  Uzi,  the MAC-10,  the TEC-9 shouldn't be  treated  in  the same way  that  full automatic  machineguns, please come forward.  Our pragmatic approach bans the future im portation and domestic manufacture of a spe cific list of semiautomatic assault weapons, in cluding the AK-47, the Uzi,  the MAC-10, the  TEC-9 and  several other assault weapons  recommended as  the weapons of choice of  drug dealers, violent criminals, and  terrorists.  Current  ownership  is  grandfathered,  with  future purchasers required  to go through the  same steps as  those  for  fully automatic ma chineguns: a background check and approval  from  local police, registration of the weapon,  and payment of a $200 transfer tax.  These assault weapons are  found  in  the  cities of Beirut, Tripoli,  and  Johannesburg.  They shouldn't be the drug dealer's weapons  of choice the cities of Los Angeles, Oakland,  or even Des Moines, IA.  Assault weapons are weapons of war; as sault weapons are the weapons of drug deal ers and violent criminals,  they are the weap ons of terrorists and psychopaths.  Enough  is enough. It  is  time  to close  the  loophole in the law and stand by the side of  law enforcement, before more psychos mow  down the next schoolyard.  THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET  ",1989

53,301,3,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  talk  today about  the budget  submitted by the President. My talk  will be incomplete because the budget  is incomplete.  The  first  thing  that ought  to be  noted is that George Bush began his  term with the most extraordinary re fusal  to exercise  the powers of  the  Presidency that we have seen in a long  time. Many of us became, in 8 years,  accustomed to Ronald Reagan insist ing on his right as President to exer cise  the prerogatives of  that office.  Indeed, many conservatives who were  once critics of the excessively powerful  Presidency that they thought began  with  Franklin Roosevelt, many  of  these conservatives during the 1980's  were critical of what they argued were  congressional intrusions on legitimate  Presidential prerogatives.  It was very surprising, the ref ore, to  have George Bush begin his govern ance by submitting to us a budget in  which he resolutely refused to tell us  how he thinks a substantial amount of  the Federal money ought to be spent.  He is clear in some things. President  Bush is clear that we should increase  military spending this year in dollars  sufficient to meet inflation, which is a  far larger increase than he grants to  almost any other part of the Federal  budget.  President Bush was also clear that  we should cut  the Medicare budget  which provides funds for the sick el derly by $5 billion, a cut which I be lieve unwise, which will clearly, in my  judgment, have adverse consequences  on the elderly who are sick, and on  those who try to care for them.  But when it comes to the great bulk  of programs that the Federal Govern ment deals with, education, the envi ronment,  housing,  transportation,  a  number of programs in that general  Government area, many of which are  quite important in carrying out social  purposes, purposes to which the Presi dent  pays  allegiance, George Bush  sent us the unbudget. What the Presi dent said was here is the amount that  I think we have to cut, and it is a very  substantial cut, and here are some pro grams. Now Congress, I am not going  to tell you how much I think should  be spent on any of them. I am only  going to tell you in general that they  ought to be cut.  Mr. Speaker, it is a  failure of the  most egregious sort on the part of the  President to exercise his constitutional  and statutory responsibilities, and  it  ",1989

72,327,3,Mr. SPECTER.," I  thank the distin guished ranking member for yielding  me the time.  Mr. President, I congratulate Presi dent Bush on his selection of Dr. Louis  W. Sullivan as Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health  and Human  Services, and I am pleased to express  my support and vote for his confirma tion today.  Dr. Sullivan is well-qualified for the  position of Secretary of Health and  Human Services, as reflected in his im pressive  list of accomplishments and  experiences. In July 1975, the 41-year old physician became  the  founding  dean and director of the Medical Edu cation Program at Morehouse College  in Atlanta, GA. He was named  the  first president and dean of the More house School of Medicine when  it  became independent from the college  in 1981.  Before  joining the Morehouse Col lege faculty, he held diverse teaching  and administrative positions. Dr. Sulli van began his academic career as an  instructor of medicine at the Harvard  Medical School from 1963 until 1964.  He later served at the National Insti tutes of Health and as an attending  physician  in Jersey City, NJ. From  1966 through 1975, Dr. Sullivan held  various positions at Boston University  School of Medicine and Hospital  in cluding those of professor of medicine  and physiology and professor of nutri tion. Certainly this wide range of ex perience will serve him well as Secre tary for Health and Human Services.  In addition, Dr. Sullivan belongs to a  number of medical and scientific soci eties, including the American College  of Physicians, where he is a member  of the Health Care Financing Subcom mittee. He also holds many advisory  and  consulting  positions,  including  membership  on  the Robert Wood  Johnson Health  Policy  Fellowship  Board of the National Academy of Sci ences and membership on the Adviso ry Committee  to the Harvard-Massa chusetts Institute of Technology Divi sion of Health and Technology, Dr.  Sullivan has conducted numerous re search projects that include studies on  vitamins and the effects of alcohol on  certain health conditions.

73,340,3,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I con gratulate President Bush on his selec tion of Adm. James D. Watkins as Sec retary  of  the U.S. Department  of  Energy, and I am pleased to express  my support and vote for his confirma tion today.  Admiral Watkins is well qualified for  the position of Secretary of Energy, as  reflected in his impressive list of ac complishments  and  experiences. On  June 30, 1982, Admiral Watkins was  selected  by  President  Reagan  to  become the 22d Chief of Naval Oper ations. He retired from that post on  June 30, 1986, and entered civilian life  after 41 years of service  to the U.S.  Navy.  While serving in the Navy, Admiral  Watkins held a number of assignments  at sea aboard nuclear powered vessels,  in addition to shore assignments asso ciated with  the selection, education,  and training of personnel. He also su pervised  the maintenance and oper ations  of  naval  nuclear  propulsion  plants.  After receiving his master's degree  in mechanical  engineering, Admiral  Watkins was selected by Adm. Hyman  G. Rickover to enter the Navy's nucle ar-powered  submarine  program  in  1959. In the early 1960's, Admiral Wat kins went on to serve as an assistant to  Admiral Rickover for 3112 years at his  headquarters in Washington, DC. He  then served as Director of the Office  of Chief Naval Personnel's Nuclear  Power Distribution Branch.  Subse quently, as Chief of Naval Personnel  and Vice Chief of Naval Operations,  Admiral Watkins continued his leader ship role as principle adviser  to  the  Chief of Naval Operations and Secre tary of the Navy on safe and efficient  operations of the Navy's nuclear-pow ered fleet.  In addition, Admiral Watkins' mili tary decorations  include several Dis tinguished Service and Legion of Merit  medals, the Bronze Star with combat  ""V"" and other medals, and campaign  and service ribbons.  In October 1987, Admiral Watkins  was appointed Chairman of the Presi dential Commission on the Human Im munodeficiency Virus [AIDS] Epidem ic,  and  submitted  the Commission's  final  report  to President Reagan on  June 24, 1988. For his work on this  Commission, he was awarded an hon orary doctor of humane letters from  the New York Medical College in June  1988.  Certainly his wide range of experi ences will serve him well as Secretary  of Energy.  I am confident that Admiral Wat kins will be an effective leader on the  many  important  issues addressed by  the Department of Energy.  I support the nomination of Admiral  Watkins to this post. If confirmed by  the Senate, as I am sure he will be, I  have every confidence that he will per form the new duties with exceptional  skill, as he has other positions in the  past.  ",1989
74,340,3,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I am  very proud to speak on behalf of Mr.  Watkins this afternoon as we vote on  his  confirmation  as  Secretary  of  Energy. He is an extremely fine man.  One  that  I  have visited with,  and  shared many goals and ideas with, and  I greatly look forward to working with  him.  Jim Watkins brings great capabili ties in management and leadership. He  demonstrated these skills magnificent ly as he worked for our country on the  Presidential  Commission  on AIDS.  And now he comes to us to be at the  helm of an agency that will make so  many crucial decisions and policies for  our Nation in the years to come. He  must help us develop an energy policy  that cleans up  the problems of  the  past, and yet continues to give incen tives  for America  to build a  future  that is energy  independent, healthy,  and safe.  Jim Watkins brings great experience  and expertise to the arena of nuclear  energy. He has pledged to focus on the  very serious problems with regard to  cleanup of  commercial and nuclear  waste and putting our nuclear defense  ",1989
75,366,3,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with my colleague from  the Appropriations Committee, Sena tor KASTEN, as well as many other Sen ators, in introducing this bill to deal  with the refugee crisis that has devel oped in our program for Soviet refu gees.  An emergency situation has now de veloped in the flow of Jewish refugees  and others from the Soviet Union. The  number  suddenly  being  allowed  to  leave  the Soviet Union will nearly  double the total last year, and will be  50 percent more than was budgeted or  planned for this fiscal year.  During the President's consultations  with  the Judiciary Committees  last  September,  on  refugee  admissions  under the terms of the Refugee Act,  the administration proposed a ceiling  for the Soviet Union of 18,000 which  was increased to 25,000  in December,  after emergency consultations. But, at  the rate of the current flow of Soviet  refugees,  those numbers will be ex hausted by the end of this month. No  funding will be available, and the pro gram will come to a halt.  Clearly, we have a humanitarian as  well as a foreign policy interest in re sponding to this emergency. As chair man of the Subcommittee on Immigra tion and Refugee Affairs of the Judici ary Committee, we are prepared to use  the emergency provisions of the Refu gee Act to provide the additional ad mission numbers, but this is only half  the problem. The equally  important  other half  is  adequate  funding  for  their processing and resettlement. If  additional  funding  is not  found by  next month, refugees will be  turned  back, left to languish in Rome at great  cost in care and maintenance, and the  voluntary agencies involved in the pro gram will be forced to close down.  We are introducing a bill to deal with  this crisis by drawing on already ap propriated funds that tl}e administra tion proposes to rescind. The fund is  the State  legalization  impact assist ance grants created and funded by the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  of 1986. The administration proposes  to rescind $300 million of this fund in  fiscal year 1990 and again  in  fiscal  year 1991. Furthermore, for fiscal year  1989,  of  the $665 million  available  under the SLIAG Program, CBO re ports that less than $70 million will  probably be actually spent.  We propose to shift $150 million of  these available funds  to support the  processing and resettlement of an ad ditional 25,000 Soviet Jews and other  refugees-the number estimated that  will be moving through the end of this  fiscal year. This will cover the costs of  their processing and resettlement by  the voluntary  agencies,  as well  as  State and local costs.  Clearly, longer term solutions must  be found  to deal with Soviet migra tion. But if we do not respond now to  this emergency, we will be turning our  backs  to  our  longstanding  commit ment to assist Soviet refugees.  Mr. President,  in  introducing  this  legislation,  it  is  not my  intent  to  hamper the efforts of States to assist  beneficiaries of  the recent  immigra tion amnesty through the State Legal ization Impact Assistance Grant Pro gram. State expenses reimbursed by  the program to date have been so low  that the President has proposed a $300  million rescission in each of the next 2  years.  It is my intent to make it easier-not  harder-for States to have access  to  the SLIAG Program for the legitimate  expenses. And  I  am  committed  to  making the adjustments  to the pro gram which many States are currently  seeking, as well as to pursuing for the  future  any  additional  funding  to  States as a result of our emergency re sponse to Soviet emigration.  To this end, I am introducing today  separate legislation as a starting point  for  discussions  regarding  needed  changes in the SLIAG Program.  Let me also note that this emergen cy response is the result of a healthy  partnership between the Federal Gov ernment and the private sector. Orga nizations involved in the resettlement  of refugees  from  the Soviet Union  have launched tremendous fund-rais ing efforts of their own to match the  funds we propose to appropriate to the  program.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of  the bill be printed at this point in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.489  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That (a) of  the unobligated funds appropriated by sec tion 204(a)(l) of the Immigration Reform  and Control Act of 1986 <relating to State  Legalization Impact Assistance Grants)< 1) $50,000,000 are hereby transferred to  the Director of the Office of Refugee Reset tlement of the Department of Health and  Human Services  for use only  for grants  under  the ""Voluntary Agency Programs""  and for grants to States authorized by sec tion 412 of the Immigration and Nationality  Act <relating  to domestic resettlement of  and assistance  to  refugees) and for such  other assistance authorized by such section  as the Director may deem necessary; and  (2) $150,000,000 are hereby transferred to  the account under the Department of State  entitled ""United States Emergency Refugee  and Migration Assistance Fund"".  <b> Amounts transferred under subsection  (a)< 1 > shall be administered  in accordance  with all the laws, rules, and regulations ap plicable to the accounts to which the funds  were transferred, except that the dollar lim itation on appropriated funds contained in  ",1989
76,392,3,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, today I call my  colleagues' attention to a cultural exchange of  a different sort. Seventh  to ninth graders at  John Wilson Junior High School  in Brooklyn  will venture to Emerson Junior High School in  Pomona, CA.  This trip is the rewarding culmination of a 2year  correspondence  between  these  two  schools,  a period  in which  letters,  photo graphs,  reports, and even videos were ex changed. Nine students and their teacher, Ro berta Weiss, will  spend  10  days at  their  ""buddy school""  in California attending class es,  living with host  families, and  recording  their trip on video.  It is a long way from Brooklyn to Pomona  and  it is a tribute to the imagination of John  Wilson Junior High School and the concern it  has for its students, that it is providing them  with the opportunity to spend 10 days in a dif ferent environment.  John Wilson Junior High School  is a 950student school  in  the Canarsie  section of  Brooklyn.  Its student body reflects  the com munity's  diverse  ethnic  and  economic  makeup. The school offers a full range of edu cational programs including programs for the  physically  handicapped  and  for gifted  stu dents. John Wilson Junior High School  is a  magnet school  for  telecommunications. The  school possesses a studio  in which  it pro duces a weekly  television show,  ""Next Stop  Canarsie.""  The  video  the  students of  the  school will film during their trip to Pomona will  subsequently be aired on  the school's televi sion show.  I am pleased  to have  this opportunity  to  extend a warm Brooklyn greeting  to  the ex change  students  from Pomona when  they  arrive in Brooklyn. Although New York is dif ferent  from California,  I am certain  that  the  sights  like  Seaview  Park  and  Flatlands  Avenue that Brooklyn has to offer will not be  lost on these young Californians.  Mr. Speaker, while I appreciate that this ex change is not an extraordinary occurrence, in  a  time when  the  rhetoric of education and  ",1989
77,405,3,Mr. JOHNSTON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  today I ask for your support of a private bill I  am  introducing  for  relief of Sgt.  James B.  Stanley. While I am aware that the vast major ity of private bills do not gain passage,  I sin cerely believe this case warrants congression al action.  Sergeant Stanley was one of  the military  men unknowingly involved in LSD experiments  during the 1950's. He had volunteered to test  gas masks  for  the Army and was  instead  slipped LSD  repeatedly  in his drinking water  without his consent. He began to hallucinate,  lost his career  in  the Army, was at intervals  violent toward  family members, and his mar riage eventually failed.  It was not until 1975  that the Army finally informed him of his expo sure to LSD, and that the origin of his mental  illness and bizarre behavior became evident to  him.  Sergeant Stanley's case has been heard by  the Supreme Court, and although  the Court  decided against him by a 5-to-4 vote, all  the  judges agreed  that  the  facts of  the  case  proved that Stanley suffered irreparable injury.  The Court cited  the Feres Doctrine as  the  basis for their unfavorable ruling, which grants  the U.S. Government immunity from liability in  the civil courts for servicemen ""where injury  arises out of or are in the course of activity in cident to service.""  Congress has become Sergeant Stanley's  court of  last  resort. As  you  are probably  aware, precedent exists for an award of this  kind. Public Law 96-77 provided for the relief  of James R. Thornwell, who was similarly a  victim of  the Army's LSD  experiments.  In  1976, Congress also granted  relief  for  the  family of Frank R. Olson, a civilian biochemist,  who was given LSD without his consent by  the Army and  subsequently  jumped  to his  death while under the influence.  3193  Supreme Court Justice Brennan,  in his dis senting  opinion,  concluded  that  ""soldiers  ought not be asked to defend a Constitution  indifferent  to  their essential human dignity.""  No action on  the part of  the military could  more deeply offend our national conscience  than  the  involuntary human experimentation  reflected  in  the Stanley case.  I ask my col leagues  to help  redress  in some small way  this extreme miscarriage of justice.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert a copy of  the bill in the RECORD.  H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION I. APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS.  (a) PAYMENT.-The Secretary of the Treas ury shall pay, out of any money  in  the  Treasury  not  otherwise  appropriated,  $625,000 to the trustee, designated pursuant  to section 4,  for  the benefit of James B.

78,444,3,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1989
79,444,3,Mr. BEVILL., I yield to the gentle man from Alabama.  ,1989
80,444,3,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I was sitting here reminiscing and  ruminating over the many things that  come to mind when I  think of BILL  NICHOLS. As the gentleman comment ed, he served with him 30 years, and I  have served with and been very closely  associated with him for at least 25 or  more. There are  so many  little vi gnettes and so many stories that come  to mind.  But I think the story of BILL would  not be complete if I did not put it in  the RECORD, because it is a true story,  an event that took place about 6 years  ago as the new Congress at that time  I  was being organized. The Democrats  get together and elect who will be the  chairmen of the various committees,  and BILL was fourth in the seniority,  and it normally goes by seniority. To  the surprise of many people, there was  an upset in the election, a coup if you  care to call it that, when Mel Price,  who had been the chairman for many  years, but was advancing in age, was  not reelected. That left a seat open.  The number two man asked BILL to  make  his  nominating  speech  then  since he was next  in  line, and BILL  agreed  to do  it. Then before it was  over, many, many people came to BILL  and urged him  to  run,  telling BILL  that he was the most popular, and he  was, in line of seniority, and knowing  what  I know after 24 years on  the  Armed Services Committee, I am con vinced it is true, and I think most of  my Democratic colleagues would agree  that it is true that if BILL had been  elected to be chairman of the Armed  Services Committee, if he had allowed  his name to be put in nomination, and  the gentlewoman from Maryland was  there, I believe, he would have won, he  would have been chairman. I think he  knew that.  He said, ""No, I have agreed to nomi nate and support someone else. I have  given my word. That  is what I am  going to do, and I will not agree for  my name to be placed in nomination.""  As  a  consequence, BILL was  not  elected chairman. And again, getting  back to what has been said repeatedly  here, his word was his bond. If he told  you he would do something, he would  do it. If he gave his word, you could  take it to the bank.  BILL, having given his word, stepped  aside and did not compete for the posi tion when I am absolutely convinced  that he would have been made  the  chairman of the Armed Services Com mittee had he sought it. But true to  his word, he supported another candi date, and so BILL wound up as  the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee  on  which he served when he died.  That is just one more measure of the  man that I think it behooves us all to  think about when we talk about serv ice,  integrity. He was always a very  great believer in the system, and this I  think is just one more reason to salute  the memory of a great and a  true  American.  I  thank  bama.  ",1989

All of this was so  evident at the funeral services where  so many who worked with him were  there, including what seemed to be the  whole town.  the gentleman  from Ala We lost a great friend and the Con gress a valuable Member.  BILL NICHOLS'  record of service  to  the people of his district, State, and  Nation will benefit all  for years  to  come.  To his family we extend our sincer est sorrow at his passing. Truly, he  leaves a great record.  ",1989
82,444,3,Mr. JENKINS.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to  join  my colleagues who are paying special tribute  today  to  the Honorable BILL NICHOLS, who  served in this august body for 22 years before  a massive heart attack ended his  life in De cember.  It is a privilege to say that I served in the  U.S. House  of Representatives with  BILL  NICHOLS. He set a standard of representation  of  the people which we should  follow. The  people of the Third District of Alabama were  served well on  this floor and  in  these Halls.  He looked after his local people from the Tus kegee  Institute and Auburn University to the  bedroom counties bordering Montgomery and  Birmingham, and they showed their approval  by continuing to reelect him for the 12th time  shortly before he died.  He served those of us in this institution well  by paying close attention  to his committee  duties. He was a solid rock in the foundation  of the Armed Services Committee, not failing  to question when the need arose, but a strong  supporter of the military. He voiced his con cerns about the defenses of the Marine bar racks near Beirut before the truck loaded with  explosives crashed  the gates and killed 241  servicemen.  As a veteran and staunch defense ally, he  took the helm of the Subcommittee on Investi gations and reformed  the procurement proc ess.  As we  look back  today over his distin guished career of public service, we all can  say that BILL NICHOLS could be a formidable  foe, a committed ally, but always a gentleman  in Alabamian and southern sense of the word.  ",1989
83,444,3,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Speaker, we have  lost a colleague whose record of service to  this Chamber is long and distinguished.  Representative BILL NICHOLS  is gone and  today  this Congressman proudly  remembers  the great  friendship we developed over  the  many years. Such  friendship makes our loss  hard to bear, but the memories are great and  everlasting.  Both of us were artillery officers during our  Army careers. We shared a  love of country  and patriotism. We had  jointly attended  the  1 OOth anniversary of  the Army post at Fort  Sill, OK, and we both felt very strongly about  service to the Nation.  In his capacity as a high ranking member of  the Armed Services Committee and chairman  of  its Subcommittee on  Investigations, BILL  NICHOLS worked tirelessly in the Congress to  make military policy work  for America in  the  best possible way.  He put his  talents and energy to work on  behalf of the enlisted men and women who  made  the military work. The everyday men  and women who provide the fuel for the great  engine of our armed services. These people  were the focus of BILL N1CHOLS's great com passion and efforts.  ",1989

90,457,3,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, we utilize  state-of-the-art chemicals in the man ufacturing of materials  for our Na tion's defense. We pride ourselves on  the  results, which  reflect enhanced  performance and quality. But in the  past year, things have gone astray.  Last May,  I was made  painfully  aware of the danger of chemicals. In  the town of Henderson, NV, where I  graduated high school, right outside  the heavily populated metropolis of  Las Vegas, Nevadans witnessed the ex plosion of the Pacific Engineering and  Production Co. The blast, triggered by  chemicals used  for  the shuttle and  other rocket systems, demolished ev erything in its path.  A blue ribbon panel, headed by then  Lieutenant Governor-and now Gover nor-Bob Miller, studied the situation  and concluded in a  report that ""the  most unsettling fact we  learned was  that we have such limited knowledge  regarding the identification, location,  utilization and transportation of haz ardous materials.""  The Henderson study focused on the  community's right to know about the  potential hazards of chemicals utilized  in plants near their homes. This is a  perfectly valid concern, but let us not  lose sight of an employee's right  to  know the dangers of the chemicals he  comes  into contact with on a daily  basis.  At some point,  impact on the em ployee spreads to others in the com munity. One man who was adversely  affected by chemicals in an aerospace  manufacturing plant comes home at  night and is afraid to hug his 5-year old  son. The man  fears  that  the  chemicals will  rub off on his son's  skin, inflicting the same problems he  himself suffers.  This man, and over 100 others like  him, is the catalyst for a hearing I will  chair Monday before the Senate Envi ronment and Public Works Subcom mittee on Toxic Substances, Environ mental Oversight, and Research and  Development. The hearing will focus  on  the potentially deadly chemicals  handled by aerospace and defense em ployees.  These workers utilize new chemical  compounds  found  in  composites-a  plastic-like material of great strength  that is supplanting the use of metals  and other materials. Scientists  say  composites will  replace much of the  metal now used in aircraft and auto mobiles within the decade.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

92,483,3,Mr. WARNER.," I know. But by incli nation of the Senator's voice, by judi cious language of his hand, he left a  doubt that the President with a stroke  of the pen could just open this mys tery up  and bring  forth  into  this  Chamber  stacks  of material  from  which we would search out the truth  for many hours.  ",1989
93,483,3,Mr. NUNN., The Senator from Vir ginia makes a very good point. I would  stand corrected as to the tone of my  voice.  ,1989

95,483,3,Mr. LEVIN.," If the Senator from Vir ginia, my friend, will yield, as I under stand it, the key point being is that  these documents are the property of  the executive branch. That is the only  thing.  ",1989
96,483,3,Mr. WARNER.," That  is correct. It  has been the practice of Presidents, be  they Democrat or Republican, and in  the interest of good Government they  cannot just simply release it.  ",1989
97,483,3,Mr. NUNN.,"  I  think the Senator is  correct. I think all of us have to keep  in mind here something I said earlier  this morning. As  important as  this  matter is now-and it is  important, I  do not diminish the importance of it  one iota; We spend hours, hours, hun dreds and hundreds of hours working  on it and thinking about it-but as im portant as it is, when it is over, when  John Tower is confirmed as Secretary  of Defense or when he  is not con firmed, this Government is going to go  on. We still are going to have to have  confidential communications, and the  executive branch, particularly the new  administration, has to be able to have  confidence in Congress and vice versa.  So I think we have to keep in mind  the larger picture. I would think this  President,  like any other President,  before  he  releases  an FBI  report,  would look at that larger picture and  how it affected his ability to get confi dential information to make his eval uation of future nominees. There are  hundreds of positions that have not  been  filled.  If the President of  the  United States did something here that  impeded the FBI's ability to look at  other people and  to get confidential  sources  from other people,  it might  very well harm the President's ability  to make wise choices.  So there are a lot of things to con sider. We are talking about the differ ence between  theoretical capabilities  and the practical considerations.  ",1989
98,483,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  I  think the manner in which the distin guished chairman has spoken here on  this issue, for a moment an issue of  controversy, now hopefully  resolved,  reflects on the manner in which he  with honor and distinction, and with  complete  fairness  and  objectivity,  worked with this Senator in the prepa ration of the record for our committee  and the Senate as a whole.  I thank the chairman.  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  SIMON), The Senator from Washing ton.  ",1989
99,483,3,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, under  normal circumstances, a Senator in my  position, newly returned to this body,  and as a  junior member of the Com mittee  on Armed  Services,  would  almost certainly not speak in this body  on the President's nomination for a  Secretary of Defense.  If one in my position felt particular ly strongly or wished to curry a little  bit of favor, he might, however, write  up a short statement and have it in cluded in the RECORD. Under those cir cumstances,  that  statement would  cover the background and experience  of the nominee. It would point out, in  this case, that John Tower served for  four  terms,  some  24  years,  as  a  Member of the U.S. Senate, and all or  almost  all  of  that  time was  as  a  member of the Senate Committee on  Armed Services.  I would probably include the obser vation,  common  to  all  of  his  col leagues, that the work of that commit tee was the work which John Tower  considered to be most important in the  U.S. Senate, on which he spent the  greater part of his great abilities, his  time, and his effort.  Such a statement would point out  his interests in some of the most ar chaic  elements of arms  control, of  weapons systems, of the relationships  among our armed  services,  and,  of  course,  of  the ultimate purpose of  those armed services,  the security of  the United States of America.  Certainly, any such statement would  point  to  the undoubted  intelligence  and thoughtfulness of John Tower. It  would speak admiringly of his dedica tion to his position and to his duties as  a Member of the U.S. Senate, which,  even  in a body of hard-working and  dedicated people, was clearly outstand ing.  If one wanted  to add, perhaps, a  little bit of humor or levity, as one  went on in such a statement to discuss  the strength of character which was  exhibited from  the beginning of his  Senate  career  to  the  end  of  that  career, one might even use the three word  phrase  which  appeared  in  Charles Krauthammer's column in the  Washington Post yesterday, describing  John  Tower  as-and  I  quote-""A  tough little bastard.""  One might finish by pointing out  that after 24 years of service with his  colleagues here in the U.S. Senate and  the people of Texas, whom he repre sented, John Tower went on to repre sent all of the people  in the United  States in a distinguished capacity as  an arms negotiator in Geneva; and, of  course, that he had been selected by a  newly-elected President for the vitally  important post of Secretary of De fense.  It then would have concluded with  an expression of delight at the wisdom  of the President of the United States  for picking such a qualified person for  that position, and a pledge, along with  99 other Members of the Senate, to  vote in favor of that nomination.  That, of course, is not the case here  today. We seem almost to assume all  of those charactistics on the part of  John Tower. As was the case with the  distinguished  junior  Senator  from  Texas, who spoke not long ago, each  of us,  to quote  the praises heaped  upon John Tower, as he retired from  this body and went on  to another  career, praising without exception the  qualities which I have just outlined.  We might even point to a slightly  later episode  in  this body,  in which  early  in 1985 John Tower was con firmed by voice vote, after a unani mous vote of a committee, to be U.S.  Ambassador to the strategic arms re duction talks. That appointment, inci dentally, must also have been accom panied by an FBI  report,  to which  every element of character, which is  relevant here today, must have then  been relevant.  But that is not the way in which this  nomination has  proceeded. We  are  faced here with a report of the majori ty of the members of the Armed Serv ices Committee, which questions or as serts, I might say, more properly, in  spite of  this  long and distinguished  career, a lack of ability to lead the De fense Department on the part of John  Tower. In supporting that conclusion  of  the negative  recommendation of  the majority report, there are four dis tinct, but connected, threads, to that  opposition. First, assertions with  re spect to the nominee's use of alcoholic  beverages.  Second,  his  relationship  with women, the one word character ization of which is womanizing. Third,  his representation of certain defense  interests in the period of time after he  ceased to be an arms control negotia tor in Geneva and before he was se lected for this position by the Presi dent of the United States. Fourth, and  I think it is safe to say, most signifi cantly, a set of objections or reasons  which goes under the title of, and I  have  to  quote  this word,  ""percep tions.""  I would like,  if I may  just briefly,  since  each of  them has previously  been discussed, mention each of those  four objections, and then make a few  independent observations of my own.  We have just heard and seen a debate  over the FBI report. Most particularly,  with  respect  to  allegations  levied  against John Tower connected with  the consumption of alcohol. Since this  is already a part of the public record,  we do know that some of those allega tions are anonymous, some of  them  ",1989

TUCKER: This is in response to  your request of this morning for informa tion regarding retired Air Force Technical  Sergeant Robert (""Bob"") Jackson.  Air Force records, as read to me telephoni cally this afternoon, reveal the following:  One ""Bob"" Jackson, DOB 6 May 1934, was  assigned to Bergstrom Air Force Base from  February 1976 until April 1978.  Sergeant Jackson's first duty day at Berg strom was 21 February 1976. His last duty  day was 16 March 1977. On 21 March 1977  Sergeant Jackson was referred  to Wilfred  Hall Medical Center for medical supervision  and subsequently was placed on the Tempo rary Disability Retired List following medi cal and psychological evaluation.  The Physical Evaluation Board which  evaluated Sergeant Jackson concluded, inter  alia, that Sergeant Jackson exhibited symp toms of a mixed personality disorder with  anti-social  themes and hysterical features.  Air Force records indicate that following 21  March 1977 Sergeant Jackson was unable to  perform his duties as an information spe cialist. He was retired from the Air Force at  the grade of E-6 on 19 April 1978.  Sincerely,  ANNE N. FOREMAN,  General Counsel.  sug ",1989

106,496,3,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of  the Tower nomination.  I  must admit  I am rather puzzled by  what has transpired, all that I have  read  in  the newspaper accounts, all  that I have heard on  the floor and  heard from the Senate Armed Services  Committee. The reason I am puzzled is  because I have served in this body for  going on 15 years. The Senate is not a  large group of people. It is only 100 of  us.  With the nature of our work and the  legislative process on committees, late night sessions here on the floor, all night sessions in some cases, as well as  traveling  together  various  places  around the world, we do get to know  each other rather well after a period  of time. When I hear about these alco hol charges, I must admit I am rather  surprised. I have heard others say that  they are aware of colleagues  in  the  Senate who have had alcohol prob lems.  I  too am aware of  those over  these last 14 years, some who have ap peared on  the  floor, particularly at  late-night sessions, with obvious prob lems, and  it becomes  fairly general  knowledge among us as to those col leagues who have alcohol problems.  I  served with  John Tower  for  a  decade. For that entire decade I served  with him on the Senate Banking Com mittee. He was  the ranking Republi can on that committee when I  first  was here. I also had the privilege of  serving with him on the Armed Serv ices Committee when he was the rank ing Republican  on  that  particular  committee. I had the opportunity to  travel to the Soviet Union with him  during the days of the SALT II de bates, and I traveled with John Tower  during the summer of 1972 when he  and I were in various cities around this  country debating Paul Warnke and  representatives of the Carter adminis tration on the merits or demerits of  the SALT II Treaty.  So my point is I have seen him on  the floor. I have seen him in social sit uations. I have served on two commit tees with him for a decade. I traveled  around the world with him, to many  social events, and I am amazed that I  am not aware, absolutely not aware  that there was a supposed problem or  ever seen him in a drunken state. That  has been the testimony of most of my  colleagues. If he had this alcohol prob lem we hear so much about,  I  am  amazed that he could hide it from so  many people who are close associates  for so many years.  My point is I simply do not believe  from my personal observation that he  has an alcohol problem and the unsub stantiated charges in an FBI report.  And some of  those witnesses hardly  have great character of their own if  you want to read the rest of the report  and look at their particular credibility.  And so  I  really am puzzled,  as  I  started to say, where this great alco hol problem came from if none of us  who served with him on a very close  and  intimate basis ever observed  it.  And yet some in this body to this day,  we are well aware, have a problem. We  are aware of it. I would certainly be  the last person to mention any names  on  this  floor or off  the  floor. But  there  is a double standard going on  that I am very disappointed in after  all these years in the Senate; that we  are  trying a  former colleague, who  served this Senate for 24 years in a  very distinguished manner and served  his country and his State well now,  through rumor and innuendo and un substantiated charges; that those are  more important than our personal ob servations. It is very, very puzzling to  me.  I will not  take more  time of  the  Senate at  this  time, but I certainly  wholeheartedly support John Tower's  nomination for Secretary of Defense. I .  ",1989
107,522,3,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent,  today I am introducing legisla tion that would extend for 5 years the  current 25-percent tax deduction that  is available for the purchase of health  insurance by self-employed individuals  and unincorporated small businesses. I  am  pleased  that  Senators  PRYOR,  DOLE,  WALLOP,  DANFORTH,  BOREN,  BAUCUS, D' AMATO,  BOSCHWITZ,  BUR DICK, SIMON, and SANFORD have joined  in cosponsoring this legislation which  brings a degree of equity to the farm ers  and  small  business  owners  of  America.  Unless  this  legislation  is  adopted  before the end of this year, the cur rent 25-percent deduction will  termi nate. I believe that would be totally in equitable and unfair to the small busi ness people and farmers of America  who need health insurance every bit  as much as the executives and employ ees of corporations.  Mr. President, this legislation repre sents a small step toward making af fordable health insurance available to  all working people. While Congress  has allowed large corporations a 100percent  deduction  for  the  cost  of  health  insurance  for employees and  retired employees, it was not until the  Tax Reform Act of 1986 that Congress  adopted; the provision temporarily al lowing the modest 25-percent tax de duction for the self-employed. And as  a  condition for  taking advantage of  this modest  deduction,  small  firms  must provide health insurance to their  employees  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis. This  legislation continues  this  requirement.  Mr. President, the 25-percent health  insurance deduction should be viewed  ",1989
108,548,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, the Chi cago Defender recently had an editori al about assault weapons  It is hard to believe that anyone can  def end the use of these assault weap ons whose only aim is to kill as many  human beings as possible in the short est time possible.  I hope we will have the courage to  ban these weapons.  They are becoming an  threat to our society.  I urge my colleagues to read this edi torial, which I ask to have printed in  the RECORD.  The editorial follows:  increasing  [From the Chicago Defender, Feb. 11, 19891  BAN HIGH-POWERED ASSAULT WEAPONS  The Defender  sincerely  commends  the  Chicago and Maywood police departments  for working  together  recently  to seize  a  cache of high-powered assault weapons and  explosives in the suburbs of Maywood and  Westchester. Such  incisive  teamwork may  have  saved  countless people  from  being  wounded, maimed or killed  in future vio lence. If ever an ounce of prevention was  worth a pound of cure, this was that time.  A  review  of  the  list of armaments  is  enough to send chills down the spine of any  decent-minded individual. At the Maywood  address, there were a total of 38 weapons,  including eight automatic machine guns,  seven  sawed-off shotguns, one semi-auto matic Uzi machine gun, 20 handguns, 23 live  hand grenades and numerous rounds of am munition. At  the Westchester home, sus pected cocaine, $4,300 in cash, 13 guns and  an undisclosed quantity of ammunition were  confiscated.  Authorities reportedly said the two homes  where the weapons were being kept were so called ""safe houses"" used by gangs. It was  also reported that officials felt the weapons  were destined  for delivery  to a Chicago  street gang. The Defender wants to stress  that  the weapons  reportedly were  fully loaded.  Just think of the damage to society that  could have been done if the 51 weapons and  grenades had been delivered to and used by  the street gangs. Bullets have no eyes. They  do immeasurable damage when fired from a  high-powered  assault weapon held by  a  person who is so  intent on killing a  rival  that the weapon-wielding fool doesn't care  how many innocent bystanders will be hurt  or killed in the process. The media have re ported  innumerable cases of  infants, pre school children, senior citizens, and  inno cent adults being caught in such senseless  shootings. Who is to explain to innocent vic tim's loved ones why his/her precious life  was so heartlessly and unnecessarily extin guished?  There are other horror stories of high powered weapons use such as the time when  mentally unbalanced persons walk  into a  school, shopping center,  fast-food  restau rant or the like and opens fire helter-skel ter.  Chicago  Police  Superintendent  LeRoy  Martin reportedly made a statement which  the Defender  thinks authorities and  law makers should take  into serious consider ation: ""All <the weapons> were created by  the military as war weapons. They have  only one purpose and that is to kill . . . they  were never  intended for civilian use. And  here such weapons are,  in  the hands of  people involved in criminal activity.""  Martin's statement is so on target and in  agreement with the Defender views of the  matter that we at the Defender are strongly  recommending that legislation pass appro priate  laws  to ban high-powered assault  weapons  and any ammunition made  for  them. Let's take a page from the Los Ange les' and Stockton, California book of wisdom  on this issue. The city council of the two  municipalities recently passed legislation to  ban such weapons.  Readers may recall that a man recently  used such a weapon to wound 30 children  and a teacher and kill five youngsters on a  school playground  in  the L.A., Stockton  area. Let's not wait for such a  tragedy to  occur in Illinois. We don't need school chil dren, police officers, or any other decent  citizens  ruthlessly slaughtered because of  someone's indiscriminant use of such arma ments. Ban  the weapons  throughout  the  state and, most  importantly, enforce  the  ban. The Defender wants each citizen  to  support a ban because, as  the old saying  goes, ""The life you save may be your own.""e  THE 72d ANNIVERSARY OF U.S.  CITIZENSHIP  FOR  PUERTO  RICANS   ",1989
109,548,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to commemorate the 72d anni versary of the granting of U.S. citizen ship to residents of Puerto Rico. On  March 2, 1917, the ""Act to provide a  civil government for Puerto Rico, and  for other purposes"" was enacted into  law. Since that time, Puerto Ricans  have been U.S. citizens but have not  enjoyed all of the rights and privileges  that go with citizenship.  The people of Puerto Rico vote in  Presidential primaries and send dele gates  to both  the Republican  and  Democratic  conventions.  However,  they have no vote in the general elec tion. The more than 3.3 million U.S.  citizens  in Puerto Rico cannot elect  two U.S. Senators like other citizens  can. Most of our Federal laws apply to  Puerto Rico  including any  require ments for military service.  On the anniversary of  this  impor tant occasion, I renew my belief that  true equality of citizenship for Puerto  Rico residents means that Puerto Rico  should be granted statehood. If Puerto  Rico became a State, it would have a  voice in the general election, two U.S.  Senators, and at least five or six Mem bers in the House of Representatives.  Too often Puerto Rico  receives  the  short end of important and severely  needed Federal programs.  Recently, I met with the Governor  of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernandez  Colon. He has recently asked Congress  to  sponsor  a  plebiscite  on Puerto  Rican political status. I believe that al lowing Puerto Ricans to finally choose  a definitive status for the island would  have bipartisan support in the Con gress. It also requires the consensus  support of the key parties in Puerto  Rico. Today, on the 72d anniversary of  the granting of U.S.  citizenship  for  Puerto Rico residents, I off er my coop eration and  energies  to work with  Energy Committee Chairman  JOHN STON,  his  ranking member Senator  McCLURE,  concerned  colleagues  on  both sides of the aisle, and interested  parties on the island of Puerto RiCo in  this endeavor.

111,561,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, Sudan is in  the midst of an  increasingly bloody  civil war which has claimed the lives  of hundreds of thousands of Sudanese  people and forced another 2 million to  flee their homes in search of food and  security. The war is rooted in religious  and ethnic differences between  the  south, which is inhabited primarily by  animists and Christian Africans, and  the  north,  where  Arabic-speaking  Muslims  dominate. Efforts  by  the  Muslim-based  government  in Khar toum to Islamize Sudan and deny the  south  equal political  representation  and  economic  opportunities  have  spawned s strongly supported south ern  insurgent movement,  the Suda nese People's Liberation Movement  [SPLMJ  with  a  well-trained  and  equipped army [SPLAJ.  Perhaps the greatest tragedy of the  war  is  that both parties have used  food as a political weapon and deliber ately obstructed  international  relief  efforts.  Government  forces  have  denied food to civilians in government  held  towns merely because  they are  Dinkas-the largest tribe in the south  and the base of support for the SPLM.  The SPLA, in turn, has attacked food  convoys and relief planes designated  for government held areas. In the last  2 years alone, an estimated 100,000 to  250,000 southerners died from starva tion. As many as  1112 million people  may be at risk in the rural areas of  southern Sudan unless  international  relief efforts are expanded.  The recent agreement between the  Sudanese Government and the SPLA  to allow the International Committee  of the Red Cross [ICRCJ to bring food  into six towns, three government held  and three SPLA controlled, is a step in  the  right  direction. But  it  is not  enough. Food must be delivered  to  many more towns in both areas. This  can happen only if the Government of  Sudan and the SPLA are willing to put  the welfare of civilians ahead of mili tary goals.  The  famine  in Sudan  is not  the  result of drought or lack of food but of  the war. It is imperative that the par ties  to  the war adopt an  immediate  cease-fire  to  facilitate  international  relief  efforts,  especially  before  the  rainy season begins. A cease-fire could  be an important first step toward re solving  the  issues  that  divide  the  people of Sudan and prevent Sudan  from becoming a  stable and united  nation.  As the central government, the Gov ernment of Sudan has a  special re sponsibility to facilitate international  humanitarian relief efforts, to protect  the welfare of all the Sudanese people,  and to seize every opportunity to bring  the war to a speedy conclusion. The  concurrent  resolution before us  re flects the growing concern in Congress  and among the American people about  the situation in southern Sudan. I be lieve this is a good concurrent resolu tion and I urge its adoption.  ",1989

I wanted to share his remarks with  my colleagues:  AN ADDRESS BY BENJAMIN MEED  We are together again and as always when  survivors get  together,  there  is  a  spark  which ignites our responsibility to remem ber the past and our destiny-in the words  of Elie Wiesel for the dead and the living we  must bear witness. No matter from where in  the nation we come, we have the feeling of  familiarity, bonds that were fused by suffer ing and by a common memory. We know  each other deeply and we also know how  difficult  it  is  for others,  even our best  friends who did not share our experience, to  understand us or  to enter into our inner  soul.

First and foremost,  there are the survi vors-you and me. We have traveled a long  journey together, far from the world of our  parents, far from  the world  in which we  began our lives, the world in which values  were shared and endured from one genera tion to another.  Instantly, that world was shattered and  we were thrown into a world of darkness.  We  are  the  fortunate, we  survived,  just  bodies and souls, no homes and no families,  We were displaced people. Then we came to  America. At first we were isolated; and then  we were joined by others. It took time and  hard work, but finally we survivors have as sumed our rightful place in Jewish life and  in American society. We have been together  at commemorations and at Gatherings, at  events  large and  small, all on behalf of  Jewish life and our beloved State of Israel.  We all love America. America did a lot for  us. But America has not changed us, howev er. By our collective  testimony we  have  helped  to change America and especially  American Jewry.  It is for survivors and for our collective  legacy  that  the American Gathering was  born and it is to survivors and to our legacy  have devoted every ounce of my  that  I  energy.  Our  second major  activity  is  now our  teachers program of Holocaust and Resist ance. As you heard from Vladka, who said it  better that I ever could,  the teachers are  our connection  to  the  future. They and  others  like  them will  carry part of our  legacy to the American people, to an entire  generation that was born after Auschwitz  and Treblinka. You have seen  them, our  alumni, their devotion-and how much they  want to learn from us the survivors. Here in  America,  these  teachers  recapture  our  memory and transmit it to the younger gen eration. You have seen their incredible qual ity as human beings and their enthusiasm  to learn and to teach others.  In many European cities, every vestige of  the Second World War and of Nazi tyranny  has been erased. Cities have been rebuilt.  The past has been covered over and  the  memory of Jews forgotten.  So let me thank Vladka. After all, she cre ated the program and she has worked on it  so tirelessly for the past five years.  Another most  important activity of my  life is the United States Holocaust Memori al Museum, located in the heart of our na tion's capital-the national memorial that  will transmit our experience to future gen erations of Americans. It is a Museum, but  not only a Museum. I am personally grate ful that Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff point ed this out in his remarks yesterday. It is an  educational institution that will include ar chives and an International Center for Hol ocaust Studies, a Learning Center and edu cational programs  for an anticipated one  million American visitors each year.  Imagine if someone had suggested in 1946,  the year we came to the shores of America,  that this would be possible-we would have  taken him for mad. Imagine if someone had  told you in 1976 that a national memorial  would be built under government auspices  on  the National Mall  in Washington, we  would have taken him for a lunatic. Maybe  we were meshugge-because while others  told us to forget, we insisted on remember ing and we will reap the fruits of our collec tive commitment. A national memorial will  be  built  in  our  lifetime-within  three  years-and it will convey  the Jewish and  human tragedy  in a manner authentic to  history.  So my friends, this weekend we meet as  one: survivors, teachers and Museum build ers. For it is our common task that brings us  together. We still must learn from one an other. But above all, we must respect each  other. We  are  interdependent-we  need  each other. Each one of these groups must  appreciate what the other groups can give  to our common task.  Yet at this hour, we survivors meet alone  as we should, to take stock of the past and  to ask some questions about  the  future.  Where do we go as an organization? What is  our task as survivors for  the next several  years? This question must concern us today.  This should be our main agenda item.  Let us begin with an honest-and pain ful-assessment  of our greatest enemy time. Within a quarter of a century, there  will be no survivors  left  to bear witness.  Each day our numbers diminish and each  year our energy wanes. So first and fore most our concern must be to finish what we  alone can  inspire others  to complete be cause we are the eyewitnesses-because we  were there in the pit of hell.  Not only in Washington, but also in New  York, Los Angeles, Miami and other cities,  they are building major memorials to the  Holocaust. Survivors are involved with each  of these important institutions as we should  be. We have contributed to each of these in stitutions as we should and we have served  as a conscience for each of them, demanding  that they tell a  truthful story, that it be  told with dignity and in a manner equal to  the magnitude of the event.  We  have  additional  contributions  to  make-not only monetary, but material as  well. Many of us have artifacts-uniforms,  photographs  and  documents-that  have  been stored away in our homes. These arti facts will be of interest to our children, but  they may have a greater power to instruct  the generations, to provide a compelling and  enduring documentation of our experience.  It is time to clean out our attics and base ments, to contribute the physical remains of  our memory so that the story that will be  told in the museums can reflect our experi ence.  I was disturbed last fall-as I am sure you  were-to read in the press that two letters  written by Anne Frank were sold in a public  auction for $160,000. We now see that unless  we  take a stand, unless we protest, Holo caust artifacts will become a business and  the material  remains will be sold  to  the  highest bidder. We cannot allow  that  to  happen, and, frankly, if we permit this, then  ultimately, it will be the enemy who prof its-Nazis will  sell  their memorabilia,  the  Polish government will be sitting on a gold  mine and the Czechs will make a fortune off  the Precious Legacy. Only the moral voice  of the survivor can put an end to this vul garity.  Secondly, we must  individually  tell our  stories, record our memories for posterity.  In many communities there are oral history  programs designed to record the experiences  of survivors. They are being conducted in a  sensitive and considerate manner. We great ly appreciate their work. Oh yes, survivor  testimony must be given, gathered, and con served, but it must be shared by all reputa ble institutions.  My fellow survivors, it is time to tell what  can be told so that none of us will leave this  earth without sharing our tragic and heroic  story. I know it is painful and difficult-but  it is so necessary. And these oral testimonies  cannot be the property of any one institu tion. We must insist that they be shared  among Washington, New York, Detroit, Los  Angeles and others, so that all can learn.  Finally, for the past decade the American  Gathering has been compiling a registry of  Jewish Holocaust Survivors, the names and  experiences and families of  tens of  thou sands of survivors who came to the United  States. We have the single most important  archives on the survivors in the world. The  American Gathering has the largest collece This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

114,613,3,Mr. BATES.," Mr. Speaker, today I introduce  the Rural Electrification Administration Lend ing Assistance Improvements Act of 1989. Not  only  is my proposal bipartisan, covering  the  full  spectrum  of  congressional  political  thought,  it  is also supported by  the National  Taxpayers Union,  the National Tax Equality  Association, the National Propane Gas Asso ciation, the Alliance for Fair Competition, and  other worthwhile associations of public  inter est.  This  legislation would bring REA  lending  programs  in  line with changes  in  the condi tions of rural electric and  telephone service.  When  the program was begun  in 1936,  few  farms had electricity or  telephones. Today,  these services are available from  the Florida  Keys  to  remote Alaskan villages above  the  Arctic Circle. Quality rural utilities are available  in every corner of rural America.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  But with REA's original  task seemingly all  but completed, the REA  is still going strong,  pumping taxpayer money-about $1 billion an nually-into areas of the country far removed  from  the little house on  the prairie. And,  this  money is highly subsidized.  Over the  last 15 years,  the value of REA  subsidies amounts to over $50 billion. Some  of  these moneys subsidize  the power  from  REA-backed nontaxpaying cooperatives to re charge golf carts at Hilton Head  Island, the  spa where 18 holes can  run $97.50. Other  subsidized  loans provide power to Kuwait In vestment Co.'s pleasure island of Kiawah, SC,  as well as other sunshine resorts.  Mr.  Speaker,  Federal  below-market-rate  loans don't end with  the sunshine  resorts.  Tax-free  REA  cooperatives  also  provide  power  to  the burgeoning  leisure economies  and condominium complexes of Vail, Aspen,  and Snowmass.  Simply stated,  these ski playgrounds and  the sunshine  tanning centers of  the wealthy  don't  require  high-subsidy  loan  assistance.  This legislation would reform  these unneces sary subsidies.  Mr. Speaker, a good question is: Why have  such extravagant subsidies so  long been  tol erated when the country cries for cost cutting  budget reform? Well,  that's a good question.  Simply put, with apologies  to Will Rogers,  ""Some Congressmen never met a spending  bill they didn't like.""  Today,  without  question,  this  legislation  makes a clear call for reform. And it does so  on a sound base. Today, unlike 1936, nearly  all REA borrowers are financially healthy and  profitable. Some REA electric power supply  borrowers and their affiliated distribution mem bers have assets that exceed companies on  the Fortune 100  list of  largest U.S. enter prises. Our bill  recognizes  this change and  would make  the appropriate  reform-by  re placing high-subsidy REA direct  loans with  loan  guarantees when  assisting  legitimate  rural borrowers.  Under current law, areas that were rural  in  former times but are no  longer rural continue  to  receive high subsidy assistance. About 5  percent of REA borrowers serve largely met ropolitan areas, not  rural areas. During  the  period 1980 to 1985, these urban and subur ban borrowers received nearly 20 percent of  all electric loans aimed at rural communities.  Our bill says ""once a borrower, always a bor rower"" is bad policy. We would stop this prac tice and assist only legitimate rural borrowers.  The  telephone program  is no different. A  number of REA borrowers are subsidiaries of  major, multimillion dollar  telecommunications  holding companies. One of these outfits, with  sales and assets of $2.6 billion and $5.1 bil lion respectively, took nearly 10 percent of all  telephone  loans during  the  1980  to  1985  period. As a group, these holding companies,  representing 7.5 percent of all telephone bor rowers  took 25.5 percent of  the money be tween 1980 and 1985. These holding compa nies are playing  in  the Euro and Wall Street  bond markets. Multimillion dollar companies  have no place taking high-subsidy assistance  from hard-working  taxpayers. Our bill would  stop this practice.  Does  this  legislation cause serious prob lems in providing affordable, quality utilities to  3401  rural America? The answer is no; a resound ing no. There would be no drastic increase in  farmers' utility bills under our proposal. The  Congressional Budget Office and the Office of  Management and Budget agree on  that. The  Congressional Budget Office previously report ed  that moving  to a more market oriented  loan  rate above  the highly subsidized REA  rate ""* * * would have little effect on most co operative's rates as  interest charges account  for only a small percentage of  the average  ratepayer's bill."" The Office of Management  and Budget  in conjunction with  the Depart ment of Agriculture and  the Rural Electrifica tion Administration report that the  impact on  the typical ratepayer would be ""only 7 4 cents  per month.""  Now Mr. Speaker, does the package save  any money? Yes. Projected savings from cur rent  services  and  countable  savings  for  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings purposes  result  in  nearly $5 billion over the next 5 years. This  legislation produces savings that are dramatic  and real. At the same time, our legislation re mains sensitive to rural America. It does not  abolish REA nor does  it cause a drastic  in crease in farmer's utility bills. It is a reform bill  that provides continued generous Federal as sistance to those who need it while eliminat ing assistance to those who don't.  In those few cases where a borrower is ex periencing  financial hardship, our  legislation  provides a wholly reliable safety net. This leg islation ensures that a borrower in  true need  gets direct, high-subsidy assistance. The pro posal does not threaten quality, reliable, and  affordable service to rural America.  Americans  have  long been  generous  to  those who truly need help. This attribute is the  cornerstone of our  country's strength. We  help one another. However, unless we open  our eyes to changes and make the appropri ate  reforms  in Federal spending, we simply  won't have enough resources to meet the crit ical needs of today. Frankly, no one has to be  an expert in rural utility service to know that  conditions have changed since REA was cre ated in 1936. The help that was once needed  has been largely satisfied.  This legislation can reform the program, and  reduce our costs without harming rural Amer ica or abolishing REA.  It allows us,  in a sub stantial way,  to  find  the  resources  to meet  other urgent needs of today's America.  In essence, our bill  follows  the advice of  Mark Twain, which was, ""Do what's right and  you'll please some of the people and astound  the rest."" We have an opportunity here to do  what's right and astound  those who believe  Congress never met a spending bill  it didn't  like.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting  this  legislation which strikes  the proper bal ance between the legitimate interest of all par ties.  Mr. Speaker, the bill follows:  H.R. 1232  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as the ""Rural Electrifica tion Administration Lending Assistance Im provements Act of 1989"".

115,626,3,Mr.  FOGLIETT A.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  speak about the rapidly approaching possibili ty of machinists' union strike at Eastern Air lines. This action would pose another threat to  the stability of our Nation's airline industry and  the daily schedules of air passengers nation wide. It also further weakens the public's wary  confidence in the safety of air travel. Most im portantly,  it threatens the livelihoods of thou sands of workers and their families.  In order to resolve this crisis rationally and  fairly for all parties involved,  I urge President  Bush  to  immediately create an  emergency  mediation board and declare a 60-day morato rium on any action by either management or  the  labor unions  that would disrupt or halt  Eastern's regular schedule of airline service.  Labor-management  relations  at  Eastern  have been severely  tested  for  the past 1 7  months, and the 30-day cooling-off period im posed by  the National Mediation Board has  failed  to  resolve  their dispute. That period  ends  on March  4,  allowing  the  airline  to  impose new working conditions and wages on  the union, and  freeing  the union  to go on  strike.  Passengers and travel agencies are under standably reluctant to rely on Eastern's serv ice and the airline continues to lose money at  a rate of $1 million a day. While the machin ists' union and management are far apart on  contract terms, both parties want to keep the  airline  in business. Bankruptcy would mean  not only the loss of jobs, but also the inevita ble  reduction of price competiton  in  today's  regulated airline industry.  Rather than allowing further tension and in creased bitterness on both sides, the Presi dent should appoint a  factfinding panel and  delay any  strike  for  another  60  days.  In  making this request,  I am  joining  the media tors who have been involved in recent negoti ations.  The President  is  in a position  to prevent  service disruption throughout the airline indus try.  I urge him  to use his executive authority  and  leadership ability  to  take  these  steps  which are necessary to the survival of Eastern  Airlines,  the  livelihood of its employees, and  the protection of air travelers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE  OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION  HON. ENI F.H. FALEOMAVAEGA  OF AMERICAN SAMOA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 2, 1989  ",1989
116,626,3,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.," Mr. Speaker, it is on  the heels of President Bush's return from his  tour of Asia that I would like to take a moment  to note  the  rising  influence and  increasing  impact of  the Pacific region on  international  matters. Symbolically, unlike predecessors in  the Office of  the Chief Executive, President  Bush's first major trip abroad has been to the  countries of the Pacific rather than to those of  the Atlantic.  In  the upcoming decade and  into the next  century, the countries of the Pacific shall play  a greater role  in  the economic, political, and  military affairs of  the United States and  the  world. As has been often stated, the 21st cen tury shall truly be an era marked with signifi cant economic advancement by the nations of  the  Pacific.  According  to  administration  sources, it is to be expected by 1995 that the  United States' volume of Pacific-bound  trade  shall be twice that conducted with the nations  of the Atlantic. Moreover,  it  is projected that  the aggregate gross national product of  the  Pacific shall surpass that of Europe in a little  over 10 year's time.  With Japan  leading  the way  for  the coun tries of the Pacific-being the world's greatest  creditor Nation, its largest donor of foreign as sistance and  the United States strongest  fi nancial partner and ally in the defense of the  sea  lanes of  the Pacific basin-the United  States must  reassess  its  relationship  to  the  Asia-Pacific region. The United States clearly  cannot be satisfied with merely maintaining its  present policies when dealing with the Pacific.  This  is  a  time  that mandates  significant  changes be made for the creation of alliances  with the nations of the Pacific region that will  protect our mutual interests and foster lasting  trust.  It  is gratifying  to note that President Bush  has  recognized  the need  for change  in  the  United States relationship with  the countries  of the Pacific. As the President has declared,  America, too, is a Pacific nation and we must  renew our determination  to  strengthen  ties  and relationships with our allies and partners  in the Pacific region.  On  that note, Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  insert in the RECORD two articles on this sub ject that have appeared recently in the press.  The first article, entitled ""Bush Restates U.S.  Determination To Remain a Power in the Pa cific,'' was written by Gerald M. Boyd, and  published on February 23, 1989, by the New  York Times. The second, entitled ""Relearning  From Japan,'' was written by Haynes Johnson  and printed on February 24,  1989, by  the  Washington Post.  [From the New York Times, Feb. 23, 19891  BUSH RESTATES U.S. DETERMINATION To  REMAIN A POWER IN THE PACIFIC  <By Gerald M. Boyd)  President Bush today reasserted the de termination of the United States to remain  a Pacific power, calling the region one ""of  March 2, 1989  in  interna importance  great and growing  tional affairs.""  At a stop here en route to Tokyo for the  funeral of Emperor Hirohito, Mr. Bush said  he planned to strengthen relationships with  friends and allies in a five-day journey that  will take him to Japan, Beijing and Seoul,  South Korea.  Mr. Bush previewed  the  trip, his  first  abroad as President, in a refueling stop at  Elmendorf Air Force Base, halfway on the  15-hour flight. Speaking to American mem bers of the armed services in a hangar, he  said the trip has symbolic and substantive  components.  ""Alaskans understand that America is as  much a Pacific nation as it is an Atlantic  one-and that the Pacific region is of great  and growing importance in intern_ational af fairs,"" he said.  ""At each stop,  I  aim  to  strengthen  key  relationships  with  our  friends and partners in the Pacific region.""  'WE'RE READY TO ROLL, YEAH'  Although  residents  of Alaska  and  the  Soviet Far East are increasing their cultur al, diplomatic and scientific exchanges, Mr.  Bush made no mention of the Soviet Union  or the new warming. But he praised Ameri can troops based in Alaska as the ""forward  edge of our national defense.""  ""And make no mistake about the impor tance of your task,"" he said. ""Alaska's stra tegic position, at the point where the Far  East,  the Western Hemisphere  and  the  Arctic meet, is proof enough that the mis sions you perform here are vital to our na tional security.""  Mr. Bush arrived at the Air Force base as  a light but steady snow was falling. He was  accompanied by Secretary of State James A.  Baker  3d,  the  chief  of  staff  John H.  Sununu, Brent Scowcroft, the national secu rity adviser, and other senior aides.  Asked by a reporter if he was heading to  Tokyo with  ""new  initiatives,""  he  said,  ""We're ready to roll, yeah.""  TRIP SCHEDULED AROUND FUNERAL  The President said it was important for  the United States not to take the Asian na tions for granted as the new Administration  tackles other problems.  ""There is something more than symbol ism,"" he said of the trip to China, his fifth  since he left there in 1975 after serving as  chief American envoy. ""That relationship is  fundamental to any foreign policy equation  of the United States.""  ""We  don't ever want  to  neglect  our  friends,"" he said. ""Yes, things in the Pacific  seem to be going reasonably well, but we are  a Pacific power and this visit will demon strate  that we  intend  to  stay  a Pacific  power.""  Before leaving Washington, senior Admin istration officials sought to lower expecta tions by noting that the trip was scheduled  around the funeral Friday of Emperor Hiro hito.  PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH LEADERS  Briefing reporters Tuesday on the eve of  the visit, Mr. Scowcroft said that ""the sub stance will not be extensive,"" although Mr.  Bush is scheduled to hold private talks with  more than a dozen heads of state in Tokyo.  ""This  trip  is mainly an opportunity  to  have serious discussions at the outset of his  Administration with such important Asian  friends and allies and to reaffirm that the  United States plans to play a strong and af firmative role as an Asian power,"" Mr. Scow croft said.

123,678,3,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I rise  today in strong support of the nomina tion of John Tower to be our country's  Secetary of Defense.  For the last 3 months, we have been  offered a steady diet of innuendo and  rumor. We have heard much more  than we will ever need from the three  A's-accusation, allegation,  and  ap pearances. What  has  been  largely  missing is the F-word, a 4-letter word  that many of us are shying away from  as  if it were  impolite  to use  in our  debate. The word I am ref erring to is  ""fact.""  All I am asking my colleagues to do  is to judge this nominee on the facts.  Many of my colleagues in this Cham ber are laywers; I am not. But I know  enough about our American system of  justice to recognize that an accusation  is not a piece of evidence. Saying that  someone said or did something is not  the same as proving that he did, or  even giving evidence that he did.  So  let us  judge  this man on  the  facts. No fewer than 71 of the 100 Sen ators who will vote on Senator Tower's  nomination actually served with him  in the U.S. Senate. He is not a strang er whom we have to judge on allega tions, hearsay, and third-hand reports.  Many of us know him, and we can tes tify  to his qualifications, his  intelli gence, and the integrity of his charac ter.  As recently as last summer, I worked  with -Senator Tower on the Republi can platform. He was an aggressive, in telligent,  responsible,  and  a  hard working advocate of the defense poli cies he believed in.  I was cochairman of that Republican  Platform Committee. I went head-to head with John Tower on a number of  issues,  and  I  came away with  this  single conclusion: There  is nobody I  would  rather have  representing our  country in high pressure negotiations  than John Tower. When it comes to  the  defense  of  this  country,  John  Tower is as forceful, forthright, and  dependable as any public servant  I  have ever known.  And that is not just my own opinio 1.  A public servant who has known John  Tower for almost three decades, who  has worked closely with him, and who  will have  to work closely with him  once again if he is confirmed as Secre tary of Defense, agrees with my own  observations  and  conclusions  about  Senator Tower.  The public servant to whom I am re f erring is President George Bush.  As President of the United States,  Mr. Bush is entitled to nominate the  members of his own Cabinet. Under  our  constitutional  prerogative  of  advice and consent, we  in the Senate  may-as we have done on very rare oc casions in the past-choose to reject  the President's nominee for a Cabinet  post.  But in this case, if we were to reject  the Tower nomination, we would be  doing something worse  than merely  adding a ninth member to the group  of Cabinet nominees rejected by the  Senate.  We would be rejecting-based purely  on  innuendo  and  rumor-the  judg ment of a man who knows Senator  Tower better than any of us do. We  would  be  rejecting  the  considered  opinion of a man who will have to bear  many of  the  consequences himself,  should Senator Tower prove an inad equate and unfit Secretary of Defense.  So, I ask all my colleagues to consult  their consciences, and pay attention to  what  they  really know about John  Tower-not rumors or unproven alle gations, but the facts they know and  believe. The  prinicple  that  ""where  there's smoke,  there's  fire""  is  not  enough  to hang a man  in America.  And it is certainly insufficient grounds  for rejecting a President's nominee to  be Secretary of Defense.  President Jack Kennedy was fond of  observing that life is unfair. And it is  true  that not every  injustice, every  hurtful lie, every slander in the world  is set right.  But we in the Senate have a rare op portunity to perform an act of justice,  to  say  that yes,  the  truth  should  matter and  the  truth does matter.  John Tower is a prisoner of a Kafkaes que maze of accusations-and it is in  our power to free him from it.  Ten years from now, probably much  sooner ever than that, this controver sy will be forgotten. But in our con sciences, each of us will have to live  with the question, ""Why did I vote the  way I did on John Tower?"" I want to  live with the right choice-and that is  a yes vote on John tower.  Mr. President, upstairs in room S407, there are a number of black loose leaf binders. I have studied these docu ments for hours, and I agree with the  distinguished Senator from Virginia they are a conglomeration of fact, fic tion, and fantasy. I urge all my col leagues to work through those docu ments and decide for themselves what  is true and what is not true.  But much more importantly, in each  of us, there is an intellect and a con science; and  I ask-as strongly as  I  know how-that each of my colleagues  consult that conscience before we rush  to judgment on Senator TOWER.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",1989

126,678,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1989
127,678,3,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, I will  be brief, but  I believe a  couple of  things have been mentioned on  the  floor today that merit comment. I am  happy to see the able Senator from  Maryland here who made note of the  fact  that no women have come for ward endorsing or standing for John  Tower.  I  believe  yesterday Mr. WARNER  looked up at  this press gallery and  read them a letter signed by a number  of  America's  most  distinguished  women and asked them why they had  not printed  it. We searched  in vain  today and they have not printed it.  Apparently,  the press does not yet  care that a letter of this kind is in the  public record. Therefore, it is no sur prise  that  the  able Senator  from  Maryland did not know of its exist ence, because the press has been able  to play this in one certain way, too.  But if the Senator will just wait for  a moment,  I will  read  it  to her. It  reads:  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We have known Sen ator John Tower professionally and person ally for a number of years.

128,704,3,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  March is recognized as National Nutri tion Month. In addition, the American  School Food Service Association has  designated the week of March 5-11 as  National School Breakfast Week.  I have assumed the position of rank ing Republican on the Nutrition Sub committee during this Congress. As a  member of the subcommittee, I have  been  a  long-time  supporter of  the  school lunch and school breakfast pro grams. I've visited and eaten at several  schools in Minnesota during my time  in the Senate.  Over the past couple yea.rs we have  seen  increasing attention focused on  the School Breakfast Pro~~ram. Many  school teachers have told me how dif ficult it is to teach a hungry student  who has not had breakfast. A provi sion I authored to increase reimburse ment for school breakfast was includ ed in the Hunger Prevention Act en acted last year.  The federally funded School Break fast Program has been an excellent in vestment in preparing today's children  to be tomorrow's strong, healthy, and  well-educated leaders. However, many  school  districts  have been  slow  to  adopt  the  program. Objections  to  starting up a breakfast program, how ever  well-intentioned,  affect  those  least able to bear it-children.  Recently the National Education As sociation  [NEAJ  released  a  report  about the effects of hunger on chil dren's ability to learn. ""The Relation ship Between Nutrition and Learning:  A School Employee's Guide to Inf or mation and Action"" is the title of the  report that the NEA developed along  with the Food Research and Action  Center. This report highlights the im portance of food and good nutrition to  growing children.  The  study  provides  information  about  the  breakfast  program  and  other children nutrition programs and  provides suggestions for educators and  school employees about how to get a  breakfast program  started at  their  school.  I ask that articles about the  report and the School Breakfast Pro gram from the Washington Post and  the New York Times be printed in the  RECORD.  The future of our country's children  are at stake. As any parent or teacher  can attest, we cannot feed a child's  mind without first feeding his or her  stomach. I would hope that educators  or interested parents would ask their  schools to look at the breakfast pro gram and consider participation. This  is  a  very  important  initiative  that  meets a critical need for our Nation's  children.  The articles follow:  [From the New York Times, Feb. 8, 1989]  EATING WELL  EDUCATORS SOUND THE ALARM AS EVIDENCE  SHOWS THAT HUNGER CAN IMPEDE LEARNING.  <By Marian Burros>  WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-Increasing poverty  among children  in the United States has  generated such concern among educators  that the National Education Association has  released a report documenting the deleteri ous effects of hunger on a child's ability to  learn.  The report, ""The Relationship Between  Nutrition and Learning: A School Employ ee's Guide to Information and Action,"" also  provides practical suggestions  for parents  and school employees interested in attract ing more children to the free and reduced price school lunch and breakfast programs  and for improving the quality of the meals.  The report comes at a time when the final  Reagan Administration budget recommend ed a $614.4 million cut in the 1990 school  lunch program. Research published in the  American Journal of Agricultural Econom ics in 1975 indicated that for every 10 cents  cut from the lunch program there was a 10  percent decline in participation.  Spokesmen for  the Bush Administration  said  there would be no comment on  the  status of  the school  lunch program until  after  the President's budget  speech  on  Thursday evening.  At a news conference here last week, Mary  Hatwood Futrell, president of the education  association, said the report deserved imme diate action. ""Today one out of every five  American children is poor,"" she said. ""If the  trend continues, by 1990, 40 percent of our  children will be living in poverty.""  For some children, she continued, ""school  breakfast or lunch may be not only the best  meal they get, it may be their only meal,  and hungry or undernourished children find  it harder to learn.""  According to the report, a 1986 survey of  emergency food centers in Minnesota, for  example,  found  that 21 percent of 13,176  households with  children  reported  that  their children missed meals on a  regular  basis because there was not enough money  to buy food.  The report also mentioned another survey  conducted in 1987 by the United States Con ference of Mayors. It docume:p.ted an 18 per cent increase in the number of families with  children who were seeking emergency food  in major cities nationwide.  The  education  association  report  also  cited  recent  studies  that  examined  the  impact of hunger on learning. The findings  indicated that hunger leads to nervousness,  irritability and disinterest;  that skipping  breakfast often  causes  nausea,  dizziness,  headache and fatigue in the morning, and  that the hungry child is passive, apathetic  and timid.  In  1987,  for  example,  researchers  at  Boston and Tufts Universities investigated  the impact of the school breakfast program  on children in Lawrence, Mass. They looked  at achievement test results of children in  the third through sixth grades for the year  before and the year after the breakfast pro gram  began.  They  concluded  that  the  school breakfasts were responsible for sig nificant improvements in attendance and in  standardized achievement test scores.  The education association's report, pre pared by  the Food Research and Action  Center, a Washington-based nonprofit orga nization that works on behalf of the disad vantaged, was commissioned because educa tors were concerned that increasing num bers of children were unable  to do  their  school work because  they are hungry or  malnourished.  Teachers  said  they  had  heard more and more children complaining  that they hadn't had much to eat or had  stomach aches; some teachers reported that  students actually fainted in class.  Buttressing their observations was a 1987  report from  the Carnegie Foundation for  the Advancement of Teaching, which found  that more  than  two-thirds of  the 22,000  teachers surveyed nationwide in kindergar ten through high school said undernouris ment was a problem in their schools.  The school lunch program served 24 mil lion children in 1987 and 1988, half of whom  received meals  free-of-charge, while  the  school breakfast program reached 2.7 mil lion. Before  budget  cuts made  by  the  Reagan Administration in 1981, the school lunch program served 26 million children,  the school breakfast program, 3.8 million.  The National Education Association plans  to join other groups in lobbying Congress to  block the proposed cuts in the 1990 school lunch program.  Mrs. Futrell said the Federal Government  was not likely to spend as much money on  social services,  including school lunch and  breakfast, as it has in the past. ""I think we  will be relying more on volunteers, private  organizations and the business community  to support the programs,"" she said.  SCHOOL LUNCHES NEED NOT BE FEARED  The  National  Education  Association  report recommends that teachers, school of ficials and other school employees work in  their schools  to  improve participation  in  lunch and breakfast programs.

129,717,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, before  my distinguished colleague departs, I  have not as yet had the opportunity to  read the Evans-Novak column here in  the Post of today. I did take it upon  myself at my own  initiative  to  see  Roland Evans and to tell him precisely  what occurred, that is, to the extent I  had knowledge on the subject, and I  will not recount basically what I told  Mr. :H:vans, and then I will later have  the opportunity to read it and see if  this .article in any way reflects the in formation that I possessed.  Senator NUNN and I were together at  this charity event. He was scheduled  to  leave  the event and go on other  presc:heduled trips, thereby preventing  his return to Washington. I was, how ever, and did  return  to Washington  Monday after the weekend. Now, prior  thereto Senator NUNN and I had both  expressed  to  the White House our  availability at  the  earliest  possible  time to look over the FBI material. We  were told that as soon as it was avail able we would be notified.  Insofar as I know, the first knowl edge of  its availability came  to  the  chairman while he was with me at this  particular event. He pulled me aside  out there and said that he had made  arrangements for  the FBI report to  come out. As far as I know,  the ar rangements were made as is custom by  the chief of the staff of the majority. I  did not get involved in the details.  The report was brought out, Senator  NUNN and I departed from the activi ties that we were scheduled to be in volved in, and spent on Saturday, my  rough estimate now is around 2 to 2 %  hours looking at it Saturday evening not late evening. I would somewhere  in the area of 5:30 to 8:30 to 9.  We then recognized that we had to  do a great deal of additional work. We  got up around 7:15 the next morning,  regrouped with  a member  of  the  White House counsel staff, a military  aide, Mr. Punaro, and my chief of  staff, Mr. Tucker. In my recollection  we must have spent another 2% to 31/2  hours from say 7:30 on Sunday morn ing working on it.  There  were  two  advantages  to  having the report being brought to us.  A,  it enabled us  to  look over  that  report and then advise White House  counsel where we felt there were areas  that  required  additional  research.  They took our request and  initiated  immediately  the additional  research  under the aegis of the FBI.  Mr. NUNN then went on some sched uled  trips elsewhere.  I  returned  to  Washington, continued to work with  both majority and minority staff, then  worked by telephone with Mr. NUNN  throughout  that week until he  re turned, and shortly after his return we  resumed working with the FBI here in  the Senate Armed Services Committee  spaces.  I have not had an opportunity to  read this through. I will, and I may  have further comments later.  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.  ",1989
130,717,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Nebraska.  ,1989
131,717,3,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my friend and colleague from Virginia  for the explanation that has just been  offered.  I would simply caution my  good friend and colleague from Wyo ming. If you do not believe everything  that you read in the FBI report, do  not necessarily believe that report is  any more authoritative on some mat ters than the Evans-Novak story in the  paper today.  I believe that the Senator from Vir ginia has highlighted what I was going  to say in rebuttal to that charge.  I  just say I  think it is sad indeed  that we feel it necessary to come on to  the floor of the U.S. Senate and di rectly or indirectly impugn the motive  of our colleagues. We all know this has  been a very, very difficult task for all  of us-the majority and the minority.  I just want to make it very clear that  the facts of the matter are money was  saved from taxpayers' expense in the  way this was handled by the chairman  of the committee which is customary  because on that airplane that went out  it was not just SAM NuNN's chief of  staff for the committee, but there was  the majority staff director, the minori ty staff director, and the White House  lawyer that my friend from Virginia  has already referred to who had to go  along because it should be understood  by now that the White House report is  never given  to a courier other than  someone who has authority to handle  the  report. That  is why  the White  House lawyer went along. In addition,  there was a military escort that has  been properly outlined by my  col league from Virginia.  So I  think we can have our differ ences of opinion but how the report  was carried out there and whether or  not it was a good idea to take a mili tary aircraft is not a valid point con cerned. In fact, from that perspective,  it has been brought out that was the  cheapest way for this to be handled.  Also, as Senator WARNER has very  well outlined, time was of the essence.  This was on January 7. I remember it  very well because I talked on the tele phone with Senator NUNN that day in  Phoenix or wherever he was. I do not  remember where he was. He told me  that Senator WARNER was there. I had  received  some  information  that  I  thought that it was critically impor tant that I relate to the chairman. I  did so over the telephone. He told me  that the report was on its way out at  that time, and that they were doing  this so we could speed up the process  because  the  record should show we  were not scheduled to come back into  session until January 20. I know Sena tor NUNN, and I suspect also that Sen ator WARNER, felt that the sooner they  had the opportunity as the leaders of  the committee to address this subject  and study the report, get the process  going, we would be better prepared  when we finally did get back to call  the full committee into session to dis cuss the nomination which we did.  Just one other point. I heard early  about the charge of an Eastern-bloc  woman and his relationship. I did not  believe  it at  the  time.  I  also heard  some time before it broke in the press  the episode about the drunken balleri na-supposedly-Soviet, and on top of  the piano dancing.  I did not believe  that either. As it turned out, I think  that  the FBI  report  among other  things closed an awful lot of loopholes  with regard to allegations that were  simply not accurate.  If I were the opposition to my posi tion on the Tower nomination, I, too,  would use  these  reports which are  unfair, unfair to John Tower, unfair  to the process. I too would use them in  an attempt to imply that everything  that we know about John Tower that  possibly would not be shed in the best  light  follows  the  irresponsibility of  those who made those accusations.  As I have said on many occasions, 90  percent of what I have heard and seen  and studied on  this matter  is sheer  garbage. Ten  percent  at  least has  given me grave pause for concern. And  therefore I  think it not accurate  to  assume that because there were unfor tunate stories released  to  the press.  This Senator can say that I have never  released one shred of evidence to the  press. And  I have  talked  to  lots of  them.  It is unfortunate  that  these  come out. I feel sorry about that. But  nevertheless the process has to go for ward, and there are other things that  cause me enough pause for concern  that I am opposed to the nomination.  I yield the door.

There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  the Senator  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 1989]  THE TOWER FIGHT: MAX KAMPELMAN REPLIES  A brief innocuous paragraph at the end of  a story [Feb. 23], an abbreviated and dis torted leak, and suddenly two fine  ladies,  hard-working government secretaries, have  a  cloud hanging over  their head.  John  Tower's two secretaries, to the best of my  knowledge, have served our country well. I  know of no reason to question that judg ment or their character.  Furthermore, without intending to influ ence or intrude on the prerogatives of the  Senate, I will add that I have never seen  John Tower intoxicated, out of control or  behave  in an ungentlemanly manner. We  worked closely  together in Geneva for 14  months, during which he was at all times a  professional in the best sense of that word  and a negotiator of skill and sensitivity.  During the past four years of the Nuclear  and Space Arms Talks  in Geneva, more  than 100 Americans have served their coun try, under my direction, with zeal, dedica tion, competence and patriotism. The Amer ican people, Congress and the press should  not permit rumors and innuendo to distort  the extraordinarily fine service performed  by these men and women.  I am proud of  them, and so should we all be proud of  them.  MAX M. KAMPELMAN.  WASHINGTON.  CThe writer has served as chief of the U.S.  delegation to the Nuclear and Space Arms  Talks in Geneva.)

139,730,3,Mr. HEFLIN.,"  I  thank my distin guished friend from Arizona for yield ing time. We all have time problems,  and my statement is short.  Mr. President, I wish I had been able  to enjoy the privilege of reading the  FBI reports at one or two sittings, but  other duties have  required  that my  review of these reports occur over a  number of days. Today I finished that  task.  I  also have spent considerable  time  talking with  and  listening  to  members of the Armed Services Com mittee, reading and rereading the com mittee report, reading commentaries,  and  listening to  the debates on the  confirmation of former Senator John  Tower to be Secretary of Defense.  I do not believe I have heard anyone  question his qualifications for the po sition of Secretary of Defense. Univer sally, it has been proclaimed that he is  qualified from the standpoint of expe rience, knowledge, and intelligence to  be an outstanding head of our Defense  Department.  This is not like a  judicial appoint ment. Judicial nominees are with us  for life and serve in a coequal branch  of Government. Cabinet members are  usually with us during the term of the  President or  for  a  period of  time  which the President determines, and  serve  in his branch of Government.  We hold the President accountable for  the conduct of  the members of his  Cabinet. It is the President's Cabinet,  not Congress' Cabinet.  However,  the position of Secretary  of Defense  is  different  from other  Cabinet positions because the security  of this Nation rests on his shoulders  more  so  than  any  other Cabinet  member.  In reviewing all of  the charges,  I  have concluded  that his conduct  in  many areas is not applaudable and not  without justifiable criticisms, but, on  the other hand, not disqualifying. Be cause of the sensitivity of the position  as Chief Deputy Commander in Chief  of the Armed Services of the United  States,  I  do  have  concerns  about  whether such a position should be en trusted to a person who has a drinking  problem.  I have served in the U.S. Senate with  John Tower for 6 years. If he had a  drinking problem during the period of  1979-84, I did not know it. I never saw  him under the influence of alcoholic  beverages; and, frankly, do not remem ber ever hearing any gossip that he  had such a problem. Service  in  the  U.S.  Senate  is  extremely  stressful.  Long hours, sometimes all night ses sions, periods of elation and periods of  depression-moments of victory  and  moments of defeat. Such stressful life  is conducive to drinking, and overin dulgence. While he, like all of us, has  faults, I never heard that John Tower  had a drinking problem or never saw  anything to give me concern during  the  time  I  served with him  in  the  Senate. I might say in passing that my  observation convinces me that the vast  majority-and I mean almost unani mously-of the Members of the Senate  do not have a drinking problem.  I have reviewed the FBI reports very  carefully. Such reports are not conclu sive as to whether he had a drinking  problem in the 1980's  that impaired  his judgment on issues in his official  governmental  capacities. Reasonable  people can read the reports and come  to different views as to the correctness  of the charges. Even if convinced that  he exhibited a drinking problem on oc casions, reasonable persons can differ  on the effect that it might have had  on his duties or the potential that it  might have on his responsibilities as  Secretary of Defense.  He has made a pledge that he will  not drink any alcoholic beverage of  any kind during his tenure as Secre tary of Defense, if confirmed. He said  that if he breaks that pledge he will  immediately resign. Should the Senate  accept such a pledge? Some say his  past conduct is such that his pledge  should not be accepted. But on  the  other hand, he says his pledge is tan tamount  to his oath  to def end and  support  the  Constitution  of  the  United States.  I believe  the  issue comes down  two questions. First,  if he were  to  to  ",1989
140,756,3,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, during the Ways  and Means Committee's February hearings on  the budget,  I was most  impressed by  the  statement of Dr. Rudolph Penner of the Urban  Institute.  He has done an exceptional job of broadly  explaining how we got into this mess, what it  means for our children, and some of the ways  we can get back on course so that our chil dren have a better  life. And he says,  the  debate on the budget trends,  All boils down to the question of what sort  of country we wish to leave to our descend ents and  fundamentally,  this  is  a moral  question. I find it very difficult to come up  with a moral rationale for doing much less  for our descendents than our ancestors did  for us.  The full text of his statement follows:  ECONOMIC AND BUDGET ISSUES  <Statement of Rudolph G. Penner,* Senior  Fellow, The Urban Institute)  Mr. Chairman and members of the com mittee, I would like to thank you for this  opportunity  to  testify  on  economic  and  budget issues.  THE ECONOMY  Since reaching its deepest post-World War  II  trough  in 1982,  the economy has per formed admirably. We are beginning  the  seventh year of an extremely healthy recov ery, manifested by the fact that inflationary  pressures are still moderate. There are no  obvious imbalances that signal that a reces sion is imminent, although it must be admit ted that recessions are seldom recognized  until after they begin.  The economy is, however, operating near,  if not at, full capacity, and demand is ex panding too rapidly by a very small margin.  Chairman Greenspan has emphasized his  concern about present rates of inflation and  the Federal Reserve System  is gradually  tightening monetary policy. It is an environ ment that leaves little room for error. Too  little tightness and inflation could acceler ate to the point that it will be very painful  to cure. Too much, and an economy that is  not extremely strong could sink into reces sion. Under  the circumstances,  I  believe  that the Federal Reserve is doing as skillful  a job as is possible.  I would like to see the Fed aim for about 6  percent nominal GNP growth over the next  two  years. That would maintain  slight  downward pressure on inflation. The Fed is   The views expressed are those of the author and  do not necessarily reflect the views of the trustees,  executives, or staff of the Urban Institute.  not explicit about its goals, but it seems to  me  that current policy  is,  in very  rough  terms, consistent with  this nominal GNP  goal. If I am right, that is likely to allow  much less real growth than is assumed by  the administration in its budget projections  and a bit less growth than is assumed by  CBO. That would put actual attainment of  the Gramm-Rudman targets beyond reach  politically, but  it will be much easier  to  reach them on paper using administration  assumptions. With any good luck economi cally, that should still be true next August.  Any deficit reduction that can be enacted  would be very helpful to the Federal Re serve. The same target for demand growth  could then be achieved with lower short term interest rates.  THE BUDGET DEFICIT  It has suddenly become stylish to argue  that budget deficits do not matter much. I  believe that that is far from the truth, but  it is easy to understand how such a belief  could arise.  Those who warned that some sort of eco nomic catastrophe would result from  the  deficit are said to have been proved wrong,  because the economy has behaved so well. I  would  provide  another  interpretation.  Those previously crying doom and gloom  may or may not have been wrong analytical ly, but I would argue that we shall never  know. Partly in response to worries about  the budget policies of the early 1980s, policy  was changed significantly. A steady series of  tax increases since the middle of 1982 is pro viding extra revenue equivalent to almost 3  percent of the GNP. Spending restraint has  been impressive both in the entitlement and  discretionary civilian budget categories. And  most important quantitatively for spending,  budget authority for defense began to be  cut in real terms by roughly 2 percent per  year starting in fiscal 1986.  As a result of such actions and the pro longed,  healthy  economic  recovery,  the  budget deficit has fallen, relative to GNP,  for a high of 6.3 percent in fiscal 1983 to 3.2  percent in fiscal 1988.  I, for one, am not  nearly as concerned as I was in the mid1980s after the interest bill on the debt rose  24 percent between 1983 and 1984, and the  problem  threatened  to explode. More  re cently, the interest bill has been rising at  less  than half that rate and has a good  chance of now stabilizing relative to GNP.  The probability that an exploding interest  bill will eventually force us to monetize the  debt and cause a hyper-inflation has become  miniscule.  Another fear of many is that the depend ence on foreign capital inflows engendered  by the budget deficit creates inherent insta bility  in  foreign  exchange markets  that  could lead to a foreign exchange crisis. This  possibility still exists, but my own worries  about  it  have waned  considerably  since  early 1988 when it became clear that we had  satisfactorily weathered the storm caused  by the October 1987 crash. I was also reas sured when private foreign investors, who  had greatly reduced lending to the United  States during 1987, returned in 1988. More over, the trade and current account deficits  improved considerably in 1988.  We are still, however, expecting foreign  investors to add significantly to their bal ances of dollar assets in percentage terms  this year and there are some signs that the  improvement  in our external balances  in  ending. Consequently, the probability of a  foreign exchange crisis is greater than zero,  but I believe that it is considerably lower  than it was only one year ago.  However, saying that the budget deficit is  unlikely to cause an economic crisis is far  from saying that it is not harmful. It is, in  fact, having highly undesirable effects, but  they are occurring slowly rather than all at  once. In fiscal 1988, the Federal deficit ab sorbed more than 60 percent of the nation's  net private saving. This extraordinary ratio  is a reflection both of the large relative size  of the Federal deficit compared to those of  past  history  and  the  unusually  small  amount of net private saving.  The low level of net private saving com bined with the high level of the Federal def icit implies that the nation's stock of net  wealth is growing very slowly and that our  generation is leaving our descendants with  much less capacity to improve their stand ard of living than our predecessors left us.  Moreover, our descendants will face the  burden that we  largely escaped. After the  first decade of the 21st century, the ratio of  the retired to working population will rise  rapidly. Therefore, if the United States re mains a  low saving, high deficit society,  income growth will be lower than it would  be otherwise and a greater portion of the  income growth will have to be transferred  from the working to the retired population.  Nevertheless, with any luck at all, future  workers should still be better off than cur rent workers. It is just that the rate of im provement from generation  to generation  will be much lower than the United States  has been accustomed to in past history. The  size of the American economy will decline  more rapidly relative to the size of other  economies and this is likely to weaken our  long-run military influence and our interna tional bargaining power in trade policy and  other matters.  It all boils down to the question of what  sort of country we wish to leave to our de scendants  and  fundamentally,  this  is  a  moral question.  I  find  it very difficult to  come up with a moral rationale for doing  much less for our descendants than our an cestors did for us.  THINKING ABOUT THE BUDGET STRATEGICALLY  Deficit reduction has been very difficult  for two reasons. First, the pain involved is  immediate in the form of program cuts or  higher taxes while  the gains  take a very  long time to accrue and are fairly nebulous.  Second, the issues are extraordinarily com plex and difficult to explain. That is be cause we are not only debating the effects  of the deficit per se, but we are simulta neously debating the proper role of the Fed eral government in our society. Those who  wish to solve the bulk of the deficit problem  through spending cuts clearly want a small er government that both provides few bene fits and interferes with our lives very little.  Those who want to solve the problem prie This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

141,782,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, with  respect to the FBI files, first, it ought  to be clear that what we are talking  about here is not just an FBI report.  There  are  also  committee  records  which contain a great deal of informa tion that is directly relevant to this  nomination. So if there is to be release  of any  information that is not now  public, it ought to include everything.  We ought not to be saying here that  .we just want the FBI file out but not  the full committee record  if we are  going to have full disclosure, and we  ought to have full disclosure.  The second point, the FBI files are  the property of the executive branch,  explicitly  stated  in writing  by  the  counsel to the President, who before  turning them over to the Senate for  access by Senators  required and  re ceived an explicit written commitment  from  the chairman and ranking Re publican member of the committee ac knowledging that the reports were the  property of the President and agreeing  at the request of the President not to  permit any publication of that materi al beyond the terms of the agreement  which was limited access to Members  of the Senate.  Now there is a certain irony in the  suggestion by those whose entire argu ment on the nomination itself is that  we should accede  to  the President's  wishes to now suggest that we should  make public a report in direct opposi tion to the President's wishes.  This the President's report. He has  provided it only on the explicit written  condition that the Senate in writing  acknowledged that it is his report and  agreed  in writing  that  it cannot be  made public.  I  note  the  ranking  Republican  member here. He is  the person who  signed the agreement and if I have in  any way misstated the facts with re spect to that I invite him to stand and  correct me.

142,782,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, if the  majority leader will yield, as far as I  know the majority leader made an ac curate rendition.  ",1989
143,782,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," I thank the Sena tor.  In  that  circumstance,  a  decision  must be made. Now,  if  the distin guished Republican  leader  or  any  Member of the Senate wishes to make  a motion that the :F'BI records and all  of the other relevant material should  be made public, each Senator is free to  do so, and we will deal with that re quest at the time it is made.  But it ought to be stated that no one  has made such a motion yet despite re peated discussion of it. The President  has not come forward to ask that the  terms of the written agreement be al tered and indeed it is my understand ing that the President's counsel, the  chairman of the committee, and the  ranking Republican member of  the  committee,  three men,  two of  them  Republicans, one Democrat, met, dis cussed the matter at some length and  agreed unanimously that the reports  should not be made public, and I be lieve that was reaffirmed by the Presi dent's spokesman as recently as yes terday afternoon.  Now, no one is required to make a  motion. I simply say that if someone  wishes to make a motion he is free to  do so, and we will, of course, deal with  that at that time. The distinguished  Republican leader is free to make that  motion.  In my view, if that is to be done, we  ought certainly to solicit the view of  the President  to  determine  if  the  President's view  is still what  it had  been  consistently  throughout  this  process, that the report should not be  made public.  I see the Republican leader. Does he  wish to respond? I am glad to yield.  ",1989
144,782,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  I  add:  Does the majority leader think we still  should be  investigating the nominee  yesterday and today, that we ought to  have Senator NuNN's investigators out  checking on Senator Tower yesterday  and today? Is that going to be made  public?  ",1989
145,782,3,Mr. MITCHELL., I would prefer to  consult with Senator NUNN before re sponding  to  that because  I  do not  know the full details myself.  ,1989
146,782,3,Mr. DOLE.," Just as a matter of fair ness, should we still be  investigating  the nominee?  ",1989
147,782,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," As I said I believe I  will be prepared  to respond  to that  when I have had a chance for full con sultation. I would simply note, when  the Republican leader asked rhetori cally are they there to help Senator  Tower, I have not understood any in vestigator to conduct an investigation  for  the benefit or detriment of  the  nominee.

148,795,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Arizona.  ,1989
149,795,3,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  I  intend to spend just a few minutes ex plaining  some of my views on  the  Tower nomination at this time.  First, I want to just point to the FBI  report with respect to certain allega tions. Some say that it is more than an  allegation, and I believe the report re futes what the Senator from Alaska  just said about Mr. Tower and  the  ""drinking problem."" The  committee  report states on page 10:  the  The record of  the FBI report and  the  committee's own review show a clear pat tern of excessive drinking and alcohol abuse  by Senator Tower during the 1970's.  It goes on:  Senator Tower and his close associates  and  friends have  conceded  that Senator  Tower had a drinking problem in the 1970's.  Even the administration has acknowledged  that the nominee had a pattern of excessive  drinking during this period. There is sub stantial evidence that this pattern contin ued in the 1980's.  So it is a little bit of an exaggeration  to  leave  the  record  stating  that  nobody can show that Senator Tower  had any drinking problem ever. Sena tor Tower, himself, says that he did,  and that is to his cr.edit. As anybody  knows who has dealt with people who  have  a  drinking problem, or other  abuse problems, the first step to solv ing it is to admit it. Senator Tower has  done that.  Let me point out, also, Mr. Presi dent,  in reference to retired military  people an organization known as High  Frontier. The  director  is  Lt. Gen.  Daniel 0. Graham. He was critical of  Mr. Tower because of his failure to be  strong enough, as the nominee for the  Secretary of Defense, on the strategic  defense  initiative. He also had some  other reservations.  I want to read a letter that he wrote  to Jack Rosenthal, the editor of the  New York Times, dated February 20,  1989. This letter indicates that there  are a  few  retired officers  from  the  military who have some real qualms  here. The letter reads:  DEAR SIR: Your story on the John Tower  confirmation  issue 08 Feb. 1989)  left the  impression that while I am concerned with  Tower's lukewarm position on SDI, I have  no problem with his personal  reputation.  That is not the case.  I  am  very much  concerned with Mr.  Tower's reputation for drinking and woman izing. No of.ffcer  in any of  the military  services would expect to be promoted if he  had such a reputation. Any ranking officer  that  acquired  such  a  reputation  could  expect to be asked to resign.  Senators should consult some retired mili tary leaders on this matter before they vote  on Mr. Tower's confirmation. Every retired  officer with whom  I have discussed  this  matter agrees with me that Tower's confir mation as Secretary of Defense would be a  serious detriment to the morale of the offi cer corps of the Army, Navy, Air Force and  Marines.  This is not to say that all military leaders  are sober and chaste. Far from it. But the  officer corps has yet to lower its standards  to the point where Mr. Tower's reputation  would be tolerated.  President Bush has certainly proven his  loyalty to a political ally-it is time that ally  proved his loyalty to Mr. Bush by withdraw ing. Mr. Tower should realize that the sen sationalist sector of the press will never let  the issue of his personal reputation die, a  fact that will severely damage his effective ness as Secretary of Defense.  Sincerely,  DANIEL 0. GRAHAM,  Lieutenant General, USA fRet.J  Mr. President, there are always two  sides to every story and certainly that  is what this debate is all about. This  debate should insure that all sides are  exposed, all questions are asked, and  all information made available.  Mr.  President, when  the  Senate  votes  on  the  nomination  of  John  Tower to be Secretary of Defense, I  am going to vote against the nominee.  After careful deliberation and consult ing with President Bush, I cannot in  good conscience or without serious res ervations, support this nominee.  In the context of deciding on this  vote, one standard that we should con sider is the importance of the position  of Secretary of Defense and Senator  Tower's suitability for this post. The  responsibilities of a Secretary of De fense are highly unique and vastly dif ferent from any other Cabinet post.  We should  seek, and  the American  people deserve,  a  candidate who  is  highly qualified, morally and ethically  ",1989
150,808,3,Mr. RUDMAN.," Let me just conclude  by  stating  that  the Senator  from  Washington  and  the Senator  from  Maine hit on very key points. The  Senator  from Arizona mentioned  a  while ago that he would like to have  the FBI  report  sanitized and made  public. I do not have a problem with  that except I know that the chairman  of the Armed Services Committee him self, in conversations we have had, has  agonized over  the  fact  that we  are  dealing with anonymous sources and  uncorroborated testimony. That is not  his fault. That is the system, and that  is the way it came here.  But this is so extraordinary. It just  seems  to me  that  to vote  this man  down  based  on  evidence  that well  could be furnished by people who are  lying, who are fabricating, who are uncorroborated,  and  uncross-examined,  sets a very troubling precedent.  I do not know what the solution is. I  see my good friend from South Caroli na is on the floor. I have worked with  Senator HOLLINGS  for  a  long,  long  time. I would have great confidence if  Senator HOLLINGS  and  the Senator  from New Mexico and  the Senator  from  the State of Washington,  just  three Senators I know have a  lot of  legal experience, could sit down with  some of these witnesses and examine  them  even  without  John  Tower  present.  I  think we would  find out  whether they were reliable or not.  I am talking about reliability, about  basic decency  to a human being so  that he can at least have his accusers  called to account for themselves.  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for  this courtesy, and I yield the floor.  UNITED NATIONS  ",1989
151,808,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  clerk will report the nomination.  The assistant legislative clerk read  the nomination of Thomas R. Picker ing, of New Jersey, to be the Repre sentative  of  the United States  of  America to the United Nations with  the rank and status of Ambassador  Extraordinary  and  Plenipotentiary,  and the Representative of the United  States of America  in  the Security  Council of the United Nations.  ",1989
152,808,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  time for debate on the nomination is  limited to 20 minutes to be equally di vided and controlled by the Senator  from Rhode Island. Senator PELL, and  the Senator from North Carolina, Sen ator HELMS, or their designees.  The Chair  recognizes  the Senator  from Rhode Island, Senator PELL.  ",1989
153,808,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I am very  pleased to support the nomination of  Thomas R. Pickering to be the next  American Ambassador to  the United  Nations. The Foreign Relations Com mittee unanimously approved his nom ination on February 28.  Ambassador Pickering has served in  the Foreign Service with great distinc tion. He  is one of only five Foreign  Service Officers to currently hold the  rank of Career Ambassador and only  32 others have been so honored since  the rank was established in the mid1950's. I believe it is a sign of the high  esteem in which he is held that Presi dent Bush nominated him to be our  Ambassador at the United Nations-a  post that has usually been reserved for  a political appointee.  Ambassador Pickering  is  fortunate  to have been nominated for this post  at a  time when public faith  the  United Nations is being restored. Over  the last year-in Afghanistan, the Per sian Gulf, and southern Africa-the  United Nations has demonstrated that  it has a valuable role to play in helpin  ing to bring stability and peace to the  troubled regions of the world.  These  successes,  together with an  improvement in the management prac tices  at  the United Nations,  even  moved the Reagan administration to  drop its harsh anti-U.N. rhetoric and  request  full  funding  for  the United  Nations  and  its  affiliated  agencies.  The Reagan  budget  also  requests  funds to begin to repay the large ar rearages we  have  accumulated over  the past 8 years. I was very pleased to  learn from Ambassador Pickering that  the Bush administration has adopted  these funding requests as its own.  I believe the time has come for the  United States to regain lost ground in  the United Nations. President Gorba chev's new activism in the United Na tions marks an important shift in the  Soviet approach to international orga nizations. The United States cannot  afford to stand idly by. We must use  our influence to lead the United Na tions  to new  triumphs,  rather  than  take it to the brink of bankruptcy. I  believe Ambassador Pickering  is  the  right man for the job.  My only regret is that Ambassador  Pickering has not been accorded Cabi net status as was his predecessor.  One final note. Ambassador Picker ing's nomination  to  the United Na tions-a spot usually reserved for po litical  appointees-generated  high  hopes  throughout the State Depart ment  that  the Bush administration  would  harness  the  experience  and  talent  of  our  professional  Foreign  Service. Since  then there have been  growing signs that the Foreign Service  is being locked out of the policymak ing process. I hope this development  can be attributed to the disorganiza tion  that  accompanies  Presidential  transitions, rather than any deliberate  design. As  the career of Ambassador  Pickering has demonstrated, the pro fessional Foreign Service can provide  invaluable advice and support to any  administration.  ",1989
154,808,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, during  the nomination hearings before  the  Foreign Relations  Committee,  and  prior to that, this Senator had person al conversations with Mr. Pickering.  He knows that I wish him well, for he  is wading into a real quagmire when  he goes to the United Nations.  If Mr. Pickering can improve any of  the aspects of anti-Americanism and  pro-Communist bias within the United  Nations, he would have performed his  job well.  Mr. President, the challenges faced  by the United States at the United Na tions are obviously significant. Indeed,  the United  States  remains  under  almost constant assault in that body.  At the same time, the United Nations  itself faces challenges of its own to es tablish itself as a relevant forum for  addressing international issues.  ",1989
155,821,3,Mr. RUDMAN., The majority leader  can state what he thought I said.  ,1989
156,821,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," You are placing a  qualification on your prior statement  which did not exist in the prior state ment. You said impaired, period. You  ended the sentence there in your prior  characterization.  ",1989
157,821,3,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. Majority Leader,  I  am not going  to get  into a  long  debate on this. I will state simply my  reading of that record, and I think it is  fair to comment within the purview of  rule XXIX what is and-not what is in  the  report but what  is not  in  the  report. I come to the conclusion read ing that report that I could find no  evidence that indicated that the nomi nee was impaired by the use of alcohol  during  the  conduct  of  his  official  duties. That is the full extent of my  statement. If I stated it some other  way, I did not intend to, but I  think  that is a fair statement.  ",1989
158,821,3,Mr. DOLE., Will the Senator yield?  ,1989
159,821,3,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Yes, sir.  ",1989
160,821,3,Mr. DOLE., The majority leader just  touched on something. The Senator  from South Carolina said this is a fact  that he  is a known alcohol abuser.  That is not a fact. That is his opinion.  ,1989
161,821,3,Mr. HOLLINGS., On the facts.  ,1989
162,821,3,Mr. DOLE.," There are no facts in the  FBI file to support it, but that can be  your opinion.  What I want to do  is go back and  check the cleaned-up RECORD against  the video of floor proceedings before I  respond  fully  to  the Senator  from  South Carolina because  I  think  the  RECORD has been cleaned up a  little  since his strong words on the floor last  week.  You may be having a lot of fun kick ing our friend all over the place. He is  our friend. We have known him for 24  years. It was not some stranger you  were kicking around over  there. He  was a man we served  in the Senate  with. You may have gotten a  lot of  kicks out of saying ""crocked,"" and all  those words right out of the report,  and then coming in and saying John  Tower is a known alcohol abuser. That  is an opinion, just as much as the ma jority leader gets a little testy because  the Senator from New Hampshire has  an opinion.  We are still trying to figure out some  way  to get  this nominee confirmed,  and I do not believe  those kinds of  statements about John Tower.  I say to my friend from South Caro lina, I will be glad to discuss this with  him privately, or maybe he wants to  go out and make that statement when  not protected by speaking from  the  Senate floor.  ",1989
163,821,3,Mr. HOLLINGS., I have.  ,1989
164,821,3,Mr. DOLE., Go out and call him in  public an alcohol abuser.  ,1989
165,821,3,Mr. HOLLINGS., I will. I will make  talks all over South Carolina and justi fy my vote. I would be delighted to do  to alcohol abuse  so. Do not worry about that. If I can  get the floor back.  ,1989
166,821,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from South Carolina.  ,1989
167,821,3,Mr. DOLE., That  is an opinion.  I  think the majority leader will agree  that is an opinion.  ,1989
168,821,3,Mr. HOLLINGS.," I am not changing  my record right now. I am saying as a  matter of record alcohol abuse, and I  mean  it because  I  have  seen  those  words from different witnesses totally  unrelated, all coming together, and I  said just to bring it into focus so it is  not back there where you are trying  cases 17 years ago, back in the seven ties and everything else, bring it right  on up from 1983 right on up to today.  Six-well, less than 7 years, right at 6  years. I will point out in the RECORD as  fact that he was seen crocked, that he  was seen comatose and all of  those  other words that we use, and I did use  it off the floor. I have the record right  here, a news conference, so  I have  stated that. I have the record to sub stantiate it.  Now, Mr. President, you get into this  dancing around the bush, and I ref er  particularly to March 5, Sunday, the  interview on ""Face the Nation"" with  Leslie Stahl. On page 7, Ms. Stahl, to  Senator Tower:  ""You've admitted  yourself.""  ""Senator Tower: I've admitted to ex cessive drinking in the 1970's.""  ""Ms. Stahl: Well,  this says alcohol  abuse. It doesn't say dependence. It  says alcohol abuse.""  ""Senator Tower: What says alcohol  abuse?""  ""Ms. Stahl: The guideline  military.''  ""Senator Tower: Yes, but I've said  excessive drinking, not alcohol abuse.  There's a difference.""  And Ms. Stahl says: Oh, Senator, but  pardon me; how are you doing? What  in  the world are we  talking about  here?  I don't find  that difference.  I  don't find that difference at all.  My  friend  from Florida has been  more than generous and considerate of  me. He has tried to clear this particu lar record.  I have pointed  to  those  times. I can go into other things, but I  apologize for taking that much time.  It is quite obvious to me when they  say-just a minute ago-there  is no  fact to support that opinion. You can  believe 1 witness against 12, or 12 wit nesses against 1. The jury is allowed to  do that and they are charged with the  duty of doing that as to who are the  credible witnesses.  I  find a witness  is credible,  I  find  him corroborated, I find him categori cal, and that is why I use those words,  because  they  are pretty categorical  when you say you are bombed and you  are comatose. That tells me there is al cohol abuse. And when I  look at the  military generally, I know the gentle man  could not  serve  in  command.  in  the  When I look at it specifically, having  just been under the nuclear Navy, not  just as an officer, but an enlisted man,  since we are defending enlisted men,  he could not serve on the crew of the  U.S.S. Tennessee. I am being specific. I  have  just gotten off  it  last month.  That gentleman, if he is not qualified  in  this man's mind  to serve on the  crew of the U.S.S. Tennessee, heavens  above, do not ask me to confirm him  as Secretary of Defense.  I yield the floor, by the unanimous  consent agreement, back to the Sena tor from Florida.  ",1989
169,821,3,Mr. DOLE.," Will  the Senator from  Florida  yield  2 minutes? Again,  I  apologize.  The PRESIDING Of FICER. The  Senator from Kansas is _ecognized for  2 minutes.  ",1989
170,821,3,Mr. DOLE.," We have just had more  expressions right out of the FBI file not  report-from  the Senator  from  South Carolina, repeating words that  have  already  been  spoken on  this  floor. Maybe, according to the Chair's  opinion, that is fair game, once they  are in the public domain. But I  just  make  the  same plea  I  have made  before. If we want to go and just assas sinate somebody's character, we can  do it right here on the floor and we  can all be protected. It does not make  any difference who it is but this hap pens to be someone we served with.  Seventy-one of us are still here.  I would like  to know what we are  trying to do to John Tower. What has  he ever done to us to deserve this kind  of treatment, that he deserves these  kinds of  statements on  the Senate  floor? ""Alcoholic abuser""? That may  be someone's opinion but it is not sup ported by the evidence. And how far is  it going to go if this debate gets bitter?  So far it has been fairly tame. We are  prepared to go the rest of this week  and into next week because we want  this nomination confirmed. We want  to convince Senators on this floor that  John Tower is qualified, that his fit ness and competency has been deter mined by the President of the United  States, and that there is no reason, at  least no legitimate reason, not to vote  for his confirmation.  Now, if you do not like John Tower,  as I said, that is one thing. But I do  not know why John Tower deserves  outbursts  from  the  Senator  from  South Carolina. I am going to work  with the Senator from South Carolina  to try to get some of this report re leased. As he said on the floor, ""Just  take 1 hour and it will all be over."" I  do not think so. In 1 hour, it might be  over-we might be voting for confir mation. We are not going to sell John  Tower short because we know him and  the  Senator  from  South Carolina  knows him. He said on this floor, ""I  never saw  the Senator  from Texas,  Senator Tower, inebriated.""  ",1989
171,847,3,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing the Sole Community  Hospital Preservation Act of 1989, a  bill that guarantees adequate access to  health care to rural Americans.  We cannot wait to provide this guar antee.  The  financial  pressures  on  access critical hospitals are building,  and corrective action is needed during  the lOlst Congress to avert a human  and economic disaster in rural Amer ica.  To understand how we have come to  this precipice,  it  is  important to re member that the Medicare Prospective  Payment System [PPS] was designed  to  increase  hospital  efficiency  and  reduce costs, not improve, or maintain,  access  to health care. With  this  in  mind, let's examine the consequences,  both good and bad, that have taken  place as a  result of the move  from  Medicare cost-based reimbursement to  prospective payment.  Considering its goals, PPS has been  exceedingly  successful.  Indeed,  a  recent  report  in  the New England  Journal  of Medicine  by Dr. Alice  Rivlin of Rutgers University, estimates  that in 1990 PPS will reduce hospital  insurance trust fund payments by $18  billion. This represents a  significant  contribution to our important job of  cutting the Federal budget deficit.  PPS has accomplished this efficien cy by careful peer review  to reduce  hospital admissions, and by providing  an averaged per-case payment  that  allows Congress  to  establish Medi care's annual expenditure for hospi tals in advance. However, for this aver aged payment to be equitable, for ex ample,  to  average  reimbursement  losers and winners, a hospital must  maintain an adequate patient volume.  When volume is  low a  few high-cost  cases make hospitals lose money. They  are inefficient.  In a competitive health care environ ment, particularly when 50 percent or  more of a hospital's discharges are  paid  for  by Medicare,  the  conse quences of inefficiency can be harsh.  These consequences  include progressive reduction of capital reserves,  in ability  to  acquire  new  technology,  physician dissatisfaction with services  leading to a further reduction of ad missions, and ultimately, bankruptcy  and closure.  Over the past 4 years 233 hospitals  have  closed  nationwide, more  than  half in rural areas.  When we are told that there may be  300,000  excess hospital beds  in  this  country, is the closure of a hospital a  bad  thing? Well, we need  to define  what we mean by bad.  Let's say the hospital is in Chicago, a  city with  a  population  of  about  3,010,000 and a metropolitan area of  228 square miles. Chicago has 47 hos pitals or about one hospital for every 5  square miles. If a hospital closes  in  Chicago, patients can just go down the  street to another facility. Their staff  will be hired by other hospitals. The  biggest transportation block to access  is the crosstown traffic.  Now if this is an inner city hospital,  and the patients are without health  insurance, there could be problems; or,  if the hospital is investor-owned, the  investors will lose money. In general,  however, access  to care will not be  jeopardized.  But let's say the hospital is in Mon tana. My State has about 809,000 resi dents spread out over 145,392 square  miles. There are 60 acute care hospi tals  or  1  hospital  for  every  2,423  square miles.  Of these 60 hospitals, 54 are the sole  provider in the town. The average bed  size for these 54 hospitals is 36. If the  41-bed  hospital  in Lewistown, MT  closed, folks in Fergus County might  have to go upwards of 100 miles to the  next nearest hospital. The staff can't  be  reemployed, so  they move away.  When people move away, the economy  of the town atrophies.  Access  critical  hospitals  are  not  unique to Montana. Most States have  at least one. It's just that most hospi tals in Montana qualify as access criti cal or  frontier hospitals. Mr. Presi dent, Congress needs to recognize the  price of efficiency to the people who  live  in  towns  like Circle, MT. When  these hospitals close,  the problem is  not  that  investors  lose money. The  problem is that people lose access to  care, and, perhaps, people die.  Now the folks living in rural Amer ica  are  good people who generally  don't like  to complain. Many would  just as soon be left alone by govern ment to work out their own problems.  As  long as  they're getting an even  shake. But they aren't.  I have looked long and hard at the  Medicare laws. Nowhere can I find any  suggestion  in the  law that a  senior,  who diligently contributes to the Med icare trust fund but who happens to  live in rural America, is to be penalized  by less adequate access to health care  ",1989
172,873,3,Mr. LOWERY of California.," Mr. Speaker,  in  times of many troubled health care systems. I  would like to bring your attention to a medical  success story in the San Diego area.  I would  also like to commend the fine staff of Balboa  Naval Hospital, and their commanding officer,  Capt. Carl Wesolowski. Given  the status of  military health care, Balboa stands as a role  model  for  the  entire military  health  care  system.  I would  like  to share with my col leagues excerpts  from  this article which de scribes in further detail the first anniversary of  the new Balboa Naval Hospital. This article by  Mr. Robert Dietrich,  app,eared  in  the San  Diego Tribune on January 31, 1989.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  NEW NAVAL HOSPITAL CELEBRATES FIRST  ANNIVERSARY, PATIENT ""BOOM""  <By Robert Dietrich>  Capt. Carl Wesolowski, who commands  the nation's largest naval medical center,  served hamburgers  to some of  the 3,000member staff of San Diego Naval Hospital  yesterday as they celebrated the first anni versary of the institution's new $260 million  facility.  ""It wouldn't have worked without them,""  the captain said, ""and we are doing things  we weren't doing a year ago-we're increas ing access to medical care.""  The new hospital, in Balboa Park's Flori da Canyon, has  a  daily patient  load of  2,000-twice the number that were treated  at  the  facility  it  replaced. The original  Naval Hospital in Balboa Park was begun in  the 1920s and most of its buildings are now  being razed. The site was transferred to the  city in a land-swap negotiation.  Wesolowski acknowledged that the hospi tal could not begin  to meet  the medical  needs of all the estimated 400,000 San Diego  County military personnel, retired person nel and dependents entitled to care there.  But he said breakthroughs in medical ad ministration have allowed him  to expand  patient loads  ""We expanded our <in-hospital) primary care clinic by adding civilian doctors to the  staff,"" he  said.  ""In June 1987, we were  seeing 50 primary-care patients a day. Now  we are seeing 200-and that is seven days a  week.""  Primary-care clinics  in Tierrasanta and  the South Bay each see an additional 200 to  300 patients a day, he added.  ""Our  specialty  clinics  have  raised  the  daily patient  load  from  1,000  a  day  to  2,000,"" he said. ""We recently reached an in patient population of 427-and that includes  retirees and their dependents.""  Wesolowski also gave the Navy's civilian  physician partnership program-authorized  in 1987-high marks in expanding care for  military beneficiaries.  THANKS TO GREGORY M. GILL  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 7, 1989  ",1989
173,873,3,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  it is all  to infre quent that we stop to thank the staff of those  people who make this institution run.  I would  like to do just that today, to recognize and say  thanks to a member of my staff, Gregory M.  Gill, who is leaving us to take up a great chal lenge as drug policy coordinator  for Prince  George's County, MD.  Greg joined my staff more than 5 years ago,  after working  for the Maryland State Senate  for 3 years. He has served in all his time with  me as an associate staff member for the Ap propriations Committee, with special concen tration on  two Subcommittees: Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education and District  of Columbia.  Every one who has met Greg and worked  with him has been impressed with his commit ment,  his  humor and with  the breadth of  knowledge he has developed about Govern ment programs ranging from AIDS research to  Head Start. He has made an important contri bution to our country's domestic agenda. Like  3661  most staff members, however,  that contribu tion is known only to a few. Greg has been an  invaluable advisor, right arm and friend to me.  Now he faces even greater challenges. The  drug epidemic is the most serious problem af fecting our region. Greg has been asked by  our country executive to coordinate all phases  of our local fight against drugs. The future of  so many young people depend on his efforts.  I know he is up to this new challenge, and I  hope all my colleagues will join me in thanking  Greg Gill for his contributions and wishing him  Godspeed.  END OF COMMUNISM IN  EUROPE?  HON. TOM LEWIS  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 7, 1989  ",1989
174,873,3,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I insert  the enclosed article, ""End of Communism  in  Eastern  Europe?""  by  rny  constituent, Mr.  Arthur Burck, in Extensions of Remarks:  [From the Palm <FL> Beach Post, Oct. 23,  1988]  END OF COMMUNISM IN EASTERN EUROPE?  <By Arthur Burck)  In touring the six nations on the Danube  River during recent weeks, my wife and I  observed conditions that could portend the  beginning of the end of communism in East ern Europe.  It is coincidental that just after the end of  World War II in 1945, I visited these very  same nations at a  time when I concluded  that it was inevitable that the Soviet occu pation forces would bring lasting commu nism to five of these nations-Hungary, Ru mania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Bul garia-thereby slamming shut an Iron Cur tain.  Our trip  just happened to be at a  time  when, as a possible consequence of Mikhail  Gorbachev's  perestroika,  the  troubled  economies  of Yugoslavia, Hungary  and  Czechoslovakia were in ferment, leading to  turmoil among the communist leaders that  in time could undermine communism in the  Eastern Bloc, especially since despotic Ru mania and Bulgaria also are ripe for similar  turmoil.  When World War II ended, the major ob stacle to a  lasting peace was the question  whether  the  six nations  in  the Danube  basin would lose their independence by be coming communist satellites of the Soviet  Union. <Austria slipped out of  the Soviet  noose in 1955 and today is a thriving show place of capitalistic democracy.) In October  1945, Sen. Claude Pepper, then a leader in  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  embarked on a five-week investigative tour  of these nations, and the U.S. Army ordered  me, an Army captain stationed  in Rome  awaiting return to my civilian position as a  Wall Street lawyer, to assist Sen. Pepper as  special aide.  We spent days in intensive conversations  with  communist  leaders-Marshal  Josip  Broz Tito, as house guests in his Belgrade  palace, Field Marshal  Ivan S. Koniev  in  Viennta, Austria, Field Marshal Klementiy  Voroshilov in Budapest, Hungary, as well as  countless Soviet officials of lesser stature.  One fact emerged crystal clear.

SOME OF THE REAGAN  CUTS  ARE  UNCONSCIONABLE  AND  OUGHT TO BE CORRECTED  <Mr. BENNETT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1989
176,886,3,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, when I  was home  in  Jacksonville, FL,  last  weekend, a widow of a Navy officer  told me that her allotment from her  husband's pension that was set aside  in a contract between the Navy and  her husband, which allotted her so  much money, has now been reduced  because she also gets Social Security.  This was an attack upon entitlements  which she could not understand.  I cannot understand it either.  When I realize the tremendous cuts  that were made in taxes at the begin ning of  the  last administration and  that we are now catching up that kind  of money out of the hides of  little  people and out of the contracts we  have had with people for entitlements,  which  they have earned under con tract, I think it is unconscionable and  ought to be corrected.  To selectively impose such financial  loss on the retired serviceman who has  served his country long and loyally and on the widows of such retirees-is  bureaucracy at its worst, and is plainly  unjust.  there must  be  sacrifices  for  budget balancing, then let the burden  fall equally across an comparable pro grams.

178,886,3,Mr. HASTERT.," Mr. Speaker,  this  past weekend  I was  invited by  the  Warrenville, IL, Kiwanis Club to come  to their weekly meeting and accept a  check  for $100-a small amount as  budget discussions go on  this  floor.  But  the check  is  for an  important  cause.  The check is made out to the U.S.  Treasury and is earmarked for reduc tion of  the national debt. It comes  from the 55 members of the Warren ville Kiwanis Club and is an indication  of the urgency that some of us view  our fiscal situation. The Kiwanis mem bers have decided they cannot sit back  and wait for someone else to take care  of this problem. And they have chal lenged the 9,000 other Kiwanis Clubs  to match their contribution.  Mr. Speaker, we should heed an im portant message from America's heart land-Warrenville is a community of  less than 10,000. Our foremost priority  this session should be  to make  rea soned decisions  targeting  the waste  that we all know exists in our Federal  programs.

179,899,3,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  the life and accomplishments of a good friend  and a pioneer  in  the arts, Ms. Didi Daniels  Peters, well-known producer,  publicist, and  community  activist,  and wife  of world-re nowned  actor I singer  and  producer Brock  Peters, died in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb ruary 25, 1989, after an extended illness. She  was 59 years old.  The Philadelphia, PA, native was cofounder,  with her husband Brock, of Maga Link,  Inc.,  which created Communications Bridge  Insti tute, the first institution  in the Nation for the  professional career training in videotape tech nology of low-incomed minorities, and women.  Maga Link,  Inc., was recently named by  the  Corporation  for Public Broadcasting as  the  CPB Consortium for Blad' Programming to the  Public Broadcasting System  for the develop ment, production, and distribution of program ming to stations nationally and to PBS educa tional and cultural institutions.  Ms. Peters was  one  of  the  first  black  women  television producers  in  the country.  One of her productions, ""Jazz Party,"" the first  regular  television series on  jazz, earned her  an Emmy Award  nomination. As  assistant  publicity director  for United Artists Records,  she became one of the first female executives  within the record industry.  She was founder of the Dance Theater of  Harlem Advisory Board and Guild and found ing board member of the Museum of African  American Art. Ms. Peters was also one of the  founders of the Media Forum, an organization  consisting of a group of eminent media per sonalities who produce seminars, forums, and  concerts designed to inform the public about  media  imagemaking. This group's  television  special,  ""Voices of our People,"" won  ten  Emmy awards in 1984. She also served as a  trustee of the Bella Lewitzky Dance Founda tion and of the Dance Gallery, a group which  constructed  the  first  theater ever built  for  dance in the history of the art form. This facili ty is located in downtown Los Angeles.  The jazz lover was once the owner/produc er of WNCN  in New York,  the  first all-jazz  radio station in the United States. This station,  which  set  the precedent  for such stations  which folJowed, featured major musicians and  critics as regular disc jockeys. Included were  ""Cannonball"" Adderly, Duke Ellington, Horace  Silver,  Leonard Feather, Nat Hentoff,  and  others. She later became the national funding  director of the NAACP for which she created  the national ""Bank of Stars,"" a year of con cert tours in major cities which featured stars  of music, poetry, and literature. As a tribute to  this project, Max Roach wrote his ground breaking ""Freedom Now Suite.""  Having become highly discontent with  the  quality of black-oriented  films  of  the  late  1960's and the early 1970's, Ms. Peters and  her husband started a production company,  Delbro Enterprises. This company produced  such award-winning projects as  the PBS-TV  special  ""This Far by Faith"" and  the  feature  film, ""Five on the Black Hand Side,"" a family  comedy which broke the ""blaxploitation"" trend  of this period.  This uniquely creative husband and wife  team also produced numerous internationally  acclaimed benefit events  for the  issues and  organizations to which they were both commit ted.  Included are the ""Harlem Homecoming""  series for the Dance Theater of Harlem; ""Hal lelujah"" at the Forum; ""Soul Food at the Wal dorf""  for  the Free Southern Theater;  ""The  American Tap Show"" for the Dance Gallery,  and the Olympics Arts Festival.  Ms. Peters earned here M.A. degree in po litical science and administration with honors  under a fellowship at Howard University. She  later studied at the University in Copenhagen,  as a  fellow of  the Scandinavian American  Foundation. Her works have also been cited  into  the U.S. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on  three  occasions. Her  awards  include  the  NAACP National Humanitarian  Image Award;  the Delta Sigma Theta Fortitude Award; was  named as one of the 1 O most distinguished  black women  in 1984 by  the NAACP Legal  Defense Fund;  the Rosa Parks Award of the  U.S.C. Black Woman's Caucus  in 1982. She  has also been the recipient of many citations  from mayors, Governors, State, and national  legislators, and  leaders  for her outstanding  professional and community activities.  During a  recent  interview,  the  legendary  achiever was asked about that in her career  of which she was most proud. ""That's an easy  one,"" she readily responded. ""I am proudest  of my part in creating Maga Link,  Inc., which  now trains over 35 percent women for 'behind  the camera'  jobs and  the Dance Theater of  Harlem which destroyed the stereotypical view  that blacks didn't have the  'arch' for ballet.""  She continued, ""But I am filled with both pride  and joy as I look back over the 27-year 'Brock  and Didi' partnership. There have been a lot  of  liberal and  sensitive men who  opened  those 'first' doors for me. I was lucky enough  to marry one who has understood what  the  word 'partner' really means.""  ",1989
180,899,3,Mrs. COLLINS.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with a  deep sense of sorrow  that  I join  the distin guished Member  from Texas, Congressman  MICKEY  LELAND,  the Congressional  Black  Caucus, and  the  thousands of voices  today  that are resounding as one  to speak on  the  life and legacy of Didi Daniels Peters-an ac complished producer, publicist, and communi ty activists. But even more f ondty to remem ber, she  is the wife of world-renowned artist  Brock Peters.  Mr. Speaker, as I take his moment to reflect  on  the  life of one of history's most powerful  black women,  I cannot help but to enunciate  those words that the founder of the National  Council of Negro Women, Mary McCloud Be thune, has bestowed upon women of color as  a guiding  light on  the road  to success. She  stated, ""when the door of opportunity opens  be ready to put your foot in.""  Venturing into a field that was heavily domi nated by men and equally nonminorities, Didi  Daniels Peters premiered in the television in dustry as one of the first black women televi sion producers in the country. Turning to the  recording  industry, she  is acknowledged,  in  her capacity as an assistant publicity director  for United Artists Records, as one of the first  female executives in the record business.  The Dance Theater of Harlem, which many  of us in the Congress have enjoyed over the  years, could not have realized its importance  or diversified potential without the  insight of  Didi who recognized  the need to set up  the  Dance Theater of Harlem advisory board. And  the  list of her many achievements goes on  and on.  But Mr. Speaker, there is one important ele ment  in her memoirs  that captures  the es sence of Didi Daniels Peters. ts it not a beauti ful  testimony of life when a man and woman  can come  together  in a  ""partnership."" Re sponding  to  the question of  the most proud  moment in her career she stated, ""But I am  filled with both pride and  joy as  I look back  over the 27-years 'Brock and Didi' partnership.  There have been a lot of liberal and sensitive  men who opened those 'first' doors for me. I  was lucky enough to marry one who has un derstood  what  the  word  'partner'  really  means.""  Mr. Speaker, it is always a moment of sad ness to learn of the passing of one who has  contributed so greatly to  the social, political,  and cultural development of this Nation. So as  we speak about Didi Daniels Peters today reflect in silence on her today-let us remem ber her as a gift of love which we were given  to learn from and to enjoy.  ",1989
181,899,3,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with deep  sadness that I rise today to pay my respects  to a dedicated and motivated woman, Mrs.  Didi Daniels Peters. Didi, a long-time, personal  friend passed away on Saturday, February 25,  1989, after struggling with an extended illness.  Didi will be remembered not only as a won derfully caring individual, but also as a shining  star of the black community who contributed  to the enlightenment of our society. Didi was a  well  respected producer, publicist, and com munity activist and will  truly be missed by  those of us who were privileged enough  to  know her. She was a true inspiration to us all.  Together with her husband, Brock Peters, a  world-renowned actor, singer, and producer,  they worked to improve miniority participation  and portrayal in film and television, as well as  greatly enhanced our cultural  involvement in  the arts.

182,912,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, will  the  distinguished  leader  yield  to  accept one question, a brief question?  ",1989
183,912,3,Mr. MITCHELL., I yield.  ,1989
184,912,3,Mr. WARNER.," I thank the Senator.  As we look at these windows of history, depending on whether there is a  Democrat  or  a Republican  in  the  White House, indeed we can come up  with statistics as the majority leader  represents, but  let us  take  the big  window, 200 years in which we have  had 540-I will correct the record to be  exact-nominations by a President for  members to serve in the Cabinet. Yet,  only eight have been rejected by the  U.S. Senate. What is it about this case  that elevates or lowers  it, whichever  way one wishes to go, to the category  that he would be the ninth?  ",1989
185,912,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," The case against is  stronger  than  the case against was  when you opposed Democratic nomi nees.  I  thank the Senator, and yield the  floor  to  the Senator  from Rhode  Island.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  BRYAN).  The Senator  from Rhode  Island is recognized.  ",1989
186,912,3,Mr. PELL.,"  I  thank  leader for his courtesy.  Mr. President, the decision on the  nomination of Senator Tower is a very  difficult one for me because the argu ments pro and con are so evenly bal anced.  On the one hand, he is the choice of  our President, and he is unquestion ably  competent  and  highly  experi enced in matters of defense and arms  control.  On the other hand, however, his re lationship with the defense  industry  has clearly compromised his position  and reflected adversely on his  judg ment; not only has he realized sub stantial personal gain on the basis of  his prior Government service, but he  has established business connections  with such a broad range of defense  contractors, that it would be difficult  for him to perform as Secretary with out at least an appearance of conflict  of interest.  I also fear that the fallout of pro tracted debate over  this and other  problems  would  deprive  Senator  Tower, were he to become Secretary of  Defense, of  the  respect and  regard  that the men and women of our armed  services should accord to that office.  the majority  I very much regret that this debate  has become  so partisan  in nature.  While I fully honor the desire of our  colleagues on  the other side of  the  aisle to support their President's nomi nation, I do feel that many of us on  this side have genuine doubts on the  matter that should transcend any con siderations of partisanship.  In this regard, I take note of the re straint and sensitivity with which Sen ator NUNN has comported himself as  has  the majority  leader,  Senator  MITCHELL, and indeed as has the Presi dent, our President, I would add, of all  of us.  On balance, while I would normally  vote for  the President's choice, par ticularly when that individual is an old  colleague and friend, in this case I do  believe it is in our Nation's best inter est for the President to make another  choice  and  should  the  nomination  come to a vote, it is my intention to  vote ""no.""  I thank the Chair.  ",1989

188,912,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  I  wonder if our distinguished colleague  would stand for just a question. I have  had the privilege for a decade here  now of serving with the distinguished  chairman of  the Foreign Relations  Committee. We have made many trips  together and we have debated the his tory of this institution. We have cov ered many subjects together.  But was I correct in taking a note  down  in the Senator's opening com ment he felt that the pros and cons of  this case were evenly balanced? Was I  correct in that note?  ",1989
189,912,3,Mr. PELL., I hope the Senator was  not. What I meant to say was it was so  evenly balanced.  ,1989
190,912,3,Mr. WARNER., I beg the Senator's  pardon.  ,1989
191,912,3,Mr. PELL., It was so evenly balanced.  ,1989
192,912,3,Mr. WARNER., Depict  the  scales  there.  ,1989
193,912,3,Mr. PELL., Depict them like this and  on balance I  think I come out nega tively.  ,1989

195,912,3,Mr. PELL., It was to keep you guess ing.  ,1989
196,912,3,Mr. WARNER.," The question that I  would ask my distinguished colleague  is,  if history reflects that only eight  times this institution has seen fit to  veto the judgment of a President of  the United States over the course of  these 200 years, I think you can inf er  from that that it takes just more than  a degree or  two off  the scales, but  indeed it has a heavy burden, a heavy  burden of factual evidence, and yet as  I  listened  to my distinguished  col league,  I  heard  the  refrain  it was  evenly balanced.

201,925,3,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, we  just  heard a speech which referred, in part,  to a contamination of the process and  leakage by forces, presumably outside  the Senate. Let us be clear about what  has happened. I wish to refer to an ar ticle  in  the New York Times  of  Sunday,  February  26;  the  Sunday  before this debate began. The article  says,  in part, ""White House officials        outlined their plan to draft a 6or 7-page summary of the secret 300page FBI report,"" et cetera. ""The White House-official went on to de scribe 7 of the 12 allegations.""  This article then goes on to provide  a lengthy summary, including volumi nous details  taken directly from  the  FBI report, presented by a person who  identified himself  to  this newspaper  reporter, Bernard Weinraub,  as  a  White House official.  We are all  familiar with  the fact  that the White House first presented  the FBI report in a partisan forum to  Republican members of the committee  in a meeting to which Democratic Sen ators were not invited and of which  they were not made aware. It is not  my purpose in stating these facts to  express  anger  about  those  events,  which have long since been analyzed  and discussed thoroughly on the floor  of this body.  But I off er that incident again as a  counter to the implication on the part  of some of my colleagues  that  this  process has somehow been contami nated by  the committee itself or by  the majority in this body.  Mr. President,  there are a  lot of  issues  that need discussion  in  this  debate. They have all been discussed.  This Senator is ready to vote. I believe  this body is ready to vote. I believe the  country is ready for us to vote.  This has gone on too long. But, since  our colleagues on the Republican side  of the aisle continue to serve notice  that they want to drag this out and  have even more time devoted to it, I  will discuss the issues as I see them.  First of all, the issue involving the  charge of partisanship. Others have  noted the record, but let me ref er to it  briefly. We have had 21 nominations  sent to the U.S. Senate by President  Bush. Twenty  of  them have  been  voted upon. All 20 of the nominations  have been approved in committee by a  unanimous vote of every single Demo cratic Senator. All 20 of them have  been approved on the floor by unani mous vote of every single Democratic  Senator.  One of the nominations had one ab stention in committee, when a Repub lican member of  the committee ab stained. One of the nominations had  one opposing vote on the floor of the  Senate when a Republican Senator  voted against the nomination.  Most all have been by votes of 100 to  nothing, or 99  to nothing. It is not,  Mr. President, a  record of partisan ship. For anyone  to suggest that we  have dealt with  the nominations of  this President in a partisan fashion is  for that person to simply ignore the  record, which is overpowering on that  point.  Why  is  it that  the nomination of  John Tower is being treated different ly from all of the other 20 nomina tions  that have been sent  to us?  I  would answer that question, Mr. Presi dent, with another question. Why is it  that President Bush himself  treated  this nomination differently from all of  the other nominations  that he has  sent to the U.S. Senate?  President Bush  has  known  John  Tower probably longer than anyone in  this body. He has been a close person al friend and political ally of John  Tower  for  a  long  period  of  time,  dating,  I  am  told, back  to  the  late  1950's. In spite of that friendship and  political alliance, Mr. President, Presi dent Bush was evidently wracked by  doubts as to whether or not it was wise  for him to nominate John Tower. If  the merits of this nomination are so  crystal clear, as our Republican col leagues and some of our Democratic  colleagues would have us believe, why  then did President Bush  require as  much time to consider the nomination  as the Armed Services Committee re quired to consider whether or not to  give its assent to the confirmation?  We all know the answer. He was un certain about whether  this was  the  correct nominee. And, Mr. President,  when he finally rejected the advice of  many in his circle of advisors who said,  ""Don't nominate John Tower; he's not  the man for the job,"" when President  Bush  finally decided  to  reject  their  advice, finally decided  to discard his  own doubts, finally decided to resolve  the matter in favor of his  longtime  personal friend and political ally, he  had, at that point, seen only the first  of the seven volumes of information  that were  later  presented  to  the  Armed Services Committee.  So, Mr. President, when I hear some  of our colleagues express amazement  that anyone could consider opposing  this nomination, or anyone could look  at the record and find some legitimate  basis for doubt, I am moved to wonder  what in  the world was going on  in  President Bush's mind all that time  when he was  trying  to  figure  out  whether or not he could go forward  with  the  nomination  of  his  close  friend.  Nevertheless, after President Bush  finally  resolved his doubts and sent  the nomination to the committee, it  was clear that Democrats on the com mittee anticipated a favorable vote to  confirm this nomination. Some have  pointed  to  the  laudatory statements  on the opening day of the proceedings  that most every member of the com mittee made. I made such a statement,  and, Mr. President, I fully anticipated  supporting  the confirmation of Mr.  Tower. I entered the process support ing him, liking him personally, believ ing that he had all the requisite expe rience and skill to be highly effective.  That was before any of the evidence  had been presented.  When did  things start  to change?  Mr. President,  I,  along with  some  other members of the committee, was  genuinely  surprised  and  then  con cerned at the scope of the business ar rangements to which Senator Tower  testified in the early part of the pro ceedings. I was surprised and then con cerned at the rapid sequence of Gov ernment service, followed by employ ment as a consultant for the defense  industry, to be quickly followed again  by Government service in the highest  possible capacity relating to defense.

202,938,3,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I would  like to congratulate my colleague from  Nebraska. I am somewhat saddened by  the fact that his maiden speech on the  floor was on a subject that he prob ably would not have preferred to talk  about, as he expressed very well. But  we saw in BoB KERREY  for the first  time on  the Senate  floor what has  made him particularly attractive  to  Nebraskans; how we have revered him  as a Vietnam Medal of Honor winner;  how we revered him as an outstanding  Governor. And I want to compliment  him for his well put remarks on the  matter at hand.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  SANFORD). The Senator from Virginia  [Mr. WARNER] is recognized.  ",1989
203,938,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  it  would be my hope that in the closing  hours of this debate, as those few re maining Senators indicate their dispo sition on this critical matter, that the  tenor of this debate,  the balance of  this debate can remain as established  by this historic speech given by the  senior Senator of Texas. Irrespective  of how we may  feel  individually on  this matter, that in my judgment will  go down as one of the greatest speech es that I have heard in this Chamber.  Not just because it perhaps favors the  position as the Senator from Virginia  has  espoused,  but  the manner  in  which it was delivered,  the intensity  and uniqueness of the circumstances.  Mr. President, I would like to speak  on issues which could be similarly ad dressed by many of my colleagues in  the Senate today. Seventy Members of  this body  served with John Tower,  many for much longer than I served  with  him. Those of my  colleagues  know full well the dedicated service of  our former colleague, our friend,  the  U.S. Senator from Texas, to this body  and to the Nation.  Let me recount John Tower's out standing  record  of  accomplishment  during the 6 years I served with him  on the Armed Services Committee. In  1979, when I came to the Senate, I  joined  the  committee  under  John  Tower's able leadership as its ranking  minority member. That year, Senator  Tower led the Congress in granting a  sizable increase to the Defense budget  at a time when our Armed Forces were  underfunded and seriously deficient in  training and readiness. Senator Tower  was, and remains, a strong and eff ec tive advocate  for adequate  levels of  Defense spending. Through his leader ship in dealing with both the adminis tration and with his congressional col leagues, Senator Tower helped to fash ion  spending  compromises  that  al lowed real growth in Defense spending  levels, to permit our Armed Forces to  emerge from  the so-called decade of  neglect with the prospect of a modern,  fully ready force. The vastly improved  effectiveness, readiness, and spirit of  our men and women in uniform today  is due  in no small part  to Senator  Tower's leadership of the Committee  on Armed Services during a critical  period of national recovery.  In  1980,  then  ranking minority  member Tower led a bipartisan group  of members of the Senate Armed Serv ices Committee  in  insisting that the  committee  examine  the  important  military and security issues raised by  the SALT II Treaty. The committee's  report revealed serious causes for con cern relative to the treaty and showed  that the treaty would allow the Sovi ets to continue their military buildup  while at the same time making it diffi cult for the United States to maintain  a  balance. The  report went on  to  remind us of the importance of view ing arms control from a national secu rity point of view and, as such, was a  turning point in terms of raising the  standards  for  future  arms  control  agreements. Senator Tower's leader ship in the SALT II debate is responsi ble in large measure for effecting this  change, that we experienced.  In 1981, when Republicans gained a  majority in the Senate, Senator Tower  undertook a number of initiatives as  chairman of the Armed Services Com mittee. As a first step, he reorganized  the  subcommittee  structure  of  the  Armed Services Committee to  imple ment  review of Defense budget and  policy issues oriented along mission re quirements rather than budget catego ries.  Through Senator Tower's chairman ship, the five-part strategic moderniza tion program proposed by the Reagan  ",1989
204,951,3,Mr. JOHNSTON.," We have all ob served wide ranges of people using al cohol  in  this  town.  I will  say, Mr.  President, that I think Senators are as  careful and controlled and responsible  in their use of alcohol as any group I  have seen. If there  is abuse  in  this  body, I do not know about it. But that  does not mean  it does not exist be cause, frankly, I did not know about  the abuse by Senator Tower.  Nevertheless,  there  is  the question  of a double standard. I do not believe  there is a double standard involved be cause it is not a question of a double  standard. It is a question of a different  standard. We Senators have shared re sponsibility. The Secretary of Defense  has sole responsibility. I heard former  Secretary McNamara on television the  other night talking about the Cuban  missile crisis and he was talking about  the troops under ""my"" command. He  was  describing  the  whole  Armed  Forces of the United States. He then  corrected himself and said ""under the  President's command."" But the fact is  under the national command author ity  it goes from  the Commander  in  Chief, the President, to the Secretary  of Defense, who is really the operative  commander  in  the  field  of all  the  forces. He is the sole commander. We  in the Senate share authority.  But the second difference between  Senators and the Secretary of Defense  is that we are a group who bears re sponsibility on only a part-time basis  and he  is always on call. By ""some times"" I mean when the Senate is in  session, or when we are in committees,  when we  are on official duties. At  those times our judgment is to be ex ercised for the United States. But if  we are at home with our families, basi cally our time is our own. No one is  going  to call us at 3 a.m. and say  ""come make a decision about whether  to respond to the firing of a Libyan  rocket."" But the Secretary of Defense  is subject to that call. It is a different  standard. Even if there was clear evi dence of abuse of alcohol in this body,  which I deny, we could not escape our  responsibility for making a  judgment  about  the nominee for Secretary of  Defense. We must  determine  the  qualifications of a person who must be  consistently and unerringly responsi ble in his judgment.  Mr. President, finally,  there is  this  question of the no-drink pledge. That,  too, is troubling. On a moral level I be lieve in the right of redemption. I be lieve Senator Tower is a man of integ rity. So when he makes a pledge, it is  important evidence. But the fact is he  has not yet demonstrated his ability to  exercise that unerring judgment; that  is  to say, he has not demonstrated  that he can be alcohol free.  We know enough about the abuse of  alcohol that if abusers have one drink  they frequently cannot control their  appetite for others. Does that mean I  think Senator Tower is an alcoholic? I  do not mean to use that word because  I do not know. I know he is an abuser.  I  think he speaks of  it in  terms of  being an excessive user at one time.  But, Mr. President, they tell me it is  characteristic of the problem that you  do not solve an alcohol problem until  you admit that you have an alcohol  problem-facing up squarely  to  that  problem, not by deflecting it, not by  saying I am a disciplined man, I can  use  it or take it or leave  it, but by  saying  I  have  a  problem. Senator  Tower has not done that. Am I certain  that he has to do that? Nothing is cer tain in this record. As I say, there are  dull hues of gray all over this record.  But I come finally to the conclusion  that we have a burden of proof prob lem here. If this were a criminal trial,  I would be the first to say not guilty.  If this were a civil trial, I would be the  first  to  say  judgment  for Senator  Tower because  the plaintiff has not  proven his case by a preponderance of  the evidence. But  this  is neither of  those, neither a criminal nor a civil  trial, Mr. President.  It is a judgment of the most serious  position or one of the most serious po sitions in this whole land; the person  who can determine the very future of  the world, whose unerringly consistent  judgment  is  of more  vital  concern  than that of the pilot of the airplane  we will next catch. It is not only our  future, but the future of the whole  world which  is  at  str ke. And  the  burden of proof, when t_ iere is a prob lem unquestionably presented, ought  to be on the nominee or on the admin istration. They must prove  that the  man is able, without question and at  all times, to adequately discharge the  duties of his office.  Does this mean that John Tower is  not a good man? Not at all; that he is  not a loyal American? Not at all; that  his service for 24 years in this body  was not of a very high standard? Not  at all. Does it mean that he is not a  very able man on defense, able to give  great advice, great  judgments, be a  great administrator? It does not even  mean that. It does not even mean that  his character  is not of  the highest  level. All it means, and this is the vital,  important and crucial test to me,  is  that  in  the m.:.clear  age we cannot  afford to take a chance on the man  who holds in his hand the future of  the world.

In that connection, I had a call from  someone  in Mississipppi who  asked  me, ""Thad, what in the world is going  on up  there?"" And  I  said,  ""Well,  I  think it is a lot like mud wrestling.""

209,964,3,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce  the Debt Ceiling Reform  Act of 1989.  Although I have come to this floor  many times to introduce and support  legislation to restore fiscal responsibil ity to the Federal Government, I have  been one of the leading skeptics of the  Gramm-Rudman law.  In my opinion, there were two fatal  flaws  in the current budget process.  First, the Gramm-Rudman law devised  a formula for deficit reduction which  is so filled with exemptions and special  rules that well over half of the Federal  budget is exempt from formula reduc tion.  The second and most serious flaw  and false promise of the budget proc ess  as  amended  by  the Gramm R udman law is the total reliance on  arbitrary  economic  projections  as  benchmarks of progress  toward  the  much promised balanced budget of  1993. Under the current budget proc ess  and Gramm-Rudman plan,  eco nomic forecasts are made for a period  into the future, and all attention is fo cused on making  the forecasts meet  the deficit  target for a  single fiscal  year.  In such a legislative environment, no  holds are barred to make the future  target year look as good as possible re gardless of the long-term effects of the  chosen action. This invites manipula tions and procrastination.  My skepticism was again confirmed  when President Reagan's 1990 budget  proposal revealed that the deficit for  1989 will likely exceed $161 billion, $25  billion above  the  level mandated by  the Gramm-Rudman law.  ",1989
210,990,3,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I rise to introduce a bill to amend the  Bankruptcy Code. This bill clarifies  that an airline in bankruptcy should  be treated the same way as a railroad  in bankruptcy.  Under current section 1167 of  the  Bankruptcy Code, the trustee in a rail road reorganization may not alter em ployee wages or working conditions  except in accordance with section 6 of  the Railway Labor Act. It makes no  sense to single out railroads for special  treatment. The Railway Labor Act  controls resolution of disputes involv ing wages and working conditions for  employees  in both  the  railroad and  airlines industries. My bill amends sec tion 1167 of the Bankruptcy Code to  cover air carriers in bankruptcy in the  same way that railroads in bankruptcy  are now covered.  My bill also amends section 109 of  the Bankruptcy Code to allow credi tors to reach the assets of a bankrupt cy air carrier's parent holding compa nies  or  related  entities.  Creditors  should not be  left holding  the bag  when an air carrier files for bankrupt cy after its assets and cash reserves  have been drained by holding compa nies and other related entities. Under  my bill, if the air carrier files for bank ruptcy,  then  the air carrier's ""con trolled group,"" including parent hold ing companies and related subsidiaries  also must enter bankruptcy.  Controlled  groups  are  recognized  under ERISA for pension liability pur poses. Relying on  controlled group  assets furthers the reorganization of  troubled, complex entities and ensures  fair treatment for creditors. This bill  recognizes the realities of modern air line corporate structure and protects  creditors from being abused by that  structure.  It is important to note that this bill  becomes effective as of the date of in troduction-March 8, 1989. Making a  bill effective as of the date of intro duction is a common practice in the  tax area. This is done to prevent par ties involved in or considering transac tions from changing their behavior in  contemplation of pending  legislation  being enacted.  We are all aware that Eastern Air lines is contemplating a filing in bank ruptcy. This bill will affect Eastern  Airlines, its parent holding companies  and related entities, the creditors of  Eastern and Eastern's employees. All  those parties and all other air carriers  contemplating bankruptcy are hereby  put on notice that the bankruptcy law  changes proposed in this bill will,  if  enacted, be effective March 8, 1989.e  By Mr. PRESSLER:  S. 545.

PERMITTING PRODUCERS TO PRODUCE ALFALFA  ON CERTAIN ACRES  e ",1989
211,990,3,Mr.  PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation that  would allow alfalfa to be considered as  a farm program crop for base history  compliance purposes.  I recently completed a 16-town tour  of public listening meetings where I  received valuable  input on  the 1990  farm bill and other agricultural issues  from my  fellow  South Dakotans.  During that tour, I was able to gather  many  valuable  ideas  regarding  the  future direction of farm policy. One of  those ideas was the basis for the legis lation I am introducing today.  Perhaps the most frequent sugges tion  for  farm program changes ex pressed by South Dakotans concerns  alfalfa. The current farm program re quires a farmer to plant a farm pro gram crop in 2 of the last 3 years to  maintain a production base. This re quirement discourages the planting of  alfalfa, which  is  an expensive crop  that usually remains in the ground 3  or more years in a row. Because alfalfa  adds nitrogen  to  the soil and helps  mitigate wind erosion, many farmers  like to alternate their program crops  with alfalfa. This is wise stewardship  of the soil and should be encouraged.  In South Dakota, as in other areas  of the United States, the wind severely  damages  the precious  few  inches of  topsoil available to our food producers.  Farm program changes that help pre vent the destruction of this natural re source, which is so vital to our future,  are appropriate and necessary. I hope  my distinguished colleagues will view  this bill as an effort to assist farmers  ",1989

You see, the  two cities are separated by about 100 feet of  road. Although they contract with each other  to provide various services-fire, trash collec tion, and so forth, each has its own city gov ernment and is fiercely autonomous.  When working  in  tandem,  they  resemble  any midsize urban community-they have the  same conveniences and the same problems.  Their combined population is roughly 54,000well over the census requirement for designa tion  as  a  standard metropolitan  statistical  area.  However,  the Federal Government refuses  to recognize the proximity of these two cities.  On paper, Pocatello and Chubbuck might as  well be on opposite sides of the country. But,  in reality, they are both part of one metropoli tan area and deserve to be treated as such.  These two communities ought to be entitled  to the same benefits available to other urban  centers-increased  hospital  reimbursement,  indigent care and the whole range of Federal  3817  required  urban assistance-without being  surrender their autonomy.  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping  Pocatello and Chubbuck secure that which is  rightfully theirs by cosponsoring the legislation  I am introducing today.  to  THE DRUG DEALERS SEND  ANOTHER HORRIBLE MESSAGE  HON. CHARLES 8. RANGEL  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 1989  ",1989
217,1029,3,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  it seems  that  every few months or so  I find myself in  the  unfortunate position of having to bring to the  attention of my colleagues some brutal news  from  the drug  jungles  in our cities.  In  this  case, it again comes from New York.  About  this  time  last year,  I remember  the  deep sense of loss and  the sadness felt by  the family,  friends, and  law enforcement col leagues  of  rookie  New  York  Policeman  Edward Byrne, who was gunned down while  protecting an  important witness  in  a drug  case. The drug dealers sent a message, and  Edward Byrne was  the unfortunate messen ger.  Today,  it  is Everett Hatcher. Mr. Hatcher  was a 16-year veteran of the Drug Enforce ment Administration. He was a husband and  the father of two children. He had laid his life  on  the  line every hour of every day  for our  drug-infested communities for nearly two dec ades, until they took it all away from him in a  hail of bullets on  the evening of Tuesday,  February 28, while Agent Hatcher worked un dercover on Staten Island.  This, sadly,  reminds us all  too well of the  commitment  that we  in  the Congress must  keep to support our law enforcement officers  in the continuing battle to regain our neighbor hoods, our streets, and our souls and hearts  from  the drug  traffickers. These pirates of  peace and prosperity are bent on making a  profit at the expense of destroying all  that is  good about America.  I cannot help but think, Mr. Speaker, about  the horrible price that we will continue to pay  to fight the growing incursion of the drug traf fic  in our great country.  It  is a depressing  thought to know that Everett Hatcher will not  be the last one.  It is disturbing to know that  until we firmly grip this problem as tight as we  can, that we will continue to suffer periodically  from the loss of some our greatest, most self less warriors.  But it is not just the police officers who are  being mowed down like blades of grass by the  modern-day mafia that runs the drug trade.  It could be  the uninvolved citizen who, at  the wrong place at the wrong time, say, at a  traffic light, catches the spray from machine gun  fire as  traffickers  turn otherwise  safe  streets into a temporary battleground over ter ritory.

218,1042,3,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  the  GEICO Insurance Co. yesterday honored Rita  Calkins, a constituent from Seminole, FL, with  one of its five annual Public Service Awards  for her work in the field of physical rehabilita tion.  Rita Calkins  is a special woman who has  overcome great odds  to make a significant  contribution to a number of local, State, and  national civic causes. She is a retired secre tary from the Bay Pines Veterans Administra tion Medical Center who was severely dis abled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947. Fol lowing her stroke, she was confined to a bed  for an extended period of time,  to a wheel. chair for a year, and  then was able to walk  using leg braces for 6 years.  Although Rita is still considered totally dis abled for employment purposes, she has been  an  active  volunteer  throughout  Pinellas  County, FL, for the past 12 years. She was a  pioneer in developing and raising funds for the  Alzheimer's Disease Fund and was the key to  her local chapter's lead in the Florida Federa tion fund drive. She also donates to the Alz heimer's Fund the proceeds from her famous  ""10 bean soup mix"", which she prepares in  packets and sells at the National Association  of Retired Federal Employees meetings. Her  efforts have inspired the association to make  major contributions to the fund.  In addition to her work in support of Alzhei mer's Disease, Rita also volunteers her time  at  the Free Clinics  in St. Petersburg and  Clearwater. She prepares and serves meals to  the indigent as a volunteer at the St. Vincent  DePaul soup kitchen  in Clearwater, she pro vides home economics training to the needy  through the Pinellas County Extension Home makers Service, and  she  is active  in her  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 1989  ",1989
219,1042,3,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, in 1964, a group  of women from Redwood City banded togeth er  to  form  their Spanish-speaking neighbor hood's first bilingual nursery school, the Com munity Education Center [CEC] at the Com munity Congregational Church. This year, the  CEC celebrates its 25th season of service to  the Redwood City community.  From  its humble beginnings as a twice-a week nursery school, the center has expand ed to care for nearly 50 preschool children 5  days a week,  is conducting classes for new  mothers, and holds evening English  lessons  for the neighborhood's adult Spanish-speaking  newcomers.  In  spite of seemingly endless  challenges threatening its financing and facili ties,  the CEC has always managed  to meet  the need for greater and more varied services.  The greatest praise one can bestow upon  the work of the CEC comes in the feedback of  both children and parents which, I am delight ed  to say, has been uniformly positive. Par ents' anecdotal stories  tell  it all: Following  their participation  in CEC,  the children  look  forward to going to school, they are filled with  enthusiasm  for doing  their homework, and  they become quite upset when they can't go  to school, even when ill.  The CEC attributes much of the success to  its overarching philosophy. The center strives  to  develop  the whole  person.  In  its day  school, the social, emotional, intellectual, and  physical development of the child takes place  in the belief that school should be a fun expe rience, shared by  the entire  family. Parents  actively participate  in  the education of their  children.  March 8, 1989  Evidence  for  the center's success comes  from  traditional sources as well. Testing has  repeatedly shown that children involved in the  CEC are well above average. It is no wonder  the center's enrollment is always full and the  waiting  list  is nearly as  long as  the  list of  those admitted.  The growth of  the CEC has been made  possible through the generosity of individuals,  local  businesses,  service  clubs,  charitable  foundations, and especially through the dedi cation of the center's staff, volunteer and pro fessional. The center, however, cannot grow  to meet the increasing demand for its services  if its current financial needs go unmet.  The CEC's four major funding sources are  now demanding greater self-sufficiency. They  have limited the CEC's dependence upon any  one source to 20 percent and have cut back  on  future contributions.  In  response  to  this  new threat to the CEC's activities, the center's  parents and children have become involved in  a major fundraising effort to maintain the oper ation. The cost of providing such an outstand ing educational experience, however, remains  a very difficult challenge.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the staff and par ents of the center, which has given thousands  of children a solid start in their education and  thousands  of adults  the English  language  skills necessary to participate fully as Ameri cans.  I commend  the  small group of  inspired  women  in Redwood City who  founded  the  CEC 25 years ago and took responsibility for  their own education and for the education of  their children.  I congratulate  the Community Education  Center on its 25th anniversary, and wish it at  least another 25 years of success:  COAST GUARD ENVIRONMENTAL  COMPLIANCE ACT  HON. DON YOUNG  OF ALASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 1989  ",1989
220,1042,3,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker,  the  legislation that  I am  introducing today is the  same bill as H.R. 5089 from the 100th Con gress. This legislation will respond to the criti cal problem of hazardous substance contami nation at present and former Coast Guard fa cilities around  the country. The program of  compliance with environmental  laws mandat ed  for Coast Guard  facilities by  this bill  is  modeled after the existing Defense Environ mental Restoration Program. This program  provides for centralized program management  for  the cleanup of Department of Defense  hazardous waste sites, consistent with provi sions of  the Comprehensive Environmental  Response Compensation,  and  Liability Act  [CERCLA],  the Superfund Amendments and  Reauthorization Act of 1986 [SARA], and the  National Contingency Plan  [NCP]. The goals  of the Environmental Compliance Program es tablished in this bill are identical to the goals  of the DOD program:  First,  to  identify,  investigate, and clean up  contaminants  from  hazardous  substances,  pollutants, and contaminants;  ",1989
221,1055,3,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, today  the distinguished gentleman from New  York [Mr. FrsH] and I are introducing  legislation to fill a gap in our Nation's  immigration laws.  Current law addresses the situation  faced by a person who is the victim of  persecution in his or her own coun try-persecution based on  race,  reli gion, nationality, political thinking or  social class. That person may enter  the United States or remain here if al ready in the country, is entitled to be  called a refugee or a.sylee, and is enti tled to become an American citizen.  The law today also addresses the sit uation faced by a person who is not  persecuted in the home country but  wants  a  better  life  in  the United  States. The  law  says  you  cannot  remain  if you have entered without  documents, but you are entitled  to  enter as an immigrant.  But, the law does not address the sit uation  faced  by  persons-including  many who have left their homes be cause of temporary but dangerous or  life-threatening  conditions  and who  need a safe haven until the threaten ing  conditions-war,  environmental  disaster,  economic  collapse-have  eased.  This latter situation is what our bill  addresses.  This  situation  is  sometimes  ad dressed by the application of extended  voluntary  departure  [EVDl  status.  But, EVD is without sound, statutory  basis, depends on the general parole  authority  of  the  executive,  and  is  granted and withdrawn arbitrarily the bill we are introducing today does  the job better than EVD.  Mr. Speaker,  the  temporary  safe  haven bill is no stranger to this Cham ber. On October 5,  1988,  this  bill  passed by unanimous voice vote. Un fortunately, the bill was not taken up  by the other body in the closing mo ments of the  lOOth Congress. There fore, I would urge my colleagues once  again  to support  this  legislation,  to  make America a safe haven for  law abiding people whose home countries  are wracked with turmoil.  Mr. Speaker, the following is a sum mary of the Temporary Safe Haven  Act of 1989:  SUMMARY OF TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN ACT OF  1989  Authorizes the Attorney General to allow  aliens from any country (or part thereof)  who are  in  the United States,  to remain  temporarily if the Attorney General finds  that:  < 1 > An ongoing armed conflict within the  aliens' home country would pose a threat to  the safety of returning aliens; or  (2) An  environmental disaster has oc curred in the aliens' home country, substan tially disrupting living conditions, and the  country has officially  asked the United  States to provide temporary safe haven to  its nationals; or  (3) Other temporary, extraordinary condi tions exist in the aliens' home country such  that to return aliens to that country would  not be in the national interest of the United  States based on humanitarian, immigration,  and international concerns.  (4) Prohibits future use of ""Extended Vol untary Departure"" or other administrative  action as a substitute for safe haven;  <5> Requires the Attorney General to pub lish notice and  a  statement of  findings  whenever safe haven is granted, extended or  terminated;  (6) Requires eligible aliens to show contin uous physical presence in the United States  since the date safe haven  is granted, but  allows for brief, casual, and innocent depar tures;  (7) Permits no  judicial  review  of  safe  haven determinations of the Attorney Gen eral;  (8) ~equires eligible aliens to register, and  reregister annually;  <9> Denies safe haven to criminals, drug  offenders, and subversives;  (10) Disqualifies safe haven grantees from  federal programs of public assistance;  <11> Requires  the Attorney General  to  report yearly on why each country's nation als were, or were not, made eligible for safe  haven.  OPPOSE THE MANDATED  EMPLOYEE LEAVE BILL  (Mr. BALLENGER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1989
222,1055,3,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday  the Committee on Education  and Labor marked up H.R. 770, man dated employee leave bill. This is not a  new bill, in fact, it is the same legisla tion approved by the committee in the  la.st Congress.  What has not changed is the central  problem raised by the bill-should the  Federal Government adopt a  policy  that mandates benefits for private em ployers?  Prescribing a one-size-fits-all policy  for  all  businesses,  both  small  and  large, ignores the fact that employee  needs differ from one business to an other. Mandating one particular bene fit limits the ability of employers to  offer other benefits  that appeal  to  their work force.  Leave for employees for the care of a  child or sick parent is a good policy to  pursue. I hope employers would off er  their employees this option. It is, how ever, bad policy for the Federal Gov ernment to require companies to off er  these benefits.  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R.  770.  PROPOSED MIDDLE EAST  DEVELOPMENT BANK  <Mr. OWENS of Utah asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  . ",1989
223,1055,3,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, I  rISe today to salute the 10th anniver sary, on March 26, of the historical  peace between Israel and Egypt, which  paved the first road to a normalization  of  relations between  Israel  and  its  Arab neighbors. That event was one of  the most  significant  foreign  policy  achievements of  this decade, and a  true cause for celebration.  To  commemorate  that  important  event, I will shortly introduce legisla tion which would direct the creation  of a Middle Ea.st Development Bank.  Such an economic development pro gram, funding local projects, through  foreign assistance, public and private,  and in cooperation with local financial  institutions and  industries, has been  successful in Asia and in South Amer ica. It is my assumption that the dif ferent countries of  the Middle Ea.st  would welcome a similar type of fund ing source.  La.st December, under the auspices  of the House Foreign Affairs Commit tee, I traveled to six countries during a  dynamic period in the region. I was in  Saudi Arabia the day Arafat was get ting  la.st minute  advice  from King  Fahd before his Geneva speech; I was  in Jordan the day King Hussein reor ganized his Cabinet to lessen govern ment  ties with West Bank Palestin ians; and I was in Israel the day it fi nalized its coalition government. In ad dition, I  traveled to Egypt, Iraq, and  Syria.  As a member of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee  on Europe  and  the  Middle East, I have become active in  trying  to  understand  the problems  which seem to preclude peace in that  troubled area of the world.  Today, though, I rise to discuss a dif ferent subject, but one which is direct ly related to the peace process: region al economic cooperation.  One of the recurring themes during  my December trip and my two earlier  official visits  la.st year, was the role  that  regional  economic  cooperation  must play to help build a foundation  for peace. It is known that Israel and  Egypt have many joint economic and  scientific activities. But I learned that,  at  times, notwithstanding very  real  conflicts, some other Middle Eastern  countries have put aside political dif ferences with Israel out of economic  necessity. For example,  Jordan, de spite the fact that it does not have any  peace  treaty or normalized relations  with Israel, has entered into a number  of cooperative agreements with Israel  concerning water  issues  and  other  areas of mutual interest. They jointly  operate  the Allenby Bridge between  their two countries. In fact, there has  even been talk recently about the pos sibility of building an entry bridge be tween Aqaba and Eilat to help pro mote tourism between those two coun tries .  The cooperative exchanges between  Egypt and Israel have played a useful  role in warming and developing their  ",1989

225,1081,3,Mr.  KENNEDY.,"  Mr.  President,  when  Sunny  Davis,  the  waitress  turned protocol officer in the Goldie  Hawn  comedy  about  diplomacy,  is  asked about her foreign travels, she re plies that she hasn't been outside this  country but questioningly adds ""I was  in Canada once but that doesn't count  'ca.use it's like attached."" During their  recent national elections, Canadians  reminded us  that it does count and  that we're not the only ""Americans""  north of the Rio Grande.  The November  election  of Brian  Mulroney's Progressive Conservative  Party enabled the historic free trade  agreement between Canada and  the  United States to go into effect. I wel come this agreement, which I believe  will bring greater prosperity to both  countries.  While Americans know little about  Canada and even less about the free  trade  agreement,  Canadians  know  much about us and more about the  agreement-it was the No. 1 issue in  their election campaign,  fueled by a  real concern of Canadians  that  the  agreement would result in their coun try being placed at an economic disad vantage with the United States.  Canada is often taken for granted by  the United States-probably because  we are similar in so many ways and be cause  our  few  disagreements  seem  never to be insurmountable. Our rela tionship is so intertwined that it usual ly goes unnoticed. We share a common  language  and  also  elements  of  a  common  culture. Canadians  eat  at  Kentucky  Fried Chicken,  shop  at  Sears, and watch American television.  Americans  drink Molsons  and Sea grams and shop at Canadian-owned  Macy's. A  large number of  tourists  flocking to Florida's beaches are Cana dian. Hockey and baseball spectators  of both nations sing the words to each  other's national anthem, and Montreal  sports  fans are  just as enthusiastic  about the Canadians and the Expos, as  Boston fans are about the Bruins and  the Red Sox.  Yet there are many differences as  well-differences that date back to our  early  history, when  our  colonists  sought  independence  from England  while our northern neighbors did not.  In fact, a significant increase in the  Em~lish population  of Canada  oc curred during  the American Revolu tion, when British  loyalists  rejected  the move  for  independence and  in stead chose to move to Canada.  Canada also has the rich tradition of  the  French  language  and  culture  dating back to the days of the great  explorer Cartier in the late 16th cen tury  and  the  settlement  of New  France by Champlain in the 17th cen tury.  Canadians  today  put  special  value on  their sense of community,  which  is  evident  in Canada's social  services network,  including universal  medical  care,  and  a  recently  an nounced multibillion-dollar  daycare  program. This emphasis is enshrined  in  the Canadian Constitution, which  calls for ""peace, order and good gov ernment.''  I hope that the new free trade agree ment will foster a greater understand ing of our northern neighbor. Canada  is our largest trading partner, buying  twice as much from us as  the Japa nese. This $170 billion annual trade is  the single largest trading relationship  in the world. Canada is the No. 1 host  country for United States foreign in vestment and the United States is the  No. 1 host country for Canadian  in vestment.  Canada also serves on the U.N. Secu rity Council, and the Canadian contri bution of more than 80,000 troops to  16 different U.N. peacekeeping forces  has been a substantial factor  in the  success of  those forces and their re ceipt of  the Nobel Peace Prize  for  1988.  Most important, Canada is a trusted  and valued ally of the United States  and a partner in the defense of North  America. We are proud of  this rela tionship, and we must work hard to  make it even stronger, to the mutual  benefit of both our nations.  Mr. President, last month Derek H.  Burney became the new Ambassador  of Canada to the United States. I be lieve that his remarks on that occasion  will be of interest to all of us in the  Senate. Mr. President,  I  ask unani mous consent that they be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  re marks were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  REMARKS  OF  THE  AMBASSADOR  OF  CANADA  DEREK H. BURNEY UPON THE OCCASION OF  THE PRESENTATION OF HIS LETTER OF CRE  DENCE FEBRUARY 7, 1989  I have  the honour  to present  to you a  letter  from  the  Governor-General  of  Canada, Jeanne Sauve, accrediting me as  Ambassador of Canada to the United States.  Mr. President, to a world in which igno rance  and  hunger  still  too  often mock  human values and  in which hostility and  conflict still too often impoverish affairs be tween  nations,  the  relationship  between  Canada and the United States is a source of  inspiration. Shared  ideals and democratic  institutions are its foundation. The friend ship and kinship of millions of Americans  and Canadians are its strength.  Canada and the United States are at an  exciting stage in the evolution of this model  relationship. Our historic free trade agree ment is now coming into effect and we have  a shared interest in making it work.  The agreement holds the promise of sub stantial economic benefits  for millions of  Canadians and Americans. For our consum ers, it means lower prices. For our business es,  it increases confidence and predictabil ity. For our economies, it means enhanced  competitiveness and better jobs. For our two  governments, it reduces friction and misun derstanding.  As well,  the  agreement  signals  to  the  international community that, as partners  in the world's most important bilateral trad ing  relationship, Canada and  the United  States are determined to roll back protec tionism and to open new avenues of interna tional commerce.  Mr. President, the essence of being Cana dian springs from the forests and lakes and  plains and oceans of our vast country. The  natural environment is the mystical source  of our nationhood and of our pride as Cana dians.  Your  comments  during  the  past  few  months on the need to address environmen tal  issues  have been warmly greeted  in  Canada. Canada and the United States have  a long and constructive history of working  together  to preserve our shared environ ment, starting with the visionary Boundary  Waters Treaty of 1909. We have set an im pressive standard of international coopera tion.  Acid rain is the one anomaly in our other wise remarkable record. An important part  of my instructions from the Prime Minister  is  to elicit effective action by  the United  States to bring about specific reductions of  transborder  flows of acid  rain pollutants  within a  fixed time. A firm priority objec tive for Canada is a  joint commitment to  that end enshrined in a bilateral accord.  Our cooperative defense  relationship  is  basic to the security of our two countries.  We have fought side by side in two world  wars  and  Korea.  Together,  through  NORAD and other arrangements, we defend  North America. Together, through NATO,  we help to defend Europe.  The Canadian Government has embarked  on an extensive defense modernization pro gram designed to upgrade the capabilities of  the Canadian armed forces to carry our fair  share of the NATO burden. Canadian indus try,  too,  through bilateral agreements re newed by our two governments in 1985,  is  contributing to  the viability of the North  American industrial base.  Mr. President, the global landscape prof fers challenges to both our countries:  the  Soviet Union's search for new solutions to  its worsening economic problems offers the  prospect of a more enduring peace; the inte gration of the economies of our Western Eu ropean  allies will have consequences  for  both our countries; the strong economies of  Japan and our other Asian trading partners  present us with a competitive challenge, as  well as substantial opportunities.  Meanwhile, other countries, many in this  hemisphere, are struggling under enormous  debt burdens. And around the world, people  still live in poverty and despair.  My government believes that, as two dis tinct  and  democratic  societies  in North  America, we have a boundless capacity to  work with one another and to contribute to  world peace and prosperity.  In pursuit of these objectives, Prime Min ister Mulroney looks forward to welcoming  you to Canada in the very near future. The  Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr.  Clark, warmly anticipates regular and fruit ful exchanges with Secretary Baker.  As Ambassador, I take up my duties in a  climate of confidence and at a  time when  our  respective  governments  have  strong,  new mandates. I welcome the opportunity  to stimulate our unique relationship. I will  do my utmost to fulfill the expectations of  my government, I ask for the full support of  your Administration.  ",1989
226,1107,3,Mr. WARNER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my friend of some 20 years for  his comments  today.  I  return  those  sentiments. As I have stated before, we  embarked together to prepare a record  not only for the Senate Armed Serv ices  Committee,  but  also  for  the  Senate as a whole, as best we knew  how, in a manner which we believed  was a nonpartisan, constructive, fair,  and objective approach. On Thursday  night, the 23d of February, we parted.  Subsequent to that Thursday night,  when we :reached that fork in the road  and he had to pursue his duty, as he  viewed it, and I accepted the challenge  to pursue my goal, which was to bring  out  in  this Chamber the  truth, and  fairness as reflected by facts we had,  and to unswervingly support the nomi nation of John Tower. And further, to  support the constitutional right of the  President  to select  those  individuals  whom he believes, in his judgment, are  best qualified to advise him. We then  fulfilled our respective roles.  I believe only history will be able to  resolve  the  aftermath  from  that  Thursday night, through and includ ing the termination of this debate at  or about 4 o'clock today.  Mr. President, I had the rare privi lege to step off the floor a few minutes  ago to take a call from John Tower,  another man  I have known  for  20  years. As a matter of fact, we first met  at  the same  time  I met  the distin guished chairman, some 20 years ago.  I am pleased to  tell my colleagues  that his head  is high, his voice  is  strong. He will make his views known  following the vote.  I say to John Tower that I appreci ate his expression  to me personally,  and he asked me to convey the same,  in his language, to the ""troops"" that  rallied to his defense, and I do so on  his behalf now.  Mr. President, I will have further re marks as the day goes on, but there  are other colleagues who have not had  ",1989
227,1133,3,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President,  we have been through trying days in  the U.S. Senate. The debate over the  nomination of John Tower as Secre tary of Defense has become a very per sonal decision generating much emo tion and tension for all of us.  We have tied ourselves into a Gordi an knot of moral and ethical consider ations  that has  left  the Nation-as  well as each Senator-questioning the  limits of public disclosure  and  fair  play. Under the best of circumstances  this  nomination would  have  chal lenged the Senate's standards of fair ness. But this decision has only been  made more burdensome by the process  and the tenor of the debate.  Our decision on this nomination is  all the more difficult because it con cerns a former colleague, who served  in this body for 24 years, and because  it goes to the heart of the issue of sep aration of powers. Or perhaps to be  more accurate, this decision brings to  life one of the more peculiar features  of our Constitution in which power is  not only separated but it is shared.  Mr. President, as we  are all well  aware,  the  Constitution  gives  the  President  the  right  to  nominate  people of his choice  to serve  in his  Cabinet. But it is only with the advice  and consent of  the Senate  that his  nominees are appointed. The genius of  our Constitution  is  that  it provides  broad guidance that can withstand the  test of time. The frustration is that it  does not give us specific guidelines on  exactly how to exercise shared power.  Advice and consent, while being the  most lofty duty of the Senate, has also  been one of  the most controversial  among practitioners and scholars over  the years. I have deep respect for the  institution of  the Presidency and  I  have deep respect for our new Presi dent, George Bush. I am also aware of  precedent. As has been mentioned nu merous times during this debate, only  eight Cabinet nominees have been re jected by the U.S. Senate throughout  our history.  But, I firmly believe that our Found ing Fathers did not intend for the U.S.  Senate to be a rubber stamp. I also be lieve that our Founding Fathers made  it clear in the Federalist Papers that  the Senate's advice and consent proc ess was not intended to be simply a  referendum  on  criminality,  but on  overall fitness and merit for the most  distinguished offices  in  this Nation.  The Senate's role, as I see it Mr. Presi dent, is  to assess whether a nominee  can effectively provide the necessary  leadership in the post that he or she is  being nominated for and whether the  nominee can enlist the public's trust.  In  the nomination process we are  forced  to  look  through a prism and  the  images we  see  are diverse and  sometimes distorted. In fulfilling our  constitutional responsibility of advice  and consent, I believe we each individ ually have  to evaluate  these  images  and, upon personal reflection, make a  judgment. This  is our duty  to  the  President and the American people.  The Secretary of Defense,  in my  view, is the most important of all the  Cabinet positions. The Defense Secre tary is in the chain of command on de ployment of forces and questions of  command  and  control  of  nuclear  forces. He provides leadership to our  military forces and to our civilian per sonnel dedicated to this country's de fense. And, he oversees  the  largest  portion of the Federal budget.  We are at a critical crossroads in our  national security policy. Over the next  4 years,  the Secretary of Defense  is  going to have to provide leadership on  major decisions involving force struc ture, arms control, strategy, personnel,  and procurement, which will  deter mine our defense posture in the next  century.  These decisions are going to have to  be made now and under very difficult  circumstances. Budget pressures are  going to demand effective leadership  from  a  Secretary  of Defense who  knows how to provide a strong, eff ec tive  national  defense with  limited  funding and who can forge a consen sus on controversial budget decisions  among the competing services and on  Capitol Hill.  Most  importantly,  the next Secre tary of Defense  is going  to have  to  counter  the debilitating  impact that  the defense procurement scandal has  had on public confidence  in our de fense establishment. As a former head  of the Military Reform Caucus, I have  followed  these very  troubling  issues  closely over  the years. There  is no  doubt in my mind that the Pentagon  scandal has resulted in a growing ero sion of  public  support  for  defense  spending. The Secretary of Defense  oversees contract awards worth $150  billion  annually,  75  percent of  the  goods  and  services  purchased  each  year  by  the  Federal Government.  Dealing effectively with the issues of  fraud, conflict of interest, inefficiency,  waste,  and  reform of  the  revolving  door  are  the major  issues  on  the  agenda of the next Secretary of De fense.  In meeting  these  challenges,  the  next Secretary of Defense must have  the confidence,  trust, and respect of  the American people and  the Con gress. Mr. President,  I am going  to  vote against the nomination of John  Tower because I do not believe he can  ",1989

231,1146,3,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I con gratulate President Bush on his selec tion of Dr. William J. Bennett as Di rector  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy, and I am pleased to express my  support and vote for his confirmation  today.  Dr. William Bennett is well-qualified  for the position of Director of Nation al Drug Control Policy as reflected in  his impressive list of accomplishments  and experiences. Dr. Bennett began  his  long distinguished career as an  academician. From 1971  to 1981, he  served as assistant  to  the president  and assistant professor of philosophy  at Boston University, assistant profes sor of philosophy at the University of  Wisconsin, Madison, and executive di rector and president of the National  Humanities Center in North Carolina.  In 1981, Dr. Bennett began his serv ice for the Federal Government when  he was appointed by President Reagan  to be chairman of the National En dowment  for  the Humanities. He  served in this position until 1985 when  called upon by President Reagan to be  Secretary of Education. Currently, Dr.  Bennett is president of the Madison  Center,  a Washington, DC,  based  public-interest organization.  As Secretary of the Department of  Education and chair of the National  Institute for the Humanities, Dr. Ben nett displayed his capacity as a strong  administrator, as well as his ability to  address broader issues of concern  to  our Nation, such as drugs. In 1986, the  Department of Education implement ed the Drug Free Schools Act of 1986,  a drug abuse education grant program.  That same year the Department also  issued  the  first  edition  of  ""What  Works: Schools Without Drugs."" Dr.  Bennett also has served as a member  of  the National Drug Policy Board,  the highest-level drug policy entity in  the Federal Government. Dr. Bennett  has been outspoken on matters con cerning the drug crisis, having testi fied before Congress on  the matter,  and made numerous speeches as Secre tary of Education.  I support the nomination of William  Bennett  to be Director of National  Drug Control Policy. If confirmed by  the Senate, as I am sure he will be, I  have every confidence that he will per form his duties with exceptional skill,  as he has other positions in the past.  Mr. President, moving beyond  the  qualifications of Dr. Bennett, I believe  that he will need enormous help from  the Senate, the House, and from the  entire executive branch  if he  is  to  have any opportunity to complete this  very important mission.  During the course of the hearings, a  number  of  subjects were  discussed  showing that Dr. Bennett is going to  have to work very closely in foreign re lations to take a strong hand in the  curtailment of the growth of drugs in  South America, He is going to have to  take a strong hand involving the De partment of Defense on the judgment  niade by the Congress to involve the  military in interdiction. He will have  to take a strong hand in the activities  of the Department of Justice where so  many of  the activities of  the Drug  Czar must be implemented.  Mr. President, the job also involves  extensive efforts in the field of educa tion, where perhaps the only long-run  solution to the problem of drugs exists  in terms of telling those from kinder garten on up what are the dangers of  drugs in light of experience that 7 and  8, 9-year-olds use drugs.  Beyond  those  lines, Mr. President,  Dr. Bennett is going to have to have  cooperation on adequate  funding  so  that there are sufficient investigators  and task forces, so that there are suffi cient judges and perhaps most impor tantly,  jails  to house armed career  criminals engaged in drugs.  And so, Mr. President, beyond focus ing on the qualifications of Dr. Ben nett, we ought to say to ourselves we  are going to have to help him on this  enormous job if it is to be done.

235,1198,3,Mr.  HATFIELD.," Mr.  President,  every day, each one of us does some thing that could get us sent to jail in  at least half the countries around the  world: We speak our mind. On issues  big and small, we voice an opinion  every  day  in  100  different ways.  Indeed, we do it so often and so easily  that I doubt that many of us ever stop  to think about how precious our free dom really is.  Thousands of men and women  in  dozens of countries around the world  know exactly how precious that freedom-the freedom to simply speak-is,  Mr. President. These men and women,  from all walks of life, from all cultur al,  religious,  and  economic  back grounds, are Prisoners of Conscience  who had the courage  to speak their  minds in countries which did not want  to hear what  they had  to say. The  price they pay is  jail, oftentimes tor ture, and sometimes even death.  For 28 years, Amnesty International  has been adopting these Prisoners of  Conscience, shining  the spotlight of  international attention into their dark  cells and putting names and faces on  the statistics. Over the years, their ef forts  literally have  saved  lives  and  have won the freedom of thousands of  men and women.  Today,  the organization  is  asking  Congress and  the administration  to  adopt some of these Prisoners of Con science. Today, Amnesty International  is  asking each State delegation,  the  District of Columbia delegation, and  the administration to come together not as Democrats and Republicans,  not as conservatives and liberals, but  as men and women who cherish free dom-to work for the release of the in dividual Prisoners of Conscience  to  whom they are assigned.  I hope my colleagues will think the  next time they voice an opinion-what  would happen if our opinions landed  us in jail? Would anybody care? Would  those who had a free voice be willing  to speak on our behalf?  I ask that a list of the Prisoners of  Conscience assigned to the delegations  and to the administration be printed  in the RECORD.  The listing follows:  PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE  ADMINISTRATION, COUNTRY, AND PRISONER OF  CONSCIENCE  President Bush: China, Yulo Dawn Tser ing.  President Bush: Israel, Zahl Jaradat.  STATE DELEGATION, COUNTRY, AND PRISONER OF  CONSCIENCE  Alabama: Somalia, Sofia Hashi Madar.  Alaska: Morocco, El Hassan El Bou.  Arizona: Indonesia, Farid Majid.

236,1211,3,Mr. RAY.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to place  into the RECORD a copy of an article that ran  in the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer on Sunday,  February 26, 1989, entitled ""Snapshot of Co lumbus Patriot's Views"" written by Mr. Glenn  Vaughn which pays  tribute  to Mr. Maynard  Richard Ashworth.  The article follows:  [From the Columbus Ledger-Enqujrer, Fe\;>.  26, 1989]  SNAPSHOT OF COLUMBUS PATRIOT'S VIEWS  <By Glenn Vaughn)  Maynard Ashworth, who was my longtime  employer,  also  has  for  years  been my  mentor and friend. Few among us are more  keenly aware of national and world events  than he, and this is to shate a snapshot of  his thoughts.  Being the gentleman he is, he doesn't go  around spouting his opinions. But ask him  what he thinks and he'll answer with clarity  and candor. However, before getting into hi5  viewpoints, let's review his credentials.  Going on 95, Maynard Richard Ashworth  has lived during 44.4 percent of this nation's  213-year history.  He taught school after graduating in 1915  from what is now Central State University  in Warrensburg, Mo.  He  has  traveled  throughout  the nation and much of  the  world. He served as an Army officer in both  World War I and World War II. He was a  newspaperman for more than half a centu ry, serving as publisher of the Ledger-EnEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  quirer much of that time. He has known  some of the great leaders of this century.  He'a an historian. He's a patriot.  To me, he's ""the colonel,"" not just because  it is a title he earned in the Arm~. but be cause  it fits one who  is so distinguished.  Having recovered reasonably well from two  serious falls down steps at his Peachtree  Drive home, Col. Ashwortb  is busy  these  days involving himself in renovation work  there, including new carpets, painting and  wallpapering.  ""News,"" he  told me  the other day,  ''is  sometimes so depressing, I simply have to  break away from it for a while."" He said  thinking persons have to wonder how long  our free and open society can continue al lowing so much violence and greed befote  becoming a  ""controlled-state"" with  fewer  freedoms.  ""Freedom,"" he lamented, ""must be exer cised  in order  to keep  it, and  too many  simply will not take part, nor even vote."" He  said, ""Things have been so easy so long, we  begin to think this way of life is just going  to go on forever.""    Of the federal deficit, Col. Ashworth said,  ""We've got  to pay our bills;  there's too  much riding on it. We can't be beholden to  foreigners. They hold us in hock when they  buY our bonds to finance our debts.'' Unless  the United States remains solvent, he said,  the entite world's economy will collapse.  He deplored that ""so much public revenue  has been spent with so little to show for it.""  He added, ""Everybody wants federal money,  ,and when  one  group  gets money  from  Washington, others have a right to it and  the drain never ends. So many who wanted  states' rights are not willing to accept the  states' responsibilities  that go along with  those rights.""  On illegal drugs, he said, ""Education must  be part of the solution. We must get to indi viduals before  they become addicted."" To  reduce crime being committed by addicts, he  wondered if confiscated narcotics might be  used in a very tightly controlled ""weaning  process.""  On  overcrowded  prisons:  ""Whatever  it  takes, find  the money to build new facili ties.""  On Gorbachev's  reform  efforts  in  the  Soviet Union: ""If the Russians are being  honest with us, they'll prove it. Until then  we must not let our guard down.""  On Lt. Col. Oliver North: ""lie;s the most  thoroughly knowledgeable military' officer  I've ever seen. In a war, I'd want him in a  major role. He has been punished enough,""  On the media: ""While there are some good  programs on CNN, C-SPAN and public tele vision which give us an opportunity to hear  persons who know what  they are talking  about,  the media overall have  too much  power.""  The colonel sees as  the greatest danger  facing this nation ""the possibility that our  people may  lose  the will  to fight for the  freedoms and values we cherish.'' Ile. said  television is portraying war as so horrible,  he fears people will come to believe it is too  high a price to pay for liberty's survival.  Maynard  Ashworth's  views-nurtured  long ago largely by Horatio Alger""s writings  on hard worlc, honesty and thrift and tem pered by history-deserve to be often revis ited.  3999  SOCIAL SECURITY SERVICE$  IMPROVEMENT ACT  HON.

238,1224,3,Mrs. MARTIN of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, today  I am  introducing  the Committee Process Re forms of 1989, a package of 14 House rules  amendments aimed at revitalizing our commit tee system.  The acronym for committee process reform  is CPR, and  that's  just what our committee  system needs-a little cardiopulmonary resus citation. Committees are supposed  to com prise the very heart of the legislative process,  and yet  today  they are suffering  from hard ened arteries,  clogged valves, and  tangled  veins.  Committees and Members are overwhelmed  by too many subcommittees, too much staff,  and  jurisdictional overlaps and conflicts.  It's  little wonder  that committees must resort  to  one-third quorums and ghost voting  to get  things done. And it's little wonder that commit tees failed to reauthorize one-third of expired  laws last year totaling $23 billion.  My package of reforms would put us back  on the right track by limiting committees to no  more  than 6 subcommittees, Members to no  more than 4 subcommittee assignments, and  by reducing staff by 1 o percent. Moreover, it  would abolish  joint bill  referrals and proxy  voting,  and  restore majority  quorums  and  open meetings. My resolution would further re store  the May 15 reporting deadline  for au thorizations and require more systematic over sight. Finally, I would require a two-thirds vote  to consider any rule which makes in order an  unreported  bill.  Let's administer CPR  now  before the heart of the House, our committee  system, becomes a useless organ.  A summary of the resolution follows:  March 9, 1989  H. RES. 106  SUMMARY OF ""COMMITTEE PROCESS REFORMS OF  1989""  <A resolution introduced by Representative  LYNN MARTIN  to amend House rules ""to  restore the committee system to its right ful role in the legislative process"")  Sec. 1. Title: ""Committee Process Reforms  of 1989.""  Sec. 2. <a> House Rules would be amended  as follows:  < 1) Oversight Refonn.-Committees would  be required to formally adopt and submit to  the House Administration Committee by  March 1st of  the first session their over sight plans for that Congress. The House  Administration Committee, after consulta tion with the majority and minority leaders,  would  report  the plans  to  the House by  March 15th together with its recommenda tions,  and  those of  the  joint  leadership  group to assure coordination between com mittees. The Speaker would be authorized  to appoint ad hoc oversight committees for  specific tasks from the membership of com mittees with shared  jurisdiction. Commit tees would be required to include an over sight section in their final activity report at  the end of a Congress.  <2> Multiple Referral of Legislation.-The  joint referral of bills to two or more com mittees would be abolished, while split and  sequential referrals would be retained, sub ject to time limits and designation by the  Speaker of a committee of principal jurisdic tion.  (3) Committee Elections and Organiza tion.-Committees would  be  elected not  later than seven legislative days after the  convening of a new Congress and must orga nize not later than  three  legislative days  thereafter.  <4> Committee Ratios.-The party ratios  on committees would be required to reflect  that of the full House <except for Standards  of Official Conduct which  is bipartisan).  The requirement would extend to select and  conference committees as well.  (5) Subcommittee Limits.-No committee  <except  appropriations)  could have more  than six subcommittees, and no Member  could have more  than four subcommittee  assignments.  (6) Proxy Voting Ban.-All proxy voting  on committees would be prohibited.  (7) Open Meetings.-Committee meetings  could only be closed by majority vote for na tional security, personal privacy, or person nel reasons.  (8) Majority Quorums.-A majority of the  membership of a committee would be  re quired for the transaction of any business.

239,1250,3,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I don't represent  New York City, but  I do represent Oakland,  CA. Both cities, while a continent apart, have  been plagued by a continual battle with drug  abuse. the  lack of available, affordable drug  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  treatment programs, and  the  resulting AIDS  crisis from intraveneous drug abuse.  Will, a generation  from now, a nation  look  back and condemn our Government's current  callous disregard for an entire segment of our  population?  How, in a nation of such moral commitment  and  religious strength, can we stand  idly by  and do next to nothing?  Anyone who has held a tiny baby in  their  arms, knowing that this innocent, defenseless  baby will soon die from AIDS, recognizes that  we must commit ourselves  to  solving  this  problem. Anything  less  than providing avail able, affordable drug treatment-the best way  to attack the AIDS crisis currently plaguing our  inner cities-is morally indefensible.  Currently 9 out of 1 O of  IV drug abusers  who seek to pay for affordable treatment are  turned away and told to wait for at least 3 to 6  months  for an available  treatment slot. Can  anyone explain how we can allow this?  Do not assume that this is a crisis only in  New York, Oakland,  or other metropolitan  cities-this is happening in your own backyard  too. Whether it's Seattle or Miami, San Diego  or Bangor,  it's happening.  It's happening  in  Dothan. AL; in Butte, MT; in Lubbock, TX. You  just don't realize it yet.  Mr. Speaker.  the New York Times editorial  which follows ought to be required reading for  all Members:  THREE PLAGUES  Modern America's Three Plagues blight  the South Bronx: poverty, drug addiction  and AIDS. The population is now widely in fected with a disease that slowly drains the  body of control, sight, mind and life. When  the administrations of Mayor Edward Koch  and Gov. Mario Cuomo are long forgotten,  history will surely note that the New York  of their era left the poor to rot, in unparal leled numbers, from the cruelest of diseases.  Now  there is vivid evidence of just how  punishing  the AIDS plague has become.  Among emergency room patients tested at  Bronx-Lebanon Medical Center, 23 percent  were found  to be infected with the AIDS  virus, Bruce Lambert reported recently  in  The Times. That doesn't necessarily mean a  quarter of  the South Bronx  is  infected.  Emergency room patients are sicker than  the population at large. But it's a horrifying  warning.  The people of the South Bronx are mostly  black or Hispanic, and poor. Poverty and  drug addiction go  together. Unable to buy  clean needles, heroin addicts share  them,  thus spreading the blood-borne AIDS virus.  Crack houses. where sex is often exchanged  for drugs, spur the spread of other diseases,  which in turn promote the spread of AIDS.  Addicts then infect their partners. In one  South Bronx district, 1 of every 25 women  giving  birth  now  carries  the  virus,  and  nearly half of these infect their babies.  As  if  the Three Plagues weren't deadly  enough,  they  are magnified by  a  larger  malady: indifference. The poor of the South  Bronx do not speak loudly in the councils of  state. Other citizens readily see them, if at  all, as an underclass, an unregenerate source  of addiction and crime.  Society has not, surely, chosen a deliber ate policy to let them die. But if it had, the  present outcome would not be very differ ent. Governor Cuomo, announcing his five year plan for combating AIDS, declared last  week, ""I want to say as clearly as I can, I am  not putting into this plan this year nearly  March 13, 1989  enough money to meet these goals realisti cally.""  There is no public health plan to stem the  spread of AIDS in the South Bronx, just a  grab bag of half-hearted initiatives. If socie ty really cared about the Three Plagues. in  every South Bronx  across  the  country,  many measures might have been tried long  ago:  Drug treatment would be made available  on demand, and centers set up where ad dicts  congregate conquering  local opposi tion.  Instead of having to send addicts back on  the street when no drug  treatment was  available, clinics would be allowed to supply  them with clean needles. This would help  keep an addict coming back until a  treat ment slot was ready, meanwhile protecting  against infection.  Addicts would be urged to avoid sharing  needles, to sterilize their works with bleach  and  to enroll in dirty-for-clean needle ex change programs while awaiting treatment.  Each severely affected block would be as signed a health worker charged with insur ing that every resident understood how to  protect himself against contracting AIDS.  Once the victims of AIDS are dying, with  only months  to  live,  public  expenditure  soars,  often  reaching  $100,000  per  case.  Were a fraction of the same money avail able  for prevention, many  lives would be  saved.  Without a serious preventive effort,  the  incidence of AIDS in the South Bronx will  soon approach that in African cities with  minimal standards of public health. And the  levels  in other  inner cities won't  be  far  behind, to the enduring shame of all New  York and of all America.  TRIBUTE TO UKRAINIAN  PEOPLE  HON. BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 1989  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to  pay  tribute  to  the Ukrainian  people who  remain committed to  their struggle for sover eignty and  independent statehood. This year  marks the 70th anniversary of the unification  of Ukrainian  lands  in  the Ukrainian National  Republic. On January 22, 1918, in the city of  Kiev,  the Ukrainian Central Rada  issued a  proclamation declaring Ukraine a  free,  inde pendent nation, subordinated to no other for eign power and a member of the community  of free nations. Unfortunately for the people of  Ukraine  the  iron  fists of Soviet  leader after  Soviet  leader,  including  the present General  Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, have subjugated  these brave peoples. In  tribute, and recogni tion of their rights of political, economic, and  religious  freedom,  I wish  to submit  into  the  RECORD  the  fourth universal  issued on  that  January day 70 years ago.  FOURTH UNIVERSAL OF  JANUARY  22,  PROCLAIMING  THE  INDEPENDENCE  OF  UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REPUBLIC  People of Ukraine: By your strength, will.  and word a Free Ukrainian National Repub lic was established on the Ukrainian Land.  The  former  old dream of  your  fathers,  fighters for freedom and the rights of the  working people has come true.  1918,  THE  ",1989
240,1263,3,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, of  Pittston, PA, who will be celebrating their ?5th  anniversary this year.  The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick is an orga nization devoted  to  the preservation of  the  values brought to America by Irish immigrants.  Because our country  is a melting pot of so  many different cultures, it sometimes happens  that ethnic groups  lose part of  their cultural  heritage and identity in the process of assimi lating  into American culture. But the Friendly  Sons of St. Patrick keep the  Irish spirit alive  for the many individuals of Irish descent who  have  settled  in  northeastern Pennsylvania.  The language, songs, dances, and arts of the  Irish people are enthusiastically practiced so  that future generations may share in the proud  heritage of their ancestors.  The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, who have  met every St. Patrick's Day for these past 75  years, usually mark the occasion with a guest  of honor and a special award for an outstand ing Irish-American. This year's guest of honor  is Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey, a  good  friend and native son of northeastern  Pennsylvania. Governor Casey joins such dis tinguished names as Senator Hubert H. Hum phrey, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Presi dent Harry S. Truman  in being  the Pittston  Friendly Sons' guest of honor. This year's out standing  Irish-American  is  Maj.  Michael  Jordan,  the area 2 commander of the Penn sylvania State Police.  I am proud to join with  the Friendly Sons  in saluting Major Jordan  and the other honorees, who have contributed  much to Pennsylvania and the country.  This year  the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick  will be initiating a scholarship program for stu dents in the Pittston area. The Jack Brennan  Scholarship-named for a gentleman who has  served the Friendly Sons as Secretary for 17  years-will provide $1,000 for a needy college  student  from  the greater Pittston area. This  scholarship, which will be awarded every year  hereafter, will provide hope and help for stu dents who might not otherwise be able  to  afford a college education. I salute this effort  and am proud to be associated with this pro gram.  Mr. Speaker,  the Friendly Sons of St. Pat rick deserve our special attention and praise.  The members of  this organization seek not  only to preserve our diverse cultural past, but  also set their sights  toward a brighter future  for America.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  DEFICIT REDUCTION IS  CONGRESS' RESPONSIBILITY  HON. JOHN EDWARD PORTER  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 1989  ",1989
241,1263,3,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, like many other  Members of Congress, I was disappointed that  the  National  Economic  Commission  was  unable to come to a compromise and present  us with a plan to reduce the deficit.  The failings of the Commission only mirror  the  failings of this body, however. For many  years, Congress stood by and allowed deficits  to skyrocket and  then hoped  that a hastily  formed  commission would  give  it  political  cover to avoid the pain of deficit reduction.  With  the publication of  the Commission's  fractious  and  generally  inconclusive  report  comes  the  realization  that Congress cannot  duck  the deficit issue any  longer. Deficit re duction is Congress' responsibility.  The ball  is now squarely  in our court and  that is where  it will stay. The only course of  action left is for Members on both sides of the  aisle  to accept  the President's  invitation  to  bring to the bargaining table their priority pro grams and sacred cows and negotiate  real  deficit reduction.  VETERANS LOSE A GOOD  FRIEND  HON. G.V.(SONNY) MONTGOMERY  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 1989  ",1989
242,1263,3,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great sadness that I report to my colleagues  the passing of a dedicated and highly respect ed public servant, Hugh E. Davis, the director  of  the  Veterans'  Administration  Medical  Center at Salem, VA. Hugh died March 5 in  Richmond of a heart attack.  Just  last September, Representative  JIM  OUN and I met with Hugh in his office at the  VA hospital to discuss health care matters of  concern  to  regional  veterans. Hugh  was  down-to-earth, straight-shooting, and very effi cient. And you just couldn't find a more likable  fellow. He  is going to be missed not only at  the hospital but throughout the Virginia veter an community and  in  the Halls of Congress  where he maintained a very cooperative work ing  relationship with  those of us  involved  in  veterans' affairs.  Hugh Davis' career in service to his country  began  in 1942, prior to a 3-year hitch in  the  Army. Following his separation from  the mili tary, he continued to further his education as  he worked his way up through the VA system  in a series of fiscal, accounting, and adminis trative positions in Tennessee, Kentucky, Indi ana, Mississippi,  Arkansas,  South Dakota,  Washington, DC, and eventually Salem, VA,  where he was appointed medical center direc tor in 1972, a position he held until his death.  Since 1980, he had served as associate dean  of the school of medicine at the University of  Virginia. Hugh was very actively  involved  in  civic affairs.  4051  Mr. Speaker, Hugh Davis did an outstanding  job for the veterans of this Nation. I know my  colleagues will want to join with me in extend ing our sympathy to his family and in making  known our appreciation for his contributions to  improved quality in veterans' health care. His  is quite a legacy of distinguished public serv ice.  TRIBUTE TO JOYCE KALE-PESTA  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 1989  ",1989
243,1263,3,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great honor that I stand here today to pay trib ute to one of the most extraordinary citizens  of my 17th District, Mrs. Joyce Kale-Pesta.  Joyce was born in Youngstown, OH, and is  the daughter of Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Spangel.  She is an outstanding woman who participates  in community activities with great  frequency.  She  is  the  financial secretary of  the Ladies  A.O.H. and serves as the chairperson of the  L.A.0.H. Ways and Means Committee. She  serves as secretary to the Pete Gabriel's St.  Patricks Day Parade, is on the committee for  the Ursuline Alumni  Irish Show and  is  a  member of the Youngstown area Feis Society.  She is also a member of St. Edward's Parish.  In addition, Joyce is very active in  the Ma honing County Democratic Party  and  has  served under Chairman Don L. Hanni for the  past 11 years. She is a member of the John  F. Kennedy Federated Democratic Women's  Club,  the Federated Democratic Women of  Ohio, and  the Tri-County Democratic Organi zation. As acknowledgement for both her ex emplary efforts and unsurmountable dedica tion, Joyce was honored as  the Democratic  Woman of the Year in 1988.  Joyce is also very proud of her family. Her  husband Thomas J. Pesta and her four won derful sons, Robb Kale, Gregory Kale, Geof frey Kale and Eric Pesta, have provided  the  love and support necessary  throughout  the  years.  Joyce Kale-Pesta's unvarying perseverance,  devotion and  patience  should  serve as  a  model  for all  to  follow. And,  it  is with great  pride that I stand here today to congratulate  her as well as to wish her well in all future en deavors.  EASTERN AIRLINES STRIKE H.R. 1231  HON. JOHN P.

The minority position on  this legislation fol lows as well as two pertinent editorials.  ",1989
245,1276,3,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak  on behalf of House Joint Resolution  124 to commemorate the 75th anniver sary of enactment of the Smith-Lever  Act and its role in establishing our Na tion's system of State Cooperative Ex tension Services.  When President Woodrow Wilson  signed the Smith-Lever Act  into law  on May 8, 1914, the Extension Service  legally became the educational agency  of the U.S. Department of Agriculture  [USDAJ. Its mission, as mandated by  the legislation, is ""to aid in diffusion  among the people of the United States  useful and practical information. * * *  [EJxtension work shall consist of the  development of practical applications  of research knowledge and giving of  instruction and practical demonstra tions of existing or improved practices  or technologies.""  Actually, the Department of Agricul ture has been engaged  in extension  work prior to enactment of the Smith Lever Act. As early as 1898, a USDA  employee named Seaman A. Knapp  was demonstrating the results of agri cultural research on rice production to  Louisiana  farmers. By 1904 he was  joined by two dozen other agents in  Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. Two  years later Knapp's dream of network  of USDA agents in each county of the  country got underway.  Originally focused on disseminating  and  encouraging  the  application of  useful and practical information relat ing to agriculture and home econom ics,  today's Cooperative  Extension  system has adapted and changed  to  better serve modern American society.  While many of us associate Extension  activities with only agriculture, actual ly  two-thirds of Extensions' clientele  now live in metropolitan areas.  Today's Extension system  includes  professionals at each of our land-grant  universities-all  50  States,  Puerto  Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam,  the Northern Mariana Islands, Ameri can Samoa,  the Federated States of  Micronesia, and right here in the Dis trict of Columbia. Extension employ ees are in nearly all of the Nation's  counties.  In 1986, the Extension system refo cused its educational efforts and estab lished eight national priority  initia tives. These initiatives are: Alternative  agricultural  opportunities;  building  human  capital;  competitiveness  and  profitability of American agriculture;  conservation and management of nat ural  resources;  family and economic  well-being;  improving nutrition; diet,  and health; revitalizing rural America;  and water quality.  Recently,  the disturbing  statistics  and trends involving poverty, poor nu trition,  pregnancy,  substance  abuse,  depression,  the  suicide  among  our  teenagers led to the announcement of  a ninth initiative-""Youth at Risk.""  Mr. Speaker, for 75 years the Coop erative Extension system has  identi fied and sought to solve, through prac tical research-based knowledge, many  of the critical concerns of American  families and American agriculture. It  has served us well. The productivity of  the American farmer  is  testimony of  that. The fact that, out of all nations,  American consumers spent  the  least  percentage of their disposable income  on  food  is  testimony  to  that. The  knowledge Americans have about nu trition and food safety is testimony to  that.  Today's Extension system is prepar ing itself to meet the challenges of the  21st century. Its overall mission will be  even more  important  in  the  years  ahead-to link modern research, sci ence, and technology to the needs of  people  in ways  that help us  in our  daily lives and in improving the lives  of our children.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues  and  the 22 million households who  have at one time or another made use  of Extension services will  join me in  commemorating the enactment of the  Smith-Lever Act and in paying tribute  to the men and women who work in  today's Cooperative Extension system.  ",1989
246,1276,3,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  express my strong support  for House Joint  Resolution 124, a joint resolution to recognize  the 75th anniversary of  the Smith-Lever Act  and its role in establishing the system of State  Cooperative Extension Services.  The Extension Program has long been rec ognized as  truly outstanding.  It has played a  major role in helping to develop the most pro ductive agriculture system in the world, it has  encouraged our youth to take an active inter est in learning through 4-H, and has improved  our rural communities and urban areas as new  problems confronted  the Nation.  Its philoso phy of enhancing human progress through the  products of research has worked and has ef fectively  taken  knowledge  directly  to  the  people of rural America for 75 years.  Clearly,  the key  to  the success of the Ex tension Program has come because of  its  unique structure as a partnership of Federal,  State, and county governments with  strong  guidance in its priorities from those it serves.  Thousands of local volunteers and extension  professionals in more than 3,000 offices na tionwide contribute time and skills to help with  adult and youth programs.  The future of American relys largely on how  well  people  are  prepared  to  face  critical  issues, and the education Extension provides  can help us achieve that goal. Its focus on im proving  our  health  and  nutrition;  providing  ideas for new and competitive agriculture; re vitalizing  rural America and  the quality of  water we drink; and conserving and managing  our national resources will effectively lead us  into the 21st century.  Again,  I urge my  colleagues  to  support  House Joint Resolution 124 to celebrate the  years of valuable assistance the Cooperative  Extension Service has given us.  ",1989
247,1276,3,Mr. SARPALIUS.," Mr. Speaker, I think every one  in this House recognizes the importance  of  the Smith-Lever Act  and  the  profound  impact our State Cooperative Extension Serv ice has had on this Nation. I also know both  of you understand how much Extension has  meant to our home State of Texas.  But,  I would like to enter in to the RECORD  some  information about  the work  the Texas  Agricultural Extension Service is doing today.  Extension has been extremely  important  to  the 13th District of Texas. It is no small coinci dence  that  the Extension Service has been  aggressive and active in this, one of the most  productive agriculture regions in the country.  By making this information about Extension  services available for all to see, we are paying  tribute to the countless men and women who  over the last 75 years have helped build Ex tension into what it is today.  Texas, as well as  the other states, also  joins with the U.S. Department of Agricul ture to form a nationwide cooperative Ex tension network.  Those  things start with  food and  fiber  products, but also include economies, busi nesses and communities, families, youth and  leaders.  Today's agriculture is based on productivi ty and profitability-a $33 billion per year  economic impact on Texas and the source of  one out of every five jobs.  ",1989

Whereas  in Washington, District of Co lumbia, on March 26,  the Govern ments of Israel and Egypt, with the support  and encouragement of  the United States,  signed a  treaty of peace formally ending  their state of war;  Whereas this treaty, the only peace agree ment between Israel and any Arab nation,  remains a crucial element in fostering peace  in the Middle East;  Whereas under terms of this historic doc ument Israel and Egypt agreed to end the  state of war between them, Israel fully with drew its military forces and civilian settle ments from the Sinai Peninsula, and Israel  and Egypt established formal diplomatic re lations, including the exchange of ambassa dors;  Whereas the establishment of peace be tween Israel and Egypt demonstrates that  direct bilateral negotiations are the most ef   fective way to resolve the Arab-Israeli con flict and can lead to lasting and mutually  beneficial results;  Whereas the other parties to the conflict  have been unwilling to enter into direct bi lateral negotiations but continue to main tain a state of war against Israel;  Whereas the continuation of the conflict  has exacted a high cost in human lives and  human  suffering  from both  Israelis and  Arabs; and  Whereas the treaty has allowed the peo ples of Israel and Egypt to begin to build a  network of cultural, economic, personal, and  political contacts and relations among them selves: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress  assembled, That  the United  States Government(!) commends Israel and Egypt for their  historic act of courage and statesmanship in  signing the Treaty of Peace of March 26,  1979;  <2> calls upon the President to mark this  historic anniversary with appropriate public  activities;  (3) welcomes the willingness of Israel and  Egypt to continue to observe the interna tional obligations they have accepted which  have contributed to the peace and stability  of the region; and  (4) calls upon other Arab nations and the  Palestinians to follow the example of Israel  and Egypt,  to  join actively  in  the peace  process,  to renounce the state of war and  acts of violence, and to enter into face-to face negotiations with Israel to achieve a  just and lasting peace.

252,1289,3,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like  to express my deep appreciation to the  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee,  the gentleman  from Florida  [Mr. FASCELL],  the chairman of  the  Subcommittee  on Europe  and  the  Middle  East  [Mr.  HAMILTON];  the  ranking Republican member of  the  full committee,  the gentleman  from  Michigan [Mr. BROOMFIELD]; and the  ranking Republican member of  the  subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  New York [Mr. GILMAN], for their CO  operation and support in bringing this  critical resolution before the House.  This month, Mr. Speaker, we cele brate  the 10th  anniversary  of  the  Treaty of Peace between the State of  Israel and the State of Egypt. It was in  our own city of Washington on March  26, 1979, that these two governments,  with the support and the encourage ment  of  the Government  of  the  United States, signed a treaty of peace  formally ending their state of war.  This treaty, Mr. Speaker, is the only  peace agreement in existence between  Israel and any Arab nation and it re mains the crucial cornerstone of sta bility in the entire Middle East. Under  terms of this historic document, Israel  and Egypt agreed to end the state of  war between them. Israel fully with drew all its military forces and disman tled all its civilian settlements in the  Sinai Peninsula, and  the  two  coun tries, Egypt and  Israel,  established  formal diplomatic relations, including  the exchange of Ambassadors.  This peace treaty, Mr. Speaker, dem onstrates that direct face-to-face nego tiations are the most effective and pos sibly the only way to resolve the Arab Israeli  conflict  through  face-to-face  negotiations, which in this case led to  a  lasting  and mutually  beneficial  peace treaty.  For too long a very high human cost  has been exacted from both the Israe lis and the Arabs  in  the region, be cause the other countries in the area  have refused  to do what Egypt has  done, sit down  in face-to-face direct  negotiations.  I want  to pay  tribute  to  the late  Egyptian President Sadat who  flew  the Jerusalem to initiate this critically  important step and who paid for his  courage with his life.  Our  resolution, Mr. Speaker, com mends Israel and Egypt for their historic  courage  and  statesmanship  in  signing the treaty of peace. Our reso lution calls on our President to mark  this historic anniversary with appro priate festive public activities.  We welcome the willingness of Israel  and Egypt to continue to observe all  their international obligations which  so heavily contribute to the peace and  stability of the region.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we call on all  Arab nations and Palestinians in the  area to follow  the example of Israel  and Egypt,  to  join actively  in  the  peace process, to renounce the state of  war and to renounce the acts of vio lence and to enter into face-to-face ne gotiations with the State of Israel to  achieve a lasting and just peace.  ",1989
253,1289,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity to express my strong  support for Congressman LANTos' res olution, House Joint Resolution 187,  commemorating the 10th anniversary  of the historic peace treaty between  Israel and Egypt. It is proper that we  should  celebrate  this  courageous  treaty between  these  two great na tions.  In 1979, after 30 years of a state of  war,  two  farsighted  leaders,  Prime  Minister Menachem Begin of  Israel  and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt,  came together to forge a lasting peace  between  their  two  countries. This  treaty was possible because both sides  sought to find a permanent solution to  their differences. Both leaders wanted  to give peace a chance and take a risk  for peace. Anwar Sadat risked alienat ing  the Arab world, and eventually  paid for his act of courage with his life  in 1981. Menachem Begin risked the  security of Israel itself and the anger  of his own people when he gave up the  Sinai, including all of the existing Is raeli settlements there.  The  result has been 10  years of  peace based on mutual recognition and  respect. The  success of  this  treaty  demonstrates that direct negotiations  between the differing parties can have  impressive  results.  Israel and Egypt  are now spared the expense and waste  of constant conflict. Both countries  are  now  enjoying  the  benefits  of  peace.  In light of the present tragic disturb ance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,  I  believe  all parties should demon strate the same spirit of reconciliation  and trust that Menachem Begin and  Anwar Sadat demonstrated 10 years  ago. That is the only way to a just and  lasting peace.  The United States stands ready, as it  did 10 years ago, to act as an honest  broker  in  the pursuit of peace. We  wish to assist this process in any way  possible.  ",1989
254,1302,3,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague, the gentlewoman from  California, and I appreciate the oppor tunity  to participate  in  this special  order.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to salute  my colleague for her fine work on our  Human Resources Task Force as part  of the work we are doing in the Com mittee on the Budget.  The Committee on  the Budget  is  many times a very depressing experi ence. There are  so many needs  in  America and so few  resources, but I  can  tell  the Members candidly  that  the work on  this Human Resources  Committee has been uplifting, posi tive, and has  really  indicated  to us  that the common complaint that our  programs, our governmental programs,  are ineffective, wasteful, and duplica tive are in this day and age in many  respects not directed properly to the  programs that we address during this  special order.  0 1510  For you see, Mr. Speaker, we have  found over the last 20 years that there  have been many experiments in social  programs  in America which  have  failed, but  likewise  there are many  which have been resounding successes.  We come today in this special order  to  speak of  those successes and  to  speak of  the  continuing  challenges  that face us.  The first  response of anyone who  would listen to our remarks from the  floor of the House, the listening audi ence or  the gallery, might be, ""Oh,  here they come again, another group  of Congressmen and Congresswomen  with some bright ideas that are going  to cost me some more money. Well,  thanks, but no thanks. It's about time  Congress  learned  to  live within  its  means."" For those who fall in that cat egory,  the  so-called  styptic hearted  who want  to know  the bottom  line,  how much money is this going to cost  and what will it save, let me offer a  few statistics about just one aspect of  the problem  facing America  today.  The problem is the challenge of infant  mortality.  Most Americans are surprised, if not  shocked,  to  learn  of  the  dreadful  infant mortality rates  in  the United  States. To put the phrase infant mor tality  in better perspective, we  are  talking about the death rate of babies  in America. How do we  rank in the  world? In fact, we rank 18th. We are  tied for the last among industrialized  nations in the world in terms of the  survival rate of American babies. We  are behind such nations as Spain and  Singapore.  American  black  infant mortality  places us 28th in the world, behind the  overall rates of Cuba and Bulgaria. A  black baby born in this District of Co lumbia  today  in  the shadow of  the  White House is more likely to die  in  the first year of his life than if that  baby were born  today  in  Jamaica,  Trinidad, Tobago, Chile, Panama, Ro mania, or the Soviet Union.

255,1341,3,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. Speaker,  the election of  1988 proved  that Republicans have made  great stides  in  recruiting  thousands of new  voters. People who  traditionally have called  themselves  ""Democrats""  have made  the  switch. They saw the far-left factions dominat ing  their party and contrasted  it with our vi brant GOP  team and made a simple deci sion-they defected to a political camp which  better represents mainstream American ideals  and  beliefs. And  the Republican National  Committee, with Lee Atwater at  the helm,  is  going  to carry  that message  to  thousands  more.  I only regret  that  the emotionally charged  students at Howard University failed to recog nize  the  things which our party's new chair man and  the GOP really represent. And  it is  their  loss. However,  I commend  chairman  Atwater's  response  to  the Howard students  which was published in the March 10 edition  of the Washington Post.  I only hope that the  students will  take  the  time  to read his mes sage and  realize  the opportunities our party  offers.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you include the RNC  chairman's article to be printed in the RECORD  immediately followingt my remarks.  [From the Washington Post]  WHAT I WOULD HAVE TOLD THE HOWARD  STUDENTS  <By Lee Atwater)  On Tuesday I resigned from the Howard  University Board of Trustees. I did so with  deep  regret. The board had honored me  with its support, and I  looked forward  to  serving the students and the community as  a  trustee of  this outstanding historically  black university.  I must confess that the idea of serving on  Howard's board would never have occurred  to me. But when Howard President James  Cheek informed me that I was a unanimous  choice to join that board, I was excited by  the prospect-excited because  I  believed  that I could be helpful to the university in  fund raising, scholarship endowment, identi fying job opportunities for graduates and in  scholastic opportunities such as student in ternships at the White House and the Re publican National Committee. I was espe cially pleased that I could help bring money  into a university the overwhelming majority  of whose students depend on tuition assist ance to get their education.  The fact is, I had a lot to offer Howard,  and the idea of serving a distinguished uni versity known for its academic diversity and  respect for the free exchange of ideas ap pealed greatly to me.  Despite what some of my critics say, I did  not, as chairman of the Republican Nation al Committee, expect  to come  to Howard  with unanimous support from the student  body. But I did expect to have a chance-a  chance not only  to prove my sincerity in  reaching out, but also to show that I could  deliver for Howard. What I regret most is  that I was not given that opportunity.  ",1989
256,1354,3,Mr. KOL TEA.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  bring to the attention of my colleagues a very  serious environmental problem. This problem,  however,  unlike many which  confront  us  today, is one in which a solution is within our  reach-in fact, we have  the technology,  it is  affordable and quite  feasible  to undertake.  The problem to which I refer is contamination  of our water supplies.  Each year, billions of gallons of potable  water are lost. Last year, for instance, on Jan uary 2, hundreds of thousands of residents of  communities surrounding Pittsburgh were with out water for over 1 week when an oil storage  tank at the Ashland Oil facility erupted, spilling  over 700,000 gallons of diesel  fuel  into  the  Monongahela River. You may also recall  the  tragedy that occurred in South Dakota when a  1,000 gallon gasoline spill at the Williams Pipe  Line  Company's  facilities  reached  ground  water supplies. That particular  incident oc curred  early  in  1987 but underscored  the  danger such storage tanks can pose as Wil liams' equipment was responsible for the con tamination of either water or soil in the South  Dakota area eight times since October 1983.  Mr. Speaker, current regulations require that  storage  tanks near navigable waters have a  secondary means of containment.  In most  cases,  this simply consists of an earthwork  dike around the tank. Needless to say,  in the  event of an emergency, existing secondary  systems can prove grossly inadequate, in that  they  fail  to protect  the  public health and  safety. As  I stated earlier, we possess  the  technology to prevent this type of disaster.  I  am referring to a liner system. Such systems  are already required  in above ground storage  tanks containing hazardous wastes. However,  more accidents could be prevented if we were  to extend this requirement to apply to second ary containment of oil storage tanks as well.  These  liners, usually made of polyethylene  plastic have proven very effective at perma nently eliminating  the problem of  leakage.  These liners actually strengthen storage dikes  and have also actually helped in  leak detec tion. Not only can liners prevent contamination  of drinking water supplies but  they can be  used to restore tanks themselves.  Mr. Speaker, protection of the environment  and  the public's welfare is of the utmost im portance. Contamination of our land and our  water supplies must be guarded against.  I  strongly suggest that the Environment Protec tion Agency examine the potential for a liner  requirement  that would help  to prevent any  future tragedies.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  THE ARIAS PEACE PLAN: A  BROKEN DREAM  HON. PHILIP M. CRANE  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 14, 1989  ",1989
257,1354,3,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  if recent history  has shown us anything, it has shown us that  Communist governments break  international  agreements with  appalling  regularity.  From  Yalta  to Helsinki  to numerous arms agree ments,  the Soviet Union and  its surrogates  have shown a remarkable propensity to break  agreements.  Nicaragua is a Soviet client state, and Con gress should have no illusions regarding San dinista compliance with  the Arias peace plan  or any other peace agreement that the current  Nicaraguan dictatorship may enter into with its  Central American neighbors.  Indeed the San dinistas  have  already  established  a  track  record of broken promises.  In 1979, when  they needed the support of  the Organization of American States to legiti mize their regime, they promised to allow po litical pluralism, maintain a truly mixed econo my, respect human rights, and conduct a non aligned  foreign  policy. These  promises al lowed the Sandinistas the time they needed to  consolidate  their power  in Nicaragua, power  that enabled them to break each of the at ore mentioned promises.  The only force which has proven itself able  to pressure the Sandinistas into honoring their  promises are the Nicaraguan freedom fighters,  commonly referred to as the Contras, who the  United States has  intermittently  supported.  The Congress has cut off all of the vital mili tary aid to the Contras, and has, in effect, al lowed the Contras to wither on the vine.  Congress  is disregarding history at the ex pense of the freedom of the people of Nicara gua. It is with these thoughts in mind that I re spectfully submit the following  report  for  the  RECORD.  THE ARIAS PEACE PLAN: A BROKEN DREAM  In February of 1987, Oscar Arias of Costa  Rica  introduced his now  famous Central  American Peace Plan;  it was  signed  six  months later by the leaders of all five Cen tral American countries. Although the plan  addressed the entire region,  in essence, it  was meant to end the 9 year-old conflict in  Nicaragua. Unfortunately, for the people of  Nicaragua,  the Arias Peace Plan has thus  far been a failure.  By signing this Peace Plan, Daniel Ortega  committed  the  Sandinistas  to  working  toward the democracy  they had promised  the people of Nicaragua nine years before.  However, as was the case in 1979, it would  seem that Ortega's true intention in signing  the Arias Peace Plan on August 7, 1987, was  to buy time in crushing all internal and ex ternal opposition rather than promoting the  principles of democracy.  In March of  this year,  the Nicaraguan  Democratic Resistance met with the Sandi nistas face to face in Sapoa, Nicaragua. Re sistance  leaders were confident that they  had reached an agreement with the Sandi nistas that would finally mean ""peace with  freedom"" for the Nicaraguan people. This  was not to be the case.  Within  two weeks of signing the Sapoa  Agreement,  the  Sandinistas  violated  its  March 14, 1989  terms. In exchange for a ""definitive cease fire,"" under which  the Resistance would  agree to lay down its arms, the Sandinistas  promised, < 1) an internal dialogue in which  members of  the Resistance would be al lowed  to participate, (2) unrestricted free dom of the press, and (3) release of all polit ical prisoners. Sapoa called on the Sandinis tas to sign an agreement by April 6, estab lishing  a  resupply  system and cease-fire  zones which Resistance  forces were  to  occupy during a 60-day truce.  Once the occupation was under way, the  Sandinistas would have  to follow  through  with the commitments made at Sapoa. This  never happened because  the Sandinistas  reneged on signing the agreement establish ing a viable resupply system for the Resist ance forces. Since that time, the Sandinista  regime has disavowed itself from any agree ments involving democratization and Sapoa,  while at the same time using the cease-fire  to their advantage.  While Nicaraguan Resistance  troops are  forced to become refugees in Honduras, the  Sandinistas have been working aggressively  to wipe out all forms of opposition within  Nicaragua. For some reason,  liberal demo crats in the U.S. Congress have stood by and  watched as  the Sandinistas  increase  their  oppression  in Nicaragua,  thus leaving the  situation more desperate  than before  the  Arias Peace Plan's introduction. Because  the House Democratic  leadership has  re mained faithful  to Sandinista promises of  democratization, the Nicaraguan Resistance  is being stripped of its ability to remain a  viable opposing  force  to  the Sandinistas.  This is a dangerous development for both  the  people of Central America and  the  United States.  It is now clear that the Sandinistas have  no intention of working within the frame work of either the Arias Peace Plan or the  Sapoa Agreement. The future of Nicaragua  has never been more bleak. The hope that  the Arias Peace Plan originally  inspired  within the people of Nicaragua has turned  into  a  nightmare. To  continually  ignore  Sandinista  insincerity  toward  peace  can  only make things worse for those who must  live  their daily  lives under this tyrannical  regime. It is time to hold the Sandinistas ac countable.  ON THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT  DEAR  FRIENDS: For  almost  eight years  thousands of brave men, women and chil dren have been sacrificing  their  lives  in  order  to  secure  a  long-desired  free  and  democratic Nicaragua. Like  those freedom  fighters of  the American Revolution who  fought and died so that future generations  of Americans could live in a pluralistic socie ty where the rights of the individual come  first,  so  do  these dedicated Nicaraguans  desire to benefit from the fruits of democra cy.  When given the opportunity, the Nicara guan Resistance was able  to perform sur prisingly well against a military force receiv ing over $40 million a month in Soviet mili tary aid. Now, because certain members of  Congress decided  to place  their  trust  in  Daniel Ortega, the Resistance is no longer  seen as a viable threat to the Sandinistas.  Unfortunately,  the new Republican ad ministration is  faced with a dilemma that  goes beyond whether  the Resistance  re mains a capable opposition. The problem  now centers around whether the next ad ministration is going  to allow  the intense  human suffering and the increased threat  ",1989

He was recently commemorat ed at a special Touchdown Club lunch eon. I know him as a special friend,  and I have a special series of remarks  to present into the RECORD.  Recently,  in  the Nation's Capital,  my friend Barnee Breeskin, the com poser of ""Hail to the Redskins,"" the  most famous team song in the history  of all professional sports, and a man  known  to U.S. Presidents and Mem bers of Congress for his generous char itable work through Saints and Sin ners Club roasts, was honored by the  Touchdown Club of Washington for  his life long achievements and his con tribution to the public and to the life  of this city and our country.  We  all  join  in  this  long overdue  salute  to Barnee Breeskin,  a  great  American, whose ""Hail  to  the Red skins"" song is part of the ritual of fall  in this city-a song on everyone's lips  throughout this city and region, espe cially during the football season as it  is regarded as the theme song of the  Nation's Capital.  President George Bush  and  Jack  Kent Cooke, Washington Redskin's  chairman,  expressed  their  apprecia tion to Barnee Breeskin for what he  has meant to this city and the coun try. We would  like  to  thank John  O'Brien, Northern Telecom and Marty  Walsh, United Way of America who  put  together  this Touchdown Club  tribute. It's the first time that Barnee  has been so honored, but never the  last!  Finally, we would like to thank the  Circus Saints and Sinners and their  chairman, Gen. Donald Dawson, presi dent, Army and Navy Club and Barnee  Breeskin for  their charitable efforts  over the past two decades,  involving  Members of Congress,  and persons  from the executive branch.

But, none theless, I want to take just a few min utes to observe the passing of one of  Montana's true pioneers and a person al, dear friend of mine.  On March 15, Peter Yegen, Jr., of  Billings, died at the age of 92. He was  active in his business until almost the  day he passed away, the business of  real estate and insurance.

So many wonderful  technologies,  from medicine, communications, and  the list goes on, were developed during  his time. In fact, you could say that we  went from traveling on horseback to  traveling to the moon. He came from a  generation of stalwart men who faced  not only survival in a hard land, but  while they were doing it, they ensured  the Nation's  survival  through  two  great wars and a devastating drought,  and in the 1930's, an economic depres sion.

271,63,7,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to join the senior Senator  from Alaska as an original cosponsor  of  the  Prince William Sound Oil  Tanker Navigation Safety Act of 1989,  which is designed  to respond to the  devastating oilspill off Valdez, AK,  and to prevent a recurrence.  As the ranking Republican member  of the Commerce Committee's Nation al Ocean Policy Study,  the Senator  from Alaska has been a leader in all of  our efforts to protect the ocean and  coastal waters, their living marine re sources, and the people who depend  upon  them. This bill  reflects, once  again, his strong leadership and com mitment to those objectives.  This is comprehensive legislation. It  imposes new  requirements for pilot age,  licensed personnel, alcohol  test ing, disclosure of drunk driving convic tions,  radar monitoring,  and other  measures that should serve to prevent  another grounding  like  that of  the  Exxon Valdez. It also establishes firm  requirements  for contingency plans,  requires that they be approved by the  Coast Guard, makes the provisions of  those plans  legally binding and en forceable, and provides for Federal di rection and control of cleanup efforts  to avoid a recurrence of the shameful  fiasco that we have witnessed over the  past several weeks. Finally, the legisla tion responds to the human needs re sulting from an oilspill of this magni tude. It recognizes that a major oilspill  is, in fact, a national disaster, and pro vides well-deserved  relief and assist ance to people who are impacted by  such a spill.  In short, Mr. President, the senior  Senator  from Alaska has developed  comprehensive and effective  legisla tion in response  to  the Alaskan oil spill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.  ",1989
272,63,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  today I am joining with my senior col league from Alaska, Senator TED STE VENS, to cosponsor the Prince William  Sound Tanker Safety Act.  The need for this corrective legisla tion was  horribly demonstrated on  March 24, 1989 when the oil  tanker  ran  aground  spilling  some 240,000 barrels of North Slope  crude oil into the waters of Prince Wil liam Sound, AK.  The effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill have been disasterous. Hundreds  of miles of formerly pristine beaches  have been fouled by crude oil. Thou sands upon  thousands of birds, ani mals, fish, and other creatures depend ent  upon  the marine  environment  have been killed.  Fishermen, guides, and many other  Alaskans have lost millions of dollars  in income. Some may even lose their  way of life.  Exxon has spent and will continue  to spend millions of dollars to clean up  the crude oil and attempt to restore  Prince William Sound.  All of this occurred because every one involved became complacent.  Because we were careless and com placent we did not adequately and ac curately  assess  the  risks  associated  with oil tanker traffic in Prince Wil liam Sound. Because we  failed  to  assess  the risks, we did not seek to  eliminate them.  Mr. President,  the  legislation that  Senator STEVENS and I are introducing  today attempts to do that very thing.  It attempts to eliminate and minimize,  Valdez  Exxon  ",1989
273,102,7,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to introduce legislation to desig nate October 1989 and 1990 as Nation al Down Syndrome Month. I have in troduced  this  proposal  every  year  since 1984, and I am convinced that  Congress will once again enact such a  law  to  encourage  continued under standing and advancement in the med ical and educational programs  con cerned with Down syndrome.  Down syndrome occurs once in every  1,000 births. It results from a genetic  mishap in which an extra chromosome  No.  21-which affects physical and  mental development-is found within  the individual's genetic material. For  years,  Down  syndrome  carried  a  stigma of being a hopeless impediment  to a meaningful and productive life.  Happily, recent medical research has  brought about the possibility of cor recting a number of the disorders asso ciated with this genetic defect. More over,  infant  stimulation  programs  taught to parents of babies with Down  syndrome have increased their intel lectual development far beyond previ ous expectations.  Since the enactment of the Educa tion for All Handicapped Children Act  <Public Law 94-142), we have seen the  rewards of educating the developmen tally disabled  in our public schools.  These  rewards can be measured  in  terms of their increased achievements  and, consequently,  the contributions  that these children are later able to  make to society. This alone is a major  breakthrough in our regard for these  boys and girls, men and women, fellow  members  of  our  families  and  our  neighborhoods. We have come to the  important  realization  that  persons  with Down syndrome, though limited,  can and do contribute to the welfare  of our society. These individuals are  not to be regarded as a mere responsi bility. They are capable human beings  who need our encouragement to reach  their full potential.  We have an obligation to forge new  social attitudes so that persons with  Down syndrome will be accepted for  what they are-people first, and sec ondly people with Down syndrome.

276,141,7,Mr. LAUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to introduce a bill for the relief  of River Publishers, Inc. of Wharton,  TX.  The proprietors of River Publishers,  Inc.,  a  small newspaper  publishing  company in my district, wholehearted ly relied upon the Bay City, TX, Post  Office to provide guidance and proper  postal forms required to mail 13,000  copies a week of their publication and  pay the appropriate postage. The post master of Bay City billed River Pub lishers on these 13,000 copies at the  wrong rate from May 5, 1983, through  January 4, 1984. The result was a 9month mistake and an acknowledged  error by the postmaster of $26,491.95.  If the proprietors of River Publish ers, Inc. had been presented with the  correct rate of postage from the post master, they would have quickly decid ed not to proceed with this particular  publication.  My bill would relieve River Publish ers, Inc. of Wharton, TX, of all liabil ity for payment to the United States  of the amount of $26,491.95, which is  the difference between  the amount  that should have been paid and the  amount actually paid by River Pub lishers  for  postage on  a  requester  second-class mailing of the mid-coast  advertiser for the period from May 5,  1983, through January 4, 1984. Such li ability resulted from the reliance of  River Publishers,  Inc.  upon  postal  rates specified  in good faith by the  Bay City postmaster although such  rates were erroneous.  Mr. Speaker, I am introducing this  companion bill along with the gentle man from Texas, Senator LLOYD BENT SEN, who has already submitted his  version in the Senate. I encourage my  colleagues to join and support me to  relieve an erroneous burden from a  vital and indispensable community es tablishment.  This was an election in which the  opposition, media, and press had been  stifled, manipulated, and controlled.  Yet,  Panamanian  people  traveled  many miles on foot or by bus to wait  in lines for 4 or more hours in the hot  sun and registered their opposition to  Noreiga.  This was an election  in which fo menting of anti-United States senti ment was  endemic by  the Govern ment. Yet, we were welcomed at the  polling places literally with cheers and  were begged to stay there to prevent  brutality literally with tears.  The courage and determination of  the opposition voters were remarkable  as was their affection for the people of  the United States. The daughter of a  government candidate for Vice Presi dent worked against her own father  because she believed her children need  to grow up in a democracy. On numer ous occasions voters risked their per sonal safety in insisting on their right  to vote.  It would be a tragedy if their cour age and the will of the vast majority  of the Panamanian people were per manently thwarted.

277,141,7,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Speaker, during  the lOOth Congress I introduced legis lation  to withdraw certain  lands  in  California for military use. While the  legislation passed under suspension of  the rules in the House, it did not re ceive final consideration in the Senate  prior to adjournment last fall.  I am  now reintroducing the measure with  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  California [Mr. HUNTER].  The  lands  to  be withdrawn  are  within  Chocolate Mountain Aerial  Gunnery  Range  and  China  Lake  Weapons  Center.  The  bill  would  rewithdraw these lands for a period of  15 years. While both of the tracts have  been used by the Department of the  Navy since World War II, congression al approval of these lands expired in  the 1970's.  In order to remain consistent with  provisions of comprehensive military  land withdrawal legislation passed at  the close of the 99th Congress,  this  bill sets out similar terms of withdraw al. For example, the 15-year withdraw al, a draft environmental impact state ment to be completed no more than 12  years after the law's enactment, and a  requirement for on-going decontami nation efforts all conform with  the  standards set in Public Law 99-606.

278,141,7,Mr.  SHARP.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  United States worked hard last year to  gain its position as the chairman of  the most important international body  considering the issue of global warm ing. In this position, the United States  has the opportunity to  lead on this  vital question.  But now the administration is squan dering this opportunity because we are  the only major Western country not  advocating an international ""conven tion"" on global climate protection.  This is clearly an international prob lem  requiring  international coopera tion. We must help  formulate  the  worldwide response.  Last week  the Energy and Power  Subcommittee held a hearing where  the Environmental Protection Agency  presented its analysis of the policy op tions we could choose among to slow  global warming. Some actions would  surely be better for us than others. We  certainly have the analytical capabil ity  to help  the world decide what  paths we should take. But if we fail to  lead now, we won't have the credibil ity.  If we fail to lead-if all the adminis tration does is bicker among the dif ferent  departments  and  allow  the  policy to drift, if all the President does  is muzzle his own scientists-we are  going to let others decide our fate.  This week, OMB censored the testi mony of Dr. James Hansen of NASA,  one of the acknowledged experts on  global warming. Last year, when my  subcommittee  invited him to  testify,  the administration  tried  to send us  someone  else,  someone who would  soften the message. Dr. Hansen was al lowed to appear only when we told the  administration  that  if  he  did  not  appear, there would be an empty chair  at the witness table with Dr. Hansen's  name on it.  Perhaps this empty chair is an excel lent metaphor for the role the admin istration is playing in the internation al arena. Unless we mend our ways.

281,154,7,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker, for pur poses of debate only, I yield 4 minutes  to  the  gentleman  for Ohio  [Mr.  SAWYER].  ",1989
282,154,7,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to join with my other colleageus this  afternoon to congratulate our chair man,  the gentleman from California  [Mr. HAWKINS] for his courage and te nacity getting  this bill  to  the  floor  today.  I found this reauthorization process  gratifying because we were actually  able  to solicit and synthesize a vast  amount of information and design a  common sense blueprint for positive  change.  This legislation and the vocational  educational programs  it supports  in  this Nation need to be elevated, and I  think what  the committee did will  help to achieve this goal.  Mr. Speaker, one of  the areas  in  which this elevation is most important  concerns the level of academic compe tency that is achieved by students in  vocational education programs. If vo cational education programs, and their  graduates, are to realize their full po tential, they will need to obtain the  same basic skill credentials that their  counterparts  in basic  academic  set tings receive. Under the provisions of  our bill only those programs that inte grate both academic and occupational  studies will receive Carl Perkins Feder al funding. Academic and occupational  competencies will be measured, ena bling us to plainly see where improve ments are necessary.  If vocational education programs are  to be on the leading edge of larger na tional efforts to change the way we  learn and train for our jobs, then this  kind  of  approach,  incorporating  higher order learning skills,  is abso lutely essential.  There was a time when a man could  go to work with a good attitude and a  set of tools and earn himself a pretty  solid  living, but  today a man or a  woman in the workplace needs the full  range of skills  that our schools are  able to provide them with. The old dis tinctions  between  blue  and white  collar work may  today  be  forever  blurred. This measure goes far to re flect  that change  in our schools as  well.  I would also like to thank the Chair man and members of the committee  for  including  in  this  package my  amendment on  teacher  training and  development. Teacher training and re cruitment  problems  are  endemic  throughout our education system-1  million new teachers will be needed by  the end of the century-but the prob lem is particularly acute in the voca tional education field. Poor working  conditions, a perceived lack of status  of faculty and noncompetitive salaries  in some places are preventing talented  teachers from joining the system and  driving existing teachers into careers  in business and industry.  The leadership development awards  and professional development fellow ships that are authorized under this  bill-$5 million-should go a long way  towards  building  capacity  into  the  system.  Let me finish, Mr. Speaker, by ex pressing my sincere admiration for the  work that has been done on this bill. I  would also  like  to express my grati tude to our ranking member, the gen tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goon LING] for his leadership in this process.  I  look forward  to working with you  and all our distinguished committee  colleagues  as  the  reauthorization  moves forward.  ",1989
283,154,7,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker, for pur poses of debate only, I yield 2 minutes  to  the gentleman from  Illinois  [Mr.  POSHARD].  ",1989
284,154,7,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 7, the Carl  D. Perkins Applied Technology Educa tion Amendments of 1989.  In  the  southern  Illinois  district  which  I  represent,  education  and  training aimed at preparing men and  women for the job force is absolutely  vital. The 22d district has the highest  unemployment rate in the State and  my  constituents  depend  upon  the  skills training which the Carl Perkins  program offers. We must be willing to  provide  opportunity  for  students  whose gift is technical in nature just  as we do for those with other kinds of  skills.  I believe that H.R. 7 refines and im proves the Perkins program. It is de signed to get more money directly to  those school districts which need  it  most,  including rural communities. I  have schools with kids who need this  special kind of  assistance, but  the  schools  have  trouble  enough  these  days providing just the basics within  limited budgets. This is the kind of co ordinated  Federal  assistance  that  makes the most sense, because it gives  students a chance to fulfill their po tential and trains them for one of the  most  important  responsibilities  they  will ever have, holding down a  job.  Since the program's matching require ments have been eliminated and the  funds are less restrictive, there should  be more money for schools with fewer  resources.  In addition, the bill strengthens our  commitment to  integrating academic  and technical training. My colleagues,  Congressman  SAWYER,  Congressman  PAYNE, and I, introduced H.R. 1787 to  explicitly link technical and academic  skills. As a  former educator, I know  that  link needs  to be strengthened,  and I believe our bill does just that.  The text of our bill was incorporated  into H.R.  7,  as were  a number of  others.  ",1989
285,167,7,Mr. GOODLING.," Madam Chairman,  I yield 3 minutes  to  the gentleman  from Texas [Mr. BARTLETT].  ",1989
286,167,7,Mr. BARTLETT.," Madam Chairman,  I want to take a minute to clarify a bit  the administration's policy as the bill  is receiving increasing levels of biparti san support, even as we take it to the  floor.  A statement of administration policy  was  issued earlier  this week which  made it crystal clear that the section  on restrictions on the Office of Man agement and Budget would not be ac ceptable in any form to the adminis tration and, indeed, the administration  would  veto  the bill,  the President  would veto the bill, or the Secretary of  Education would recommend a veto of  the bill  if that section on Office of  Management and Budget restrictions  were  included. Indeed the statement  of administration policy states  that  the Secretary would recommend  the  President veto  the bill  if the provi sions discussed in this OMB paragraph  were to remain in H.R. 7.  It  is my  understanding, Madam  Chairman,  that, when we begin  the  amendments, that the gentleman from  Pennsylvania CMr. GOODLING] will be  offering an amendment to strike,  to  strike the entire OMB section, and to  replace it with a study by the General  Accounting Office to determine what,  if any, actions by OMB may need to be  further reviewed.  So, I want to say to Members who  have received the statement of admin istration policy opposing the bill,  if  the Office of Management and Budget  section  is  included,  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania CMr. GOODLING] in tends to offer an amendment which I  have reason to believe will pass, will be  accepted,  that will strike  the OMB  provisions in their entirety.  So, while  the administration does  have some additional concerns about  the  legislation, as do  I and various  Members of the House on both sides  of the aisle,  the additional concerns  would not be caused at least based on  the statement of administration policy  to recommend a veto.  Madam Chairman, the two primary  concerns are, first of all, the section on  negotiated rulemaking, which the gen tleman will  also be offering as an  amendment  that will  substantially  compromise that section in which the  House  is offering  to go more  than  halfway on the negotiated rulemaking  section.  I  still have some hopes  that  the  amendment of  the gentleman  from  Utah  to strike  that section will be  adopted, but, if not, it is my belief that  can be worked out in conference.  The administration also has a legiti mate concern about the authorization  level of this bill, which is $1.4 billion,  and indeed I have to say it is too high  and ought to be lower.  But I want to suggest to those who  are watching this debate that the fact  is  that  this bill  is  so  substantially  streamlined over current law, it so sub stantially decreases the amount of pa perwork, and reporting requirements,  and setasides and other cumbersome  administrative  requirements  that  I  still recommend support for  the bill  even though the authorization levels  are higher than what I would like to  see appropriated.  Madam Chairman,  in my opinion  during the course of the conference  and  the appropriations process  the  actual money spending levels will be  adjusted in a way that will be general ly comfortable for all Members of the  House, and so I do urge support for  the legislation.  ",1989
287,167,7,Mr. HAWKINS.," Madam Chairman, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia CMr. RAHALL].  ",1989
288,167,7,Mr. RAHALL.," Madam Chairman, I  am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 7,  the Applied Technology Education  Act. I will begin by discussing a small,  but  important provision of  the act,  known as negotiated rule making.  In my view, and one that I believe is  shared by my colleagues on the Educa tion and Labor Committee, negotiated  rulemaking is especially vital  to  the  implementation and conduct of voca tional education programs nationwide  because they have been changed con siderably under H.R. 7,  the Applied  Technology Education Act of 1989.  The legislative history of negotiated  rulemaking and its uses with respect  to an effective, bipartisan implementa tion of Federal  law  is brief, but of  proven effectiveness.  Negotiated  rulemaking  was  first  used during  the Reagan administra tion by the Department of Transpor tation. But its most effective use, ac cording to the education community,  was by the Environmental Protection  Agency CEPAl. The EPA implemented  the process in order to receive input  from  all  responsible  parties with  regard to cleaning up toxic wastes, an  expensive and contentious, but crucial  activity required by law of our mili tary-industrial complex nationwide.  When asked why this process was so  desirable, educators responded that it  worked for them, when they were in cluded in EPA's development of rules  and regulations regarding the detec tion and removal or treatment of as bestos in schools. Last, educators re f erred to their more recent experience  with negotiated  rulemaking and  its  success  in  implementing  last year's  changes to chapter 1 programs under  the Hawkins-Stafford School Improve ment Act.  Negotiated  rulemaking,  simply  stated, is a process that helps define  and clarify complex and contentious  issues.  Why is  it gaining such popularity?  Madam Chairman, while I have not  conducted a scientific survey on the  question, the first thing that comes to  mind is the absence of a previous con gressional authority known as a legis lative veto over final regulations pro mulgated by various agencies and de partments of Government that often  did not reflect the original intent of  Congress. Departments and agencies  have been known to legislate through  regulation when certain provisions in  law were not to their liking, and Con gress used the legislative veto author ity for purposes of returning laws to  their original intent.  Madam Chairman, it is my premise  that if State and local education offi cials, parents and teachers are given  the opportunity to participate in the  regulation writing process before pro posed,  then final  regulations  imple menting education laws are published,  which is made possible by the adop tion of H.R. 7 of the negotiated rule making  process,  fewer  incidents  of  misspent funds, or programs otherwise  found out of  compliance with  the  intent of the law, will occur.  Madam Chairman, I was pleased to  introduce  the bill, H.R. 1819, which  was incorporated as part of H.R. 7, re quiring the Secretary of Education to  convene regional meetings in order to  provide comments to him on the con tent of proposed regulations, and to  require that such meetings shall  in clude  representatives  of  Federal,  State, and  local administrators, par ents, teachers, and members of local  boards of education who will be  in volved with  implementation of pro grams under the newly structured Ap plied Technology Education Act.  After the committee had reported its  bill, I was approached by Representa tive BILL GOODLING, our able ranking  minority member, who advised me of  the administration's objections to the  inclusion of negotiated rulemaking in  the bill. While I am firm in my intent  to retain the process as part of H.R. 7,  I was pleased to work with Represent ative GOODLING in producing language  limiting the number of key issues to be  subjected to the negotiated rulemak ing process. As a result of our own ne gotiations, an amendment to the com mittee amendment to the bill now in cludes language stating that ""The Sec retary shall prepare draft regulations  and submit regulations on a  limited  number of issues to a negotiated rule making process."" It is our intent that,  when we  reach conference with  the  Senate on H.R. 7, the key issues will  have been  identified, at which  time  ",1989

I  was anxious that we not be duplicative  or do anything  that might confuse  that, and rather than ask the gentle man to withdraw or to further refine  the amendment at this point, I wanted  to ask if he is aware of my concern,  and I just wondered if we might work  it out before the matter goes to con ference.

291,206,7,Mr. MILLER of California.," Madam  Chairman, if the gentleman will yield,  I was aware of that concern. Unfortu nately, I was made aware of that late,  and it would be my intent that the  gentleman and I will be able to work  this out prior to the appointment of  conferees. If we work it out to the gen tleman's satisfaction, then there will  be no requirement for the Committee  on Agriculture to have conferees on  this bill. If we cannot work it out, it  will  be  dropped  immediately,  and  there would be no reason for the Com mittee on Agriculture to have confer ees on this bill.

297,258,7,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the memory of Ms. Janice Johnson.  Janice was a  teacher  for 11  years at  the  Curtis Park School. a special education pro gram at the Sacramento, CA Children's Home.  Janice  taught  elementary  and  junior  high  school students and during her  tenure she  worked with approximately 600 youngsters.  According  to Janice's colleagues at  the  school:  Janice will be remembered most for her  sincere commitment to her students. She  challenged their academic knowledge and  worked  to  build  their  self-confidence.  Always available to listen to their concerns,  Janice had  the  intuitive gift of knowing  when a student was ready to return to the  mainstream of public school. Her dedication  was endless.  Janice will be deeply missed by her stu dents, her colleagues, and the community of  Sacramento. Those who knew her will keep  endearing memories of her with  the knowl edge that she was an exceptional person.  I applaud Janice's commitment to the edu cation of the youth of Sacramento, and com mend her for making the kids that she taught  and knew a part of her life.  May 9, 1989  A CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE  HON. ALFRED A. (AL)  McCANDLESS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 9, 1989  Mr. McCANDLESS. Mr. Speaker, a great  number of people in my congressional district  in California are up  in arms about the Medi care Catastrophic Coverage Act passed  last  year. On March 28, 1989, I met with a group  of at least 300 seniors who had complaints  about the new law, and who had some hard  questions  to answer.  I gave  them  the  facts  about the catastrophic Medicare law, but they  were definitely not pleased with it, and I was  glad I could say I voted against the bill.  We cannot escape the fact  that the cata strophic law does more harm than good. The  following article by Joan Beck outlines clearly  the many hardships  imposed on seniors by  the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.  It  appeared in the Chicago Tribune on February  16, 1989. I urge my colleagues to read it, and  join me in my efforts to repeal the new Medi care law:  A MEAN MISTAKE THAT Is COLD, COSTLY  COMFORT FOR ELDERLY  <By Joan Beck>  All those new Medicare benefits for which  the middle-income elderly are being forced  to pay the highest income tax rates in the  nation don't add up to much.  Just ask the insurance companies.  Members of Congress who pushed  the  Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act have  been trying to assure the outraged elderly  that their new benefits are well worth the  huge new surtax on their federal income tax  and the extra payment on Part B of Medi care. You won't need ""medigap"" insurance  to cover what Medicare doesn't, the bill's  supporters told the elderly. Or at least it  won't have to cover as many benefits and it  won't cost you so much.  But insurers have  taken a hard-headed  look at the benefits the new law provides  and  instead of cutting  the premiums on  their medigap policies, most of them are  raising  their rates. Middle-income elderly  people must now pay up to $848 extra in  new Medicare charges-and most of them  must still lay out 10 to 75 percent more for  medigap insurance.  About 70 percent of Medicare benefici aries have medigap coverage, according to  financial analysts. Policies cost an average  of about $420 to $600 a year, but can range  from about $190 to about $1,300, depending  on the extent of benefits and such factors as  area. New benefits or not, Medicare recipi ents who want adequate protection against  overwhelming medical bills  still have  to  have medigap coverage,  financial advisers  say.  Even the American Association of Retired  Persons, many of whose members are bitter  about AARP's support of the hated new leg islation, has raised premiums on the medi gap policies it sells with the Prudential In surance Co. by an average of 40 percent.  The AARP is making what has become a  standard defense of the cruelly misnamed  bill: Without the new law, the jump in medi gap rates would have been even bigger.  That's probably so. But it's estimated that  the new law is holding down  increases in  ",1989
298,271,7,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  bring  to  the attention of my colleagues  two  very special people. Louis and Dorothy Fox  have dedicated  themselves  to  the State of  Israel and the Jewish community.  Louis Fox has been a first  in many posi tions. He was  the  first  Israel bond chairman  for communal resources, the first chairman of  the Baltimore Committee for Soviet Jewry, first  president of  the Jewish Community Center,  and  founder of the Jewish Historical Society  of Maryland.  Dorothy Fox has supported Lou  in all of  these and many other activities  in  the Balti more Jewish community. Dorothy, a member  of ORT, has given generously of her  time,  money and energy.  Louis and Dorothy Fox will be honored on  Wednesday, May 9. That night  they will be  presented with the Shield of Israel Leadership  Award by the State of Israel Bonds. I join with  many  in  the Baltimore Jewish community  in  offering my congratulations  to Dorothy and  Louis Fox, and offer my thanks and apprecia tion for all that they have done.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ALTERNATIVE FUELS USE AN  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVE  HON. MICHAEL A. ANDREWS  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 9, 1989  ",1989
299,271,7,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, when we think  of issues of importance to us  today several  areas come  to mind:  the budget deficit,  the  trade deficit, the savings and  loans situation.  There  is one  issue,  though,  that eclipses all  others in its long-term significance to all of us.  It is the concern about our environment. The  air we breath  is becoming  increasingly con taminated,  the greenhouse effect endangers  our global climate, and the acid rain problem  is not being adequately addressed. We are lit erally destroying the planet on which we  live  for our children and our grandchildren. It is im perative that we do a better job of addressing  our environmental problems.  To  this end  today  I am  introducing along  with Congressman DOWNEY  the Alternative  Fuels  Incentive Act of 1989. We are glad to  be joined by many of our colleagues among  whom are members of both parties from many  different regions of the country.  The Alternative Fuels Incentive Act of 1989  will provide  for  tax  incentives  to encourage  the use of clean burning alternative fuels  in  vehicles. The switch to such fuels is absolute ly essential.  A look at the urban smog problem provides  a graphic example. Ozone is the main ingredi ent in  the haze  that settles on most of our  cities. The Clean Air Act provides for ozone  attainment standards, and almost without ex ception, our major urban areas do not meet  these standards.  The list of these nonattainment areas brings  the problem home: New York, Chicago, Los  Angeles, Houston, Boston, Washington, DC,  Denver, Miami, Dallas, San Francisco, Cleve land, and on and on.  Nearly half of the ozone pollution problem  in many areas can be attributed  to vehicle  emissions from the transportation sector. Re active  hydrocarbons  and  nitrogen  oxides  [NOJ are the two primary ingredients leading  to  ozone pollution,  and  the  transportation  sector accounts for about 40 percent of reac tive hydrocarbons and 48 percent of NOx  in  urban areas.  In  this way  reducing  vehicle  emissions can be a giant step in addressing  the urban smog problem.  One very effective way to accomplish  this  goal is to move toward greater use of vehicle  fuels which burn cleaner than traditional diesel  and gasoline. This is the aim of the Alternative  Fuels Incentive Act of 1989. This bill was in troduced last in draft form and we have since  had a chance  to work with environmental,  transportation, and energy groups and State  and local officials to effect improvements.  The bill provides the needed push to start a  large  scale  clean-burning  alternative  fuels  movement in this country; ""clean burning"" is  defined as natural gas, liquified petroleum gas,  or a fuel which is at least 85 percent metha nol, ethanol, other alcohol, or ether.  Specifically it would provide:  8735  for equipment  to  it may  run on a  A 20-percent  tax credit  convert a vehicle so  that  clean-burning fuel;  A 20-percent credit  for  refueling  station  equipment  directly  related  to  delivering  a  clean-burning fuel into the fuel tank of a vehi cle-including tanks for liquid fuels and com pressor stations for natural gas;  A 20-percent credit for the fuel system of a  new vehicle produced to run only on a clean burning fuel; and  Credit equivalent payments  to State and  local agencies so that they may take advan tage of the credit.  The initial effect of this legislation will be to  encourage private and public fleet owners to  convert their vehicles to run on an alternative  fuel, and it would also encourage the develop ment of a badly needed alternative fuels infra structure in this country.  The benefits of using alternative  fuels  to  combat ozone pollution are clear. Running a  vehicle  on  natural  gas,  for  example,  can  reduce reactive hydrocarbon emissions by up  to 85 percent and NOx emissions by 65 per cent. Similarly, methanol  powered  vehicles  have  shown  significantly  reduced  emission  levels of these compounds.  Alternative  fuels have other environmental  benefits as well. They can be an effective tool  against acid rain. Many of the above agents  which cause ozone pollution and which are re duced by clean-burning  fuels also contribute  to the acid rain problem.  In addition, alternative fuels can help in ad dressing  the  global warming  problem.  In creased levels of carbon dioxide [C02] are a  primary cause of the greenhouse effect and  vehicles which  run on cleaner burning  fuels  emit significantly less C02.  We have the technology to make alternative  fuels a reality  today. Only  the  initial cost of  converting to a system of alternative fuels and  natural inertia are holding us back.  For example, the cost of converting a vehi cle to run on natural gas can be over $1,000.  The cost of installing a compressor station for  the refueling of natural gas vehicles can run  into  the hundreds of  thousands of dollars.  These costs are enormous hurdles to the de velopment of an alternative fuels system.  It is time the Federal Government acknowl edges the value of alternative fuels and en courages their use. They are an effective tool  in  fighting urban smog, acid rain, and global  warming-some of the most serious environ mental problems we  face. The Alternative  Fuels  Incentive Act of 1989 will provide  the  initial support needed to start a large scale al ternative vehicle fuels movement in the United  States.

301,284,7,Ms. SCHNEIDER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  being joined by several of my colleagues in in troducing a joint resolution on ""Human Needs  and Mobility,"" which addressed a subject vir tually ignored by decisionmakers both in de velopment agencies and  lending  institutions:  the transportation needs of those who com prise a majority of  the Earth's people,  the  Third World poor.  Lack of transport is one of the gravest prob lems facing  the world's underdeveloped and  debt-ridden countries. The virtual absence of  this  fundamental need adversely affects  the  health, well-being, and economic productivity  of  hundreds  of millions  of  impoverished  human beings.  For millions of families  the daily reality re quires hours of hand carrying heavy loads of  water and  firewood  located miles  from  their  dwellings. The respected  international assist ance organization, Save the Children, finds a  lack of transport to critically undermine essen tial health services. For example, the absence  of vehicles  leave health posts without medi cines, mobile vaccination campaigns are not  carried out,  the sick are not  transferred  to  medical attention, and much disease preven tion and health promotion goes untapped be cause people cannot visit health centers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Although development agencies and lending  institutions have engaged in expanding motor ized  transport services  in developing coun tries, in practice this is an unrealistic possibili ty. Even bus fare, let alone simple motorbikes  or cars, are beyond the reach of hundreds of  millions of families. Lack of money for the pur chase of motorized  transport, plus problems  with maintenance,  repair and supply of fuel,  lubricants and spare parts, makes it unlikely  that in the short-and medium-term these will  be a real answer to the transport problems of  families, or workers  in  the health, welfare,  education, and assistance community.  Save  the  Children,  the  Peace  Corps,  UNICEF and other private and public develop ment agencies working at  the village  level  have found a variety of nonmotorized vehicles  to be quite  in  line with needs of cash-poor  families and local agencies. Bicycles and tricy cles, for example, are relatively cheap to buy,  easy to assemble and maintain, require little in  the way of lubrication and nothing in the way  of fuel. Millions of families currently use them,  often in conjunction with carts, to transport up  to 400 pounds of cargo over even  the most  difficult  terrain. There  is a  long  tradition of  using such human-powered vehicles to trans port  agriculture  products,  fuelwood, water,  manufactured goods, clothes, drugs, and med ical materials, and even for use as an ambu lance in emergencies.  Unfortunately,  development  programs  funded  in part by the United States currently  promote  policies  favoring  capital-intensive  highways and motorized vehicles,  to the ex clusion of nonmotorized options. All  too  fre quently,  the  low-cost,  nonpolluting, more  broadly affordable, human-powered vehicles  are marginalized or destroyed. A few stark ex amples make the point.  Jakarta, Indonesia has thrown 75,000 tricy cles,  the basis of a  thriving system of miMay 9, 1989  croenterprises,  into  the  sea,  ostensibly  to  reduce traffic congestion. El Salvador spends  over one-half of its export earnings on petrole um, yet only a tiny minority can afford cars.  One-quarter of the World Bank's portfolio is  invested in transportation-related projects, yet  almost nothing goes for vehicles people can  afford or to encourage nonmotorized, low-cost  forms of  transportation. Similarily,  the U.S.  Agency  for  International Development  [AID]  has no projects related to reducing transport related energy use or promoting sustainable  substitutes. Humanitarian relief distribution  in  Mozambique and Ethiopia relegate women to  pack animal status to head carry 100-pound  sacks of grain from distribution centers to vil lages.  Sustainable and  affordable  transportation  strategies are desperately needed to address  the mobility needs of all without destroying the  environmental  resources  that underpin sus tainable economic development. The ""Human  Needs and Mobility""  resolution builds upon  language  inserted  in  the  fiscal  year 1989  House  foreign operations' appropriations bill.  It recognizes the problems of too little trans port for so many people, and emphasizes ac tions to be taken by AID and U.S. representa tives to multilateral funding institutions to pro vide real and sustainable solutions for the mo bility needs of the poor in developing coun tries.  If we are to encourage flourishing microen terprises as a means of helping people help  themselves  to overcome  their  impoverished  conditions, and  transform aid-dependent na tions  into  thriving  trade partners,  then we  need to assist in  the development of sturdy,  low-cost, sustainable transport options appro priate to local conditions.

302,310,7,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, let us be  honest. There is not one of these coun tries certified by the President and ac companied by a statement of explana tion that is ""fully cooperating"" under  the common usage of the term ""fully.""  There is without question corruption  in the Bahamas. But there is also solid  evidence that the Bahamas are giving  us good cooperation  in  the war on  drugs.  The Bahamas is the only country in  the world to allow United States law  enforcement units  to enter its  terri tory in hot pursuit of drug targets.  These  cooperative  efforts  netted  over 10 metric tons of cocaine, more  than 13 metric tons of marijuana, 20  aircraft, and 9 vessels in 1988.  Despite the Senate delay in ratifica tion of  a Mutual Legal Assistance  Treaty with the Bahamas, the Baha mian Government turned over to us  temporarily two persons serving time  in a Bahamian prison so  they could  testify in an important Federal narcot ics prosecution. This was one of the  Department of Justice's first uses of  the Attorney General's authority  to  request  prison  transfers under  the  1988 Omnibus Anti-Drug Act.  Negotiations are progressing well for  a new extradition treaty; we believe  they will be concluded  in  the next  round. Meanwhile, the Government of  the Bahamas has  just extradited to  the United States a Bahamian nation al on marijuana smuggling charges.  Although we have not yet achieved  success, our request for Nigel Bowe's  extradition remains active and is now  pending before the Privy Council in  London.  ",1989

314,323,7,Mr.  FORD.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing, by request, legislation  to authorize appropriations to the De partment of Energy for civilian energy  programs for fiscal year 1990 and 1991.  This bill was transmitted to Congress  by the Department of Energy on April  17, 1989.  The cover letter accompanying the  bill indicates that certain provisions of  the bill may need to be revised to re flect the results of negotiations with  Congress on the budget. Certainly pro visions need revision. I do not support  the bill as  introduced. For example,  the proposed spending on fossil energy  research and development is too small  by half. Proposed spending on the su perconducting  super  collider  is  too  high. I could cite a number of other  disagreements with the bill.  However, the Secretary of Energy's  bill deserves  to be introduced so his  proposals are on the table and subject  to debate. I want to work with Secre tary Watkins on the problems I have  with this bill. I think I will be able to  work with Secretary Watkins.  This bill contains provisions author izing research, development, and dem onstration CRD&Dl programs of the  Department of Energy as well as other  programs, such as those of the Energy  Information Administration,  that do  not involve RD&D. I  intend to hold  hearings on the RD&D proposals of  the Department in my Subcommittee  on Research and Development of the  Committee on Energy and Natural Re sources. I urge my fellow subcommit tee chairmen on  the Committee  to  hold hearings on the portions of this  bill that fall within their subcommit tee jurisdictions. We may find this bill  a useful vehicle to express our energy  policy concerns to the administration.

315,336,7,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  today,  I am saddened to  inform my  colleagues  that New York City and  New York State citizens have lost a  valuable  leader. Chancellor  for  the  Public Schools  of New York City,  Richard R. Green died this morning.  Chancellor Green was inauguarated in  January 1988 and came to New York  from the city of Minneapolis, where  he  served  as  superintendent  of  schools. His  arrival was  rightfully  greeted with enthusiasm and hope.  Chancellor Green emerged as a child  of Minneapolis' Sumer-Field housing  project to become his hometown's first  black high school athletic team coach,  first black principal, and first black su perintendent. He had attended local  Augsberg College  on  a  basketball  scholarship and in 1973 earned a doc torate at Harvard, his education par tially  funded  by  local  foundations.  Chancellor Green had convinced these  benefactors that it would be a good in vestment. He was correct.  His responsibilities in New York City  would have been daunting to many.  He had the assignment of caring for  nearly 1 million children, responsible  for their educational lives. Not a small  task.  Mr. President, Chancellor Green ac cepted this challenge with innovation  and concern. His first and foremost  priority, he reiterated, was children.  He consistently questioned how pro grams would affect children directly in  the classroom. He viewed education as  a year-round process and sought a con nection between children and schools  as early in life as possible. Next, he un derstood the importance of teachers.  He worked  to  involve  teachers  in  policy decisions and sought to instill a  new  respect  for  teachers.  Finally,  Chancellor Green knew that parents  had to be involved in the education of  their children.  With a  realistic yet visionary eye,  Chancellor Green saw the school as an  integral, vital part of a modern, trou bled community.  In  the New York  Times, he stated: ""I see schools as  places  that  feed  children,  educate  their parents, and provide early child hood education. Schools are the place  where  antidrug programs will  take  place and where AIDS will be debated  and understood more clearly. They  must become the most important fact  of  the urban  community.""  I  fully  agree.  These were  his  goals,  amidst  a  sprawling, difficult system. Chancellor  Green did not balk before this system.  He  realistically  recognized  that  schools had to be safe to be effective.  He put the creation of new schools  and the improvement of the physical  plant as a high priority. He outlawed  beepers-used  by  drug  dealers-in  schools  and  insisted  that  students  attend  school  or  face  the  conse quences. It seemed to work.  Of course, as befits an able man as signed to a formidable task, expecta tions were  great. But, Chancellor  Green's priorities were not  to meet  every expectation placed upon him.  His priority was children. As Chancel lor Green stated at a meeting in As toria, Queens,  children  that  bring me to this city."" The city and  the city's children shall not forget him  or his work to improve the education  and very lives of the children of New  York City.e  ""It is  NATIONAL BICENTENNIAL COM PETITION ON THE CONSTITU TION AND BILL OF RIGHTS  e ",1989

The key question that the support ers of the FSX proposal have indicat ed that they will review is whether the  FSX proposal will or will not signifi cantly  increase and enhance Japan's  ability  to compete with our civilian  aerospace industry. The supporters of  the FSX proposal, Madam Speaker,  doubt  that  the FSX will  enhance  Japan's competitive ability.  I  ask  these  supporters, Madam  Speaker, to listen to the words of the  president of Mitsubishi Heavy Indus tries as  translated  from  the Japan  Economic Journal on January 21 of  1989, where the then president of Mit subishi Heavy Industries said that the  FSX project will ""be a great boon to  us. The  technology we will develop  and accumulate during the project will  be  instrumental  in developing next generation planes such as hypersonic  and supersonic transports.''  We should take the Japanese leader ship at their word. They are much  more candid about  their goals  than  the administration  is willing  to be  about what their goals are. I urge us  to  review  carefully  the  statements  coming from  responsible and candid  leaders in Japan and to reject the FSX  proposal.

It would inflame Panamani an passions and would decrease our  credibility in Latin America and give  Noriega the card he desperately needs  to show that we are beating him up.  But we need to be measured in our  response, but in the same vein consist ent. First, our entire bureaucracy and  Congress should work together.  Second, we should consider economic  sanctions applied in a more coherent  and consistent way.  Third, we should get  international  pressure, but effective  international  pressure from Latin American coun tries, Alfonsin of Argentina, Carlos  Andres Perez of Venezuela. We should  not  lead  internationally ourselves.  I  think everybody knows this has been a  fraudulent election.  We should also encourage Panama nian opposition, their continued pro testing, to get out there and talk about  this election. They should not expect  the United States should do it all.

319,349,7,Mr. WISE.," Madam Speaker, the fail ure  of  the President  to have  the  United States support an international  conference on global warming  is  in credibly disappointing. It also shows a  total unwillingness to exert leadership,  particularly since our own Department  of State and Environmental Protec tion Agency recommend participating.  I am from a  fossil  fuel producing  State. Hasty action in this area can  jeopardize  jobs. Yet failure  to be at  the international table seeking realis tic solutions can also be harmful.  I  believe  there  are  responses  to  global warming that permit continued  fossil fuel use, alternative fuels, for in stance, made from coal, natural gas,  and so on. But the United States must  be there putting them on the table.  There  is  another  reason. Many  Third World nations today are resist ing  basic  environmental  changes,  charging  that  their  development  should  not  be  restricted,  cynically  charging that the United States has  already achieved a high standard of  living and now wants to deny the same  level to others.  The  global  warming  challenge  cannot be met by one nation alone,  but yet it cannot be met by the ab sence of a great nation like the United  States.  Please, Mr. President, show environ mental and economic leadership by re considering  and having  the United  States participate in an international  conference on global warming.  OPPOSE THE FSX DEAL  (Mr. MINETA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1989
320,349,7,Mr. MINET A.,"  Madam  Speaker,  when we  signed an agreement with  Japan several years ago to end that  nation's unfair semiconductor industry  trade practices,  Japan  said  that  it  would open up its domestic market to  U.S.  semiconductor  manufacturers.  But in what has become a classic nego tiating tactic, Japan shunted this criti cal facet of the agreement into a so called side letter and now refuses to  live up to that part of the semiconduc tor industry agreement.  Incredibly, we are being asked again  to fall for the same old smoke and mir rors when it comes to the FSX tech nology transfer deal. We are being told  that Japan has made important tech nological and production concessions  as part of the deal. But do we  find  these consessions in the formal FSX  agreement? No. Where we find them is  in-you guessed it-an exchange of let ters.  Madam Speaker,  the  real  agree ments on these concessions will only  be negotiated after we have finished  transferring our key  technologies  to  Japan. As far as I am concerned, this  is an open invitation for the United  States to get burned twice with the  same  trick,  and  so  I  urge my col leagues to oppose the FSX deal.

321,349,7,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Madam Speaker,  because  of  a  trade  dispute,  India  closed the border with Nepal, a  tiny  landlocked country in the heart of the  Himalaya.

322,362,7,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, I  am  today  introducing  legislation  which addresses a serious inequity in  the system of Medicare physician re imbursement. Under the present for mula, Medicare reimburses physicians  a  different  amount,  depending  on  their geographic location around the  country.  Studies  have  shown  that  Medicare makes  substantial  differ ences of payments for the same sur gery and care, depending on where the  physician  lives,  disparities  which  cannot be  justified by differences in  the cost of providing care. Our current  system  is completely out of whack,  and doctors and their elderly patients  in Utah in various regions around the  country,  are  being  discriminated  against. As a  result, quality care for  senior citizens in Utah and in many  other States is being jeopardized. We  must do something, about that gross  unfairness, and that something is, to  pass my bill.  The 1988 Physician Payment Review  Commission  CPPRCJ  study  showed  that all of the prevailing charges in  Utah are below  the national mean.  The data demonstrates that Medicare  prevailing fees in Utah are substantial ly  lower  than in most areas of  the  country.  In  fact,  for  some  services,  Utah is dead last. Utah's Medicare al lowable  fees are extremely  low  for  both  surgical procedures and office  visits. For example, the Utah payment  for a pacemaker insertion is $680 while  the national average is $1,228-almost  double. Utah  ranks 12th  from  the  bottom out of 117 Medicare geograph ic localities that were surveyed. There  is no rational explanation for  these  differences  in  reimbursement  from  State to State.  The PPRC has stated that approved  charges vary extensively from one lo cality to another. Three-and four-fold  differences  in charges for particular  procedures are common. It is difficult  to believe  that physicians  in other  parts of  the country  receive up  to  three  times  the Medicare  reimburs ment of Utah physicians for identical  Medicare  procedures. These  differ ences extend  far beyond  justifiable  differences in the cost of practice. The  Utah Medical Association's data indi cates that the actual costs of practice,  including malpractices insurance, em ployee expenses, office rent, and sup plies are not substantially  lower  in  Utah. In some cases, Utah's costs are  higher.  The greatest impact of these unreal istic Medicare payments is felt by our  elderly  and  disabled  citizens.  The  PPRC also concluded that Geographic  variations  in prevailing charges are  substantial, and stated that wide varia tion in charges unrelated to difference  in cost of practice could mean access  ",1989
323,388,7,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  together with six of my colleagues  from  in volved Southwestern States, I am introducing  the  radiation victim compensation bill. This  legislation would  redress an outstanding na tional obligation to citizens in our region, who  were unjustifiably and  involuntarily sacrificed  to advance our Nation's position during  the  cold war.  They are either the heirs of Colorado Pla teau uranium miners who were unwittingly ex posed  to extraordinary  levels of radiation  in  underground uranium mines, where ore for the  Government's  nuclear  developments  was  mined during the 1950's, or they are the heirs  and family members of fallout victims from the  Government's  nuclear  testing  in  Nevada  during this same era.  Both classes of victims have presented their  cases to the judiciary system.  In both cases  court opinions were  issued  that  the deaths  and injuries were caused by the radiation ex posures, and that Government officials knew  of the risks and  failed  to act. However, be cause the courts also found that the Federal  decisions  to disregard  these people's  lives  and safety were premeditated, Federal sover eign  immunity laws were applied to bar their  claims.  Indeed it is because their deaths and  injuries were deemed  intended, or,  in other  words, a policy decision of the United States,  that they have gone uncompensated.  They are the victims of the cold war who,  unlike other war victims, could have chosen to  live or work elsewhere had  they been  in formed.  Both the Ninth and Tenth Circuit Courts of  Appeals struggled  in  these cases with  the  unjust  result  imposed by applicable Federal  sovereign  immunity  laws. The  ninth  circuit  stated:  We agree with the district court that this  is the type of case that cries out for redress,  but the courts are not able to give it; Con gress  is the appropriate source in this in stance.  This legislation would respond to these judi cial recommendations with a national apology  and modest, but long overdue compassionate  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  payments, similar to those provided for victims  of  the Texas City disaster and  Japanese Americans who were unjustly interned during  World War  II.  I invite you, Mr. Speaker, and  my colleagues  in  the House of Representa tives to join in resolving  this outstanding na tional obligation.

FINDINGS  SEC. 2. As a result of testimony received  before various committees of  the Senate  and the House of Representatives, the Con gress finds that< 1 > fallout emitted during  the Govern ment's  above-ground  nuclear  tests  in  Nevada exposed civilians who lived in the  downwind affected area  in Nevada, Utah,  and Arizona to radiation that generated an  excess of cancers among these civilians;  (2) the health of the civilians who were  unwitting participants in these tests was put  at risk to serve national security interests of  the United States;  (3) radiation released in underground ura nium mines  that were providing uranium  for the sole use and benefit of the nuclear  weapons program of the United States Gov ernment exposed miners to massive doses of  radiation that produced an epidemic of lung  cancer and respiratory diseases among these  miners;  <4> the United States should recognize and  assume equitable and compassionate respon sibility for the damages sustained by these  civilians and provides herewith a procedure  to make partial restitution to these individ uals for the burdens they have borne for  the nation as a whole; and  <5> Congress recognizes that the lives and  health of uranium miners and of innocent  citizens who  lived  downwind  from  the  Nevada tests were sacrificed to serve the na tional  security  interests  of  the United  States, and Congress apologizes  to  these  citizens and their families on behalf of the  Nation.

324,401,7,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing  legislation  that will  assist disabled  Americans in obtaining health insurance cov erage at group rates.  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Recon ciliation Act  [COBRA] of 1985 required  that  continuation of certain health insurance cover age be offered to employees who would oth erwise lose coverage in an employer's group  health plan due to termination of employment  or other qualifying events. For most eligible  beneficiaries the minimum continuation period  is 18 months; for certain other situations, the  minimum period is 36 months.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  When a worker becomes disabled under  provisions of title II of the Social Security Act,  he or she  is eligible  for  financial support 5  months after  the onset of disability. Health  coverage under Medicare is available after an other 24 month waiting period. Thus, an indi vidual who  is disabled by a severe medical  condition  faces a 29-month waiting period  from the date of onset of disability to the date  of becoming eligible for coverage under Medi care.  This  legislation would extend the minimum  continuation period from 18 to 29 months for  individuals who are disabled under title  II of  the Social Security Act.  This legislation will help improve access to  health services and also help protect family fi nancial  resources.  I urge my colleagues  to  support this proposal.

One of  the  four scientists sharing  the  top  award as Inventor of the Year is a University  of Colorado graduate, and  two medical doc tors honored as distinguished  inventors of  1989 collaborated while on the faculty of the  University of Colorado Medical Center.  David Goedde!, a 1977 Ph.D. in biochemis try graduate of the University of Colorado, was  one of four scientists at Genentech, Inc., who  shared  the $4,000 prize as  Inventor of  the  Year for their creation of t-PA, tissue plasmin ogen activator, which dissolves blood clots in  arteries, a major cause of heart attacks. The  invention of t-PA  is a good example of how  biotechnology can  be applied  to everyday  health care.  The University of Colorado should also be  proud of the accomplishments of Ors. Charles  A. Chidsey  Ill and Guinter Kahn, who were  honored as distinguished inventors of 1989 for  their work in developing rogaine topical solu tion, a baldness treatment that was approved  for sale last year by the Food and Drug Ad ministration. Rogaine,  like so many discover ies, was the spinoff of an unrelated study into  hypertension drugs.  I salute Ors. Chidsey, Kahn, and Goeddel  and  I salute the  Intellectual Property Owners  Foundation for honoring their work.  PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER  HON. WILLIAM 0. LIPINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 10, 1989  ",1989
326,401,7,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute the fine work of President Jimmy  8865  Carter. He has become a one-man  traveling  White House years after his departure  from  office. His  familiarity with  the  situation  in  Panama, his willingness to travel to that coun try, observe  the elections, and  to  return  to  brief this indecisive administration is a testa ment to President Carter's abilities and dedi cation.  The Republicans have been running against  Jimmy Carter for 9 years. Now,  in a time of  crisis, they run to him. It is to his credit that he  has responded to the calls of a candidate who  vilified him and who continues to blame him  for every problem for which the administration  does not have an answer.  Jimmy Carter  implemented vital and  long lasting foreign and domestic policies and ham mered out historic agreements. The Camp  David accords continue to be a model for set tlement in the Middle East. The SALT II Treaty  has served as a vital check on the arms race  and helped  lead  the way to the historic INF  Treaty. The Panama Canal Treaty will help  protect the canal  from  the  likes of Noreiga.  Jimmy Carter was far-sighted on the issue of  energy. In the aftermath of the Exxon oil spill  and  the rising dependence of our Nation on  imported  fossil  fuels  it  is clear we need his  leadership on energy conservation and renew able energy.  Jimmy Carter understood  that  the United  States must lead  the world on human rights  and support for democracy. Leadership does  not mean policy review and indecision. It is a  relief and  it  is an honor  to have President  Carter on the job for the White House and the  United States of America.  THE PHILADELPHIA MOUNTED  PATROL: 100 YEARS OF SERVICE  HON. THOMAS M. FOGLIETI A  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 10, 1989  ",1989
327,401,7,Mr. FOGLIETTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay  tribute  to  the mounted police patrol,  who, this year, celebrate 100 years of service  to the people of Philadelphia.  In 1858 Mayor Richard Vaux  first experi mented with the use of mounted officers in an  attempt  to  combat  civil  disturbances  and  pursue criminals on horseback. His attempt  failed, but just 31 years later it became appar ent, again,  that a mounted police patrol was  needed. The mounted police patrol was origi nally made up of 98 officers, all formerly cav alrymen. For 60 years,  they were a major  force; effectively patrolling downtown Philadel phia, its parks and residential districts.  By  the mid-1950's, however, many people  began to question their effectiveness. One of  their bleakest hours may have come in 1952,  when the Philadelphia Police Department ter minated  the mounted patrols on  the recom mendation of the city government.  But the era of horse patrol did not end here.  The Fairmont Park Guard, a division created  in 1967, continued  to patrol city parks on  horseback. Eventually,  the police department  realized they had made a mistake and rees tablished the mounted patrol in 1972.  ",1989

We all pause to welcome them.  The Chair, at this time, recognizes  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Maryland [Mr. HOYER].  ",1989
332,414,7,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, unfortu nately the Speaker and the majority  leader and majority whip are current ly at the White House. Save for that  single event they would be here. They  would be here to welcome and recog nize many who have been mentors of  those present Members of Congress,  many who have made historical contri butions to the welfare of this democra cy, many who have enhanced both  this  institution and our democracy.  The Speaker would want me to say a  special personal thanks for this day to  the many Members with whom he  served, with whom he labored to uplift  the quality of life in this country.  Those Members who currently serve  know that we do so as legatees of your  prior service as legatees of the com mitment and  talent and knowledge  that Members brought to the ever-ex panding experiment  in  free govern ment, in the creation of a just though  yet imperfect society, but one that we  believe is more perfect than any other  yet tried by man, and one which these  former Members, Mr. Speaker, individ ually and collectively, have enhanced.  Indeed, we are pleased to again greet  these Members.  There have only been, I  think, ap proximately 11,000 persons who have  been granted  the privilege by  their  fellow citizens of serving in this body.  As we are so proud to point out, there  is only one way to get to the House of  Representatives,  unlike  the  U.S.  Senate,  unlike  the Maryland State  Senate which I serve and the House of  Delegates in Maryland, most probably   of the State legislators, only one way,  and that is to be given the very high  honor of having the faith and trust of  our neighbors placed in Members, to  speak for them and to serve them in  this great democracy.  So  to each and every one of  the  former Members, for those who now  serve, we thank everyone.  I see my friend John Rousselot up  here. I remember when I came to the  Congress as perhaps some other Mem bers did with an image of a Member  because of his or her reputation.  I  came to the Congress, and I have told  this to John not believing that John  perhaps was the best guy that I was  going to be a friend with in the Con gress. He and I did not agree on all the  issues, but in a very short period of  time we became friends and I came to  respect his commitment  to his con stituency and to his country. I think  that is what happens with most Mem bers. We differ on the issues. We have  a different perspective, we  represent  different constituencies, but the over whelming majority of Members with  whom we have served, present and  past, are Members who have a deep  and abiding commitment  to serving  their constituency honestly and eff ec tively. We ought to take pride in that.  The  former Members,  I  think,  are  probably  concerned,  as  am  I, Mr.  Speaker, and as many Members of this  body  are now  concerned, with  the  House of Representatives.

333,427,7,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  distinguished chairman of  the Sub committee on Labor Standards of the  Committee on Education and Labor,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. MURPHY].  ",1989
334,427,7,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in support of  the conference  report on H.R. 2. This report repre sents an honest effort  to help our  lowest paid wage earners as well as to  accommodate the concerns of many of  the critics of the minimum wage, first  among them President Bush.  As a longtime supporter of a raise in  the minimum wage I welcome the new  President's willingness to support an  increase. After 8 years of silence and  stonewalling from the White House I  had hoped that with a new administra tion this important issue would finally  be resolved. I believe many of my col leagues were also encouraged by the  promise of cooperation. Unfortunate ly, although our committee and the  majority  in  both  the House  and  Senate have compromised, we are dis appointed that since that action we  have not heard from the President nor  has he  offered  leadership  on  this  issue.  Yes, Mr. Bush has proposed a mini mum wage increase, and, yes, that is  certainly a step in the right direction.  But there is one thing on which we  can all agree, no legislative proposal is  perfect from the outset, including the  President's. The legislative process is  one that requires give and take. De mocracy survives because we work out  our differences  instead  of  fighting  over  them. The President, however,  adamantly refused to talk of compro mise, he has said ""take it or leave it""  to the Congress and then turned his  back on the process and our compro mise.  This  legislation which  passed  by  both Houses of Congress by a biparti san majority takes into consideration  the concerns of many different Mem bers. In our bill we have included a  training wage, an issue that still trou bles many of the Members from this  side of the aisle. We have increased  the tip credit, the small business ex emption, and we have lowered the rate  of increase from our committee bill.  Democrats  and  Republicans  have  worked together to write this legisla tion in the hopes of accommodating  many different points of view. Yet  even with all this work, the President  has not responded to our efforts.  On TV and in the newspapers we see  this conflict presented as a major test  of political will. The commentators  often ask who will win  in  the end.  What so many people do not under stand is that there will be few winners  in this battle. The political benefits of  this fight will be  fleeting. Unfortu nately,  the most  lasting effect  that  this battle will have will be upon the  millions of people who make up Amer ica's working poor.  It will be these people who will be  asked to go on working and sacrificing  every day. For the ninth year in a row  the message to them is, ""Don't expect  to  see  any more  relief or greater  reward for your efforts."" Once again  these people will have been victims of  partisan posturing. There may be no  relief this year because Washington is  too occupied with business as usual.  ",1989

SOLOMON  URGES  PRESIDENT  BUSH TO ABROGATE PANAMA  CANAL TREATY  <Mr.  SOLOMON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  include extraneous  his  remarks and  matter.)  ,1989
341,440,7,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday I took the floor of the House to  let you, the Congress, and the Ameri can people know of a resolution I in troduced urging President Bush to ab rogate the Panama Canal Treaty.  The  recent events connected with  General Noriega's attempts  to steal  the election just held in Panama un derline  the urgency of  this matter.  Until such time as a properly elected,  democratic government assumes legal  control of the nation of Panama, the  strategically located canal cannot be  allowed to be threatened by the likes  of General Noriega. Nor can we stand  by and let  this killer endanger  the  lives of American men and women sta tioned in the Panama Canal Zone.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the  attention of my colleagues to an edito rial I wrote over a year ago concerning  this whole issue. In writing this edito rial, I wanted not just to point out the  dangers posed by General Noriega's  presence in Panama, but to the fact  that  international  law provides  the  basis for abrogation of treaties-such  as the one now governing the canal,  when certain unexpressed understand ings connected with their negotiation  prove to be false, and I am submitting  the article for today's RECORD.  Mr. Speaker, now  is  the  time  for  forceful action by our Government,  backed by the unanimous consent of  the Congress. It is not a time for back peddling and hesitation. The world is  watching and so is this killer, Noriega.  [From the Albany <NY> Times Mirror]  BUSH SHOULD LIMIT CANAL PACT  <By Gerald B. Solomon and Bruce Fein>  Shortly before he  left office, President  Reagan urged  the reconsideration of  the  1977 Panama Canal treaty because of the  unreliability of Panamanian leader Manuel  A. Noriega.  During his confirmation hearings before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  Secretary of State James A. Baker III also  expressed misgivings about the treaty.  One of  the President Bush's first acts  should be  to declare  the portion of  the  treaty transferring sovereignty to Panama  to be provisionally  inoperative. Congress  should also play a constructive role in acting  on these concerns.  Noriega mocks the transfer's presumption  of continuing Panamanian good faith and  ability to prevent sabotage of the canal, and  to  safeguard  its  openness  and  security.  International law would thus justify Bush's  suspension declaration.  In 1903  the Hay-Bunau-Varilla  treated  granted the United States perpetual use of  and sovereignty over a 10-mile-wide, 50-mile long Panama Canal Zone. Under U.S. sover eignty, the canal has operated reliably, and  without sabotage or interruption. It has sig nificantly boosted  the commerce and na tional security of the United States.  During the Cuban missile crisis, 18 Ameri can warships transited the canal overnight,  jumping ahead of commercial shipping to  fortify a naval quarantine of Cuba. The U.S.  warships would otherwise have consumed 13  days to navigate around Cape Hom.  Considering Panama's history of violence,  chronic  political  turbulence  and  anti Yankee sentiments, it is little wonder that  the 1977  treaty considers good will and  friendly relations as being indispensable to  carrying out the treaty's terms. Since  its  birth, Panama has had four constitutions.  During World War II, profascist President  Arnulfo Arias denied the United States de fensive rights outside  the Canal Zone. In  1964 Panamanian students  rioted  in  the  Canal Zone, leaving four American soldiers  dead and dozens wounded while the Pana manian police  and national guard  stood  aloof.  During the 1977 treaty negotiations, par ticipants from both Panama and the United  States openly acknowledged a  basic pre sumption of good  faith and political will  behind the treaty terms. For instance, Pana manian negotiator Carlos Lopez Guevaro  trumpeted: ""The canal has no defense with out  the  friendship  of  the Panamanian  people"" -a view echoed by  the Pentagon  and President Carter. Similarly, Panama's  chief treaty adviser, Romulo Escobar, insist ed: ""I think we must begin from one major  premise:  That  the United  States  and  Panama are not enemies."" American Ambas sador William J. Jorden  recognized  that  ""(a)gainst a threat of sabotage to the water way, by far the best defense was the good  will and cooperation of  the Panamanian  people and their national gUard.""  But Noriega's domestic-and foreign-policy  gambits undermine that treaty assumption.  He has thickened ties with Cuba, Libya and  Colombian Marxist guerrillas, and harassed  the 40,000 U.S. civilians and 12,000 U.S.  troops in the zone. Indicted by the United  States for complicity in drug trafficking and  subject to a companion economic embargo,  he exploits  those actions domestically  to  bestir Panamanian ill will towards America.  The 1977 treaty terminates U.S. sovereign ty over the Panama Canal and the Canal  Zone in 1999. That stipulation, however, is  limited by the higher treaty right of the  United States  to protect and defend  the  canal from armed attack ""or other actions""  that threaten its neutrality or security or  the right of U.S. warships to transit the  canal expeditiously in cases of emergency.  The latter right requires maintaining U.S.  troops in the zone whenever prevailing Pan amanian conditions are  inconsistent with  good faith and Panama's capacity to honor  its 1977  treaty obligations-circumstances  that exist today.  International law empowers a treaty sig natory to suspend provisions when a materi al unexpressed postulate of the negotiations  proves to be false. Thus, during World War  II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared  a shipping convention suspended and inop erative because a continuation of peace was  an essential premise of its provisions. Simi larly, Bush  should  inform Noriega U.S.  troops will  remain  in the zone and  that  zonal security will remain untransferred in  1999 unless  the United States  then con cludes that Panama is both able and politi cally dedicated to preventing an interrup tion of canal operations or a violation of  canal neutrality.

344,466,7,Mr. DIXON.,"  In short: There  is a  nerve gas plant in Libya. Next to the  nerve gas plant as a supporting manu facturing system is sort of a metal fab rication plant. Do not hold me to the  precise description because, again,  I  tell you that these are not my areas of  expertise, but the metal plant, which  is next door to the poison gas plant  where the canisters, shells, and bombs  are made for  this  insidious, deathly  nerve gas was in large part developed  by Japanese concerns, with some in volvement by Mitsubishi.  I would  also  like  to put  in  the  RECORD, Mr. President, the statement  by Clyde Prestowitz, Jr., ""The New  FSX Deal Hardly Differs From the  Original.''  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Chicago Tribune, May 5, 19891  THE NEW FSX DEAL HARDLY DIFFERS FROM  THE ORIGINAL  <By Clyde v. Prestowitz, Jr.>  The FSX mountain  has  labored  and  brought forth a mouse. For several months  the Bush administration appeared  to be  raising the priority of defense of U.S. tech nologies leadership in the deal with Japan  to codevelop its next generation fighter as a  derivative of the U.S. F-16. Yet the adminis tration now seems to have settled for little  more than the original deal of last Decem ber.  Under the agreement, the United States  was to turn over to Japan F-16 technology developed at the cost of $3 billion to $5 bil lion-in return for 40 percent of the devel opment work on four FSX prototypes <$460  million), a vague expression of ""best effort""  to achieve a similar U.S. workshare on the  eventual 130-plane production run, and an  equally vague promise of access  to unde fined Japanese technology. Flowback to the  U.S. of Japanese  technology ""essentially""  derived from U.S. technology was to be free  of  charge, while  indigenously  developed  Japanese technology would be available for  a royalty.  Critics pointed out that the wildly unbal anced nature of this deal <similar to others  the U.S. had come to regret> probably would  accelerate Japan's drive toward world-class  aircraft manufacturing status and narrow  the U.S.  lead in its last industrial strong hold.  In  response, President Bush ordered a  review and then asked Japan to agree to cer tain improvements in the deal. Specifically,  the President demanded: <1 > revision of the  basic memorandum of understanding  to  obtain clear assurances of a 40 percent U.S.  production workshare; <2> restriction on the  transfer of key software source codes for  the plane's computers; and (3) a clearer defi nition of  the  term  ""essentially"" derived  from U.S.  technology with regard  to  the  flowback of technology to the U.S.  When made in February, the President's  demands amounted to a denial of the asser tion by  the Pentagon and State Department, as well as by former Secretaries of  Defense Frank Carlucci and Caspar Wein berger, that the deal as originally negotiat ed was the best one possible. In particular,  the President obviously questioned their in sistence that the United States ""had every  reason to expect that it would receive 40  percent of the eventual production work.""  He had good cause. Bitter experience had  taught that the words ""best effort"" in this  kind of deal  really mean ""it will never  happen."" Experience with  the F-15  and  others also  indicated a U.S.  readiness  to  transfer increasing increments of technolo gy for very little or nothing in return.  Nothing confirmed  the wisdom of  the  President's course and confounded the par tisans of the original deal more than the  Japanese response. Three months of hag gling ensued. Where the Pentagon had ear lier insisted that the U.S. ""had every reason  to expect"" a 40 percent production work share,  the Japanese proposed 28 percent,  then inched up to 32-35 percent.  The stakes in this game were the engines.  At a 40 percent U.S. workshare, if the Japa nese were to keep the avionics and other so phisticated work in Japan, the U.S. would  have to get most of the engines that con tained new and  important  technology  in  which the U.S. has a substantial lead.  Similar haggling occurred over technology  transfer issues. For most of that time the  administration held firm for the President's  demands with, amazingly, the State Depart ment taking the lead as the tough guy.  Then, suddenly, it all fell apart. Shortly  after Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's  resignation statement, an agreement on the  FSX was announced. Under it, the U.S. is to  get ""approximately"" 40 percent of the pro duction workshare. Mention of restriction  on transfer of source codes was made, but it  is agreed that the U.S. will transfer all codes  necessary to realization of the FSX project's  objectives.  The terms of the U.S. access to possible  Japanese technology were somewhat clari fied, and the U.S. agreed that it would not  preclude the possibility of Japanese produc tion of the engine. Moreover, these changes  were contained in an exchange of letters  rather than in the memorandum of under standing itself as the President had request ed.  One can only wonder what all  the fuss  was about. This is essentially the same deal  as that announced in January. What is ""ap proximately"" 40 percent. Is at 20 percent or  35 percent? Certainly it is not 45 percent.  Any suggested restrictions on source code  transfer are meaningless as long as they are  qualified by the need to ""reach project ob jectives."" In time, ""reaching objectives"" will  result in virtually total transfer.  Why did the U.S. back down? One can  only speculate, but it appears to be a reas sertion of the traditional primacy of defense  over economic consideration in U.S. diplo macy. With Takeshita on the skids, the U.S.  became concerned that a new prime minis ter could not agree to any deal on the FSX.  Concerned that Japan would not have an  adequate fighter in the 21st Century, the  U.S. appears to have pressed for a quick  deal with Takeshita was still around to do  it, proving once again that, between the U.S.  and Japan, nothing ever changes.

346,466,7,Mr. DIXON.," Mr.  President,  you  heard me tell the story about what we  are  getting  from  the  Japanese  in  return with respect to the composite  wing technology and with respect to  the radar technology. That has been  substantiated in a full hour discussion  with the General Accounting Office in  a separate meeting on Friday a week  ago  and  it has been  substantiated  again in a subcommittee of the Armed  Services Committee meeting the other  day, but just to make the record emi nently clear I hold in my hand, Mr.  President, a letter from the U.S. Gen eral Accounting Office, Washington,  DC, National Security and  Interna tional Affairs Division dated May 8,  1989, addressed to this Senator. I want  to read a sentence. In time I may read  the whole letter, but I want to put the  whole letter in the RECORD now but  read this sentence. ""Our preliminary  observations  are  that,  overall,  the  United States has superior""-superi or-""composites  technology  and  ap pears to be ahead in the radar develop ment.""  On composite technology and radar  development,  the United States of  America  is  superior  to  the country  with which we want to do business.  Japan would be giving us technology  in which the GAO says we are superi or.  I ask unanimous consent that this  letter from  the General Accounting  Office be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  MAY 8, 1989.  Hon. ALAN J. DIXON,  U.S. Senate.  DEAR  SENATOR DIXON: On January 30,  1989, you requested that we review various  aspects of the proposed FS-X support fight er codevelopment program between the U.S.  government and the government of Japan.  As arranged with your office, we are fur nishing the information we have obtained to  date on two Japanese technologies that will  be available to the United States under the  program. These technologies, which relate  to composites and the active phased array  radar, are discussed in detail in enclosures I  and II.  In October 1987, the government of Japan  decided to develop the FS-X support fighter  using the General Dynamics F-16 C/D as  the baseline aircraft. In November 1988, the  Department of Defense <DOD)  and  the  Japan Defense Agency signed the Memoran dum of Understanding for the cooperative  development of  the aircraft.  In January  1989, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japa nese prime contractor, and General Dynam ics,  the U.S. manufacturer of  the F-16  signed a Licensing and Technical Assistance  Agreement.  According to DOD, the FS-X program was  not pursued with the primary objective of  obtaining access to Japanese technology or  balancing  the  exchange  of  technology.  ",1989

353,479,7,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, I want to  talk about Senate Joint Resolution  113, which is the resolution of disap proval of  the  sale of  the FSX  to  Japan.  You know, I am somewhat pleased  that the paper in my State, one of the  large papers, a very good paper,  lis tened  to  the debate and researched  the reasons for this sale. Their head line has been used quite a bit here this  afternoon. The headline of that edito rial in the Lexington Herald-Leader,  Lexington, KY, says ""The 'S' in FSX  stands for sucker.""  I would like to read that editorial,  Mr. President, into the RECORD.  U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford is right. The Bush  administration's proposed FSX aircraft deal  with Japan brings to mind P.T. Barnum's  famous line about the birth rate of gullible  people.  Ford,  the Democrat from Kentucky,  is  leading a  fight  to keep Americans  from  being played for suckers in this deal; and  well he should. It's a one-way transaction.  The United States gives the Japanese the  technology they need to compete! underscore ""compete"" with us in aircraft production. In return, we  get nothing we don't already have.  Sure, General Dynamics, the aircraft com pany that will work with Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries on this new version of the F-16  fighter, will get  the benefit of Japanese  radar and composite materials technology,  But that will only help General Dynamics  catch up with  its domestic competitors Boeing, Lockheed and Northrup,  for  in stance-who already are competitive with  the Japanese in this area.  To get technology that we already have,  we give away the secrets to our leadership  in airframe construction and electronics-se crets the Japanese can use to enter the com mercial aircraft market. And that, as the  president of Mitsubishi has indicated public ly, is what this dealI underscore ""deal""is all about. Why else would Japan agree to  pay twice the price of an F-16 for a slightly  better version of the same plane?  Of course,  there  is nothing wrong with  Japan developing an aircraft industry. Com petition  in any  industry  is good. But we  don't have to hand everything to the Japa nese on a platter. Let them incur their own  research and development expenses, instead  of buying the technology wholesale. And let  General Dynamics do the same on the do mestic front.  The figure has been used of $7 bil lion of hard-earned taxpayers' dollars  that have gone into the development  of the finest military aircraft in the  world, the F-16. So here in a flick of a  pen a deal is struck to give that tech nology,  that research,  that develop ment away for a pittance.  I do not  know what other Senators are hear ing. But let me tell you when you get  outside the Beltway-in case anyone  listening to me does not know what  the Beltway is,  that is  the highway  that runs around Washington, DC, 72  miles, I guess-when you get beyond  that,  beyond  the  Potomac River,  people do not like this arrangement.  And it would be my guess  that the  mail is going to be almost as heavy in  opposition to this arrangement as it  was to the pay increase.  Telephone calls are coming  in my  office, and letters are being received  by the boxes and bags full. When our  constituents get through telling us, I  do not believe there will be a Senator  who should support this arrangement  with Japan. Some will. Some are loyal  even if the people they are following  are wrong. You cannot fault loyalty,  but you can also fault being wrong.  I know what good business with the  Japanese is. There is a perfect exam ple in my State. Toyota has built a  plant in Georgetown, KY, and is man ufacturing  Camrys with American  workers and American parts. They get  the revenue; we get the jobs. There is  nothing wrong with  that. Why give  them the revenue and the jobs both?  In my opinion, that plant in George town, KY, is a good business transac tion-this one is not-because in that  situation in Georgetown, KY, there is  no erosion of American jobs, no giving  away of valuable technology, no giving  away-and this is what really get to  me-of the capability  to establish a  lead in the commercial aviation indus try and take away our predominance,  our one  last area of manufacturing  predominance, from us.  We are approaching  the Japanese  decade of the aircraft, having suffered  through the decade of the automobile  and the decade of the microchip; and  we are handing it to them on a silver  platter-maybegreen.  I  think  if we  took time, as I said earlier, to listen to  our constituents, and what they are  saying, not one Member of this body  would have to think about how to vote  on the resolution of disapproval. The  decision would be automatic, and  it  would be a resounding vote of no sale,  no sale.  The working men and women of this  great country of ours have a stake in  what we do now and how it develops  the future. You know, the American  dream is to invest at night and be rich  in the morning. It does not happen to  many people. It takes a while to work  and develop, and it takes a demand in  the American system to make a go of  things. As we say  in Kentucky, ""It  would take a while.""  The working men and women know  what this is, and union knows the dif ference between a short-term gain and  a  long-term loss. This morning I  re ceived a very interesting letter from  the International Union of Electronic  Workers. This union represents some  47,000 workers  at General Electric  who manufacture  the  jet  engines  which will be  involved  in  the FSX  deal.  Listen to what the union president  says, William H. Bywater:  The net effect of this deal will be to give  Japan a leg up in another vital industry, re sulting in the loss of jobs for U.S. workers,  who have built the U.S. aerospace industry  into the strongest industry of its kind in the  world.  They paid their taxes, they worked  hard, and now we say to them, with all  your payment of taxes, all your hard  work, we are going to give that away.  We say, down in Kentucky, something  about that: ""That ain't right.""  Likewise,  it misses  the boat in  its  failure to hold out for full production  of the FSX. Production where? In the  United States of America, if we hold  out for a full production of the FSX in  the United States, as a down payment  by  Japan on  longstanding  commit ments to bring down the $55 billion  trade bonanza it enjoys over this coun try.  The union has not been fooled, not  for a minute, by the fleeting promise and I underscore ""fleeting""-of a tem porary workload. They understand the  tradeoff between short-term gain and  long-term loss. Why do we not here on  Capitol Hill understand it as well?  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous  consent that a letter written to me by  William H. Bywater, president of the  International Union  of  Electronic,  Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Fur niture Workers  be  printed  in  the  RECORD at this time, along with the  news release.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  INTERNATIONAL  UNION  OF  ELEC TRONIC,  ELECTRICAL,  SALARIED,  MACHINE, AND FuRNITURE WORK ERS, AFL-CIO,  ",1989
354,505,7,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  equal opportunity  in employment  is  the law of the land. Yet despite the  Equal Pay Act and the antidiscrimina tion laws enacted in the 1960's, women  in this country still earn only 70 per cent of what men earn. One of the rea sons for  this persistent wage gap  is  that men and women work at different  jobs. Occupational segregation of the  sexes  is very much a  reality in the  American workplace.  Women are 99 percent of dental as sistants, and men are 91 percent of  dentists. Women are 87  percent of  data entry keyers, and men are 87 per cent of data processing equipment re pairers. Women are 95 percent of all  registered nurses, and men are 98 per cent of all construction workers. And  it is no secret that the occupations  dominated by women pay  less  than  the jobs typically held by men. As an  example, data entry keyers earn $290  per. week, but data processing equip ment repairers earn $515 per week.  The  reasons  behind  occupational  segregation are varied and complex.  We face cultural stereotypes about the  roles of men and women, and biased  attitudes about the types of work that  women can perform. We also must rec ognize the failure of our education and  training systems  to overcome  these  stereotypes  and  biases. Moreover,  women who do choose to pursue non traditional employment often are the  victims of sexual harrassment or more  subtle forms of discrimination.  If we are to promote true equal op portunity in the workplace, we must  work to break down occupational seg regation. Women deserve a shot at the  higher paying jobs that currently are  dominated by men. We must encour age  businesses  to  think  of  hiring  women for traditionally male jobs. We  must encourage women  to go after  these better paying jobs.  Accordingly, today I am introducing  legislation to expand employment op portunities for women. It is a modest  but important measure that will help  erode  the  occupational  segregation  that pervades our work force.  I am  pleased to be joined in this effort by  the ranking Republican on the Labor  Committee, Senator HATCH, as well as  Senators PELL, KASSEBAUM, and KEN NEDY.  The Nontraditional Employment for  Women Act-the NEW Act-amends  the Job Training Partnership Act to  provide women greater access to occu pations traditionally held by men. In  doing so,  the bill will assist women  across the country to acquire skills in  jobs that provide good wages and ben efits and long-term economic security.  There is a clear reward for women  who seek employment in fields tradi tionally dominated by men. It is no  secret that carpenters earn more than  cashiers, and  technicians earn more  than typists. Employment in tradition ally male fields can off er women great er wages, benefits, and advancement  potential  than  traditionally  female  fields of work.  During the lOOth Congress, I chaired  a hearing of  the Subcommittee on  Labor to explore the employment of  women in nontraditional fields. At the  hearing we heard from women who  had been frustrated in their efforts to  become highway construction workers.  We heard from one of the first female  electricians in the Boston area about  what it was like to be the only trades woman at  the worksite. We heard  from women who broke the welfare  cycle by becoming computer  techni cians. These women enjoyed not only  higher wages, but also an enhanced  self-esteem. At  the same  time,  they  spoke of their struggles in overcoming  barriers  to meaningful  training and  successful job placement.  Despite language in the Act to the  contrary, women who participate  in  training  programs  under  the  Job  Training Partnership Act often are  steered into secretarial, bookkeeping,  and other traditionally female occupa tions. These are not jobs that lead to  long-term  financial  independence.  These  are predominantly  dead-end,  low-wage jobs.  Changes  are  needed  in  the  Job  Training  Partnership Act  so  that  women are encouraged to seek train ing and employment in nontraditional  fields of work. The NEW Act will pro vide for these opportunities by focus ing additional attention and resouces  on training and placing women in non traditional jobs. The act accomplishes  this objective in two ways.  First, the NEW Act requires service  delivery areas and States to  include  goals  in  their  annual  job  training  plans for training and placing women  in nontraditional employment. This  requirement will focus attention early  in the planning stages on how to pro vide  for nontraditional opportunities  for women. The bill also includes pro visions  to facilitate coordination be tween Job Training Partnership Act  programs  and  activities  offered  through the Carl D. Perkins Vocation al Education Act and other sources.  Second, the NEW Act creates a 4year demonstration program to foster  the development of programs to train  women  for  nontraditional  employ ment. One of the reasons given for the  low number of women in traditionally  male  training programs  is cost. Be cause of cultural stereotypes, educa tional differences,  child care needs,  and a variety of other reasons, it often  costs more to train women for nontra ditional work  than  for  traditionally  female work. This cost factor acts as a  disincentive  to service delivery areas  that might otherwise seek to increase  the number of women offered training  in nontraditional fields.  Under the NEW Act, the Secretary  of Labor will select up to six States per  year for demonstration grants. Gover nors may use  the  funds  to  award  grants to service providers for the pur pose of training women for nontradi tional employment. They also may use  this money to award grants to service  delivery areas that excel  in training  and placing women in nontraditional  fields of work. Through this approach,  we will facilitate the development of  model programs for training women in  nontraditional fields, which then can  be replicated by other States and serv ice delivery areas.  Mr. President, the NEW Act offers a  simple and straight! orward means to  provide a wider range of employment  opportunities for women who partici pate in programs under the Job Train ing Partnership Act. One of the funda mental purposes of JTPA  is  to  in crease the earning potential of partici pants. Women have not received their  fair share of the training available for  the jobs with the best earning poten tial.

Res. 26) urging first asylum countries  of the Association of Southeast Asia  Nations CASEANl  to  reinstate  the  practice of providing  refuge  to  all  asylum seekers from Vietnam, and for  other purposes, was considered and  agreed to.  The preamble was agreed to.  The concurrent resolution, and the  preamble, are as follows:  ASEAN  the ASEAN  S. CON. RES. 26  Whereas the refugee crisis in Southeast  Asia remains unresolved and large numbers  of refugees continue to flee from Vietnam,  Laos, and Cambodia;  Whereas,  although  Hong  Kong  and  first asylum countries are  to be  commended for their past actions on behalf  of refugees in the region, concerns remain  over  the failure  to provide  refuge  to all  asylum-seekers arriving in Hong Kong and  in ASEAN member countries;  Whereas,  in June 1989,  the United Na tions will convene the International Confer ence on Indochinese Refugees  in Geneva,  Switzerland;  Whereas representatives of  member  countries,  the United  States,  Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, the Europe an Community, Vietnam, Laos, and other in terested and affected countries gathered on  March 7-9, 1989, in Kuala Lumpur, Malay sia,  for  the Preparatory Meeting for  the  International Conference on  Indochinese  Refugees;  Whereas the countries represented at the  Preparatory Meeting unanimously adopted  a draft declaration and comprehensive plan  of action to be presented for ratification at  the  June United Nations Conference  in  Geneva;  Whereas the draft declaration agreed to  by all countries present at the meeting in  Kuala  Lumpur  includes  provisions  for  region-wide screening of asylum-seekers and  for the encouragement of voluntary repatri ation under the auspices and monitoring of  the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees <UNHCR> or persons determined  not to be refugees;  Whereas  the ongoing program in Thai land for the screening of Lao asylum-seek ers has had major and continuing problems;  Whereas  the ASEAN member countries  have  announced  that all  asylum-seekers  from Vietnam arriving in ASEAN countries  on or after March 14, 1989, will be screened  to determine their refugee status; and  Whereas the Socialist Republic of Viet nam has demonstrated its hostility to those  leaving Vietnam illegally and, in particular,  to those refusing to return to Vietnam vol untarily: Now, therefore, be it  .Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep resentatives concurring), That <a> it is the  sense of the Congress that< l> ASEAN first asylum countries should  reinstate the practice of providing adequate  refuge for all Vietnamese asylum-seekers,  while carrying out the screening of such in dividuals;  (2) early access should be given  to the  United Nations High Commissioner for Ref ugees <UNHCR>  to provide humane care  and protection to such asylum-seekers;  <3> no repatriation of Vietnamese asylum seekers should occur until a strong and ef fective internationally approved mechanism  is in place to guarantee that such asylum seekers will be returned  in conditions of  safety and dignity and will not be subjected  to persecution in any form;  <4> given Vietnamese attitudes toward ille gal departure, forced repatriation of refu gees to Vietnam should not be considered a  viable option;  <5> continuing effort should be made to  improve  the  screening program of Laos  asylum-seekers in Thailand;  (6) the United States should remain com mitted to a generous and humane Southeast  Asian refugee resettlement policy; and  <7>  the United States should urge  its  Western allies  to  implement or continue  generous and humane Southeast Asia refu gee resettlement policies.  <b> For purposes of this resolution< 1 > the term ""ASEAN"" means the Associa tion of Southeast Asian Nations; and  <2>  the term ""ASEAN first asylum coun tries""  includes  any  country which  is  a  member of the ASEAN group of countries  and which is the first to receive an individ ual seeking asylum.  Whereas open discussion, meaning  the  full airing of views, among member-states of  the Alliance is fundamental to the nature of  a voluntary alliance of democratic nations;  Whereas  experience  has  demonstrated  that a firm and coherent NATO position is  crucial to effective East-West arms control;  and  Whereas the common interests of Alliance  members continue to outweigh any disagree ments on particular issues of defense pos ture and arms control negotiating strategy:  Be it therefore  Resolved, That this resolution may be re ferred to as the ""Renewed Commitment to  NATO Resolution,"" passed on the occasion  of NATO's 40th anniversary.  That the United States Senate remains  dedicated to the North Atlantic Alliance as  a critical instrumentality for maintaining an  effective Western defense of the principles  and institutions of democratic freedom;  That it remains in the overwhelming in terest of the United States and other mem bers of NATO that recurring disputes con cerning defense posture and arms control  negotiating strategy be resolved in a spirit  of comity and compromise, and with a con tinuing emphasis on  the  larger purposes  NATO has so effectively served for forty  years.

The preamble was agreed to.  The resolution, and the preamble,  are as follows:  S.

357,570,7,Mr. SANGMEISTER.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great pride that I rise to salute a constituent,  and a friend, who has dedicated most of his  life to the service of his community. After 22  years of service as the mayor of Manhattan,  Will County,  IL, John E.  ""Jack"" Fitzgerald is  retiring and I ask my colleagues in the House  to join with me in paying tribute to this excep tional public servant.  Jack Fitzgerald's dedicated public service to  the village of Manhattan  is exemplary. Jack  was a village trustee of Manhattan from 1965  to 1967 and served as mayor of that village  from 1967 to 1989. In addition, he has been a  member of the volunteer fire department for  32 years; has been assistant fire chief since  1967 and  in 1987 was named paramedic of  the year  for  the Will-Grundy system which  covers 2,000 square miles that includes area  fire departments and private systems.  His public service career is marked by con tinuous achievement concerning  the overall  welfare, growth, and safety of the village of  Manhattan and  its  residents. The village of  Manhattan has gone through many changes,  and Jack Fitzgerald served . as the catalyst for  many of them: forming the local civil defense  organization  [ESDA], developing a compre hensive plan for the growth of the village, ob taining revenue sharing funds, expanding the  police force, and improving the street program  as well as building a new sewer  treatment  plant and water tower. Over the years of his  tenure, Manhattan  has  seen  a population  growth now exceeding 2,000 residents.  Jack Fitzgerald was born, raised, and edu cated in Manhattan and never left. He and his  wife raised their five children there and they in  turn are raising their families there. In addition  to his public service, Jack is active in many  civic, community, and church affairs. I offer to  my colleagues a quote from a newspaper arti cle which  I  feel eloquently expresses why  Jack Fitzgerald is held in such high esteem by  the residents of Manhattan: ""He sacrifices his  time for those who need him, not for financial  reward, but  for his  love of Manhattan. He  knows no other way.""  Mr. Speaker,  the  residents of Manhattan  have been most fortunate to have someone of  Jack Fitzgerald's ability and quality  to  lead  them. He has done a lot of good for them,  and in their behalf and as a friend of mine,  I  thank him and wish him well in the future.  SMALL DAY CARE CENTER  ASSISTANCE ACT  HON. MARCY KAPTUR  01' OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 1989  ",1989
358,570,7,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I invite my col leagues to join me in removing an impediment  to provision of day care by cosponsoring the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ""Small Day Care Center Assistance Act."" This  bill which I am introducing today, and which is  being introduced in the other body by Senator  DAVID DURENBERGER, would amend the Fed eral charters of the Federal National Mortgage  Association and Federal Home Loan Mort gage Corporation to permit these agencies to  purchase mortgages  on  homes  containing  family day care centers.  Today, there are many small, family-operat ed day care services which are  run out of  peoples' homes. For many working parents,  these neighborhood centers offer a reliable,  familiar, community setting in which to leave  their children when they go off to their jobs.  Unfortunately, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,  and Ginnie Mae,  the secondary mortgage in stitutions which purchase most home mort gages, are limited by their charters to involve ment with  residential mortgages. What  this  means  for  the owner of a house whose  spouse operates a day care center on  its  premises is that he or she cannot refinance  the mortgage  because  the  local  lender  couldn't sell  that mortgage to the secondary  mortgage market. Or, it means that a couple,  who depend on  the  income from  the wife's  small day care operation to qualify for a mort gage, cannot get the mortgage without giving  up the day care service.  We are all familiar with the many statistics  which  indicate a growing need  for day care  services. Day care centers operated  in  resi dential homes are, by  their very nature, not  huge,  impersonal businesses. They are,  in  fact, the type of day care preferred by many  working parents. Furthermore, because most  States have regulations or  licensing require ments setting standards for numbers of chil dren being served and the quality of care pro vided,  they are safe, clean environments for  provision  of  this  care. We  can  enhance  access to day care by passing this bill and I  hope you and the other Members of this body  will support it.  CLEAN AIR RESTORATION ACT  OF 1989  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 1989  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker,  I  am pleased to join with my colleagues today  to introduce the Clean Air Restoration Act of  1989, offered by ",1989
359,570,7,Mr. WAXMAN of California.,"  This bill constitutes the second phase of our  efforts to reauthorize the Clean Air Act in the  101 st Congress. Earlier this year, I joined with  over 140 of my colleagues  to introduce the  Acid Deposition Control Act  to combat acid  rain. Soon we will be introducing legislation to  control toxic emissions of particulates. These  three pieces of legislation will form the basis  for reauthorizing the Clean Air Act.  Mr. Speaker, on April 27 of  this year,  I  signed a  letter  to President Bush with over  150 of my colleagues, calling upon him  to  send  to Congress comprehensive clean air  legislation. The President has  indicated his  support for just an approach and  I look for ward  to working with  the Administration  this  May 11, 1989  year to enact a Clean Air Act reauthorization  bill.  However, we cannot afford to wait one day  longer  to  take action  to protect  the air we  breathe. Mr. Speaker, it has now been almost  two decades since the passage of the Clean  Air Act, and over a decade since the Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1977 were passed. As  you know, the cornerstone of the law was the  establishment of the national ambient air qual ity standards [NAAQS]. States and metropoli tan areas were given deadlines to meet these  standards or face a series of sanctions. Unfor tunately,  these standards still have not been  met.  Mr. Speaker,  the Environmental Protection  Agency reports that over 150 million Ameri cans live in nonattainment areas, due to un healthy levels of either ozone or carbon mon oxide. As President Bush has said,  the time  for action is now.  The Clean Air Restoration Act of 1989,  which  I am proud to cosponsor, would grant  deadline extensions  to  those areas which  have not been able to achieve the attainment  standards, however,  these extensions would  be conditioned upon the adoption of additional  pollution control measures. Areas with  the  most severe pollution problems would receive  longer extensions, but would also be required  to  implement  the most aggressive pollution  control steps.  Mr. Speaker, the basic approach of this leg islation is to provide each State with the flexi bility to meet the standards by granting exten sions of 4 years for moderate areas, 8 years  for serious areas, 12 years for severe areas  and 15 years  for extreme areas. Each area  granted an extension would then be required  to put  into place special measures  for  the  achievement of  reduction  targets  [SMARn  based upon  the classification by  the EPA.  New targets and milestones would be set up  for each area to insure their compliance, and  new assessments would be made every 4  years.  This  legislation gives States 4 years  to  gather data, assemble emission  inventories,  and develop implementation plans for control ling ozone pollution. However, States are re quired  to continue  to  implement short  term  measures  to continue  their existing compli ance strategies. Free market economic incen tives would be authorized, such as emission  fees or marketable permits as an alternative  to command and control approaches used so  often in the past.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation attacks mobile  sources in addition to stationary sources. New  and  tougher tailpipe standards would be es tablished for automobile emissions to control  hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions.  There would be new requirements to mandate  that auto emission controls last for the life of  the car, not just for 50,000 miles as currently  required.  In addition,  this  legislation aggres sively promotes the use of ethanol, methanol,  and other alternative  fuels which contribute  fewer pollutants.  Finally Mr. Speaker, let me say that the pro tection of our air has always been  foremost  among my  legislative priorities while  in Con gress. I am proud to have received the Clean  Air Champion Award from the Sierra Club last  ",1989
360,583,7,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I am ad vised that in a few minutes the distin guished Senator  from  Illinois  [Mr.  DIXON] will be present, and he will be  managing the bill on his side.

362,583,7,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I thank  the Chair.  This morning, in my initial remarks  I will outline my reasons for support  of the FSX agreement that has been  submitted to the Congress by Presi dent Bush, and which was commended  by the Senate Foreign Relations Com mittee by a vote of 9 to 8 yesterday.  In particular, Mr. President, the vote  was on a motion of rejection of the  FSX situation which Senator DIXON  proposed. And the committee, having  turned down Senator DIXON'S motion  by a vote of 9 to 8, proceeded to send  the issue to the floor for his debate  which we are now having.  I think it is important to note that  in the consideration which we enjoyed  yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee there was bipartisan  support for the agreement. In particu lar, five Republicans and four Demo crats comprised the nine who voted in  favor of the agreement. This biparti sanship is important I suspect to note  in  the deliberations which we will  have today.  The management of the joint resolu tion today comes from Senator DIXON,  and for the moment the distinguished  Senator from North Carolina, Senator  SANFORD, will manage in his stead.  I have been asked as one on the For eign Relations Committee to support  the deal, or be opposed to the disap proval, and to manage the time on our  side which I shall attempt to do.  I am hopeful that during the course  of the day, with the assistance of the  distinguished majority and minority  leaders, we will be able to arrive at a  time certain for a vote  in the early  part of next week, but after very thor ough deliberations. We have the hours  ahead of us today for all Senators to  have thoughts about the FSX situa tion to make them known.  Mr. President, I come to this propo sition with the basic thought that the  relationship  the United States and  Japan  have  in  foreign  policy  and  economies, and in development of po litical ideas around the world is very  important. We have  important rela tionships in NATO. We, of course, are  deeply concerned about the progress  of countries in our own hemisphere.  We have an abiding hope that world  trade will  increase generally because  we  believe  that our prosperity  in creases accordingly. But we center in  this debate upon our relationship with  Japan. It is of critical importance.  I suspect the first thing that must  be recognized about  the  thought of  the development of a Japanese fighter  aircraft is that many persons in Japan,  many  leaders  in politics, economics,  certainly in their aircraft industry in  the late 1980's came to the conclusion  that Japan ought to develop a fighter  aircraft on its own; that the economy,  that the technological assets of that  country were  sufficient  to do  that.  This came as somewhat of a surprise  to many of us in the United States of  America, who had worked successfully  with Japan on various other aircraft  that have been helpful to the defense  of that country. As a result, it was at  our initiative that the United States  visited with the Japanese and said, ""It  is critically important that we contin ue to develop these aircraft together,  the Japanese and Americans together,  in this situation.""  That was at our insistence, and the  beginning of the agreement that we  looked at today comes not because the  Japanese pressed us to make an agree ment; it was because we said we think  it is important for the United States of  America to be involved in the Japa nese aircraft  industry,  all  the way  through,  and  continuing.  That,  I  think, is  the critical element of this  debate, Mr. President; it is at our initi ative that this is being sought.  I suppose the fact that at the end of  the Reagan administration and the on coming of  the Bush administration,  there was, as in all grave policies of  state,  a  review. And  a  number of  people  in  the Bush administration,  having  surveyed  this,  felt  that we  ought to tidy up some of the language,  firm up some of the agreements, espe cially in terms of the commercial as pects of this. Specifically, how many  jobs for the United States, how much  business, what kind of a change  in  terms of  the balance of payments  would  this amount to? That tidying  up, that refinement of the agreement,  has occurred and has been agreed to  by the Japanese.  Mr. President, I come to the conclu sion, having heard this debate, having  visited with our leadership, having vis ited with Japanese leadership, that we  simply have a very essential question  in front of us to decide. The question  is basically this: Do we want the Japa nese  to proceed alone  to build  the  fighter plane? Do we want the Japa nese to develop an industry which will  have a figher plane as its objective, as  its achievement, and totally independ ent of us?  If the answer to that is yes, or we  really do not care,  then clearly  the  debate is a simple one for Members.  Some Members have come to a conclu sion that, of course, we really want to  monitor this, we want to stay involved,  we are deeply interested in Japanese  developments. Some Members have a  lurking  feeling  that  the  Japanese  really do not have the capabilities to  do this, at least very fast. Some Mem bers would say, well, in due course the  Japanese  could  develop  first-class  fighter aircfaft that would meet their  capabilities, but it would take them a  lot of time. They are more advanced in  the state of the art in various ways  than we are, and even if they went to  the Europeans,  it would  still  take  them time, some time longer than the  area contemplated now by this agree ment.  I have no way of making a definitive  estimate on that, Mr. President, as to  how long it would take the Japanese  to  build  fighter  aircraft.  Having  watched  Japanese  developments  in  other areas, I suspect and my own con clusion is,  that they would have the  capability of doing that at some point.  Furthermore,  I  am  convinced,  having  talked  to many  people  in  Japan, that a very large percentage of  Japanese would like to do it that way.  They would like to have the United  States out of the picture altogether. I  think that is a potentially dangerous  course for Japan and for the United  States, and so do a majority of Japa",1989
363,609,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Reserving  the  right to object, for the benefit of the  majority leader and my colleagues, I  had hoped that there could be an ac commodation made, and it may be pos sible, I say to the majority leader, that  we can work out an agreement on a  resolution which, like Senator BYRD'S  resolution, was discussed at substan tial length in the Foreign Relations  Committee and has been approved by  the administration.  The resolution related to Japanese  involvement in assisting the develop ment of chemical warfare capabilities  in Libya, in metallurgical facilities spe cifically, and having the resolution as  a  freestanding resolution right after  the disposition of the Dixon resolu tion,  recognizing  the  leader  has  changed the order. I had been assured  that a majority of my colleagues on  the Foreign Relations Committee at  least would support this freestanding  resolution.  It is my understanding the Parlia mentarian has had some objection be cause it deals with a third country. I  find the interpretation rather ironic.  While we are dealing with a message  to send to our allies, our friends  in  Japan, I feel that it is inappropriate  that  this  resolution not  receive  the  consideration of this body.  There have been efforts throughout  the day to try to work out some ac commodation. I implore the leader for  consideration of this. I should also add  that my senior colleague, Senator STE VENS, and I have a concern over drift net legislation that is presently pend ing in the form of a resolution.  While we have few opportunities to  pursue appropriate legislation, I say to  the majority leader, I would wonder and I certainly want to work toward  the tim.eframe, but if I am precluded I  must object.

364,609,7,Mr. MITCHELL.," If I may respond to  the Senator from Alaska,  two points  have been raised. First, with respect to  the Senator's provision, I had been ad vised the Senator had been satisfied  and did not intend to off er that as an  amendment. Is that what he is now  saying?  the Senator from Alaska  now saying that he does wish to off er  his amendment?  ",1989
365,609,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI., It is the inten tion of the Senator from Alaska  to  off er a freestanding resolution. That  was what I intended to do in the For eign Relations Committee and was  generally agreed to as far as appropri ate procedure. It was not going to be  in the form of an amendment.  ,1989
366,609,7,Mr. MITCHELL.," If that is the Sena tor's intention, then, obviously, if it is  Is  relevant to the pending resolution, he  has that right and will be able to do  so, and therefore is perfectly within  his rights to object to this agreement.  With respect to the amendment of the  senior Senator from Alaska, under the  existing  unanimous-consent  agree ment, he has no right to off er that to  the pending resolution. Therefore, he  is unaffected by  that part of  this  unanimous-consent  request  which  deals with the pending resolution, and  indeed this unanimous-consent request  creates a vehicle, the Byrd resolution,  in the event the pending resolution is  defeated, to which he could off er it.  ",1989
367,609,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," I appreciate the  majority leader pointing out that par liamentary track. I would be willing to  commit my colleague and myself for  that opportunity, I say to the majority  leader. I would simply, in addition, ask  for the assurance to have the opportu nity to bring up the resolution at an  appropriate time after the disposition  of the Dixon resolution of disapproval,  which I understand would be the ini tial  pending  business  before  the  Senate in the order that the Senator  has outlined.  ",1989
368,609,7,Mr. MITCHELL.," I am unable to do  that now because I do not, personally,  know who may have objection to the  Senator's resolution and in what form,  and therefore  this  is an open-ended  circumstance in which each new issue  raises two new issues. I had announced  yesterday  that we would  seek  this  unanimous-consent agreement  today.  Unfortunately, despite our best efforts  of about 5 hours, we have been unable  to do so, I must say in all candor, in  large part because Senators, many  Senators have simply not made their  wishes known or taken the time and  interest to be here during the period  in which we are attempting to obtain  this  agreement.  Accordingly,  Mr.  President, in view of the objection of  the Senator from Alaska, I can see no  alternative but to simply",1989
369,609,7,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, will  the leader withhold? I just wanted to  clarify the situation before the majori ty leader withdrew his unanimous-con sent request.  I heard most of what the Senator  from Alaska said but did not hear the  end. It was not my understanding that  he was going to object to the unani mous-consent request. Am I wrong?  ",1989
370,609,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," The Senator  from Alaska has indicated his willing ness to try to ensure that I was given  an opportunity to bring up my resolu tion which would be nonam.endable.  While,  obviously,  the  sequence  of  events is within the authority of the  leadership, I was under the impression  it would be after the disposition of the  Dixon amendment. I am not quite sure  whether I understand the reason why  the leader is unable to make that par ticular assurance.  ",1989
371,609,7,Mr. MITCHELL.," Because I do not  know whether or not there is any Sen ator who might object to my agreeing  to bring up the Senator's resolution.  This is a similar situation to when, if  someone  here were  asking me  to  commit to bringing up a resolution to  which the Senator might have objec tion but the Senator was not here, the  Senator would, of course, want some one to interpose that objection.  I do not know. I am advised by the  staff now that the Senator's resolution  is not germane to the pending resolu tion of disapproval, and, therefore, as  with the resolution of the senior Sena tor  from Alaska,  the  distingished  junior Senator from Alaska could not  bring his resolution up with respect to  the pending resolution in any event.  So he does not lose anything by this  unanimous-consent  request,  and he  gains a possibility. It is difficult for me  to understand the reason for objecting  under those circumstances.  ",1989
372,609,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," With all due re spect, I think what we are asking for is  the same consideration given Senator  BYRD in the manner in which his reso lution is being given an opportunity to  have the assurance of a vote.  ",1989
373,609,7,Mr. MITCHELL., The difference  is  this: Senator BYRD'S resolution is rele vant to the underlying Dixon resolu tion. He could off er it as an amend ment to the pending Dixon resolution  any time he chooses. He has agreed to  forbear from doing so to permit a vote  on the Dixon resolution so long as he  gains the ability to have his resolution  voted on should the Dixon resolution  fail. The distinguished Senator from  Alaska is not in a comparable position.  The Parliamentarian  has  indicated  that  the  resolution  of  the  distin guished Senator from Alaska  is not  relevant. The Senator from Alaska is  not in the position to off er it as an  amendment.  ,1989
374,609,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," In the spirit of  cooperation,  I would be willing,  in  spite of the fact that I disagree with  the Parliamentarian's  interpretation  that a  third  country being named  eliminates it from the appropriate pro cedure, to eliminate the name of the  Third World country so it would con form if that would expedite the lead er's efforts to proceed with this be cause, as the leader is well aware, I  was a party to the discussion earlier in  previous days, and we have proceeded  through the Foreign Relations Com mittee in the manner in which is gen erally prescribed. And in the spirit of  cooperation we almost had a vote on  Senator BYRD'S amendment as well as  my own. Unfortunately, the quorum  seemed to have vanished at the last  minute.  So, if the leader would consider that,  I would am.end my resolution to con form with the Parliamentarian.  29-059 0-90-20 (Pt. 7)  ",1989

377,661,7,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, today I  begin a series of discussions on the  House floor concerning work by the  Armed Services Committee, and par ticularly the Panel on Military Educa tion, which I had the honor to chair  over the past year.  I might give some background and  history of it and do some initial discus sion because this has been a very im portant piece of work by the Armed  Services Committee and will have far reaching and long-lasting positive ef fects on our military.  Mr. Speaker, on November 13, 1987  the House Armed Services Committee  chairman,  the gentleman from Wis consin CMr. AsPIN]  established  this  Panel on Military Education and he  appointed  this speaker as chairman  and  seven  other members  of  the  Armed Services Committee on this bi partisan panel. The creation of this  panel  signified  recognition by Con gress that rigorous high quality pro fessional military education is vital to  the national security. It is an inves ment in the future military leadership  for both war and peace.  The committee  interest  in profes sional military education  is a direct  consequence of its earlier work from  1982 until 1986 on the defense reorga nization issue. This culminated with  the passage of what is now known as  the Goldwater-Nichols Department of  Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.  Congress reached back on the lessons  concerning  the  importance of  joint  military operations and implemented  those in the Goldwater-Nichols Act.  The primary objective of that 1986  Act is to strengthen the joint elements  of the military, especially the Chair man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and  the Commanders in Chief, also known  as CINC's, of the Combat Commands.  The primary method of that act is to  change organizations and their respon sibilities. The organizational changes  are found in title II, Military Advice  and Command Function, which desig nated  the Chairman of  the  Joint  Chiefs of Staff as the principal mili tary adviser to the President and the  National Security Council and the Sec retary of Defense. It gave the Com manders in Chief, or the CINC's, as we  call  them, clear comm.and authority  over subordinate commands and forces  assigned.  Now, Mr. Speaker, in order to bene fit  fully  from  these  organizational  changes, Congress believes it had to  II,  improve  the performance of officers  assigned  to  joint elements. The  re quired  personnel  changes  are  con tained in title IV of that 1986 act, enti tled ""Joint Officer Personnel Policy.""  Those personnel changes are designed  to insure quality in two related fac tors, both experience and education.  This study conducted by our panel  focuses on education. Education is im portant, both for  learning facts and  for  affecting  attitudes,  as well  as  values.  Specifically,  joint  education  can  broaden an officer's knowledge beyond  his own military service in joint multi service matters and can help the offi cer develop a joint perspective.  Using educational change to supple ment  and  reinforce  organizational  change  is not unique  to  the Gold water-Nichols Act.  Back in 1898, the Spanish-American  War made it clear that the Army's or ganization suffered from divided au thority,  that it could not meet  the  20th-century needs.  Secretary of War Roots established  the Army War College in 1901, and by  1903 had legislation creating a Chief  of Staff and the Army General Staff.  All  three changes  increased  integra tion of the Army.  After World War  the  Joint  Schools were established; namely, the  National War College and the Indus trial College of the Armed Forces in  1946 and the Armed Forces Staff Col lege in 1947, which is located in Nor folk, VA.  Further, the National Security Act  of 1947, later amended in 1949, created  the Secretary and Department of De fense  and  formally  established  the  Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Again, both organizational and edu cational steps were unifying ones.  Military  leaders are not  the only  ones who have emphasized the impor tance of military education. Winston  Churchill, among others, made it clear  about the importance of military edu cation and how  the military officer  was educated to successfully prosecute  World War II.  This panel, appointed by Chairman  ASPIN, was asked to review the overall  professional military personnel of our  Nation, and that we did. The panel's  charter, setup by the chairman, asked  that we study two areas of profession al military education. The first was to  assess the ability of the current De partment of Defense military educa tion  system  to develop professional  military strategists, joint war fighters  and tacticians.  Along this line, I became quite con cerned a  little over a year ago and  made a series of five speeches on strat egy and the need to educate future  American strategists, and out of those  speeches  came  this panel  and our  charter.  The second was  to review the De partment of Defense plans for imple menting  the  joint professional mili tary  educational  requirements  set  forth  in  title  IV of  the Goldwater Nichols Act with a view toward assur ing that this education provides the  proper  linkage between  the  service  competent  officers  and  competent  joint officers.  The third area of  inquiry,  though  not specifically stated, but was quite  implicit  in the terms of the panel's  charter and also explicit upon exami nation, was  the area of quality. Ac cordingly,  the  report  addresses  all  three of  these  areas, Mr. Speaker:  strategy, jointness and quality.  The scope of the study was to deter mine where to concentrate our efforts.  The panel had to relate the areas of  its examination to  levels of existing  professional  military  education  schools. The first level of military edu cation, precommissioning education, is  accomplished in service academies and  the ROTC Corps, which are units of  civilian colleges and the officer candi date schools.  D 1230  There are levels of military educa tion after the commissioning. The first  is the primary level where courses are  normally attended within the first 8  years after commissioning, and they  are focused on the officers' branch for  specialties such as armor, infantry, ar tillery, submarines, and the like. The  second  level  is  that of  intermediate  level, and the courses there are nor mally attended between the 10th and  the 15th year of service when the offi cer  is a major  in the Army or Air  Force or lieutenant commander in the  Navy or major in the Marines, and at  the Army Intermediate School at Fort  Leavenworth, the primary focus is not  on how a single branch operates but  on how various branches such as in fantry and armor and artillery fight  together in what they call combined  arms as a  team. The third level, the  senior level, are courses normally at tended between the 16th and 23d year  of service when the officer is a lieuten ant colonel or colonel or a Navy com mander or captain. While the curricu la vary,  the war colleges generally  study about operational art and strate gy.  The three service war colleges, the  two  joint colleges, the National War  College and the Industrial College of  the Armed Forces make up the senior  category  of  schools.  The Marine  Corps, I might point out at this point,  has no senior school, but it does a  good job of sending its officers to the  other senior schools.  There is a fourth level known as the  general officer or flag officer  level,  and the services created short courses  for flag officers, and by the 1980's, it  ",1989
378,687,7,Mr. HAMIL TON.," Mr. Speaker, I recently co sponsored  several environmental protection  bills which I believe should be enacted in the  101 st Congress. We need to take immediate  steps to address pressing national and global  environmental  threats. We need  to become  more familiar with the environmental problems  we face, and take action to maintain and re store  the quality of our environment. The  United States should recognize the benefits of  protecting our natural  resources, and  regain  its world  leadership  in environmental protec tion.  I urge my colleagues to act promptly and fa vorably on the following bills:  H.R. 37, National Ground Water Contami nation Research Act of 1989. This bill au thorizes a  comprehensive  federal ground  water research effort by the U.S. Geological  Survey,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency, and the Department of Agriculture.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  It would coordinate these efforts under a  Ground Water Research Committee.  H.R. 104, Volunteer House Recycling Pro gram. This bill would instruct the Architect  of the Capitol to design a volunteer pro gram for House of Representatives offices  to separate trash by source.  H.R. 683,  the Agricultural Commodity based Plastics Development Act of 1989.  This bill would promote the development of  degradable plastic by requiring the Govern ment to identify products that can be made  of degradable plastic and encouraging feder al procurement of these products.  H.R. 876. American Heritage Trust Fund.  This bill would  create  a  self-supporting  trust fund federal, state, and local land ac quisition  for parks,  forests,  refuges,  and  other public lands.  H.R. 980, Global Environment Research  and Policy Act of 1989. This bill would co ordinate existing federal research to give us  a better understanding of the possible ef fects of global warming. It would require  federal agencies to consider the global con sequences of their actions, and would estab lish a Council on Global Environmental  Policy to analyze and recommend national  policies for handling the impacts of global  warming.  H.R. 1087, the Scenic Byways Study Act  of 1989. This bill would instruct the Trans portation Secretary to conduct an inventory  of all roadways in the United States that  could be classified as scenic or historic. This  would provide the basis for a cooperative  program between federal, state and  local  governments designed to  identify, protect,  and enhance our Nation's scenic and histor ic roads, placing a special emphasis on pres ervation.  H.R.  1216,  the Renewable Energy and  Energy Efficiency Technology Competitive ness Act of 1989. This bill would improve  the competitiveness of American renewable  energy  technologies by requiring  the De partment of Energy to enter into joint ven tures with industry involving such technol ogies. The bill would also establish perform ance goals for renewable energy research  programs and provide stable authorization   levels for those programs.  H.R. 1268, the National Biological Diversi ty Conservation  and Environmental Re search Act. This bill would establish a na tional policy for conserving biological diver sity and create a National Center for Biolog ical Diversity Research. It would also make  biological diversity an explicit part of the  environmental impact statement process.  H.R. 1457, Waste Reduction Act. This bill  would provide  technical assistance  to  the  states to promote waste reduction in private  industry.  It would  improve  collection of  data  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency and assist states in reducing sources  of pollution.  H.R. 1746, Wetlands No Net Loss Act of  1989. This bill would authorize the creation  of a nonprofit Wetlands Preservation Trust  to acquire wetlands and former wetlands to  ensure their preservation and restoration. It  would also establish a wetlands office within  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Other  federal agencies would be required to con duct an  inventory of  the wetlands areas  they own or manage and to prepare a man agement plan for the preservation and en hancement of those areas.  9151  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

380,687,7,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, it is a rare occa sion when we, as Members of Congress, have  an opportunity to bring to the attention of our  colleagues and their respective constituencies  a person who has truly devoted himself to the  betterment of the  individual,  the  family, and  the community. Such an  individual  is Father  Edward Walsh of the First Congressional Dis trict in New Jersey.  Ordained a priest  in  the Roman Catholic  Church in 1964, Father Walsh has consistent ly responded to the needs of his parishioners  and neighbors with  thoughtfulness and com passion. On May 21,  the people he  has  served so well will have an opportunity to pay  tribute to him upon the occasion of his silver  jubilee.  Father Walsh's efforts are centered  in nu merous civic and  religious organizations that  serve virtually every age group and region in  southern New Jersey. From  the Community  Planning and Advocacy Council to the United  Way, Father Walsh has proven to be an advo cate of those individuals truly in need. He is  the embodiment of those Judea-Christian prin ciples we all respect and admire.  As public servants, we can certainly appre ciate the importance of the role he plays in his  church and community. We in government are  keenly aware of the need for quality individ ual's participation  in  the  administration  of  public programs. Father Walsh is that individ ual and I commend him for his selfless efforts.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that my col leagues join with me in praising Father Walsh  and wishing him much success and happiness  in the many years to come.

382,700,7,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, we are  back to the discussion of the resolu tion of disapproval of  the so-called  FSX deal with Japan.  There was a great deal of intriguing  debate last week as it related to the  reasons  for  this particular arrange ment with Japan. There was a lot of  concern I think expressed by Members  of this body why we should spend $7  billion of the taxpayers' money to de velop  the finest military aircraft  in  the world, and then we make arrange ments with a country that has a defi cit  in balance of  trade with us of  roughly $50 billion a year, and that we  have prospects of getting somewhere  in the neighborhood of $400 million  for a $7 billion investment.  I have never heard in the 14 years I  have been in the Senate an attempt to  substantiate a deal by some of my col leagues whose hearts are not in the  position  they are being  required  to  take. As most of us know, this arrange ment was made under the previous ad ministration. This administration does  not like it. This administration made  an attempt to change it. Some high of ficials in this administration testifying  before the committees indicated that  the deal was already made, that we  were already boxed  into  the comer  and so let us go on with it.  Well, that left Congress out of the  loop. At least we have an opportunity  to debate it. We have an opportunity  to look at the facts. We have an oppor tunity to look at the long-term effect  on this country, our industry, and our  working men and women.  Japan spends about $35 billion a  year on defense, whereas the United  States spends nine times that amount.  One would, therefore, hope that the  country  of  Japan would  carefully  spend their apparent small defense resources. This arrangement does not  appear to be so.  Instead of buying 130 F-16's for  about $3 billion,  they are going  to  spend $1.2 billion on development, $8  billion on production, a  total of ap proximately $9 billion. That is three  times what the same number of F-16's  would cost. There has to be a reason  for this type of arrangement and this  kind of expenditure from a country  that the world has recognized as an  economic power because of its ability  to produce.  It is also possible that the cost of de velopment will triple the stated Japa nese estimate, or it would go to $3.6  billion instead of $1.2 billion in the de velopment phase. How can any propo nent of the FSX justify the extra $5  to $8 billion cost of the FSX in light of  scarce defense resources on both sides  of the Pacific? Do not forget that this  money will be spent while the Depart ment of Defense will be trying to get  the Japanese to spend more money an nually to meet our common defense  goals. Proponents of  the FSX also  tried to  justify the program on the  grounds that a 40-percent work share  of development will earn General Dy namics $480 million, and the roughly  40 percent work share of production  will be around $2 billion for a total of  $2.5 billion. They say that this amount  is close  to  the $3  billion  that GD  would have gotten if the Japanese had  bought the plane off the shelf.  That is strange. We are saying that  General Dynamics is the only one in vovled in this and so by lettting the  Japanese develop  the FSX General  Dynamics will still get almost as much  as they would have gotten had they  sold this plane off the shelf.  Let us go back and think a minute  what are the reasons for wanting to  participate in an arrangement that is  so bad, apparently, that it would cost  the country of Japan so much more  money than if they were just buying  the airplane for defense. I think every one agrees that the F-16 is the best  and most sophisticated military air craft in the world. There has to be a  reason.  Let us think a minute about General  Dynamics and their profit and what  labor people have decided. They say  the short-term gain is a long-term loss.  The President of the union that repre sents 40,000-some workers at General  Electric, William H. Bywater, stated:  The net effect of this deal will be to give  Japan a leg up in another vital industry re sulting in the loss of jobs for U.S. workers  who have built the U.S. aerospace industry  to the strongest industry of its kind in the  world.  He goes on to say:  Likewise, it misses the boat in its failure  to hold out for full production of the FSX  in the United States of America as a down  payment by Japan on longstanding commit ments to bring down the $55 billion annual  trade bonanza it enjoys over this country.  It is my opinion that the union is  not  fooled one bit by  the  fleeting  promise of 40 percent of a temporary and I underscore ""temporary"" -work load. They understand  the  tradeoff,  and  they  understand  it well. The  tradeoff is short-term gain and long term loss. Why do we on Capitol Hill  not understand what the working men  and women of this country understand  very well?  Let me make another point or two.  The argument of not buying the F16's off the shelf ignores the fact that  the  Japanese  are going  to waste really, are they going to waste it-bil lions of additional dollars reinventing  the F-16.  It also ignores the fact that, if Japan  bought off  the shelf,  it would also  have to buy all spare parts for the life  of the Aircraft Program. They would  have  to buy  them from  the United  States and parts made by American  workers.  Spare parts cost two to three times  the original purchase  price. Think  about that. So if the purchase price is  X, we are going to receive Y in spare  parts. I think we are giving up double  here, maybe  triple.  It  is  another  whammy on  the working men and  women of this country, and it is an in crease in our deficit as it relates to bal ance of trade.  So  the  total F-16 buy  from  the  United States would be about $12 bil lion over the life of this program. The  guarantee of $2.5 billion falls far short  of the $12 billion that a buy would  generate.  We hear the argument, ""Oh, they  will buy it from somebody else. They  will  enter  into  a  consortium with  somebody else.""  Well, if they are going to buy some thing inferior, I doubt seriously that  they would want to enter into those  contracts. They cannot make the deal  with anyone else apparently, or they  do not want to make the arrangement  with someone else. They want to make  it with good old Uncle Sugar so we can  spend more taxpayers' money and lose  more American jobs.  Over  the  last  few years we have  given away $1  trillion in deficit and  balance  of  trade,  and millions  of  American  jobs. And we are standing  here today proposing to do more of  the same. What is in the deal for the  United States? Let us look at it for a  minute. What is in this deal for us?  The proponents claim  that  there  is  access to advanced Japanese technolo gy. Well, Japan is good at promoting,  and  they are always promoting and  proclaiming  their so-called advanced  technology.  But let us be honest. The Japanese  have not been major players  in the  aerospace  industry. In order to find  out if there was in fact advanced Japa nese technology to be gained, several  ",1989
383,713,7,Mr. CHAFEE.," We have a very inter esting  proposal  here,  that because  somebody does not buy our product we  think they ought to buy, we turn to  them and say, ""All right; if you won't  buy our product which we think you  ought to buy and we say it is a very  fine product, therefore we are going to  prevent you from selling other prod ucts here in the United States.""  Mr. D'AMATO. That is a question of  fairness and fair play. Is that not the  principle of which we talk about free  trade and fair trade? Is that not the  underlying principle? Do we not have  reciprocity, or is it just free trade and  fair trade when you are allowed to sell  your products here, but when we have  something that is superior, you say,  ""Oh, no; we are going to do our own.""  I do not think that is free trade and  fair trade. If you want to call me a  protectionist for saying let us see to it  that these principles are adhered to,  then  I  take  the burden and  I will  accept that label. But I do not think  that is being protectionist.  ",1989
384,713,7,Mr. CHAFEE.," That is an unusual  definition of not being protectionist,  but I will point out to the Senator in  addition,  if his proposals were  fol lowed, we would be violating treaties  that we ourselves have entered into.  Maybe he wants to brush right by that  and is not concerned. But we are start ing down, I think, a very slippery path.

385,713,7,Mr. LEVIN.,"  If the Senator  from  Rhode Island will yield, how is that  any different from Super 301 where  we say if you will not buy our telecom munications or you will not buy our  auto parts or you will not buy this and  that, we then have the right to put  some restrictions on your VCR's, your  cars, and your cameras? They are dif ferent products, but we authorize the  President  in his Super 301-to put  pressure on the President-to finally  respond  to  Japanese unfair  trading  practices, and that is  the gut  issue  here.  They  should buy our F-16's and  there is a way to make them buy our  F-16's. That is  to  tell the Japanese  that if they will not buy our product  that we can make cheaper and better  than  they can-and  the F-16  is  a  cheaper, better product that can be  made more quickly than the FSX-if  they will not buy the product that we  can make more  efficiently, more  cheaply, and more quickly  to meet  their military needs, then we are going  to have to place some restrictions on  our goods because we need a two-way  street in trade.  We are not beginning down a slip pery slope. We have slid down a slip pery slope. We are at the bottom of  that slope. We have a $40 billion trade  deficit.  I am not mad at the Japanese. This  is not Japan-bashing. I am mad at us. I  am mad at us because we will not act  to protect our own economy and our  own jobs.  So,  f oc'us  the  fire  right here on  Washington.

387,713,7,Mr. LEVIN., Is the Senator saying  there is no unfairness in the area of  trade?  ,1989
388,713,7,Mr. CHAFEE.," The Senator's inter pretation of 301 was certainly a highly  unusual one. I am somewhat familiar  with it, having been involved with that  for a number of years. But the inter pretation that the Senator has given  to it is somewhat broader than Super  301 is. But all I am saying is those who  are out there objecting to this deal  ought to come up with a solution.  I think whoever worked this deal out  did a good job. They came from a situ ation where people were not going to  buy it at all, are going to manufacture  their own, and worked it up until we  are now getting 40 percent of  the  work. That is a pretty good deal,  I  would  say,  and whoever  bargained  that, I think, should be commended.  I urge that we vote down this resolu tion of disapproval.  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

It is tempting to sup port the resolution of disapproval for  the wrong reasons-reasons that color  our view of Japan generally  rather  than reasons  that relate directly  to  the proposed FSX agreement.  One such reason is my longstanding  concern over the dangers of handing  over  critical  technology  to  trading  partners who will have little hesitation  in using it to compete against us later  on.  In a  perfect world,  technology  would flow freely  in both directions,  but, Mr. President, we do not live in  such a world, and the Japanese clearly  do not live in such a world. If we are to  preserve  our  competitive  edge, we  must preserve critical technologies. It  is as simple as that, and much of my  ",1989

That would be  accommodating from  this manager's  standpoint.  ",1989
408,739,7,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection? Without objection, it  is so ordered.  The Senator from New Jersey.  ",1989
409,739,7,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr.  President,  I  off er my apologies to the manager of  the bill for coming in at this time with  a  request, but I had no alternative,  and I thank them for their courtesy.  Mr. President, I wish to make a few  points about this issue. We have heard  that what the Japanese should do is to  buy an F-16-that is the answer-and  that there are American jobs at stake.  Well, the fact of the matter is that if  the Japanese bought an F-16,  they  would not be purchasing an F-16 until  1995 or 1996, because the purpose of  the new plane is  to meet the fourth  generation Soviet aircraft and to pro tect the sealanes out 1,000 miles from  Japan.  So  the argument  that you should  buy an F-16 will produce no  jobs in  the United States  in 1989,  in 1990,  1991 or 1992 or 1993 or 1994. That is  point No. 1. If you go the F-16 route,  no  jobs  are  created  in  the United  States until 1995, 1996 or maybe 1997.  So let us put that issue aside.  The choice is between, really, code velopment of the FSX or the Japanese  development of it by themselves. That  is the only choice. When the Japanese  looked at  their needs  for  the  late  1990's, the early 21st century,  they  saw they needed an aircraft that had a  shorter takeoff, greater missile loading  and longer-range capability than the  F-16. They decided that the F-16 was  not a sufficiently capable plane, and  that they should develop  their own  plane not only  to meet  their own  needs but also to meet common needs,  identified by  the United States,  for  them to def end their sealanes out to  1,000 miles. So they decided to build  their own plane. We then came in and  said, ""Do not build your own plane.  Let us codevelop it with you."" The de cision was taken to go ahead with co development. That means  develop ment in this country and more jobs in  this country. To decide no, as the reso lution of disapproval, would mean no  more  jobs. So, Mr. President, let us  face the question of jobs up front.  Next, there is a fear expressed that  if we go through with this deal, it will  mean greater development of the Jap anese aerospace  industry. Mr. Presi dent,  I submit that if the Japanese  have to go their own way, have to de velop all their research and develop ment capabilities themselves, have to  go down all those blind alleys that we  have gone down from time to time and  find out all those things that you find  out only when you design a fighter air craft entirely on your own,  that 10  years  from now  the Japanese aero space industry would be further ahead  than if we codevelop it with them.  So, Mr. President, I argue that the  Japanese aerospace industry, 10 years  from now, will be  further ahead  if  they develop the FSX themselves that  if we codevelop it with them.  The next point: Who in Japan would  like to see them develop the airplane  alone?  I  know  one  company  that  would, Mitsubishi.  In  the  political  debate in Japan they were vociferous  in saying that ""We want to develop  the plane ourselves; we do not want  codevelopment  with  the  United  States."" So here in the U.S. Senate, if  the disapproval resolution is approved,  we  say,  ""Mitsubishi, you have won,  you will be the prime contractor; you  develop it yourself. We are out of the  ball game."" We are not in the room  learning; we are not in the room shar ing. We are out.  So, Mr. President,  the next point:  We have heard on this floor through out this debate  that this  is a  trade  issue. Mr. President, the problem is a  trade imbalance. The way out of that  imbalance is not cutting back imports,  but expanding exports. We have a pro vision in the trade bill, Super 301, that  allows us to expand exports to Japan,  to get across to the Japanese market.  That is the place where we should ad dress the trade issue, not on an agree ment that was signed in 1987, deliv ered  in 1988 by one President,  re viewed and renegotiated by another  President. His Commerce Department,  State Department, and Defense De partment all signed on the line. We  should not reject the President.  Mr. President, one other point: A  question has been made about  the  ability of Japan to protect any tech nology. Let me submit that post-Toshi ba, the Japanese put in an export con",1989

I  just say  this, Mr. President, briefly,  I  think  this is an unfortunate amendment. I  just do not understand quite why it is  being presented. I have heard the dis cussions on both sides. It seems to levy  the most extraordinary requirements  in here and says that the Secretary of  Commerce, when he has reason to be lieve that any such memorandum of  understanding has an adverse effect,  shall recommend to the President any  modification he deems necessary.  I mean, if we have ever had a case of  micromanagement, this is  it. We are  determining what  the Secretary of  Commerce's relationships will be with  the President of the United States; a  person who he is serving under and  subject to.  I  just do not understand why this  amendment is being brought forward.  I would hope it would not prevail. I  have heard  the  arguments  of our  leader on  the Republican side,  the  view of  the  administration on  this  amendment. It is going to make life,  certainly, more difficult for them.  And I further understand, am I not  correct, and I would ask  the distin guished Senator from Indiana, when  they get to the production agreement,  then do they not have to come up with  a further memorandum of understand ing and get the approval of that in the  Senate of the United States?

It will delay the whole thing,  exacerbate  our  relationships  with  Japan unnecessarily  and  the  point  they are trying to make here will be  taken care of subsequently when we  get to the approval of the memoran dum of understanding on the produc tion agreement.

439,765,7,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I want to commend the propo nents of this resolution for their broad  exposition of the troubling issues sur rounding the FSX codevelopment ar rangement entered into between the  United States and Japan. They have  presented cogent and well-reasoned ar guments as to why the United States  should hesitate before entering into a  technology  transfer arrangement of  the proportions of the agreement cur rently before us.  And I want to commend the oppo nents of this resolution for placing the  FSX arrangement in a broader geopo litical perspective and for their forth right response to the many concerns  that everyone of us in this body have  concerning  this  transaction. On bal ance, this has been one of the most  elucidating and important debates we  have had in the Senate in many years.  Mr. President, before casting their  votes, I urge my colleagues to consider  precisely the nature of the issue that  we will soon vote on, and the forseea ble  consequences  that will  surely  result if this codevelopment arrange ment  is disapproved or  if  it  is  ap proved. In that context, I would point  out that the  issue before us  is not  whether  the  Japanese  should  pur chase  the General Dynamics F-16  fighter aircraft off the shelf as part of  its effort  to upgrade  its air defense  forces. That is not the issue currently  being debated and was never a viable  option.  The  reason  the Government  of  Japan decided to upgrade its air de fense forces is because it made a com mitment  earlier  in  this decade,  to  assume primary responsibility for pro tecting  Japanese  airspace,  coastal  waters, and sea  lanes out  to  1,000  miles. In deciding what fighter would  be most suitable for this task well into  the next century, the Japanese Gov ernment has always considered only  two development options. The  first  option, strongly supported by Japa nese defense contractors, was to manu facture an entirely new fighter air craft relying exclusively on Japanese  domestic  technology.  The  second  option considered was to develop joint ly with the United States a modified  version of the F-15, F-16, or F-18, or  to codevelop a modified version of the  British Tornado fighter in conjunction  with the West Germans and the Ital ians.  In 1987, when evidence began  to  mount that the Government of Japan  was leaning strongly toward the go-it alone first option, the Government of  the United States entered into a series  of high level negotiations in an effort  to convince  the Japanese  to  instead  agree to joint development of a new  fighter aircraft using a United States  fighter as  the basis for  the project.  Bowing to United States pressure, the  Japanese in October 1987, announced  that it would forego domestic develop ment of a new fighter and instead de cided to spend approximately $6 bil lion developing an advanced version of  an American fighter, namely the F-16.  After more than a year of negotia tions  aimed  at  implementing  the  memorandum of  agreement CMOUJ  between  the  two  countries,  the  Reagan administration  finalized  the  agreement  in  late  1988.  However,  when questions arose concerning some  of  the  technology  proposed  to  be  transferred, and the exact share of the  project that would be awarded to the  American subcontractor, the new ad ministration  successfully  sought  to  reopen the agreement.  I am convinced that the final pack age negotiated between the two coun tries is a significant improvement over  the original agreement by not only  protecting sensitive computer software  source codes, but also ensuring that  American industry will receive a fair  percentage of the development work  associated with this project.  Mr. President, what should be emi nently clear today is that the agree ment that we are debating is an agree ment that was: First, actively sought  and pursued by the United States Gov ernment and the U.S. defense contrac tors who will participate  in a  large  share of the project; and second, re opened and  renegotiated at  the  re quest of the U.S. Government.  I ask my colleagues the simple ques tion: ""What will happen if we disap prove this agreement that was initiat ed at our request?"" Japan's vast finan cial resources and advanced technolog ical expertise guarantee that it will  not turn around and decide  to pur chase  off-the-shelf  F-16's.  It will  either begin to develop and produce  the FSX on its own, or it will seek to  collaborate with  the advanced aero space companies in Western Europe to  develop another version of the FSX.  In either case, one thing is certain: De fense contractors in the United States  and thousands of their employees will  not  receive  a  single  dollar  of  the  nearly $3 billion in development work  that can be expected from this agree ment. That money will either stay in  Japan or be funneled to our European  aerospace competitors.  Mr. President, I have heard many ar guments  in  the past week  that the  FSX arrangement is a one-sided give away of American technology that will  ultimately build the foundation of a  vigorous Japanese competitor to the  American  aerospace  industry.  Al though I have some misgivings about  sharing some of our most advanced  aerospace  technology with the Japa nese,  I am not that concerned that  this agreement  is  such  a  one-sided  giveaway.  In the first place, the Japanese will  license  the F-16C  block  40  design  which is a second generation redesign  of the 1978 version of the fighter. I  would note that this is not even the  most advanced version of  the F-16,  since General Dynamics  is currently  developing a block 50 design that con tains even more advanced electronic  systems than the block 40. Moreover,  our defense contractors are currently  developing far more sophisticated and  advanced fighter aircraft than the F16, specifically the Stealth F-19 fight er, which will ensure U.S. preeminence  in military aircraft technology for the  foreseeable future.  More importantly, this is not a one way deal that only benefits the Japa nese. The time is long gone when the  United States can believe that it holds  a monopoly on all high technology de velopment  and production.  In  fact,  there are several areas where experts  would concede that the United States  can learn many lessons from the J apa nese about how to produce high tech nology products more efficiently and  effectively. I believe the United States  may turn out to learn as much from  this arrangement about high technolo gy production as  the Japanese will  learn about aircraft production from  the agreement.  For example, we will  surely gain  many insights into Japan's technologi cal advantages in composite technol ogies and phased array radars. More  importantly, the Japanese have agreed  to  return  any  improvements  they  make in the production process at no  charge  to  the United States and  to  make available any original Japanese  technology used in the FSX develop ment project  that is specifically  re quested and paid for. In effect,  this  agreement may well serve to improve  United States military aerospace tech nology and production  through  the  transfer from the Japanese of much of  their commercial manufacturing and  electronics expertise.  Mr. President, this morning the De fense Department released a report in dicating that the Japanese currently  have a significant lead in developing 6  of 22 technologies that the Pentagon  considers crucial to national security  and the long-term qualitative superior ity of American weapons systems. For  example, the report found that Japan  is ahead of the United States in cer tain areas of microelectronic circuitry  and integrated optics.  Certainly if these rapidly developing  technologies are incorporated into the  FSX, the United States will be able to  ",1989
440,778,7,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  introduce for appropriate reference a  bill to amend section Be of the Agricul tural Adjustment Act, reenacted with  amendments by the Agricultural Mar keting Agreement Act of 1937, to add  kiwi fruit, peaches, pears, nectarines,  and plums to the list of imported com modities  that must meet minimum  quality standards of domestically pro duced fruits, vegetables, and specialty  crops.  The Agricultural Marketing Agree ment Act  authorizes producers and  handlers of fruits, vegetables, and spe cialty crops to enter into an agreement  with the Secretary of Agriculture to  develop programs to stabilize and im prove markets  for  their  products.  These programs, known as marketing  orders, can be put into effect only if  approved by a majority of the produc ers of the commodity in a producer  referendum. Once approved, however,  all producers and handlers  in a de fined production area are subject to  the provisions of the marketing order.  The marketing orders can include col lection of uniform assessments to fund  production and marketing  research,  generic  advertising  and  promotion,  regulation to assure orderly flows  to  market, and minimum quality stand ards for products commercially sold.  Currently some 50 agricultural com modities, including kiwi fruit, peaches,  pears, nectarines, and plums, are mar keted under the provisions of a mar keting order. The Federal marketing  order for kiwi fruit was established in  19B4. It provides for minimum grade,  size, and maturity requirements. Cali fornia fresh pears, plums, and peaches  have  operated  under  a marketing  order since the 1940's. A separate mar keting order for nectarines was estab lished in 195B. The marketing orders  for these four fruits also provide for  minimum  quality  standards.  These  minimum  quality  provisions  ensure  that consumers receive a high quality  product and help enhance  industry  sales.  However, efforts by a domestic in dustry  to market only high quality  produce under the auspices of a mar keting order can be severely undercut  by imports of a like commodity that is  of  inferior quality. Consumers often  cannot  distinguish  between  fresh  fruits and vegetables that are domesti cally grown and those that are import ed. Section Be of the Agricultural Mar keting Agreement Act  provides  a  remedy to this problem by providing  that  if  domestic  producers  adopt  through a marketing order a plan to  establish minimum quality standards  for a particular commodity, then the  imported commodity marketed domes tically must also meet these minimum  quality standards. Section Be thus en sures quality consistency and benefits  domestic and foreign producers equal ly to the extent that the market is en hanced  through  improved  product  quality.  Currently there are 20 agricultural  commodities  being marketed  under  the auspices of section Be. California  kiwi fruit, peach, pear, nectarine, and  plum growers are asking  that  their  products be added to this list of sec tion Be crops. The State's kiwi fruit in dustry is relatively new and the kiwi  fruit market is heavily dominated by  ",1989
441,869,7,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like to join the chairman in support of  this bill which would permit the FAA to reim burse an airport sponsor for expenditures in curred as part of  the airport's  federally ap proved Airport Noice Compatibility Program.  This bill will encourage airport sponsors to  spend money up  front  for noise abatement  knowing  that at some point  in  the  future,  these expenditures may be reimbursed out of  the airport and airway trust fund. As  I under stand it, the legislation would establish no pri orities for funding but would have the effect of  expediting expenditures for noise abatement.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",1989
442,869,7,Mr.  KLECZKA.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  the  House is considering H.R. 968, a bill providing  Federal cost  reimbursement of  local airport  noise abatement projects.  This  legislation  is necessary because air plane noise control  is a growing concern of  airports and their neighbors. With ever-greater  air traffic and increasingly sophisticated meth ods of noise abatement available, projects  which minimize this annoying form of pollution  should be expedited.  H.R. 968 permits the Department of Trans portation to award grants from the airport and  airway trust fund to airports for noise control  projects after work on  such a project has  begun. This would allow airports to start work  on these efforts while being reimbursed at a  later date  if Federal  funding  is not currently  available.  Under current  law, an airport may not re ceive Federal funding for noise abatement if it  has already begun work on a project before a  grant is awarded. Reforming this counter-pro ductive procedure would provide greater effi ciency in the use of Federal airport noise con trol dollars.  H.R. 968 is not a budget buster either; ac cording  to  the Congressional Budget Office,  the enactment of this measure will result in no  additional costs to the Federal Government.  I have been assisting Milwaukee's General  Mitchell  International Airport  in my Fourth  Congressional District of Wisconsin with sev eral noise abatement projects. However, air ports cannot be expected to bear the burden  of noise control on their own. By cutting red tape  through  legislation such as  this, we  in  Congress can assist in this process.  I urge my colleagues to join constructively in  the war against airport noise by voting  for  H.R. 968.  ",1989
443,869,7,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support  of H.R. 968 which would enable airport au thorities to receive reimbursements for airport  improvement  projects  aimed  at  reducing  noise.  I support noise mitigation efforts and  believe project  reimbursements are entirely  appropriate. While this bill addresses some of  the funding concerns of airports, other noise  issues remain.  In my city of San Francisco, overflight noise  continues to be a very serious problem. I have  urged  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  [FAA]  to consider alternatives which would  route flights away from the city. The FAA re sponse  has  been  less  than  satisfactory flights over San Francisco have not been re duced nor rerouted.  San Francisco has a strong local noise miti gation policy and  the city has made every  effort to comply with Federal regulations. Re gardless, the FAA has withheld important Fed eral airport improvement funding because of  perceived noncompliance with Federal noise  regulations.  I am concerned about this lack of concern  and cooperation by the FAA. The fact is, Mr.  Speaker, that the FAA has rot jeveloped na tional noise mitigation guide'  .10' ;. This inaction  now makes it necessary for tte Congress to  step in and develop a national policy on air craft noise. Such a policy should incorporate  the concerns of airport communities such as  San Francisco, which are most heavily impact ed by aircraft noise.  This issue of aircraft noise is of major con cern to the citizens of San Francisco and I am  pleased  that the  topic  is being discussed  in  Congress today.  I urge members of the Avia tion Subcommittee to develop a national noise  policy and  I also urge my colleagues to sup port the legislation before us today.  ",1989
444,869,7,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support today of H.R. 968,  the Airport Noise  Abatement Cost Reimbursement Act.  I would  like  to commend my good  friend and col league, Chairman GLENN ANDERSON, and the  members of his committee for their effort in  bringing  this  important  legislation before  the  Congress.  Under current law, airports may not receive  Federal grants  from  the airport and airway  trust fund  to cover the cost of noise abate ment projects  if any work on  the project  begins before the grant is awarded. The Air port Noise Abatement Cost Reimbursement  Act, which we  are  considering  today, will  permit  the Department of Transportation  to  award grants from the airport trust fund to air ports for noise abatement projects after work  on such a project has begun.  This will be an important incentive to airport  authorities to move ahead quickly with noise  abatement projects without waiting  first  for  Federal clearance, which can sometimes be  slow in coming. The airport noise abatement  cost  reimbursement will vastly  improve  the  quality of lives of countless families living near  our Nation's airports at no additional cost to  the Federal Government.  For many of my constituents on  the San  Francisco peninsula, airport noise is the princi pal source of degradation  in  their quality of  life. As  the needs and demands of  the air traveling public increase and our Nation's air ports are called upon to accommodate many  more passengers and many more flights, the  Federal Government must continue to encour age local airport authorities and communities  to support noise abatement projects.  The use of Airport  Improvement Program  funds  for  FAA-approved  noise  abatement  projects is absolutely essential to the success  of airport  improvement  ventures. Certainly,  prompt  and  expeditious  funding  of  noise  abatement projects is necessary for continued  community support. While  the Administrator  retains discretion over the reimbursement of  Federal funds,  this  legislation sends a signal  to  the Department of Transportation and  to  the many communities around the Nation that  the Federal Government will expeditiously ful",1989
445,882,7,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman  from Florida  for his excellent state ment, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like now  to  urge all of my colleagues  to give a  strong vote of support for the legisla tion before the body to indicate to the  PLO that the U.S. Government, the  executive branch and the Congress of  the United States,  is very much op posed to PLO membership in the spe cialized agencies of  the United Na tions.  [Mr. JAMES]  ",1989
446,882,7,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, both the adminis tration and this Congress can  take credit for  denying  the Palestinian Liberation Organiza tion membership in the World Health Organi zation. Had  the PLO obtained backdoor ad mission to  the United Nations by  joining the  WHO, this would have immensely complicated  efforts to achieve a negotiated peace  in  the  Middle East.  I commend Secretary of State Baker for re alizing the seriousness of the PLO's member ship request and threatening to cut off all U.S.  aid to the WHO. And I commend those in this  Congress who worked behind the scenes to  send  the message  that no  further contribu tions to WHO would be forthcoming if the PLO  joined that organization.  Ironically, international politics should be far  from  the concern of  the WHO, which has  done so much good over the years  in safe guarding the health of so many people. The  legitimate agenda  for  the WHO should be  AIDS, malaria,  chemical warfare and other  threats to world health. But the WHO, a tech nical support organization of the United Na tions, cannot become involved in the complex  politics of the Middle East without completely  undermining its efficacy.  By accepting the application of the PLO for  membership, this U.N. agency would have ef fectively recognized Palestine as a state. Al though  the United States currently conducts  negotiations with  the PLO, we  reject  the  PLO's claim that it constitutes a state. Admis sion  to  the WHO would have advanced  the  PLO's claims to statehood in a reprehensible  manner.  By using the WHO to push  for illegitimate  political gains, the PLO bears responsibility for  politicizing a truly essential U.N. agency devot ed to improving the health of the world's peopies. Such politicization can only divide and  discredit an international organization that has  so much important nonpolitical work to do.  ",1989
447,882,7,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 2145.  This bill comes before the House at a criti cal time. Although the danger of the PLO's im minent entrance into the World Health Organi zation has lessened, the question remains on  the WHO's long term agenda. Futhermore, the  PLO is now shifting its efforts to other U.N. or ganizations where  it believes  it has a better  chance for short-term success. For these rea sons, it is important that we act quickly to pro vide the administration the legislative authority  it will need to cut off U.S. contributions to any  U.N. organization that admits the PLO as a full  member state.  Last week  the World Health Organization  barely turned back  the PLO's effort  for  full  membership on a series of votes that culmi nated  in an unprecedented secret ballot on  the question. The result was not a full defeat  of the PLO's application on the grounds of its  clear  illegality under  the U.N. Charter. The  WHO merely deferred action for a year. The  PLO  fought against  the deferral, and  has  vowed to continue its efforts for full member ship of U.N. specialized agencies. In fact, the  PLO has already submitted as application for  membership of UNESCO, which may be con sidered in the coming weeks.  I am pleased by one clause in the deferral,  which directs  the Secretary General of  the  WHO to study and report on the legal implica tions of the application. Such a study, if hon estly conducted, can only come to one con clusion. I felt earlier that the Secretary Gener al of both WHO and  the full United Nations  should have  taken a more principled and  public position on such a clearly political and  illegitimate application.  I look forward to their  public position on  this  issue when  it next  arises.  Even  this measured success at WHO was  possible only because of the expected pas sage of this legislation.  If we  fail  to approve  this bill today we will be telling the United Na tions that the U.S. Congress does not care if  the PLO  succeeds  in  its campaign  for  full  membership of U.N. organizations. If we fail to  pass this bill we will deny Secretary Baker the  clout and legislative authority he needs to im plement the administration's firm policy on this  question.  Organizations in the U.N. system must rec ognize  that they must make a choice. They  can undermine their own credibility and violate  the U.N. Charter by admitting the PLO, which  does not have even the most rudimentary at tributes of statehood. If they take this action,  they must know that the United States will feel  under no obligation to continue to provide a  quarter of their budgets.  It would be unfortunate  if effective U.S.  withdrawal from some U.N. specialized agen cies becomes necessary. Any U.N. organiza tion, however, derives its value directly from  the willingness of its member states to treat it  seriously and respect its principles.  In its ef forts, the PLO has demonstrated that it cares  more about using specialized U.N. agenices  as political tools than allowing them to contin ue their important technical work in a variety  of fields.  After passage of this legislation, the United  Nations and the PLO will have a clear choice.  They can either have the continued financial  support and full presence of the world's great est power, or they can play politics and under mine the U.N. system by approving a fraudu lent application for membership. This legisla tion eliminates any  illusions  that  they can  have both.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mrs. LOWEY of New York. Mr. Chairman,  as a cosponsor,  I rise  in strong support of  H.R. 2145,  legislation  to deny U.S. Govern ment  funding  to any United Nations agency  that grants the Palestine Liberation Organiza tion full membership as a state.  The PLO, simply put, is not a state. It meets  none of  the  internationally  recognized  legal  criteria that are required to achieve statehood.  And lacking statehood, the PLO should not be  admitted to any international organizations af filiated with  the United Nations. Such  an  action would make a mockery of the United  Nations and contribute  to a politicization of  international  organizations  that  desperately  need  to  devote  themselves  to  important  causes around the globe.  It remains true that the PLO has, as one of  its chief goals, the destruction of the existing  State of  Israel and  its  replacement with a  state of Palestine. However, the PLO cannot  achieve statehood simply by declaring  itself  an independent state. Nor can that claim ever  be  recognized as  legitimate. The State of  Israel  rightfully occupies  its current position  among world nations, and  its survival as a  free and independent nation is of the utmost  importance.  The fact remains that the PLO is a terrorist  organization committed  in  its charter  to  the  violent destruction of  Israel.  It has provoked  the ongoing unrest in the Gaza Strip and the  West Bank. And it has acted to intimidate and  harass moderate Arab leaders within and out side of  Israel,  thereby blocking constructive  action  to achieve peace between  Israel and  its Arab neighbors. To admit the PLO mem bership  in  international organizations of  the  United Nation would be tantamount to an en dorsement of terrorism and an endorsement  of ongoing violence and warfare  throughout  the Middle East.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Sec retary of State Baker for his strong and imme diate condemnation of any effort to admit the  PLO to membership in  international organiza tions. This  legislation  is  fully consistent with  the statements made by Secretary Baker and  amounts to an endorsement of the administra tion stand on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, there are now many construc tive avenues being pursued to achieve peace  in  the Middle East. However,  recognition of  the PLO as a full member of U.N. agencies is  not one of them. This is a counterproductive  step  that willl end credence and support  to  the forces of violence and hatred.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2145.  It will send a message that we do not approve  of the politicization of the work of U.N. agen cies.  It also sends the message that we do  not recognize the legitimacy of the PLO's ef forts to destroy the sovereign State of Israel.  The United States must do everything possi",1989
448,895,7,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from California [Mr. DREIER]  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1989
449,895,7,Mr. DREIER  of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I want  to  take a  few mo ments to talk about a rather sensitive  issue, one which those of us on the  Banking Committee often look at as  being sacrosanct, one which we should  not really even discuss, because if we  bring it up we are often considered op ponents, and that is specifically the  Federal Housing Administration.  Mr. Speaker, there have been several  press reports recently on two General  Accounting  Office  CGAOl  studies  which analyze  the Federal Housing  Administration's CFHAJ  growing  fi nancial problems. I am concerned with  these reports because there are several  bills pending before the Housing Sub committee  which  would  greatly  expand FHA for the very well-intend ed purpose-and I underscore the fact  that it is a very well-intended purpose,  Mr. Speaker-of alleviating the hous ing affordability problem at little cost.  Before we proceed with these propos als, however, we must determine the  true cost of the Federal Housing Ad ministration.  The first GAO study is a financial  audit of FHA  for  fiscal year 1987.  Prior to the study, no financial audit  had ever been done of FHA-and I un derscore that again, prior to the study  on the fiscal year 1987, no independ ent study had ever been done on FHA.  The audit found that, using general ly  accepted  accounting  principles,  GAP accounting, FHA's reserves are  $1.9 billion less than what FHA had  reported. GAO adjusted FHA's equity  down from $3.1 billion to $1.2 billion.  The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund  known as MMIF, which covers FHA's  single  family  lending program, was  lowered by $600 million. The GAO  audit also concluded that FHA added  $643 million  to  the Federal deficit.  FHA is a cost to the American taxpay ers because, when FHA experienced a  cash  shortage,  it withdrew money  from the U.S. Treasury by cashing in  Government  securities  before  they  matured.  GAO, Mr. Speaker, is expected to re lease its audit for fiscal year 1988 in a  few months. FHA has already report ed a $368. 7 million loss for the MMIF  for 1988. Losses are expected to continue over the next few years as the  large volume of FHA  insured  loans  originated in 1986 and 1987 enter the  peak of the default cycle. The GAO  study points out  that most  foreclo sures occur 2 or 3 years after  the  homes are purchased.  As FHA's losses grow,  I  am con cerned that we may be facing another  bailout of a Federal  insurance pro gram. Before we blindly expand these  programs, more information is needed  to balance proper social policy with  fiscal  responsibility. For example, a  second GAO study released 2 weeks  ago shows that more than 25 percent  of the FHA  insured  loans with  less  than a 5-percent downpayment in the  1981 and 1982 policy years, went into  default. This type of foreclosure rate  is a financial disaster for FHA and we  must consider whether we want  to  expand the availability of these very  low downpayment loans, particularly  if we combine the low downpayment  with very high loan amounts. We also  need to consider whether we are help ing families when as many as 1-in-4  homebuyers  could  potentially  lose  their homes.  This  is  a  very  serious  issue, Mr.  Speaker, and I believe that as we look  at  the  involvement of  the Federal  Government in the savings and loan  crisis we must also do everything that  we possibly can to avert a potential  crisis in this area.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  submit  for  the  RECORD  two newpaper articles which  more fully discuss the GAO studies,  and  I urge further consideration of  this growing problem.  [From the Washington Post, May 6, 1989)  FHA SUFFERS FIRST Loss ON ITS SINGLE FAMIL Y HOME INSURANCE FuND  <By Ann Mariano)  The  Federal  Housing  Administration  added $643 million to the federal deficit last  year, partly because of the first-ever loss it  suffered  in the single-family house  insur ance fund that has helped millions of Amer icans buy homes, the General Accounting  Office reported this week.  To cover its cash shortage, the FHA with drew money  from  the U.S. Treasury by  cashing  in  government  securities  before  they matured, thereby increasing the $165  billion federal budget deficit.  Losses in the insurance fund are expected  to continue over the next two years as the  record number of Americans who bought  homes in the boom years of 1986 and 1987  enter the period when financially pressed  homeowners are most likely to stop making  their mortgage payments. Experience has  shown that most foreclosures occur two or  three years after the homes are purchased,  according to the GAO.  In response to a congressional request, the  GAO used the private mortgage industry's  accounting  standards when  it  examined  FHA's records.  As a result, officials had to cut $1.9 billion  off the figure first reported as the govern ment's total equity in the four  insurance  funds administered by the FHA.  ",1989
450,921,7,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  join with so many Members of  the House,  past and present, in paying tribute to our late  friend  from Michigan's  12th District,  Jim  O'Hara.  Jim was an expert parliamentarian, with ex tensive knowledge of the legislative process.  His skills were widely recognized and respect ed-and often relied upon heavily-as when  he served with distinction as parliamentarian  of the 1972 Democratic National Convention.  In  formulating strategy for successful pas sage of a bill, Jim's knowledge and under standing of the intricacies of government were  indispensable. And, he was a very kind and  helpful ""instructor"" to many young  freshman  House Members in need of guidance on  the  complexities of legislative procedure.  I was honored to have served and worked  closely with him on the House Education and  Labor Committee for my first two terms here  in the House. We enjoyed many successes to gether on  the committee. Jim was a good  friend to me and,  like everyone who had the  privilege of knowing Jim O'Hara, we will miss  him.  ",1989
451,921,7,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker,  this March,  the  country suffered a tremendous  loss with  the  passing of Jim O'Hara, a wise and caring  leader both  in  and  out of Congress.  Jim  O'Hara will be sorely missed by not only his  former colleagues  in  the House, but by citi zens across the Nation. He was a dedicated  public servant and a man with an unswerving  commitment to the highest principles.  Though I began my tenure in Congress after  Jim O'Hara had left Congress and begun work  in the private sector on behalf of various labor  and education groups,  I had  the privilege of  working with him during my service on  the  Education  and  Labor Committee. Reliable,  trustworthy, and always straightforward,  he  more than lived up to his reputation of intelli gence and integrity over the course of my as sociation with him.  A  consistent  theme  runs  through  Jim  O'Hara's diverse range of legislative accom plishments: He was never afraid to champion  causes many others were afraid to take on.  During his 18 years  in Congress, he was a  stalwart  in  the battle  for  fair wages, a key  player in the passage of legislation to expand  Federal financial support for education, and a  vocal advocate of civil rights. His subsequent  outstanding work as chairman of the Federal  Minimum Wage Commission  from  1979  to  1981 provided a vital framework from which to  consider  a  fair  and  appropriate minimum  wage.  Jim O'Hara's former constitutents in Michi gan's 12th District, his colleagues, and mil lions of Americans directly benefited from his  work. I want to express my profound sorrow at  his passing and extend my deepest sympathy  to his family.  ",1989
452,921,7,Mr. HENRY.," Mr. Speaker, Michigan has pro duced a number of Members of Congress  whose  vision and  effectiveness carried  far  beyond the boundaries of our State and  the  boundaries of  these walls. One was Arthur  Vandenberg,  from my own Fifth District. An other was Philip Hart. And surely another was  James G. O'Hara, whose memory we honor  today.  I did not have the privilege of serving with  Jim O'Hara, although I am proud to be one of  his successors on  the Education and Labor  Committee. But I knew about him-as a man  of passion and  commitment  to  his  ideals  during one of  the most  turbulent periods  in  American history. He helped shape our  land  for the better. And that's how I remember him.  There was no mistaking his political cour age. When  the feelings of his political com rades-in-arms might have led him to do other wise, he strongly supported United States in volvement in the Vietnam war. Some say the  price he paid was his defeat for House majori ty leader. When the feelings of his Michigan  constituency might have led him to do other wise, he fought for civil rights legislation. And  some say the price he paid was his defeat in  his campaign for the U.S. Senate.  His  interests and energies were vast. He  was deeply involved in legislation ranging from  the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park to the  repeal of mandatory retirement age for airline  stewardesses  to designating Sousa's ""Stars  and Stripes Forever"" as  the national march.  He helped shape the election apparatus of his  party. He played as hard and as well as he  worked-and in his  later years the teenaged  paratrooper of World War II became a cham pion sailboat racer.  There was no mistaking his  love  for his  family. Jim married  the nurse who cared  for  him during a period of illness. He and Susan  had seven children, and as parents they had  to deal with such problems as hemophilia and  epilepsy. During happy times, you would find  them out at the ball park or on his boats. They  were secure in his love. And they will tell you,  ""For Jim,  family came  first and  the House  sometimes had to do without him for a short  while so that he could meet that first obliga tion.""  In a day in our land when integrity and de cency seem to be in short supply, Jim O'Hara  was a man whose priorities were right, whose  light spread to every part of his world.  ",1989
453,921,7,Mr. MINETTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise with  im mense respect and great sorrow, to honor an  outstanding and honorable colleague, James  G. O'Hara.  I mourn for the vision and dedication which  this Nation has lost in his passing. He was a  worthy companion and  I will miss him very  much.  He was held in  the highest esteem by his  colleagues,  and  deservedly so. During  his  tenure  in Congress, we were all  touched by  his dedication, determination, and vision. We  all progressed through his leadership in areas  of labor and education.  We were all  inspired by his strong beliefs  and integrity. He represented both his district  and the Nation well.  Even after his departure from the House of  Representatives, he continued  to serve  the  Nation. Just recently, James O'Hara's pres ence could be  felt. He was the chair of the  Federal Minimum Wage Study Commission  from 1979 to 1981. His work on that Commis sion  resulted  in a thorough and positive as sessment of the minimum wage which con cluded that the minimum wage did not contrib ute  to unemployment and should be raised.  And,  last month,  the House of Representa tives did just that.  His dedication to a strong defense posture  has served our Nation well. And will serve us  for years to come. His legacy will be long re membered.  The number of his accomplishments which  made our defense stronger and our country  safer for Americans, or which simply made life  better through any of his numerous other suc cesses, are  indeed  legion.  I cannot begin  to  list them all; understandably so, considering  that this man spent much of his  life serving  the people of this country.  James O'Hara was a great asset  to  this  body. The fuel which energized him was not  glory, power, or gain, but a sincere desire to  serve his constitutents and this Nation to the  best of his ability. And his best  is  truly  the  epitome of public service.  He will be greatly missed as a colleague, as  a dedicated  legislator, and as a good, good  friend.  I extend my sympathy  and to his family.  to his wife, Susan,  GENERAL LEAVE  ",1989

457,960,7,Mr. SLATTERY.," Mr. Speaker, on Thursday,  May 18, 1989,  I will chair a House Budget  Committee Task Force on Economic Policy,  Projections, and Revenues, which will  focus  on the current policy of spending money from  the Social Security trust fund surplus for cur rent government operations.  I believe that the public is unaware of this  practice. Using  trust fund money masks  the  true Federal deficit and creates a false sense  of optimism about the availability of Social Se curity funds when the baby boom generation  retires beginning in 2015.  The Kansas City Times, on May 15, 1989,  published an excellent article concerning the  Government's spending policies and use of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the Social Security trust fund to pay for cur rent expenses.  I would like to submit for the RECORD  this  article, authored by Robert Unger, and I urge  all my colleagues to review it.  The public has a right to know that funds  they  think are being  tucked away  to meet  future Social Security obligations are being  spent. If this practice is not stopped, the next  generation will  simply collect a  fist  full of  IOU's from the Social Security trust fund.  [From the Kansas City Times, May 15,  1989)  SOCIAL SECURITY: A FATHER'S WORRY  <By Robert Unger>  The Middletons span  four generations.  There's Grandma Opal, 85, and long retired.  There's Bill, 50, and his wife, Connie, work ing every day. Then there are the four kids,  17 to 28, just getting started. And, of course,  Bill's two grandkids.  Together they tell the story of Social Se curity in America: In a single family, they  are the promise made,  the promise kept,  and the promise about to be broken.  Grandma Opal came of age as Social Secu rity was born in the 1930s. By now, she says,  she's gotten back thousands of dollars more  than she ever paid in.  Bill's an optimist. He figures he's going to  live a  long time, long enough to enjoy all  that he's paid in. Maybe even a little more.  Then there are the children and grand children.  ""It doesn't look so good for  them, does  it?"" Bill asked, knowing the answer all too  well. ""With the politicians dipping into it,  the plan is doomed to fail.""  As benefits representative for United Auto  Workers Local 31 at the General Motors  Fairfax  assembly plant, he knows what  most other Americans don't know and don't  really want to know: There is no Social Se curity trust fund, at least as most of us or  any of the nation's bankers think of a trust  fund. There is no money waiting for Bill  Middleton, except in the future paychecks  of his children's generation. And if there is  none for him, there certainly is none for  them.  In the dark annals of American govern mental deception, none looms blacker than  the myth of the Social Security trust fund.  If asked, most Americans would say that  trust fund  is growing every day, building  more greenbacks through interest and pay check contributions toward each citizen's re tirement day.  They think that way because that's what  their leaders have told them. When the law  was revised in 1983, for instance, Sen. Bob  Dole of Kansas was at the forefront, an nouncing that the system was ""now sound  well into the next century.''  In fact, by Webster's definition, pedding  the ideas of a genuine Social Security trust  fund is peddling a  lie. Jim Blum, chief of  the budget analysis division of the Congres sional Budget Office, explained.  ""The trust funds really are only account ing conventions to keep track of the num bers. These aren't trust funds in the normal  sense of  the word,"" Blum said. ""I don't  know why we call them trust funds. I guess  the  aim  is  to  deliberately mislead  the  public.""  On paper, there is a trust fund, and it is  accumulating a  surplus. In point of fact,  that surplus money is immediately traded to  the federal government for non-negotiable  bonds, and the money is spent on other gov ernment activities. So  the best  the trust  May 16, 1989  fund has, Blum said,  is a stack of IOUs'  from the U.S. Treasury.  ""We are building up IOUs in the Social  Security trust fund that will come due in  future years. The question  is, how do we  pay for those IOUs in the year 2010 and  2015?""  In principle, the Treasury will return that  money  to  the Social Security  trust  fund  when the trust fund needs it. In reality, the  Treasury has  virtually  no money,  ever,  except what it is collecting in taxes.  REFORMS BROUGHT PROMISES  So what does that mean to the Middle tons? It means there will be no money for  Bill's retirement check in 2015 unless the  Middleton kids pay higher taxes of one vari ety or the other in 2015 to provide that re tirement check.  But what about all the pledges of long term solvency by Dole and others after  Social Security's reform legislation in 1983?  They were  technically correct, explained  one economists,  in the same sense that a  man might tell his wife he's putting money  in  the vacation fund every month, while  quietly ""borrowing"" it to play pool with the  boys. Eventually he must try to squeeze a  trip to Yellowstone out of the August pay check. The  family  vacation  fund would  show a fine Aug. 1 balance on paper-and be  empty.  Jeffrey Sachs, professor of economics at  Harvard University, summarized the long term effect of the 1983 reforms this way:  ""The simple fact is that before the 1983  Social Security fund's needs in 2015 <when  the flood of baby boomers will be retiring)  would have had to be paid out of current  revenues (tax collections) in 2015,"" he said.  ""After the tax increases, the Social Security  fund's needs in 2015 will still have to be paid  out of current revenues in 2015. You just  can't double count that <trust fund> money.  It is already being spent to pay for current  operations of the government.""  So what, exactly, did the Social Security  tax increases in 1984, plus all the rate in creases since, really achieve? Sometimes, in  a fit of candor, lawmakers tell us clearly and  concisely.  Rep. Leon Panetta, a California Democrat  who is chairman of the House Budget Com mittee, said in a recent interview: ""I think  most Americans would agree that they did  not anticipate that by enacting that <Social  Security> reform they were basically enact ing a blank check for other government  spending. We  implemented  those reforms  on the basis that we would secure the Social  Security  system,  that we  should protect  from bankruptcy.  ""So we created this huge Social Security  surplus by virtue of (Social Security) tax in creases. And now what we're seeing is a situ ation where, through the back door, we are  using  that money  to basically pay other  bills. So, yes, it is. It is a cover for basically  meeting needs that were not intended by  the <Social Security> tax.""  The money did,  indeed, come  in handy  back  then. That Social Security  tax  in crease, which fell hardest on poorer taxpay ers, was really the second major tax revision  of the early 1980s. The first had been a tax  cut for the more wealthy taxpayers. Taken  together, the two actions produced a trans fer of taxes from the rich to the poor.  THE CHILDREN'S CHOICES  In the end, Bill Middleton's children will  have only four choices in 2015.  ""When it comes time to spend that money  owed to the trust fund, the taxpayers in the  ",1989
458,973,7,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, today,  I will be  introducing  the Correctional Alternatives Act  of 1989. This  legislation provides for the es tablishment of a Federal discretionary grant  program to assist State efforts to institute new  and innovative alternatives to imprisonment.  American prisons  today are not doing  the  job of  rehabilitating  prisoners  or deterring  future crime. We are  in effect warehousing  prisoners at  incredible costs and when  they  come out they simply are better criminals. At  an average cost of $50 a day per inmate we  are spending over $30 million a day on a  system that is not working and has failed us  miserably. We need  to explore a new ap proach.  In the President's crime address yesterday,  he concentrated on prisons and incarcerating  criminals. Punishment and preventing  recidi vism are seen as the answer to the problem  of the prison population sitting around doing  9437  nothing except making license plates. The real  answer to avoid continuing  incarceration and  recidivism  is through programs that begin  to  train inmates to be productive citizens.  Even if we build more prisons as the Presi dent proposes, why should we not require that  when inmates are released they return to so ciety as bricklayers, electricians, painters, car penters, and skilled  in other trades. This  is  what we are proposing today.  The Correctional Alternatives Act of 1989 is  directed toward the many nonviolent offenders  who are incarcerated and would be eligible for  a wide  range of alternatives  including boot  camps, house arrests, drug treatment, and vo cational education, among others. Since it is  the States and  localities where most of the  prison overcrowding is occurring in the United  States, our bill provides support to the States  for these programs.  A unique aspect of  this bill  is a private  sector/State partnership to provide vocational  and  job  training programs  to offenders. We  need to teach working skills to inmates while  in prison not only for their benefit but for the  benefit of our society. Our approach should be  if you do a crime you are going to do time, but  you are also going to come out with a skill to  become a productive citizen. Our  legislation  encourages  the private sector  to  join with  State correctional agencies  in creating these  programs and I will be exploring additional leg islation  to enhance  tax  incentives  to private  businesses that engage  in  these job training  and job placement activities.  If our prisons remain as warehouses  then  all we are buying with more and bigger pris ons is a bit of time and a false sense of secu rity. Whether in prison or through the types of  alternatives proposed in this bill in addition to  punishment we must provide the opportunities  for offenders to change their behavior.  Specifically, the legislation does the follow ing:  Authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance  to award grants to States for the purpose of  funding new and innovative alternatives to in carceration  in order  to  reduce prison over crowding.  Provides $200 million  for this program  for  each of fiscal years 1990, 1991, 1992, and  1993.  Requires that 20 percent of the total fund ing available be used to fund joint State/pri vate vocational education and job training pro grams. It also requires a 30 percent State/pri vate sector-no less than 15 percent from the  private sector-match  for  these  joint State/  private efforts.

460,986,7,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to  pay  tribute  to  St. Matthias Parish  of  Youngstown, OH, on  the occasion of  their  75th anniversary. This blessed celebration  in  my 17th Congressional District is a perfect ex ample of the deep religious  traditions which  hold  this country  together as  ""One Nation  Under God."" This anniversary is marked by a  Mass of Thanksgiving to be attended by over  1,000 parishioners, which will be followed by a  dinner-dance where I have the honor of being  toastmaster.  St. Matthias parish was the idea of a group  of Slovak  immigrant  families who had  the  vision  to establish a strong  church/school  community. The  first services  in July 1914  were held in a rented home, but through gen erosity and hard work by generations of fami lies the St. Matthias Parish plant today con tains a school, convent, rectory, and church,  all  debt-free.  This  once  vision  has  now  become a reality that 1,041 families share.  Today, a highly dedicated staff of Vicentian  Sisters and  lay people provide an  unsur passed education  for St. Matthias students.  Along with  this quality education,  the school  offers a multitude of athletic programs which  the students as well as  the community  take  an active role. Over 3,000 students have grad uated  from St. Matthias creating a strong  alumni which includes myself.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask that the House join me  today in honoring St. Matthias parish commu nity. May this parish, which I was once fortu nate enough to attend, continue to prosper in  the next 75 years.  It is truly an honor and a  privilege to represent such a fine community  organization.

461,986,7,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to pay  tribute to an outstanding dance company, the  Dance Theatre of Harlem.  Under the leadership of its founder, Arthur  Mitchell,  the Dance Theatre of Harlem has,  since 1969, brought hundreds of thousands of  dance lovers around the world to their feet as  a result of its  innovative well-choreographed  performances. The history of this company is  May 16, 1989  a rags to riches story, which emanated out of  Harlem, NY, going  from  local popularity  to  become one of the most sensational dance  experiences on stage today.  Arthur Mitchell has  taken his  talents and  has not only shared them with disadvantaged  youth from the black community, but has built  bridges  of  understanding  between  black  Americans and  the cultures of  the world.  It  has been a distinct and uplifting pleasure to  watch  the company's art  form breaking  into  the world of American, and  then  to  interna tional ballet.  In a time when nations feared and  fought  each other, when dialog was needed between  peoples of the world, Arthur Mitchell and the  Dance Theatre of Harlem were ambassadors  of peace, promoting understanding and  the  university of human experience through an art  form that can only be described as exhilarat ing.  Mr. Speaker, Arthur Mitchell and the Dance  Theatre of Harlem are not only  to be com mended  for outstanding contributions  to  the  world of the arts, but also deserve recognition  for their significant and eloquent symbolism in  support of peace at home and abroad.  I ask my colleagues to join me in extending  best wishes  for continued success in all  the  future  endeavors of Mr. Mitchell and  the  Dance Theatre of Harlem.  AWARD WINNER: PAM  LUGINBILL  HON.

466,999,7,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself as much time as I may con sume. I rise in support of the confer ence report on House Concurrent Res olution 106, the concurrent resolution  on the budget for fiscal year 1990. It is  very similar to the House version of  the  budget  resolution, which was  adopted on a vote of 263 to 157. I hope  my colleagues will give it their support  because the resolution essentially re flects  the same elements  that were  contained in the House resolution.  If we approve this conference report,  it will be the earliest that the House  has approved a conference report on a  budget  resolution  in  this decade.  I  think this is a tribute to the coopera tive spirit that has been displayed by  both parties in Congress, as well as the  White House.  While there was by no means a wide  gulf between the House and Senate  budget resolutions,  there were some  important  issues and funding differ ences to be resolved. In all matters, I  believe my colleagues will  find  that  the House  conferees protected  the  House position. In virtually all cases  where  there were  differences,  we  either ended up with a position similar  to or identical to the House version,  split the difference with the Senate, or  simply agreed to disagree.  Like the House-passed budget, this  conference report adheres to the bi partisan budget  agreement between  the White House and the Democratic  and Republican congre8sional leader ship,  and  it meets  the  Gramm Rudman deficit-reduction  target  for  fiscal year 1990. Given the narrow con straints under which this budget has  been developed, I believe it represents  our best possible budget for fiscal year  1990 as well as our best chance for  more comprehensive deficit reduction  in the future.  This budget provides for real deficit  reduction. It is bipartisan, and it is  achievable.  It also places the Congress on sched ule with  regard  to  its  legislative  agenda. The Committee on Appropria tions can now proceed to bring their  bills to the floor. Reconciliation will  proceed to implement this budget res olution with the date of July 15 for re porting, and this Congress, as we have  in the last Congress in the second ses sion, can avoid the problem of a large  continuing  resolution  on  appropria tions for the Federal Government.  To let my colleagues know that this  obviously does not represent the bold  approach is not news. We need ulti mately to face the deficit issue head  on. Everyone who worked on  this  agreement acknowledges that this  is  not the bold approach that we need to  ultimately implement with regard to  deficit reduction, but solving the defi cit problem is a marathon, and with  this budget we have  taken the first  mile.  While we have barely broken into a  sweat, there are still many miles that  remain  to go  in developing what  I  think is the necessary deficit reduction  package for the Congress and for the  country. The real task will come when  we try to consider the budget for fiscal  year 1991, and hopefully one that will  be multiyear.  We have met with the President yes terday morning  to again discuss  the  situation with  regard  to  the budget  resolution and where we go from here.  I believe all of the participants in that  meeting  found  it very  encouraging  that, not only did we  acknowledge  that there  is a new and cooperative  spirit between the Congress and the  White House with regard  to budget  issues, but that beyond that we need  to begin discussions now to try to im plement a bolder package with regard  to deficit reduction as soon as we can.  Mr. Speaker,  this budget sets that  framework and gives us that opportu nity. The budget agreement calls for  continuing negotiations between  the  White House and the Congress on a  budget for fiscal year 1991.  I want to assure my colleagues that I  have no intention of sitting down and  negotiating  a minimal budget  with  If  regard to 1991 or beyond. I will push  hard for a bold approach which  in cludes taxes and restraints on both de fense  and  entitlement  spending.  these elements are not on the table,  we will get nowhere. I have no interest  in negotiations  that are destined  to  fail, but, if we put all of these issues  on the table, and if we continue the  spirit of good will  and cooperation  that we have begun with this process,  if we continue to give and take, that is  essential  to  the kind of compromise  that we need in this area, and I am  convinced  that we  can  successfully  take the next step with regard to the  budget.  In  light of  that  I want  to again  thank my ranking minority member  on the House side, the gentleman from  Minnesota [Mr. FRENZEL], for his hard  work,  and  cooperation and  support  during the conference and throughout  this difficult process.  I also want to  thank the leadership on both sides of  the Hill for the cooperation and sup port that they have provided through out this very difficult process, and in  particular I would like to thank the  administration and the President for  the cooperation that they have shown  in developing  these versions of  the  budget and helping us to resolve our  differences as quickly as possible.  There were, as I stated at the begin ning, differences that needed to be re solved. As this budget is implemented,  we will need continuing cooperation  between the Congress and the admin istration  to achieve  the  savings,  to  achieve the revenues that are part of  this budget, and to a large extent that  will  test  the  relationship  for  the  future. If it is successful, if it works,  then I  think it lays the right frame work for the future.  I also want to thank in particular  the House conferees on both sides of  the aisle. Their support enabled us not  only to protect the House position on  the critical  issues  that we  face, but  their  input  throughout  the process  has been  invaluable  to making our  budget process work and work eff ec tively.  Let me briefly summarize the con ference agreement for my colleagues.  Overall,  the conference agreement  provides for fiscal year 1990 outlays of  $1,165 billion and revenues of $1,065  billion, with a deficit of $99.7 billion.  It provides for $27. 7 billion of deficit  reduction from the baseline. Entitle ment and other mandatory spending is  cut by $8.3 billion  in outlays, while  Social Security and other retirement  program cost-of-living adjustments are  protected and Medicare cuts are limit ed to half the amount proposed in the  President's budget. All of these figures  comply with  the bipartisan budget  agreement, as do total spending levels  for defense, international affairs, and  domestic discretionary programs.  ",1989

The administration does not  want the Congress to appropriate any  more money for crime and drugs. That  is a fact. Everything else in this bill  has been agreed to, everything else.

He asked for twice as  much money as we have in this bill,  but they do not want the bill to come  up, and they do not want the House to  vote its will on whether or not they  want more money for crime and drugs.  Everything else has been agreed to in  this bill.

492,1038,7,Mr. HATCH., That is not what I said.  ,1989
493,1038,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," The  fact of  the  matter is we had an increase in the  minimum wage by 60 percent between  1961 and 1969. The rate of inflation  during that period was 22 percent.  Between 1981 and 1989, a zero-per cent increase in the minimum wage,  but the rate of inflation was 39 per cent.  Let us use the basic traditional eco nomic data when we are trying to talk  about the projections and what the  impact is going to be in terms of the  loss of jobs.  An just finally with regard to the  loss of jobs, I put in the RECORD  the  Business Week article that states that,  regarding the loss of jobs, ""Indeed, the  harm from a higher minimum wage  may not only be less than the conserv ative figure-but even  less  than the  liberals think.""  It basically points out that any po tential loss of jobs would be de mini mis because  it correctly points out  that what impacts  jobs are the eco nomic indicators, not just providing a  living wage to the working poor of this  country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the article, dated October 19,  1987. be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  DISPELLING THE MYTHS ABOUT A HIGHER  MINIMUM WAGE  <By Aaron Bernstein>  Sometimes economists are so busy predict ing the future that they neglect to look at  the past. This seems to be the case in the  current debate over the minimum wage. Lib eral and conservative economists alike have  churned out predictions of how many jobs  will be lost if the $3.35-an-hour minimum is  raised. The liberals say very few,  the con servatives say a lot. But a close look at how  each side  reaches  its conclusions  throws  doubt on both their estimates. Indeed, the  harm from a higher minimum may not only  be less than conservatives figure-but even  less than liberals think.  The  problem  lies  in  the  econometric  models on which the projections are based.  Lobbying groups  ranging  from  the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO buy  these computerized profiles of the economy,  which they then use to project what hap pens when variables such as the minimum  wage are altered.  It turns out  that  the  models used on both sides of the current  debate assume that the percentage of work ers earning the minimum wage will remain  the same.  In reality, the percentage has been drop ping. As a result, the pool of workers likely  to be affected by a higher minimum wage is  smaller  than most models assume-some  35% smaller (chart). The implication is a  matter of arithmetic: The fewer minimum wage jobs there are, the less impact on em ployment if the minimum wages rises.  To be  fair,  glitch  in  the econometric  models  has  caught nearly  everyone  off  guard. Even such staunch opponents of a  minimum wage hike as Finis R. Welch, a  labor economist at the University of Califor nia at Los Angeles, now concede that the  smaller number puts the matter in a differ ent light. Although he still is against raising  the minimum, he agrees ""there will be less  problems if there are fewer workers at the  current minimum.""  That may be an understatement. Conserv atives point out that if higher labor costs  aren't matched by productivity gains, mini mum wage workers could be priced out of a  job. The Chamber of Commerce predicts  that 750,000 jobs could be lost by 1990 if the  minimum wage were raised in steps to $4.65,  as is called for by legislation being debated  in Congress. It predicts a loss of up to 1.9  Inillion jobs by 1995.  Liberals, arguing  that employers would  offset  the wage  hike with  productivity  gains, show far fewer  jobs being lost. F.  Gerard Adams, an economist at the Univer sity of Pennsylvania, puts the loss at 100,000  by 1990. Liberals also argue that it's worth  losing some jobs to keep other minimum wage workers out of poverty.  Whatever the merits of that argument,  even Adams' number may be too high. The  model he used, from Wharton Econometric  Forecasting Associates Inc., assumes a con stant proportion of minimum-wage workers  vs. all hourly workers in the economy-even  though the actual share fell from 15% in  1981 to 8.8% in 1986. Thus ""the model could  be overcounting  [anticipated]  job  losses,""  says John Hagens, the head of Wharton's  macro unit. The impact could be overstated  further because the number of hourly work ers above $3.35 but below the proposed new  minimum wage has fallen, too.  The Chamber of Commerce used a Wash ington University econometric model with  siinilar flaws. ""We do assume a rise in the  number of minimum-wage workers,"" con cedes Chris Varvaes, an economist at Lau rence H. Meyer & Associates, which built  the model. The chamber's economist, Gra ciela Testa-Ortiz, apparently didn't realize  that. By contrast, Data Resources Inc. used  a ""very conservative assumption"" on how  many workers earn $3.35, says Roger Brin ner, its chief economist. He sees 87 ,000 jobs  lost by 1990.  Indeed, the opponents' own logic indicates  that raising the minimilm shouldn't be dev astating. If business hires fewer minimum wage workers when they become more ex pensive, then it should hire more such work ers when  they become cheaper. They've  become an absolute bargain since 1981, as  the real value of the minimum wage has  fallen by 25%. Yet there are 2.7 million  fewer minimum-wage workers now, while  overall employment has risen by some 9 Inil lion.  Why did this happen? Many economists  say the education and skill requirements of  new  jobs are rising. While some of these  may be low-paid retailing or fast-food jobs,  even they are starting to pay more than  $3.35. That may be because the number of  teens is falling and labor shortages are de veloping, making it harder to hire workers  at the minimum. If these trends continue,  the  economy will  replace more  of  the  lowest-paying jobs with higher-paying ones.  So letting the minimum rise shouldn't be so  harmful.  There's another point that some econo mists have missed. Opponents argue that  lifting the minimum wouldn't help many  poor people anyWay. Only 1 million of the  5.1 million minimum-wage workers live  in  poverty, they say-the rest live with other  wage-earners. But few mention that the 5  million counts only hourly workers.

503,1051,7,Mr. HEINZ.," Madam President,  a  quite  interesting  column  by  Jodie  Allen  appeared  in  the Washington  Post on May 10, entitled ""Regaining  America's Dulled Industrial Edge: The  Answer Is Right Here at Home."" The  essence of the discussion can be found  in the first sentence of that article:  If U.S. companies are really worried about  this country's retreat in international mar kets, there is one obvious thing they can do  about  it: Commit  themselves  to  reducing  their dependence on foreign suppliers.  To the extent this is a recommenda tion for kind of a voluntary Buy Amer ica Program, coupled, of course, with a  sustained effort by American industry  to maintain competitiveness in terms  of both quality and price, then I am  all for it. More interesting, however, is  the column's discussion of why  this  has become a problem.  Essentially, what we are seeing  in  the United States is a continuing pat tern of industrial retreat. Foreign pro ducers target an industry and through  aggressive-and  sometimes  illegal pricing  practices  force  down  the  return on investment for U.S. produc ers and build up foreign producers'  market share. The result is that Amer ican firms  retreat from  that sector,  and foreign producers move on to a  new one.  In some cases these foreign victories  have come about after blatantly illegal  dumping and the continued failure of  our Government to address it. I ref er  to the television industry, which has  been decimated not through a lack of  competitiveness but  through unfair  trade practices. Other foreign target ing has occurred in critical sectors like  machine tools, bearings, and semicon ductors, and we are seeing similar ef f arts in aircraft via Airbus, and, I pre dict we will increasingly see them in  computers. Indeed, the same day this  column appeared, the Post also had an  article pointing out that for the first  time Japanese  total electronics pro duction nearly matched that of the  United States. In computers, foreign  market share rose from 35 to 45 per cent last year.  In each of these cases we are seeing  a new phenomenon in Washington the blurring of the distinction between  American interests and foreign inter ests. The new lobbyist on the block, as  it were, is the domestic user of foreign  parts-foreign chips, foreign bearings,  foreign machine tools, and so on. He  has an interest in continuing our in dustrial retreat because he has already  surrendered-he depends on  foreign  sources for his parts.  Fighting back, as we have done with  the semiconductor agreement, the ma chine  tool VRA's, and  the bearing  dumping determinations,  to mention  three examples, is expensive for those  who use foreign parts because it in creases their prices. As a result they  often oppose  these efforts,  even  if  they are mandated by  law as  in a  dumping finding, in the interest of the  easier path of continued retreat.  This is part of the classic conflict in  our country between short-term and  long-term considerations. Our  indus trial analysts and economists are fre quently critical of American business'  emphasis on short-term returns and  lack of long-term planning. Domestic  users of  foreign components display  exactly  this  same  shortsightedness.  They are more concerned with next  quarter's prices on  their parts than  they are with the long-term preserva tion of viable, technologically competi tive industries.  The  tragedy  of  this  conflict,  as  Allen's column points out, is that the  cost of our action is high precisely be cause we  have delayed  so  long  in  taking it. If we had acted decisively on  semiconductors, machine tools, televi sions, and bearings when the problems  began instead of when it is almost too  late, we could have achieved our objec tives with minimal disruption. Instead  our Government chose to wait until  we were in crisis, expecting the market  system to solve the problem. In fact,  the market will only solve the problem  if all parties are using the same set of  rules. If the Japanese, for example,  and they are involved in most of these  cases,  do  not  practice  American  market principles in their own econo my, it should come as no surprise that  they do not  immediately adhere  to  those rules here.  The result is what Akio Morita of  Sony Corp. has called the ""hollowing  out""  of American  industry. Allen's  column is correct that part of the solu tion to that must come from American  industry itself-and I agree with that.  But there is also a lesson for Govern ment here. We are facing a new gen eration of these problems in the high  value added growth industries of the  future: Supercomputers, telecommuni cation, aerospace, and HDTV-high",1989
504,1077,7,Mr.  PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  there is an unfortuante lack of high quality oats in the marketplace. The  demand for oats for human consump tion has increased substantially in the  past few years due to wide publicity on  the nutritional benefits of this grain  in lowering blood cholesterol and re ducing colon cancer. We are all famil iar with the current barrage of adver tising on oat bran products.  Domestic oats demand has been in creasing annually at the rate of 10 per cent. Cereal manufacturers are scram bling to locate supplies of high-pro tein, milling-quality grain. Once  the  largest exporter of oats,  the United  States has become the largest import er. In 1987 the United States bought  more than 46 million bushels of oats,  most of it from Canada, Argentina,  and  Scandinavia.  Imports  in  1988  amounted to over 60 million bushels,  or 21 percent of our total domestic  use. In 1960, over one billion bushels  of oats were harvested in the United  States. Production  in 1988 was only  206 million bushels. That was  the  smallest crop of oats harvested in the  United States in 112 years.  The 1985 farm bill has been success ful  in some areas. However,  in my  home State of South Dakota, which  has traditionally ranked as the No. 1  oats producing State in the Nation,  oats have become a forgotten crop. Be cause of the way oats are treated in  the 1985 farm bill, farmers have been  planting  barley  instead,  therefore  adding to the surplus of this crop.  Mr. President, I believe one step in  the right direction would be to raise  the target price of oats. I support and  am cosponsoring efforts to raise the  target price of oats. Under present cir cumstances,  I believe we  should go  even further  to promote more oats  production in the United States by re moving the current 5 percent set-aside  requirement for oats. We desperately  need m.ore domestically produced oats.  Present regulations do not make good  sense when we are importing 60 mil lion bushels of oats in 1 year and at  the same time forcing farmers who are  participating in the oats program to  idle land that could also be planted to  oats.

SUSPENSION OF DUTY ON CERTAIN TWO-STROKE  CYCLE PISTON ENGINES  e ",1989
505,1077,7,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent,  I  rise  to  introduce  legislation  that would alleviate an unintended  problem that has arisen as a result of  the  adoption  of  the  harmonized  system of tariff clarifications.  Polaris  Industries,  a Minnesota based company and the last remaining  domestic manufacturer  of  snowmo biles, has for several years been im porting  engines  for  installation  in  their snowmobiles. Since there appear  to be no domestic suppliers of compa rable engines, Polaris has been allowed  to  import  these  engines  duty-free.  However,  in the transition from the  TSUS tariff clarification system to the  harmonized  system,  these  engines  have been reclassified into a new cate gory which carries a U.S. tariff of 3.1  percent. The legislation I am introduc ing would  temporarily  suspend  the  duty on these engines.  When Congress approved  the har monized system, it was not our inten tion to raise tariffs on products that  are currently not dutiable. The pur pose of the harmonized system was to  enhance our  international  competi tiveness. In this instance, the harmo nized system works  to the disadvan tage of a domestic manufacturer and  simply forces the company to raise the  price of its products.  I ask unanimous consent that the  full text of this legislation be included  in the RECORD.  ",1989
506,1090,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing the third in a series  of bills to help rural America get back  on its feet.  I have spoken at length in the past  about the basic tools I believe are nec essary to help rural areas compete in  today's world economy.  One of those tools is access to state of-the-art  telecommunications  serv ices. On April 11, I introduced legisla tion, S. 759, the Rural Access to Tele communications Services Act of 1989,  to bring this tool to rural areas. Under  my legislation, rural businesses, hospi tals, and schools will all have access to  telecommunications services equal  to  those  currently  available  in urban  areas.  Another essential  tool  is access  to  capital  for businesses  that want  to  locate or expand in rural areas. Many  of these businesses, because of their  location, are considered by banks to be  more  risky  than others  and  have  found it next to impossible to secure  adequate financing. On April 19, I in troduced  legislation  to  address  this  problem. My  legislation, S. 863,  the  Rural Access  to Capital Act of 1989,  will establish a public/private partner ship revolving loan fund at the SBA to  make capital more readily available to  rural businesses.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today will provide another important  tool to rural businesses: Access  to a  business ""incubator"" program  to be  administered through the Rural Elec trification Administration [REA]. This  legislation will establish a $10 million  revolving loan rural business incuba tion fund at the REA to be used to  make grants and  low  interest  loans  available  to REA borrowers for  the  purpose of developing business incuba tors.  The incubators will provide techni cal assistance, advice, loans, or capital  to business  incubation programs al ready in existence; or to create and op erate new ones. The purpose of this  provision is to establish a common fa cility from which small businesses can  operate while sharing facilities, equip ment, machinery, telecommunications  devices, computers, support staff, over head costs. or janitorial services with  other small businesses. This program  could  cut  down  on  a  substantial  amount of the overhead costs associat ed with operating a small business in  rural areas.  Once again, I look forward to work ing with my colleagues to develop a  comprehensive approach to facilitate  revitalizing rural areas.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the full text of the bill be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 1029  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

NEBEKER TO BE CHIEF JUDGE  OF THE U.S. COURT OF VETER ANS' APPEALS  ",1989
515,1103,7,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the Committee on Veter ans' Affairs, I am pleased to rise  in  support of the President's nomination  of Frank Q. Nebeker to be the first  chief judge of the U.S. Court of Veter ans' Appeals.  Our committee held a hearing on  this nomination on Monday, May 15,  and then met on Tuesday, May 16, and  voted unanimously to report the nomi nation favorably to the full Senate.  BACKGROUND  Mr. President, the Senate consider ation of this nomination is one of a  number of very meaningful, truly his toric events  that are occurring  this  year as the result of the enactment  last year of laws elevating the Veter ans' Administration  to Cabinet-level  status <Public Law 100-527) and pro viding for judicial review of the deni als of veterans' claims for benefits and  establishing the new court of veterans'  appeals <Public Law 100-687).  In March, the Senate confirmed the  nominations of Edward J. Derwinski  and Anthony J. Principi to serve as  the first Secretary and Deputy Secre tary, respectively, of Veterans' Affairs.  On March 15 we celebrated the estab lishment of the Department of Veter ans' Affairs. Those events were mani festations of the very high level of ap preciation of the American people for  the courage, service, and sacrifices of  those who have served in the Armed  Forces and of the great  importance  that the Nation attaches to the pro grams by which we seek to meet our  obligations to our Nation's veterans.  This  nomination  symbolizes Con gress'  recognition of  the  fact  that  those whose service has preserved our  government of laws not of men are en titled to a full measure of justice in  their relations with their Government.  The sustained effort in the Senate  to provide for judicial review of VA de cisions denying claims for benefits cov ered a span of nearly 13 years. Mem bers of our committee worked  long  and hard and played vital roles in de veloping legislation to ensure that vet erans have access to the courts and to  the assistance of counsel. Thus, this  nomination is specially significant for  our committee, and we are delighted  to be able to support this nominee.  QUALIFICATIONS OF NOMINEE  Mr.  President, many  aspects  of  Judge Nebeker's background make  him eminently qualified to be the first  chief judge of the new veterans' court.  Committee staff has  thoroughly  re viewed his questionnaire and financial  statements, and we are assured that  there are no financial conflicts.  ",1989
516,1116,7,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker,  it has been 8  years since  the minimum wage was  last  in creased. The $3.35 per hour wage today only  purchases $2.46 worth of goods and services  in the marketplace. Workers today deserve to  earn a decent wage for  the hard work  they  perform. H.R. 2,  the Fair Labor Standards  Amendments of 1989 creates the long over due opportunity for Congress and  the Presi dent to provide millions of low wage workers a  measure of economic justice.  President Bush's veto threat of this modest  proposal  is wrong and unfair to  the poorest  working men and women in the Nation. When  the President supports a capital gains tax and  opposes a modest  increase  in  the minimum  wage,  it is easy to see why the  income gap  between the richest and poorest Americans is  the greatest in more than 40 years.  I urge the President to reconsider and not  veto this legislation for the sake of 30 cents  an hour. Also, I believe it is important for all of  us to realize Congress' 60-day training wage  proposal  for  the very  first  job-or jobs-a  worker takes, is significantly different than the  Bush 6-month, potentially  lifetime,  submini mum.  The  following  article,  ""Bush's Minimum Wage Ploy,"" by Arnold Mayer, vice president  of the United Food & Commercial Workers  [AFL-CIO], that appeared  in  the Washington  Post on May 16, 1989, points out the differ ences in the two proposals and clearly shows  the only meaningful  increase  in  the Federal  wage floor is the congressional package.  I encourage my colleagues to join in our ef forts to convince President Bush of the imperEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tance of signing a meaningful minimum wage  bill. Copy of the article follows:  BUSH'S MINIMUM-WAGE PLOY  Some workers could end up on a submini mum training wage treadmill.  Much is missing from the public debate on  the differences between the minimum-wage  legislation passed by both houses of Con gress and the one supported by the Bush ad ministration. News reports concentrate on  1) the Bush call for a $4.25 an hour mini mum wage in three years as compared with  the congressional $4.55  rate; and  2>  the  Bush proposal  for  a  six-month  so-called  training wage versus the congressonal two month limit.  In actual fact,  the training wage differ ence is much greater and much more signifi cant both in economic and political terms.  The administration  is  demanding  a  six month training period every time a worker  changes his or her job, while the congres sional 60-day  total  training wage would  occur only once-on the very first  job or  jobs a worker took.  Under the Bush proposal, a worker could  be plagued with  the  subminimum wage  throughout his or her working life. Under  the Congressional  legislation,  the worker  would endure the subminimum only at the  start.  But there is more. In both proposals the  training wage would be either $3.35  an  hour-the minimum-wage  rate  in  effect  since Jan. 1, 1981-or a percentage of the  existing minimum  wage,  whichever  is  higher. The subminimum percentage would  be 80 percent in the Bush proposal and 85  percent in the congressional bill.  Multiply either the Bush minimum-wage  proposals of $3.65 an hour for 1990 or $3.95  for 1991 by 80 percent and the all-pervasive  training wage stays at $3.35 an hour both  years. In 1992, the Bush-proposed minimum  wage would go  to $4.25 and the training  wage would finally rise-by 5 cents to $3.40.  Minimum-wage workers leave jobs often.  In 1980,  the U.S. Minimum Wage Study  Commission  found  that  ""turnover was  greater among minimum-wage workers than  among those making higher wages."" In fact,  more than twice as great.  ""On a monthly basis, 13 percent of mini mum-wage workers left their jobs,"" accord ing to the commission. For the economy as a  whole, ""workers left their jobs at a 6 per cent monthly rate."" Many experts believe  the  turnover  rate among minimum-wage  workers is higher today.  The Bush proposal also gives employers  an  incentive  to conclude -that  these  low wage workers are inadequate  in their  job  performances as they approach the magic  six-month deadline. While the substitute of  subminimum workers  for  those  receiving  the full minimum wage would be illegal. the  U.S. Labor Department's Wage and Hour  Division has been so denuded of staff that it  could hardly enforce this difficult-to-prove  provision.  As a result, most workers employed at the  subminimum wage would never reach the  full rates proposed by Bush. Job changes either voluntary or forced-would effective ly keep them at the $3.35 and $3.40 rates.  The media has speculated that the Bush  ""take-it-or-leave-it""  attitude on minimum  wage is a political ploy aimed at stiffening  the image of a president who often compro mises with Congress. It is to show conserv atives that he does stand his ground.  Bush's minimum-wage strategy is actually  a shrewder maneuver  than  that. It is  a  May 17, 1989  double  play. Bush demonstrates  to  the  nation  a  ""gentler and kinder""  approach  than the Reagan flat ""no"" on minimum wage increases. At the same time, he assures  employers that under the law they will not  have  to pay more  to a  large number of  workers until 1992 and then an increase of  only a nickel an hour.  There  is yet another benefit for mini mum-wage opponents. Representatives, sen ators and the media are guessing what will  happen after the expected Bush veto of the  congressional minimum-wage legislation.  Congress will probably be unable to over ride  the veto. While both chambers ap proved the minimum-wage bills by comfort able margins, they did not pass them by the  two-thirds majority which the Constitution  demands for a veto override.  Bush may not be willing to make changes  in his proposals even after a veto. He could  very well continue his ""tough strategy"" for  the economic benefit of employers and the  political benefit of conservatives.  But  the political pressures may be  too  great. The administration may be willing or  may have to negotiate a new bill with Sen.  Edward M. Kennedy <D-Mass.) and Rep.  Augustus F. Hawkins CD-Calif.), the chair men of the congressional labor committees.  No genius  is needeJ  to foresee what a  compromise  of  the minimum-wage  rates  could be like. One side or the other may get  the better deal of a nickel in the difference  between the Bush prcposal of $4.25 an hour  in  the  third year and  the c,ongressional  $4.55 figure. The result is likely to be some where between $4.35 and $4.45.  Such a compromise would b1 ~ difficult for  minimum-wage  increase advocates to swal low. The cost of living has increased 37 per cent since  the $3.35 minimum  first went  into effect. The minimum should be at $4.60  today to make up the lost purchasing power  of these low-paid workers.  The $3.35 rate represented 48 percent of  the nation's average wage when it became  law in 1981. To equal the same percentage  of the average wage today, $4.58 would be  needed. Any wage compromise would there fore push minimum-wage workers even fur ther down the equity scale.  But  the negotiating sticking point will  come on the training wage. If the adminis tration becomes generous and cuts its six  months subminimum to just one month at  every  job  change,  the minimum-wage  worker still will be in deep trouble. Because  of  job  turnovers,  the $3.35 and the $3.40  rates will remain a major factor-and per haps  the predominant factor-in  the  job  market for minimum-wage workers.  This  after-the-veto  situation  puts  the  Democrats in a political bind. If they agree  to such a  training wage deal, they cripple  the effectiveness of the Fair Labor Stand ards Act-long a major jewel in the Demo. cratic New Deal's crown-and  they will  enrage  labor and other advocates of  the  working poor.  If congressional Democrats refuse to make  the deal, the administration will try to make  them appear as dogmatists who will not  compromise to provide a much-needed wage  increase to low-wage workers-even though  President Bush is not proposing a real in crease.  The minimum-wage fight could end up as  a victory for political cynicism at the ex pense of the working poor.  ",1989
517,1129,7,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Speaker,  there are  many individuals who spend their life in dedi cation to a cause or a movement, but there  are  few whose  life's work actually makes a  fundamental difference in  the history of their  State and Nation. We in Jefferson County, AL,  recently lost just such a person, and all of us  mourn the passing of this great man.  Dr. Joseph F. Volker first arrived in Birming ham in 1948 to serve as dean of the newly created dental school at the University of Ala bama. By the time he retired as chancellor of  the University of Alabama system in 1982, his  vision and energy had  transformed  the  local  economy and quality of health care  for Ala bamians and the world,  through the develop ment of the University of Alabama at Birming ham  into a internationally-acclaimed medical  center and university.  He took the Birmingham campus of the Uni versity of Alabama, originally only an exten sion center with no  faculty or  facilities, and,  with the help of many others, turned it into an  independent  university within  the  system.  Today, as the county's largest employer, UAB  is a vital  force  in Jefferson County. And  its  medical center is of a caliber that few other  medical facilities in the world can match.  The changes that Joe Volker brought to Jef ferson County benefited our community dra matically,  and  his  legacy  is one  that will  always be with us.  I would like to share with my colleagues in  the House  two editorials  that  recently ap peared in the Birmingham News and the Bir mingham Post-Herald, highlighting the dreams  and aspirations  that Joe Volker had  for Bir mingham,  for Alabama, and  the Nation, and  his efforts that turned his dreams into reality:  CFrom the Birmingham News, May 5, 19891  JOSEPH F. VOLKER  Had Joseph Volker ended his career in  1939 without ever having stepped foot  in  Alabama, he would still have been a famous  man worthy of honor for his contribution to  the betterment of mankind.  But  throughout  his  life,  Dr.  Volker  seemed driven by a desire to do something  more, something better. The monument to  that drive is a world-class medical facility on  Birmingham's Southside  and  the bright  future it represents for a reinvigorated city.  Dr. Volker died Wednesday night. We  mourn his passing.  Birmingham and the world have  lost a  great mind, a great asset and a great man.  Dr. Volker received national recognition  in 1939 when he became the first scientist to  prove fluoride prevents tooth decay. A few  years later at age 34, he was named dean of  the Tufts College Dental School. Shortly  thereafter he came to Birmingham to head  a new dental school here.  Looking out on the University of Alabama  at Birmingham's sprawling campus now, it  is hard to imagine what Dr. Volker encoun tered. He had no facilities and no faculty. It  took him 45 days to round up students.  In the years following he recorded a good  many ""firsts"" before his titles. He was the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  first director of research and graduate stud ies at UAB, first vice president for health  affairs, first director of the medical center  campus.  Later of course he was named first presi dent of UAB and the first chancellor of the  University of Alabama system.  People  around  the world honored Dr.  Volker's achievements. The governments of  Czechoslovakia, Thailand and Iceland gave  him top honors. He was given an honorary  degree  from Louis Pasteur University  in  France and named to the prestigious Insti tute of Medicine of the National Academy  of Sciences in this country.  People in Birmingham will remember him  as the father of UAB and thus the man who  helped provide this city with a caliber of  health care  few others anywhere  in  the  world can match and who charted a course  for the city's economy into the 21st century.  JOSEPH F. VOLKER  Few individuals deserve credit for chang ing the course of a city, but Dr. Joseph F.  Volker, who died Wednesday, certainly be longs in that select group.  When Volker came to Birmingham in 1948  to serve as dean of the University of Ala bama's newly created dental school,  this  area's economy was heavily dependent on  the steel and iron industry. When steel did  well, so did Birmingham. But when heavy  industry fell on hard times, so did Birming ham.  By the time he retired as chancellor of  the UA System in 1982,  this area was no  longer bound to the fate of a single indus try. We now have a diversified economy and  an international reputation in the medical  and biotech areas.  The change in our economy is also produc ing-albeit slower-changes  in public atti tudes. The can-do entrepreneur spirit that  created Birmingham had long since given  way to a branch-plant mentality by the time  Volker arrived. Traces of that community  inferiority complex remain, but an influx of  well-educated people attracted by  the  job  opportunities now available in this area and  the retention of bright young people who  might previously have left for opportunities  elsewhere have helped  to revive  the  idea  that this community can do things for itself.  Volker did not do  it by himself. Many  people in both the public and private sec tors have contributed to the growth of the  UAB medical center and related enterprises.  But many of those people were brought to  Birmingham by Volker, first as the dental  school dean, then in a variety of administra tive posts,  including being the first presi dent of the University of Alabama at Bir mingham when it became an independent  university within the UA System.  It was also Volker who had the dream of  transforming what was originally an exten sion center  into a multificated university.  UAB is a monument to his ability to trans form that dream into reality.  Joe Volker established himself as a scien tist before coming to Birmingham when he  proved that fluorides could be used to pre vent tooth decay. And he continued to keep  in touch with dental and medical research  throughout his career. But it was as an ad ministrator, dreamer and inspirer of people  that he left his greatest mark. He was a  major force in shaping the Birmingham of  today.  9593  TRIBUTE TO THOMAS J. BROWN  HON. JAMES H. SCHEUER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 17, 1989  ",1989
518,1129,7,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, on Sunday,  May 21, many who remember a rare, coura geous, idealistic man named Tom Brown, will  gather  in  the Bronx  to  try  to honor  that  memory in a way that befits Tom's life by es tablishing  the Tom Brown Memorial Scholar ship Fund.  Today, I want to honor Tom's life, his ideals,  and his commitment to service.  Tom's entire adult life was devoted to help ing and serving other people.  Tom Brown was born  in 1943, grew up  in  the North Bronx and went  to one of New  York's  competitive  high  school's  for  high  achievers-Stuyvesant High School  in New  York City.  By  the  time he had  finished college,  in  1963, John Kennedy had said ""Ask what you  can do for your country!""  Tom asked himself that question, and an swered  the  question  as  a  young  idealist  would.  He entered  the brandnew Peace Corps  to  use his training in agriculture, political science  and economics, and was sent  to promote  community development in rural Chile.  When he  returned home  in 1965, he  re mained an  idealist, eager to use his new ex perience in solving important problems in his  own country.  First, Tom earned a masters degree in Latin  American studies, then returned to New York  City to help ensure that its Community Devel opment Agency would achieve the goals of its  antipoverty programs.  Tom was praised by Commissioner George  Nicolau who found  in him attributes essential  to antipoverty work: Cultural awareness, per sonal experience  in working with  the poor,  and a broad interdisciplinary knowledge of the  political, economic, historic, and social forces  that are involved in carrying out development  pr9grams.  He left that agency in 1969 to continue anti poverty work  in a different way: Working  for  the City University of New York,  in programs  aimed at helping students whose educational  or economic background had put  them at a  disadvantage in obtaining higher education.  In 1977, Tom returned to community devel opment work, this time in the Bronx communi ty where he lived with his wife and children.  He was appointed district manager of Commu nity Planning  Board  No.  11,  Bronx,  and  became known as someone who took no po litical sides at all, but worked for the benefit of  district residents.  Tom worked with merchants' and  tenants'  organizations, with  local and borough  repre sentatives of city agencies, and  testified at  public hearings and meetings. He worked hard  to improve municipal service delivery, and for  the quality of neighborhood life.  He fought hard for both large goals, such as  the revitalization of a commercial area, or the  establishment of a new police precinct, and  he fought for smaller gains, such as demoli  ",1989
519,1155,7,Mr. NAGLE.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  been sitting here listening to the croc odile  tears being  shed by my  col leagues to my left, totally within their  incapacity to recognize this crisis was  created by a Republican administra tion previously under  their  control  and that totally and utterly failed to  adequately request or to seek funds or  support needed funds for veterans hos pitals.  D 1100  It is great to cry about the crisis of  the day, but Members need to ask the  question how it came about. It came  about in the last 8 years of the Reagan  administration, more  interested  in  sending money for freedom fighters in  Nicaragua than taking care of the vet erans of World War II and the Korean  conflict.  It is great to sit here and cry because  the money is desperately needed and  the House will act, but do not lose  sight of the problem historically cre ated by their administration and their  administration of  the Veterans' Ad ministration itself. It is great to say it  is terrible we do not have the money,  and trying to do it in a massive bill,  doing it as quickly as Members can,  but it is irresponsible to make the ar gument that somehow this is a Democratic problem when in fact the Veter ans' Administration Hospitals  have  been under  their administration for  the last 8112 years.  MOVE FORWARD WITH THE  SUPPLEMENTAL  (Mr. GINGRICH  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1989
520,1155,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think that it should be very clear to  everyone who heard the chairman of  the Committee on Veterans' Affairs a  few minutes ago, the gentleman from  Mississippi  [Mr. MONTGOMERY] who  warned that within 2 weeks the Veter ans' Administration will be laying off  800 medical personnel a week, every  week. That the time has come to pass  the dire supplemental.  Now the fact is that we do not just  have to pass the supplemental in the  House, we have to pass the supplemen tal in the House and get a supplemen tal through the other body, so it can  go downtown to the President and be  signed. The other body  is going  to  leave at the end of the day and they  will be gone until after Memorial Day,  and  I  agree with my  friend  from  Michigan who makes the point that  there is something a little wrong about  a Memorial Day weekend where we  can find the time to go home for Me morial Day but we have not found the  time to take care of veterans. I think  that every Member of this House in a  bipartisan basis should listen carefully  to what the chairman on Veterans' Af fairs said about the fact that within a  very few days we are going to start  laying off 800 medical personnel  a  week in the Veterans' Administration  Hospitals unless we pass the supple mental.  We have everyone here today. Today  is the day to pass the supplemental.  There  is no excuse for going home  without having passed the supplemen tal, and if we pass it today I think we  can then put pressure on the other  body, and we can get it passed in the  other body today and get it signed. If  we do not do our job today, we, the  House, will guarantee  that veterans  will not, in fact, have any kind of help  on this particular problem until after  Memorial Day.  wanted,  except we would  have  a  chance to vote on drugs. Reluctantly,  everything would come out that they  objected to except money for the war  on drugs. But, any member could have  a separate vote on that. Any Member  can move  to  strike. The  ranking  member of the Committee on Appro priations offered to do so, to move to  strike that money so we could have  the vote. But they do not want to vote  on it. So there was an objection on  that side.  ",1989

But  the gentleman  from  Iowa  [Mr.  SMITH] and the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. MILLER] will be allowed to  have an amendment. We are willing.

The Committee on Rules has  not been called into meeting. There is  no rule being considered. The veterans  of this Nation are being held hostage  because  of whatever  reasons. But,  wherever these negotiations are going  on, behind that door or this door, let  the RECORD show that the Republican  Party on this side of the aisle is in full  agreement with  the Democrats  to  bring that bill on the floor. There are  only two Members of this whole entire  Congress of 435 Members  that are  holding  up  this  bill  from  coming  before the floor.  Please, please, be reasonable.

538,1168,7,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Florida [Mr. FASCELLl  is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1989
539,1168,7,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, on May 14 the  Government of Israel announced a new initia tive aimed at advancing  the peace process.  The decision had broad-based support in the  Israeli Cabinet and has also been endorsed by  the Israeli Parliament.  I believe that this new  initiative  is a timely and constuctive step.  In  particular the proposed elections on the West  Bank which are an integral part of the Israeli  initiative offer a new opportunity for meaning ful progress in bridging the gap between the  Palestinians and the people of Israel.  Elections,  in and of  themselves, unfortu nately are unlikely to produce peace. But elec tions may offer the only chance to move away  from  the  current  violence.  Elections will  present an opportunity for the Palestinians to  choose their own representatives to negotiate  both middleand  long-term solutions  to  the  problems which divide  Israelis and Palestin ians.  Decades of stalemate have left deep scars  on the hearts and bodies of both Israelis and  Palestinians.  These  scars  understandably  make it harder rather than easier to find new  ways  to craft a better future. Elections offer  one chance to find a way to that future.  It is  my hope that those genuinely seeking peace  will carefully examine the real opportunity the  new  Israeli  initiative offers and give  it  the  chance which it deserves.  It  is my hope and expectation  that  the  United States will continue to play a positive  role in furthering peace in accordance with the  spirit of the Camp David accords. To support  the broad goals which the new Israeli initiative  seeks the United States should try to get input  from all parties so that our complementary ef forts will help make  Israel's new  initiative a  truly effective step. It is also my hope that the  international community will join in supporting  this constructive Israeli initiative.  THE THRIFT CRISIS  ",1989
540,1168,7,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from New York [Mr. LAFALCE]  is recognized for 10 minutes.  ",1989
541,1168,7,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, as  the House  prepares to pass legislation to funnel massive  amounts of taxpayer money into the Nation's  failing savings and  loan  industry,  I think it is  look at  important that we  take a moment to  what we are really doing.  This is the most massive bailout in the Na tion's history and  the winners are  receiving  money from the pockets of American taxpay ers, not manna from heaven.  Yet, neither President Bush, the Senate, nor  the House, which is likely to see floor action  within the next few weeks, has taken the time  to really explore the ramifications of this emer gency legislation that is roaring through Con gress like a train out of control.  I  fear  that we are  losing sight of what  should be some of our primary goals in  this  legislation-to minimize  taxpayer costs and  ensure an equitable sharing of  the burden.  Judged by  these  two standards,  the Presi dent's plan simply does not measure up.  And the dollars will come from the pockets  of taxpayers and our children and grandchil dren.  There are  five major problems with  the  President's plan: First, the cost estimates for  resolving problem thrift cases are deceptively  low; second, the bonding mechanism is both  fiscally irresponsible and morally reprehensible  and will significantly increase the costs to the  American  taxpayer;  third,  the alleged burden  sharing  is inequitable-the taxpayer contribu tion  is significantly understated,  the  industry  contribution is overstated, and other legitimate  sources of income such as the States are not  tapped;  fourth,  the application of the capital  standards  treats  institutions  inequitably and  may ultimately  increase the cost to  the tax payer; and fifth, efforts to draw in private cap ital  to help minimize  the  resort  to  taxpayer  funds are inadequate.  To date, Congress has effected little or no  improvement.  I. RECENT HISTORY OF THE THRIFT ISSUE  It is instructive to revisit the recent legisla tive history of the thrift crisis. We now face, at  a minimum, a $100 billion problem. That prob lem,  if not  its complete scope, was already  apparent 3 years ago,  in 1986, when Con gress was considering FSLIC recapitalization.  In  that  legislation, Congress developed  the  FICO Bonding Program, a self-help program  that put the costs of recapitalizing the FSLIC  squarely on the industry.  The level of that recapitalization became a  serious  point  of  contention.  The  industry,  driven largely by concerns as to the costs it  would be forced to bear, was insistent that we  had a $2 to $3 billion problem, nothing more. I  and others argued at the time, on the House  floor and  in conference,  that a substantially  greater amount of money-at least $15 billion  in bonds-was necessary if we were to seri ously address the problem. But it was impossi ble to garner the necessary political support  for a realistic financing package.  Congress finally passed a $10.8 billion re capitalization bill  in August 1987.  It was  too  little and too late.  Had we provided for a reasonable sum of  money at the time to close hopelessly insol vent institutions, we would not be facing  the  problem we face today.  Instead, insolvent in stitutions continued to operate and even grow,  drawing  in deposits with high-interest  rates.  The rising cost of funds became a debilitating  ",1989
542,1181,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," I wonder if I might  ask the distinguished majority leader  a couple of questions. First I note the  absence  of  the FSX  issue,  and  I  wonder if that might be on the calen dar for next week.  ",1989
543,1181,7,Mr. FOLEY.," I am happy the gentle man mentioned that. That may well  be on the calendar for next week. We  have not a clear designation yet with  respect to that; and any action that  might be taken by the Committee on  Foreign Affairs, but that is absolutely  correct, and we may have a vote on  FSX.  ",1989
544,1181,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Just for the pur pose of those colleagues who were not  part of our earlier discussion, when  the  dire  emergency  supplemental  comes up, since it will not have the  veterans' money, could  the majority  leader just explain for a moment what  will be in that bill in the context of  that rule in that vote?  ",1989
545,1181,7,Mr. FOLEY.," We  anticipate  there  will be one rule which will encompass  both that bill and the bill  involving  the transfer of funds for drug-fighting  purposes for  two separate bills. The  first bill, H.R. 2072, will most likely be  the text of the unanimous-consent re quest  offered  by  the  distinguished  chairman of the Committee on Appro priations  yesterday.  It will  include  such things as funds for refugee pro grams, for the provision for forest fire  fighting. There will be funds for guar anteed student loans, Federal employ ment benefits and  trade adjustment  assistance,  international peace keep ing,  Jewish  refugee  assistance  and  some  funds  for  the  homeless  and  funds for drug enforcement.  ",1989
546,1181,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Let me  just say,  first of all, I very much appreciate this  week having worked with the majority  leadership and having gotten the vet erans' supplemental through today. I  think it was an important step.  I would note that because of the un usual nature of next week's rule and  the two initiatives that are being of fered on the dire emergency supple mental and the proposal to transfer  funds for anti drug initiatives which, as  I understand it, represents a bill which  has not yet been written or  intro duced, House Resolution blank at this  stage,  I would  just say  to my col leagues on the Democratic side there  may well be one or two initiatives that  come to the Rules Committee at the  same time in an effort to find equal  opportunity, and I might say for floor  action on ideas during the week.

D 1330  THE USE OF SNIFFER DOGS AT  AIRPORTS-AN UPDATE ON AIDS  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  NEAL). Under a previous order of the  House,  the gentleman from  Indiana  [Mr. BURTON] is recognized for 60 min utes.  ",1989
555,1181,7,Mr.  BURTON  of  Indiana.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  have  two  issues  that  I  would like to touch on briefly today. I  will not take the entire 60 minutes so  that those who are still in the Cham ber can get out of here and get to  their homes or wherever they have to  go.  First of all, we have a real problem  with  the possibility  that a  terrorist  might get on a U.S. aircraft at one of  our international airports and blow it  up. We have had occasions where this  has occurred at foreign airports, but  we have not yet experienced it here in  the United States.  In order to ward off this possibility,  I and a number of other Members of  Congress have  suggested  that some  measures be  taken by  the Federal  Aviation Administration to make sure  that this does not happen. One inex pensive way to head off this eventuali ty is  to train sniffer dogs that have  the ability to detect Semtex and other  plastic explosives before they get on  an aircraft. They use  these  sniff er  dogs at many of our State Department  offices around the world, and they use  them behind the scenes to check lug gage at many of our airports, but they  do not use them at the gates that pas sengers go through to get on an air craft. In my view, we ought to train  teams of trainers and sniff er dogs and  policemen to be at these aircraft en tranceways  to check hand-carried-on  luggage that goes on the aircraft and  that, therefore, is not subject to scru tiny behind the scenes.  The FAA has come to my office and  talked to me, and they have talked to  the gentleman from Minnesota  [Mr.  0BERSTAR] and others and have said  that  they believe  this would cause  some problems for them in that the  dogs might scare passengers, and there  is a possibility that the dogs might  bite passengers. And  they point out  that the dogs can only be used for a  specified period of  time before  they  are worn out and then have to rest  before they go back through another  cycle.  Now, my answers to their criticisms  are as follows: First of all, we could  put muzzles on dogs that are loose-fit ting enough so they can still use their  tongues and their sniffing devices so  they could detect these plastic explo sives. So that argument does not hold  water. The second thing I would say to  them is that people see dogs all the  time. They see  the seeing-eye dogs,  they see dogs  in yards and on  the  streets, and people are used to that.  And if they know that it is for their  own safety that these dogs are going  to be at the airports, in my view they  will not object to them.  The third thing is that the dogs do  have a limited period of time that they  can detect  these plastic  explosives,  maybe 30  to 45 minutes. But  their  ",1989
556,1285,7,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," Mr. President, I  rise  to alert my colleagues from the  great State of Michigan  to be on  notice: Honolulu may well be the auto motive capital of our country in the  next century.  My reason for this assertion is the  success of the University of Hawaii's  Electric Car Program, which has re cently emerged as the national leader  in road endurance. Because of its deprivate sector what the Treasury Department is  doing with this information and what kinds of cases  the Treasury Department is making. The Treasury  Department needs to keep better statistics because  although Title 31  convictions are not  the only  measure of BSA effectiveness, we have not brought  forth statistics on other aspects of BSA utility. The  federal government has good examples of individ ual cases brought as a result of BSA compliance,  but the Treasury Department, for example, can't  state the degree to which BSA compliance has re sulted in incresed tax revenues. One of the recom mendations that I will be making from this round table is to do a better job of tracing Title 31  in volvements in criminal and tax cases, so that next  year, perhaps, we can bring these statistics to the  financial community to show that we do have a  program that makes sense.

564,1298,7,Mr. ARMSTRONG.,"  I  thank  the  Chair and I appreciate the opportuni ty to speak briefly upon the confer ence report of the concurrent resolu tion on the budget.  Madam President, I am disappointed  to report to my colleagues that there  is a  little  item which  I had hoped  would be contained in this conference  report which is not in there. It is just  a couple of lines at a certain spot in  the resolution and it does not involve,  proportionate to the total of Federal  spending,  a  very  large  amount  of  money. Although it is significant, it is  several hundred millions of dollars,  but compared to several trillion dollars  in spending in the next few years that  are contemplated by this budget docu ment, it is not a very big percentage.  But I tell you this, it is a big item in  the lives of some people who are get ting a raw deal, some people who de serve better treatment than they are  getting as a result of the failure of the  conference committee  to  include  in  here room to permit Congress to legis late to lift the Social Security earnings  limit.  I have mentioned  this  to my col leagues previously, and I  think most  Members of the Senate are well aware  of the issue and well aware of the jus tice of the cause that I have arisen to  advocate, and that is that, by gosh, it  is  time  to  raise, phaseout, and ulti mately  abolish  the Social Security  earnings limit. I hesitate to even go  into the issue in any detail because I  have  discussed  it with  the Senate  before, but let me just outline it for  the benefit of anybody who might  read this in the RECORD and find it a  novel issue.  The essence of it is very simple. At  the present time, a Social Security re cipient between the ages of 65 and 70,  who reaches a plateau of $8,800 in out side earnings per year, thereafter for feits $1 of Social Security entitlement  for every $2 of income. That means in stead of earning $8,800, if some person  maybe made $9,000, earned $200 over  the limit, they would have to give back  $100 of their Social Security.  I am here to tell you, by gosh, that is  not fair. It is not right. It is terrible  social policy, it is bad labor policy, and  it is an economic injustice.  We are not  talking, by  the way,  about a handful of people. We are not  talking about wealthy people. We are  talking about working elderly men and  women. We  are not  talking  about  coupon clippers or people who have  big incomes from dividends or bond in terest or rental income on housing or  partnership interests from business or  anything  like  that because, Madam  President and my colleagues, that kind  of income does not trigger a reduction  in Social Security.  Now,  let us be clear about that. If  you get $1,000 a year, $500,000 a year,  $5 million a year in dividend income,  you do not have to give up a penny of  your Social Security entitlement, but  if you earn over $8,800 a year, about  $750 a month, a little less, you have to  start giving back  to Uncle Sam 50  cents for every dollar of new income.  Madam President, if you think about  that for a minute, what it means is  this: that you pay in tax disincentive  what  amounts  to 50  cents on  the  dollar Social Security earnings  limit  offset,  then you pay your Federal  income tax, which is 15 percent, then  you pay FICA, then you pay maybe in  some States, State  income  tax, and  you very quickly get up  to a point  where about 80 percent, in a  typical  case, of your marginal earnings are  forfeited if you are between 65 and 70  and a Social Security earnings recipi ent in this income bracket, in sort of  that middle  bracket  from maybe  $8,800 to $15,000, $18,000, $20,000.  High-income  people,  relatively  speaking, are not affected. Those who  are in the very lowest income brackets  who do not have any earnings or very  little are not affected. Coupon clippers  and investors are not affected. It is  just  these  poor working  people.  I  think it is a raw deal. Now, it could be  80 percent. It might be as much as 102  percent.  One newspaper-I believe it was the  Wall Street Journal-made that point  very forcefully and very correctly and  in extreme cases it could actually be a  marginal tax disincentive. It is not pre cisely a  tax rate but a marginal tax  disincentive of about 102 percent.  The Senate on  two occasions has  considered this matter and on the first  occasion on a vote of 86 to 11 agreed  that we ought to raise the Social Secu rity earnings limit and on the second  occasion when we were considering the  budget resolution agreed in fact to a  proposal which I advanced along with  a  number  of my other  colleagues  which would give headroom, give  in  effect budget room to permit the Fi nance Committee  to  come  forward  with a proposition that would allow us  to raise by $3,000 next year and $3,000  in each of several subsequent years  the amount of  the Social Security  earnings limit,  leading I would hope  ultimately to phasing it out altogether  but certainly raising it to a  level of  $20,000 or $25,000  in  the very near  future.  I want to express to my colleagues  on the conference committee, and I  was a conferee, my great appreciation  for  them trying to help us get this  past our colleagues in the House. We  did not succeed. We did not win the  victory that I had hoped we would win  on this issue but I am here to tell you  two things about that.  ",1989
565,1311,7,Mr. RIEGLE., I  thank the Senator  for his assurance.  ,1989
566,1311,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, today we  have before us the House and Senate  conference report on the 1990 budget.  The budget reductions provided in this  plan are very modest, but  they do  meet  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  targets for fiscal year 1990 and keep us  on the road to completely eliminating  the deficit by 1993. Now comes  the  hard part-sticking with  the  agree ment  and  resisting  temptations  to  expand  spending  or  raise  taxes.  Throughout this year we must keep in  mind the Gramm-Rudman targets: 100  in 1990, 64 in 1991, 28 in 1992, and 0 in  1993.  Next year we will have to find a min imum of $36 billion to meet the 1991  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target, and  that's going  to  require  some  tough  choices. Some programs are going to  have to be cut back, others completely  eliminated, and  in an election year  that's going to be very difficult. Maybe  we can make our job a little easier by  starting negotiations on the fiscal year  1991 budget right now, as called for by  the bipartisan summit agreement and  the President of  the United States.  Cutting the budget is always hard, but  under the spotlight of a campaign the  temptation to postpone tough choices  becomes almost too great.  Unfortunately, a lot of cynics in this  town are skeptical about the chances  for  early negotiations on  the 1991  budget. They say that Congress only  makes real progress on issues under  the immediate threat of a crisis. Well,  I think this year the budget negotia tors have proven the cynics wrong. We  have made a small, but significant step  toward our goal of a zero deficit  in  1993. I congratulate Senator DoMENICI  and everyone involved in budget nego tiations this year, and hope they can  soon begin  their work on  the 1991  budget.  ",1989

Next week the deputies to the new  Congress of  the Soviet Union  con venes.  This  resolution  simply welcomes these initial steps toward insti tutionalizing the process in the Soviet  Union. It expresses the hope this proc ess will continue to go  forward and  will ultimately result in reconstituting  the Supreme Soviet with access to the  information needed  to make policy  and enact legislation, with the actual  power to make laws, approve and alter  budgets, appoint and change govern ment officials,  and oversee  security  and military services.  Mr. President, things are changing  in the Soviet Union. The pace, even  the direction, of that change are far  from  fixed. There will doubtless be  setbacks and turmoil. The skill of the  new leadership is bound to be severely  tested. From time to time, the reform ers may lose their nerve or their way.  Perestroika may get bogged down in  bureaucratic battles. The people's pa tience will be sorely tried.  Yet all over the Soviet Union, the  winds of change are blowing. Embat tled party bosses are struggling  for  their political lives. Some are winning,  others losing. But the people are tast ing democracy. And they want more.  How do I know?  I know because I talked to them on a  recent visit  to  the Soviet Union  in  Central Asia as well as Moscow.  In  subways,  in  schoolrooms,  on  the  street,  in  the  stores,  in queues,  in  cafes, in churches, mosques, and syna gogues. Just one example: I stopped  two middle-aged women on their way  to the metro and asked them the same  question. One of the women was an el ementary school teacher. For her, per estroika was greater freedom to teach  her way. To tell the truth. To elicit  questions from her students, not sup press them. Most of all, she said, ""It is  the freedom for you and me to talk  this way, without fear.""  All these hopes are focused on the  elections that have been going on over  the past few months and that are sup posed  to continue  throughout 1989.  The new 2,250-member Congress of  People's Deputies, which meets  in  Moscow for the first time next week  on May 25, is the concrete manifesta tion of the Soviet people's yearning  for more democracy.  I met some of these newly elected  deputies. They were insatiably curious  about the nuts and bolts of how a  democratic  congress  actually works.  We  talked for hours about the U.S.  Congress. What its powers and respon sibilities are. The legal and institution al underpinnings of its authority, like  immunity and subpoena power. How  the American people ensure Congress'  openness and accountability. How  it  keeps its independence from the exec utive branch. They shared their con cerns and their hopes.  The next day, I listened as over 100  deputies gathered to debate the mis sion and function of the new Congress.  ",1989

Mr. President, several weeks ago, I  began to receive a number of letters,  phone calls, and postcards from con stituents  throughout  the State con cerning art work by Andres Sarrano.  They express a  feeling of shock, of  outrage, and anger.  They said, ""How dare you spend our  taxpayers' money on this trash."" They  all objected to taxpayers' money being  used for a piece of so-called art work  which, to be quite candid, I am some what reluctant to utter its title. This  so-called piece of art is a deplorable,  despicable display of vulgarity. The  art work in question is a photograph  of the crucifix submerged in the art ist's urine.  This artist received $15,000 for his  work from  the National Endowment  for the Arts, through the Southeast ern Center for Contemporary Art.  Well,  if this is what contemporary  art has sunk to, this level,  this out rage, this indignity-some may want to  sanction that, and that is fine. But not  with  the use  of  taxpayers' money.  This is not a question of free speech.  This is a question of abuse of taxpay ers' money. If we allow this group of  so-called art experts to get away with  this,  to defame us and  to use our  money, well, then we do not deserve to  be in office.  That is why, Mr. President,  I am  proud of the Members, who in literally  a matter of minutes-over 20, about  25-joined me  in  signing  a  strong  letter of protest to  the Endowment.  Here is a picture, and the title is ""Piss  Christ."" Incredible.  To add insult to  injury, after this  group of so-called art experts picked  this artist for  this $15,000 prize-of  taxpayers' money; we paid for  this,  our taxpayers-I do not blame people  for being outraged and angered, and  they should be angered at us, unless  we do something to change this. If this  continues and if this goes unrectified,  where will it end? They will say, ""This  is free speech."" Well, if you want free  speech, you want to draw. dirty pic tures, you want to do anything you  want, that is your business, but not  with taxpayers' money. This is an out rage,  and our people's  tax  dollars  should not support this trash, and we  should not be giving  it the dignity.  And after this piece of trash and this  artist  received  this award,  to make  matters worse,  the Awards in Visual  Arts,  this wonderful publication was  put together; and who was it financed  by, partially? By none other, than the  National Endowment  for  the Arts.  What a disgrace.  They not only see this garbage, they  can say we did not know he engaged in  this kind of filth, but then they see fit  to distribute  it  through  the Nation  and brag about  it and allow  their  names to be used,  instead of calling  and saying, you get our name out of  that.

The  purpose  for  which  the Endowment was  estab lished, and I quote, ""to support the  survival of the best of all forms that  reflect  the American heritage  in its  full range of cultural and ethnic diver sity and to provide national leadership  on behalf of the arts.""  Mr. President, I submit this is a dis tortion of those purposes. It does not  reflect on the full range of cultural  and ethnic diversity; rather, it is a per version of those principles. If people  want to be perverse, in terms of what  they recongize as art or culture, so be  it, but not with my money, not with  the  taxpayers' dollars, and certainly  to  it  not under  the mantle of his great  Nation. This is a disagrace.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the letter to  the National  Endowment for the Arts be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  Washington, DC, May 18, 1989.  U.S. SENATE,  Mr. HUGH SOUTHERN,  Acting Chairman, National Endowment for  the Arts, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. SOUTHERN: We recently learned  of the Endowment's support for a so-called  ""work of art"" by Andress Serrano entitled  ""Piss Christ."" We write to express our out rage and to suggest in the strongest terms  that the procedures used by the Endowment  to award and support artists be reformed.  The piece in question is a large and vivid  photograph of Christ on a  crucifix sub merged in the artist's urine. This work is  shocking, abhorrent and completely unde serving of any recognition whatsoever. Mil lions of  taxpayers are rightfully  incensed  that their hard-earned dollars were used to  honor and support Serrano's work.  There is a clear flaw  in the procedures  used to select art and artists deserving of  taxpayers support. That fact is evidenced by  the Serrano work itself. Moreover, after the  artist was selected and honored for his ""con tributions"" to the field of art, his work was  exhibited at government expense and with  the imprimatur of the Endowment.  This matter does not involve freedom of  artistic expression-it does involve the ques tion whether American taxpayers should be  forced to support such trash.  And finally, simply because the Endow ment and the Southeastern Center for Con temporary Art <SECCA>  did not have a  direct hand  in  choosing Serrano's work,  does not absolve either of responsibiity. The  fact  that both  the Endowment and  the  SECCA with taxpayer dollars promoted this  work as part of the Awards in Visual Arts  exhibition,  is  reasons enough  to be out raged.  We urge the Endowment to comprehen sively review its procedures and determine  what steps will be taken to prevent such  abuses from recurring in the future.  We await your response.

583,1337,7,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, I want  to commend  the  leadership  in both  the House and the Senate for bringing  this important measure up before we  go on our Memorial day break.  The veterans of this country could  not have waited any longer for us to  Act. I am sure that the veterans in my  State of Montana and our two Veter ans' Administration hospitals are re joicing tonight. It is unfortunate, how ever, that we have had to make them  wait and wonder for so long.  The funding shortfall for veterans  health care has hit very hard in Mon tana. We have one of the highest per centages of veterans in the country. In  Montana, one of every eight people  are veterans. When you add their de pendents into that equation, that is a  lot of people affected by a lack of med ical care.  The Administrators of our two veter ans hospitals are to be commended for  the job they did in providing the best  care possible under extremely tough  budget constraints. In fact, I received  a copy of a letter recently which the  Veterans Department had sent to Jim  Huff,  the Administrator of  the VA  Medical Center  in Miles City, MT,  commending  him  for  a  ""job well  done.""  I  had urged both Secretary Der winski and Richard Darman to bring  forth a  supplemental appropriations  for VA health care,  and was very  pleased when they did so. I had origi nally asked for $635 million. Obviously  the figure we are working with here is  much less, but we are also left with  less  time in this fiscal year.  I know  that the leadership has conferred with  the Veterans' Department  to make  sure that this is enough for them to  get by. It is my hope that in years to  come we will not find ourselves in this  situation again.  Our veterans have performed an in valuable service  to  this country. We  should not  let  them down  like  this  again. It is almost Memorial Day and I  for one am glad we are remembering  to take care of the health needs of our  veterans.  Thank you, Mr. President.

589,1376,7,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I am pleased to join my distinguished  colleague  from Kentucky,  Senator  FORD, and our distinguished majority  leader, Senator MITCHELL, in introduc ing this bill to establish a Commission  on Aviation Security and Terrorism.  The goal of this Commission would  be to get the answers to the lingering  questions  surrounding  the  tragic  bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on De cember 21,  1988. Further,  it would  evaluate our Nation's ability  to  re spond to the terrorist threats posed to  civil aviation, and make recommenda tions for improving those efforts.  On March 17,  I  introduced Senate  Resolution 86, which called on  the  President to appoint an independent  commission to conduct this investiga tion and review. I was joined on that  day  by  Senators  FORD,  HOLLINGS,  BRADLEY, MIKULSKI, D'AMATO, HEINZ,  SARBANES, and MOYNIHAN. There are  now 19 cosponsors to Senate Resolu tion 86.  Unfortunately,  the President  has  chosen not to appoint such a commis sion. The administration has taken the  position that internal reviews will be  sufficient to correct the problems that  allowed the bombing of Pan Am 103 to  take place,  so  that more American  lives won't be lost to such terrorism.  By  introducing  this  bill, we  are  saying we don't agree. Mr. President, I  would say that, for this Senator, it is  not a matter of not taking the admin istration at its word; that word being  the President's stated commitment to  finding  the  answers  and  improving  aviation security. But rather, as I've  stated before, it's a question of juris diction. The issues involved fall under  the purview of several Federal depart ments and agencies. Similarly,  they  fall under the jurisdiction of a number  of different committees in the Senate  and House.  It continues to be my belief that the  best way  to address the serious con cerns about Pan Am 103 and our avia tion  security  programs  overall  is  through  a  single,  comprehensive  review of the facts. A commission like  that outlined in the bill we're intro ducing today would meet that stand ard.  This Commission would have nine  members:  two each from  the House  and Senate; one from the Department  of Transportation; one from the intel ligence community; one from the Na tional Transportation Safety Board;  one from the airline industry; and one  from the victims of Pan Am 103, the  group of families and friends of those  killed on that flight.  I believe that this composition would  allow for a  thorough, fair  investiga tion. The intention would not be to  repeat or overlap ongoing criminal in vestigations. Its goal would not be to  point fingers; but rather to point out  needed changes.  Mr. President, we were all touched  by the tragic destruction of Pan Am  flight 103 on December 21 over Lock erbie, Scotland. That bombing was an  unprecedented assault on America and  American citizens. It is our responsibil ity to find out all we can about how  the bombing happened, and do what  we can to prevent such attacks in the  future.  But  today, almost 4 months after  their  loved  ones were  so  viciously  taken from  them,  these people still  don't have the answers they deserve.  They don't know who knew what,  when  they knew  it, what was done  with the information, and what should  have been done. Further, there contin ue to be unanswered questions about  whether we're doing all we can to pro tect the lives of the millions of Ameri cans traveling abroad each year.  On March 14, the Subcommittee on  Transportation of the Senate Appro priations Committee held a hearing to  look into the Pan Am 103 bombing. At  that hearing,  important  information  was withheld from the subcommittee.  It was only when press  reports  in  Europe disclosed that there had been  a security bulletin  issued  to our air  carriers because of a possible threat  from  terrorists  that  the administra tion admitted to the existence of such  information.  It is unacceptable to have important  information  continue  to  come  out  piecemeal. We must get the facts, so  we can improve the efficiency of our  aviation security system. This requires  a close look at the events leading up to  the bombing of Pan Am 103 and a  comprehensive look at how our Gov ernment addresses the growing prob lem of aviation terrorism.  The bill Senators FORD, MITCHELL,  and I are introducing today provides a  means of getting such a review. I ap plaud Senator FORD  for his efforts,  and urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  Mr. President,  in closing  I would  note that the families and friends of  those killed on Pan Am 103 continue  to call for a full Senate investigation,  separate  from  the Commission  that  would  be  established  by  this  bill.  They've been frustrated by the admin istration's refusal to agree to an inde pendent review. I greatly respect their  refusal  to  take ""no"" for an answer,  and will continue  to work on  their  behalf to request a separate Senate in vestigation, as well.e  By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr.  BOREN, Mrs. KASSEBAUM, Mr.  NICKLES, Mr.  BENTSEN, Mr.  GRAMM,  Mr.  BAUCUS,  Mr.  BURNS,  Mr.  PRESSLER,  Mr.  WIRTH, Mr. PRYOR,  and Mr.  DASCHLE):  S. 1044.

",1989
590,1402,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to join Senator COATS in spon soring this legislation; and I commend  him for taking this worthwhile initia tive on an issue that is as pressing as  any national security matter on our  agenda.  Some things can't be said too often,  or too strongly. Noriega must go.  We have said so-both the President  and the Congress. The OAS has virtu ally said so. By far most importantly,  the people of Panama have said so even in the face of the mass rigging of  the recent election.  We will work to the fullest extent  possible with the people of Panama  and the nations of this hemisphere, to  restore democracy to Panama.  And, as that process goes forward,  we will  insure-unilaterally, if neces sary-that vital American interests in  and around Panama are protected.  One such interest, clearly, is the free  and  unfettered  operation  of  the  Panama Canal. The Coats legislation  makes the right, and the inevitable,  connection between our problems with  Noriega, and the issue of the canal.  Senator COATS has crafted two com panion pieces of legislation-one ex pressing  the  sense  of  the Senate,  which Senator COATS intends to move  at the earliest possible moment;  the  other which establishes a mandated  course of action, which we are intro ducing today. Both deal with the same  matter: The next step in the process  of turning over control of the canal to  Panamanian authority.  That next step is due to be  taken  January 1, 1990. It entails the nomina tion of a new, Panamanian national  administrator for the Canal, to replace  the current, American national admin istrator. An additional effect of that  move would be to change a current 5to-4 American majority on the Commission, into a 5-to-4 Panamanian ma jority.  The Coats  legislation says simply:  The United States cannot assent  to  those changes until there is a demo cratically elected government in power  in Panama, exercising full authority  over  the  Panamanian military.  In  other words, until Noriega goes.  The sense of the Senate version says  we should not assent; the binding ver sion says we will not.  In fact, we have the leverage, here in  the Senate,  to back up  these state ments of intent under the implement ing legislation for the canal treaties,  the new administrator-even in the ex tremely unlikely event a Noriega-ap pointed administrator would be  ac ceptable to our administration-must  be accorded the advice and consent of  the Senate before assuming his office.  As Senator COATS has made clear,  this action would not constitute an ab rogation of the canal treaties. We will  not  refuse  to  fulfill our obligations  under the treaty. We will simply de clare our intent to move to actually  fulfill those obligations only under the  circumstances  of  democratic  rule  which are essential to the security and  stable operation of the canal by Pana manian authority.  Eleven years ago, during the canal  treaties debate,  I  stood here  in  the  Senate and said the following:  The credibility and personal integrity [of  Panama's leaders] will bear upon their reli ability as Panama's guarantors of the new  treaties.  My guess is that, were all of my col leagues here today, I could get from  them a nearly unanimous ""amen.""  What I feared then has happened.  We are moving to turn over the canal  to a dictator, a drug pusher, and a  money launderer.  I won't have it. And I don't think  the Senate will have it.  It is time to turn the green light to  amber; and  to get ready  to go  red,  unless things change in Panama.  In closing,  let me again commend  the junior Senator from Indiana, and  urge swift and favorable Senate action  of both these important pieces of leg islation.  By Mr. BINGAMAN:  S. 1058.

592,1428,7,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with my colleague, Sen ator GoRE,  in introducing the Cable  Competition Act.  Only 5 years ago, the Congress en acted  the  Cable  Communications  Policy Act, a bill which had my sup port at that time. Today, we are faced  with a dramatically different environ ment than existed when cable was a  fledgling industry. Cable now controls  the source of television into 55 percent  of the homes in America. Yet in virtu ally every community, the cable com pany  is wihtout  competition. This  needs  to be  changed. Good  public  policy does not allow unregulated mo nopolies to go unchallenged.  Today, this bill will begin a discus sion on the cable competition issue.  Our bill is comprehensive and includes  a number of important new initiatives  which I believe will benefit the con sumer, both in urban and rural areas.  For the city dweller, who probably al ready  subscribes  to  cable,  the bill  allows States to regulate the rates a  cable operator may charge to provide  lifeline television services. This should  provide welcome relief or subscribers  who live in cities, and who have suf fered from large price increases from  their local cable companies with no  possibility of redress. For people who  live  in rural areas,  this provision  is  also critical, because cable  is often  used as an antenna service. Not only  do people in our smaller towns suffer  equally from unlimited rate increases  by  the cable  industry, but in many  cases, they do not even have access to  over-the-air signals.  Our  legislation  requires  program ming services whih are affiliated with  cable operations to be made available  to all distributers of programming on  a nondiscriminatory basis. This provi sion is aimed at addressing the complaints of satellite and wireless opera tors who are denied the right to pur chase  programming  at  competitive  rates. The legislation also allows tele phone  companies  to  provide  video  services, but provides important con sumer protections against cross-subsi dization from revenues derived from  regulated  telephone operations. The  bill, however, does not overturn any of  the specified prohibitions of the modi fid final judgment that were imposed  on the regional Bell operating compa nies as a  result of  the breakup of  AT&T. A decision on  that subject  should be addressed in separate legis lation.  For the RECORD, let me state, that I  do not have a 100-percent commitment  to each and every word in this bill.  The  issues  it addresses are complex  and far-reaching. To me, what is more  important than any single provision in  the bill, is our commitment to begin to  debate on  these  issues and  to ser\le  notice that we will no longer tolerate  the status quo.  By Mr. BAUCUS:  S. 1069.

INCREASE IN NONDEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS  TO INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS  ",1989
593,1428,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing legislation to encour age Americans to  increase their sav ings.  I believe that one of  the first  steps we as a nation must take toward  restoring our  international competi tiveness  is  to  increase our personal  savings rate. It is only  through our  savings that we will have the pool of  capital necessary  for  investment  in  new plants, new  equipment,  and a  more productive work force.  My  bill would  permit  individuals  who have established individual retire ment accounts  to contribute up  to  $4,000 per year to their accounts. But  it would not change the rules on de ductions  for contributions  to  IRA's.  The maximum amount that could be  deducted would  remain  $2,000  per  year. However, the earnings on the ad ditional nondeductible $2,000 would  not be taxed until distributed. The tax  rules that now apply to nondeductible  contributions would apply to the addi tional nondeductible contributions.  Under  current  law,  distributions  from an IRA are subject to a 10-per cent tax on the amount of the distri bution if the withdrawal is a prema ture distribution. My bill would pro vide  that  premature  distributions  made for three pref erred uses would  not be subject to the 10-percent tax.

594,1467,7,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, last  week when  I  spoke  in favor of the  FSX agreement, I said the real issue is  our huge trade deficit with Japan, and  I said we must designate Japan for pri ority negotiations under the Super 301  provisions of the 1988 Omnibus Trade  and Competitiveness Act.  This week,  the President and his  Cabinet are discussing exactly which  countries and trade practices should  be so designated. I have spoken to Am bassador Hills and Secretaries Mos bacher and Yeutter. I urged them all  to designate Japan, and in particular,  the web of practices and policies that  prevent  fair  foreign  competition  in  wood products. This may not be the  final answer to our trade deficit prob lems, but it is a useful start.  In urging  this action,  I am by no  means alone. I wish to thank my col league  from  Montana,  Senator  BAucus, for taking the lead this week  on a  joint  letter  to  the President  urging this same course.  Wood products provide a perfect ex ample of the kind of unfair and unrea sonable trade practices and trade defi cit conditions the Super 301 provisions  of the 1988 trade law were designed to  address.  Recently Japan's barriers  to wood  products  imports were  extensively  studied by the International Trade Ad ministration. They list 14 specific ob stacles to increased wood use and in creased wood product imports.  It will surprise no one that Japan  imposes high  tariffs on most wood  products, and admits raw logs free. It  may surprise to learn, however, that  Japan even tariffs wood products that  have no  Japanese competition, and  those that are in short supply. Tariffs,  however, are but the tip of the iceberg  where Japan is concerned. To quote  the report:  Japan has a very complicated system of  subsidies, low interest loans, tax incentives,  and antibankruptcy measures for the forest  products industry.            These programs allow Japanese compa nies that would otherwise be noncompetitve  to continue to produce.  Mr. President,  given  Japan's eco nomic strength, such blatant protec tionism is unacceptable.  Of course, Mr. President, the inter national  prominence  of  our  forest  products  industry was  obtained  at  great private and personal cost-not  by taxpayer subsidy. Mills have closed.  Those still open have permanently cut  their work force, and those workers re maining have in many cases accepted  lower wages. But innovation, modern ization, and cost cutting has reestab lished the U.S. forest products indus try as the world's preeminent competi tor.  Japan protects its own for a variety  of reasons. Inability to compete is ob viously one of them. But does Japan  spare itself injury through this protec tion? The  answer  is  a  resounding  ""No.""  Japan maintains one of the world's  most complex and expensive distribu tion chains of any industrial country;  it is the epitome of the insider's game.  Its building code is in part vastly out dated, which effectively prevents the  introduction of many new wood prod ucts. Japan clearly aims to minimize  the use of wood in construction, de spite the clear preference of Japanese  consumers for wood. And Japan's land use policies effectively .force consum ers  to  live  in cramped, multifamily  structures, although the Japanese pos sess the land, wealth, and desire to live  otherwise.  And what is the effect of these poli cies? Frustrated Japanese consumers  who must pay too much money for in adequate wood products in undesirable  residential conditions delivered by a  subsidized,  protected,  uncompetitive  Japanese wood products industry. And  frustrated U.S. wood products produc ers denied the opportunity to compete  fairly in an open market.  The  net  effect-and  the  clear  intent-of this web of protection is at  every  turn  to minimize  imports of  wood products. And therein lies the  real problem with our trade dealings  with Japan: we cannot expect to make  real improvements in this relationship  so long as we deal with the Japanese  on a barrier-by-barrier basis.  Mr. President, I do not take lightly  the effect of designating a country or  its trade practices for priority negotia tion. Nor, apparently, does Japan.  After  some  initial  concessions on  wood products in 1985, the Japanese  not only declined  to continue  these  talks, they provided over $1 billion in  relief to their wood products industry,  ",1989
595,1493,7,Mr.  LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, on April  27,  1989, the House Select Committee on Hunger  conducted a hearing to examine child health  improvement interventions utilized in many de veloping countries and how  these practices  might be applied here  in  the United States.  We received testimony from Dr. Sandra Huff man, president of the Center to Prevent Child hood Malnutrition, on how breastfeeding pro motion can be used as an agent to improve  the health and nutrition status of infants and  children in this country. I commend this state ment to your attention.  While we are a society which  focuses on  technological advancements  in  the  field of  medicine, in our efforts to develop and imple ment comprehensive programs  for disease  prevention and health promotion, we must not  overlook those simple strategies that are effi cient, cost-effective, and easily practiced. I be lieve the potential benefits outlined in Dr. Huff man's  testimony merit our strong consider ation.  TESTIMONY PRESENTED TO THE SELECT COM MITTEE ON HUNGER, APRIL 27, 1989, BY DR.  SANDRA HUFFMAN, PRESIDENT, CENTER To  PREVENT CHILDHOOD MALNUTRITION  Breastfeeding has unmatched health benefits for infants in both developing and de veloped countries. Many programs in devel oping countries have led to large increases  in breastfeeding rates, with substantial ben efits for child health and significant savings  in health costs. This testimony summarizes  successful programs to promote breastfeed ing  throughout  the world,  and discusses  how the U.S. could benefit from similar ac tivities to increase breastfeeding in our own  population.  Children who are breastfed have fewer  cases of diarrhea,  respiratory  tract  infec tions, allergies and other diseases. In recog nition of these benefits of breastfeeding, the  Surgeon General's report on Health Promo tion and Disease Prevention set one of the  U.S. health objectives of increasing the pro portion of women who breastfeed  their  babies at hospital discharge to 75% and the  percentage of women still breastfeeding at 6  months postpartum at 35% by  the year  1990.  In 1985, nearly 60% of U.S. infants were  ever breastfed, with about 30% still breast feeding at 3-4 months. While breastfeeding  rates in the U.S. among middle and upper  income women now approach the objective  for 1990, rates of breastfeeding among low  income women remain far below. In 1985,  only 35% of women with  incomes below  $7,000 ever breastfed and only 10% were  breastfeeding at 5-6 months. In the U.S.,  women with higher educations are more  likely to breastfeed than women with lesser  educations;  in 1985, 49% of women with  grade  school  or  highschool  education  breastfed compared to 76% of college gradu ates.  In developing countries, the pattern is re versed. Usually it is the more highly educat ed, higher income women who bottle feed as they consider it a more modern way to  feed  their  infants. Unfortunately,  these  women  serve  as  role models  for  other  women, and thus often lead the population  into reduced rates of breastfeeding-a dam aging situation for all sectors.  Besides helping  to prevent health prob lems and their related detrimental effects to  individuals and families, breastfeeding has  cost  implications  for  the  federal govern ment. It has been conservatively estimated  that in the U.S., $25 million could be saved  through  increased  rates of breastfeeding  due to reductions in illness and associated  physician visits and hospitalization.  Decreases in costs for health care have  been observed in many developing countries  that have had programs to promote breast feeding. Lessons  learned  from developing  countries can be helpful for the U.S. Pro grams that have been successful in increas ing rates of breastfeeding have focused on:  (1) Training and education of health profes sionals;  (2) Establishment of appropriate  hospital practices surrounding delivery and  the immediate postpartum period; (3) Peer  support  for  breastfeeding mothers;  (4)  Public education through mass media; and  (5) Health programs and policies, such as  maternity leave and restricted advertising of  breastmilk substitutes.  Training and education of health profes sionals in the advantages of breastfeeding  and techniques to help mothers breastfeed  have proven productive in Indonesia, Thai land, Panama, and the U.S., among others.  Such  training  is needed because current  medical education both in developing and  developed countries does not usually ad dress  lactation management, nor provide  sufficient  information on  the benefits of  breastfeeding. Medical texts in the U.S. gen erally contain more information on prepara tion of formula than on lactation manage ment. Too often wrong advice is given by pe diatricians  to breastfeeding mothers. For  example, if the infant cries, a poorly trained  pediatrician may  suggest  an  additional  bottle. This only interferes with breastfeed ing,  setting up a  cycle of  reduced milk  output, an infant crying more, more bottles,  and  even  less milk production. Properly  trained health professionals will help the  mother increase her milk supply by suckling  the infant more frequently, which results in  greater milk production.  An innovative program was started at the  University of California at San Diego, which  is currently a  separate  training  institute  known as Wellstart. This program  trains  health professionals from developing coun tries in lactation management. The program  has resulted in an ever widening alumni of  trainees who return to their own countries  to promote increases in breastfeeding with  high rates of success. In addition to train ing, Wellstart operates a  lactation clinic  where  new mothers with  breastfeeding  problems can be seen by health profession als who have been trained in lactation man agement. This program is one of the few in  the U.S.  that includes clinical experience.  Unfortunately, there are few funds for such  programs.  Changing hospital practices surrounding  delivery are also effective measures to in crease the rates of initiation of breastfeed ing. Appropriate practices have  included  keeping  the mother and  infant  together  after delivery and suckling by the  infant  soon after delivery. Mothers who have im mediate contact with their infants following  birth are more likely to continue breastfeed ing. Elimination of water, glucose water, or  other supplements to the infant while  in  the hospital have also been shown to be im portant practices in increasing breastfeed ing. Allowing mothers  to breastfeed on  demand  rather  than by a  schedule also  helps  increase successful milk production.  Infants who are given bottles often exhibit  subsequent nipple confusion since sucking  at the breast requires different movements  than sucking a bottle nipple. The use of  milk supplements or water make the infant  less willing  to  suckle because he  is  less  hungry. Continued sucking at  the breast  helps promote  increased milk production  and  is  therefore essential  for  successful  breastfeeding. On-demand feeding is one of  the principal means of promoting increased  milk production, since usually infants fed  on demand will suckle about every 2 hours  during the first few weeks following birth.  A particularly important measure shown  to be effective  in  the Philippines, Costa  Rica, Brazil and the U.S.  is allowing  the  mother and infant to stay together continu ously while in the hospital. Known as room ing-in,  this is one of the most  important  measures  to be  taken,  since  it promotes  many of  the other conditions needed for  successful breastfeeding <on-demand  feed ing,  no  bottles,  and no  replacement of  breastmilk by water or other supplements).  The extent  to which hospital practices  can influence breastfeeding in the U.S. has  been illustrated here in the nation's capital.  Breastfeeding rates in hospitals vary from  over 80% at Georgetown University Hospital  to less than 10% in another local hospital.  While much of this difference is due to the  socio-economic characteristics of the popu lations served by the two hospitals, it also  reflects practices in the two hospitals which  either promote or hinder breastfeeding. For  example,  in Georgetown no supplemental  bottles of glucose water are routinely given,  while at the other hospital glucose is com monly given. Georgetown operates a Lacta tion Center, while no such service is avail able at any other hospital in the D.C. area.  The Lactation Center staff provide breast feeding education and support for postpar tum mothers, and training of nurses and  other health professionals on lactation man agement. They also offer a telephone coun seling service to help women with problems  breastfeeding. Distribution of  formula at  discharge is common at most local hospitals,  while at Georgetown the policy is not to dis tribute packets.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

596,1506,7,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, this Member  had  the intellectually challenging and satisfy ing experience  to be among  the 60 partici pants in the 76th American Assembly, Colum bia University, which met on April  20-23,  1989, at the Arden House in Harriman, NY, to  focus on the global economy of the 1990's as  it relates to American interests. The Honora ble William E. Brock and Dr. Robert D. Hor mats acted as codirectors  for this assembly  program and supervised  the preparation of  papers used as background  reading by  the  participants.  I believe  the  final  report of the assembly,  entitled, ""Seize the Moment,"" is a statement  that deserves the attention of my colleagues  in the U.S. Congress, our staff, the executive  branch,  American  business  interests,  and  Americans generally. While not all participants  in the assembly agree with all aspects of the  statement,  it does  represent  an  unusually  large degree of general agreement given the  complex  and  controversial  nature  of  the  issues and interests involved and the vigorous  discussion and debate that occurred.  I invite  the attention of my colleagues to the following  report of the American Assembly:  SEIZE THE MOMENT: U.S. INTERESTS IN THE  1990's  PREAMBLE  Dramatic changes have taken place in the  global economy-and the pace is  likely  to  continue at a  relentless rate. We see the  next few years as a watershed-a significant  turning point in post-World War II political,  economic,  and security  relations.  It  is  a  uniquely  promising moment  in  history,  when Western Europe  is moving  toward  unity; Japan has attained great economic  power and is seeking appropriate world re sponsibilities; the Soviet Union, several na tions  in Eastern Europe, and China are  turning away from doctrinaire communism  to attempt economic and political reforms;  and  many  developing  countries  have  emerged as pace-setters in political and ecoEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  nomic reform. In short, we have relative  peace and many shared political and eco nomic goals-a large number of which have  been inspired by U.S. example. Moreover,  this  remarkable moment  in  history  is  formed by a fast-moving, multi-dimensional  technological revolution which has height ened the increasing interdependence of na tions.  Yet, at a time that should be triumphant,  the industrialized democracies have permit ted dangerous trade and other economic im balances to build up within the internation al system. Unless corrected soon, they could  engulf the world in a new wave of protec tionism and bring a financial crisis in the  1990s. Those imbalances are rooted in mis taken  and often  self-indulgent  domestic  policies of  the  industrialized democracies.  Responsibility for ensuring a health inter national economy now rests primarily upon  domestic  policy  changes  in  the United  States, Japan, and Western Europe. It is  urgent that the leaders of those nations act  quickly and decisively, The 1990s represent  a decade of enormous opportunity, but we  must no longer ignore the growing dangers.  We need to seize the moment to create a  new architecture for international economic  cooperation, one  that  takes advantage of  the economic strength many of our friends  and allies have attained in recent years. We  need to promote global growth, expand and  liberalize trade, strengthen the internation al development effort, and address  issues  such as drugs and environmental deteriora tion, which  affect  virtually  all  nations  acutely.  Constructing this new architecture poses  an exciting challenge to American leader ship. Having risen to the task of rebuilding  the global economy after World War II, the  United States is at a point in history when  it must again exert  leadership, as  it did  then, to develop a comprehensive strategy  for addressing the myriad issues before the  international  economy.  This  time  the  United States can act with the help of a  group of nations that were unable to play a  major role in the 1940s, but they can and  must now share responsibility for providing  the ideas, leadership, and resources neces sary to meet the challenges ahead.  The world has made remarkable economic  progress since the devastation of World War  II-and Americans  should  feel  a  strong  sense of pride that their nation's leadership  has played a critical role  in  this success.  Most of the goals set by the United States  for  achieving  a  stronger and prosperous  democratic world over the last forty years  have been met beyond expectations: West ern Europe and Japan are thriving and pros perous democracies, market economics has  demonstrated its superiority to communism,  and world  trade and investment have ex panded dramatically.  What  then should our goals be, what  policy instruments should be employed to  achieve them, and what institutional struc tures are best suited to the tasks ahead?  The economic and political relationships  among nations and the underlying charac teristic of the global economy today differ  greatly from those of the 1940s, when cur rent international institutions were created,  and by the end of this century they will be  far different still. Today  the  freedom of  capital flow exerts powerful constraints on  national management, burgeoning popula tions in the developing world exert massive  pressures  for migration, governments  in creasingly seek to manage flows  to  trade  and direct investment, the forces of economMay 18, 1989  ic nationalism have been stronger as globali zation of the world economy renders work ers and industries more vulnerable to inter national  forces; nations artificially create  competitive advantage to the detriment of  others;  trade and current account  imbal ances reflect large domestic imbalances in  the United States and its trading partners;  populations have come to realize how vul nerable they are to one another's lack of en vironmental  responsbility,  remarkable  changes in the previously rigid economies in  the Communist world  reflect  recognition  that they lack global competitiveness and  are unable to meet the basic needs of their  citizens; the world's poorer nations, most of  them  debt-encumbered,  are  experiencing  enormous human and economic problems  which portend social volatility and interna tional instability; and technological changes  cause quick shifts in competitive advantage  and bring the world closer together by per mitting the instant and massive dissemina tion of information and ideas.  Leaders and officials under pressure of  time and politics must make choices that  will influence the course of our lives and so cieties. Often what appear  to be  insur mountable political or resources constraints  to new policies or shifts in priorities, atti tudes, or patterns of resource allocation can  be overcome if benefits of doing so, or the  costly implications of not doing so, are made  dramatically clear. President Franklin Roo sevelt conveyed a  sense of  the costs  to  America of failing to provide Britain with  lend-lease aid by explaining the importance  of helping a neighbor to put out the fire in  his home lest it next spread to yours.  It is frequently asserted that democracies  take bold decisions only in crisis. In the cur rent environment it is essential to build a  new architecture of international economic  cooperation and address internal economic  problems,  to avert a crisis. Failure to act  puts the United States in harm's way-vul nerable to an energy crisis as our import de pendence increases, vulnerable to a finan cial crisis as domestic and international defi cits and our attendant dependence on mas sive imports of foreign capital persist, vul nerable to an outbreak of economiic nation alism as trade issues and imbalances go un attended to, vulnerable to massive instabil ity in the Third World along with massive  immigration pressures as the debt problem  festers, vulnerable to unexampled dangers  to the physical environment, and vulnerable  to the geopolitical consequences of instabil ity in Eastern Europe as their economies de teriorate. Even if such crises never occur, in sufficiently bold action on the domestic and  international economic fronts will mean a  steady drift that renders us less and less ca pable of influencing events and saps Ameri can leadership potential and spirit.  FIRST AMONG EQUALS: RELATIONSHIPS WITH  JAPAN AND EUROPE  From being first,  the United States has  become first among equals, its main rivals  also being  its closest allies:  the European  Community <EC) and Japan. The difficul ties  thus created stem  in  large measure  from the success of earlier American initia tives. Economic reconstruction of Western  Europe and Japan and the political integra tion of  the European Communiuty were,  with  the  successful  containment of  the  USSR, the principal strategic goals of the  United States in the postwar world.

597,1519,7,Mr. DAVIS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay  tribute today to a group of northeast Michigan  Vietnam veterans who are visiting the Wash ington area. This is the largest group of veter ans  from our area  to come  to Washington  during my 11 years in Congress. Many of the  veterans have never been  to  the Nation's  capital and I am sure the tour of the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial will hold special memories  for them.  I am honored to be a part of their  trip and I am especially pleased that we were  able to arrange for a hometown bandmember  to play taps during ceremonies at the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldier. The group also will tour  the White House and  the Pentagon during  their two-day trip. I hope their experience here  is meaningful and  that they will remember it  for year to come.  I would like to thank the northeast Vietnam  veterans for including my office in their visit.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  A&M CONSOLIDATED COMPETES  IN  NATIONAL  BICENTENNIAL  COMPETITION ON  THE  CON STITUTION  AND  BILL  OF  RIGHTS  HON. JOE BARTON  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 18, 1989  ",1989
598,1519,7,Mr. BARTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  acknowledge a group of outstanding students  who  represented  the State of Texas  in  the  ""1989 National Bicentennial Competition on  the Constitution and Bill of Rights"" held re cently in Washington, DC. This group is from  my congressional district, and  they were my  representatives in the State of Texas competi tion which they won.  Twenty-seven students from A&M Consoli dated High School in College Station reached  the national  finals  through much hard work  and dedication by studying  these documents  and  the values and principles  they embody.  These  students are: Kelly Andrews, Karen  Bassichis, Abid Bhimani, Christine Bivins, Josh  Busby, Jennifer Busch, Lisa D'Souza, Richard  De Vaul, Christopher Dinkel, Barbara Ellison,  Kay Fisher, Brian Fiske, John Herring, Brooke  Hill, Chi-Cheng Huang, Jeremy Hyman, Padma  Kodali,  Christina  Laane,  Eric MacGilvray,  Darrin Marquez, Michael McGrann, Kazys Mo tekaitis, Rahim Rajan, Shannon Ramsay, Wil liam  Taparauskas,  Thomas Weaber,  and  David Ray Wright.  I highly commend  these students, along  with  their  teacher, Mr. Bobby Slovak,  their  State coordinator, Ms. Hope Lochridge, and  their district coordinator, Mrs. Barbara Wei singer. They have worked very hard and have  represented Texas well.  Educating our Nation's young people about  the Constitution  is an  investment we  can  never overlook. These students are the deci sionmakers of tomorrow, and we must depend  on them to carry out what our Founding Fa thers envisioned for the future.  IN RECOGNITION OF THE WIN NERS OF THE CREVE COEUR  CHAMBER  OF  COMMERCE  ANNUAL ESSAY CONTEST  HON. JACK BUECHNER  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 18, 1989  ",1989
599,1519,7,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition  of  three  outstanding  young  people from my district: Scott Kelley, Sue Yu,  and Aaron Cooper. These young people de serve our congratulations as  the winners of  the 1989 Creve Coeur Missouri Chamber of  Commerce and the Lions Club Essay Contest.  Scott, Sue, and Aaron will each receive a  scholarship from the Creve Coeur chamber of  commerce and  the Creve Coeur Lions Club  based on  their exceptional understanding of  economics as illustrated by their prize-winning  essays  in  the Chamber of Commerce and  Lions Club annual essay contest. This contest  has  traditionally attempted  to challenge stu9983  dents to  formulate a response  to a specific  question in their answer, combining pragmatic  considerations with social responsibility.  This years question, ""In a capitalist society,  is there an obligation in the business commu nity  to narrow  the gap between  the ""have""  and ""have not's?"" would challenge even the  most seasoned of social architects, but leave  these young people undaunted. Their answers  are notable for their bold and intelligent analy sis, and  reflect  tremendous  insight  into  the  problems which confront our society today. In  their discussion of  these  issues  they have  shown an awareness often  lacking  in more  experienced policymakers.  The  first place answer came  from Scott  Kelley of Westminster Christian Academy who  likened the problem of poverty in America to  Robin Hood of England. His argument, that re distributing wealth for social purposes by any  mechanism is inferior to increasing productivi ty for poverty aleviation, should be must read ing for American policymakers.  For this award-winning answer Scott will re ceive a $2,000 scholarship from the Chamber  and  the Lions Club. The second and  third  place awards of $1,000 each go to Sue Yu of  Parkway Central Senior High School  and  Aaron Cooper of Parkway North Senior High,  but in my book they are all first place winners.  Our Nation is fortunate to have fine young  people such as these and organizations such  as  the Creve Coeur Chamber of Commerce  and  the Creve Coeur Lions Club which en courage these activities. The chamber and the  Lions Club are  to be commended  for taking  an active  interest  in  the education of our  youth, and  for backing this commitment with  the investment in time and money it requires.  This is the sort of private sector initiative we  should, indeed must, encourage.  Our young people are  the window  to  the  future of our Nation. Through  their eyes we  can see tomorrow, with their thoughts we will  dream new dreams. The winners,  indeed, all  of the participants, renew our optimism in the  future of this Nation. For this we thank them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask each of my colleagues to  join me  in congratulating these young Ameri cans and wishing  them success in whatever  field of endeavor they pursue.  IMPORTANCE  VETERANS'  PROGRAMS  OF  PROTECTING  HEALTH  CARE  HON. LARKIN I. SMITH  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 18, 1989  ",1989
600,1519,7,Mr. SMITH of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker,  I  represent a district in which there are two Vet erans' Administration hospitals. The veterans  in my district and their families became deeply  concerned when  they  learned  that elements  of the U.S. Congress were playing politics with  the future of their health care. The system of  medical care for veterans desperately needs  the  supplemental  funding provided  in H.R.  2072. That crucial funding was placed in jeop ardy when  the dire emergency supplemental  appropriations bill was held up by attempts to  saddle  the bill with nonemergency  funding  ",1989
601,5,12,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President,  I  have not had the opportunity to hear  all of the remarks made by the distin guished Republican leader, but I think  I probably heard  them before. Cer tainly I heard them in the Agriculture  Committee markup this morning and  over the last couple of days in our ne gotiations, and our discussions. There  is no one more persistent, more deter mined, and in some ways more eff ec tive in articulating his position than  the Republican leader.  And so it is with due respect that I  rise in strong opposition to his charac terization of  the bill  that was  just  passed in the Senate Agriculture Com mittee moments ago. The fact is-and  the Republican  leader will attest to  this-we have tried for weeks, virtually  months, to arrive at a consensus on  what we should do in disaster legislation this year. Time after time we met  with  the Republican  leadership and  time after time we failed to arrive at  that consensus, as close as we were on  a number of opportunities. Today's  markup was our best shot at consensus  in the realization  that  the drought  continues and worsens in some cases.  We also recognized that we are now  bumping up against the August recess,  implying that we could do nothing else  but pass out a bill, and that we did  this morning.  This bill  really does  three  things.  First of  all,  it  recognizes  that  the  drought does not just affect those who  signed up for the program. It affects  everybody. Our Republican Secretary  of Agriculture  in South Dakota has  made a number of very eloquent state ments with regard to the need to cover  all crops and to be sure that we do it  effectively. This bill does that.  The second thing this bill does very  effectively is come within the guide lines, the bounds, that we face budg etarily. We have  to  respond  to  the  budgetary problems as well as the crit ical agricultural problems as we deal  with drought and other diseases and  this bill does so.  The third and perhaps in some ways  the most effective argument in this  compromise proposal is that it is fair.  Not only does  it deal with program  and nonprogram  crops,  understand ably, with  some differential, but  it  deals with  the broader situation at  hand. It recognizes that under the Re publican proposal, farmers are going  to be required to pay back deficiency  payments in December. I would call it  the ""Grinch Bill"" if I wanted to char acterize it in a negative way, but I am  not going to do that.  The fact is the Lugar-Dole bill would  require farmers, for reasons inexplica ble,  to pay back their advance defi ciency payments at  the  same  time  they are buying Christmas presents. I  cannot figure that out.  Perhaps most importantly in dealing  with fairness, the compromise bill rec ognizes, that it is wrong for us to pit  farmers against farmers. It is a mis take we make in the Senate and Con gress time and time again. We cannot  do that, and this compromise bill rec ognizes  the  importance of ensuring  that all farmers are covered.  In  contrast,  the Lugar-Dole  bill  would  exclude  780,000  com  farms,  698,000 wheat  farms  from  receiving  disaster  assistance,  simply  because  they did not participate in the crop  programs  this year. In the State of  Kansas alone, 9,000 com farms and  41,000 wheat farms would be excluded  under the Lugar-Dole bill. In my own  State of South Dakota, 10,000 com  farms, 24 percent of  the  total, and  11,000 wheat farms, 35 percent of the  total, would be excluded.  ",1989
602,18,12,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  Terry Anderson has now been held in  captivity in Beirut for 1,592 days. One  cannot assign words to the human cost  this captivity has exacted from Terry  Anderson and his  family. While he  continues  to  suffer,  so  does  our  Nation.  I ask unanimous consent that an ar ticle which appeared earlier this year  in the Chicago Tribune be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 28, 19891  PRESIDENT BUSH'S HOSTAGE DILEMMA  <By Mitchell Bard)  In March, Terry Anderson will begin his  fifth year in captivity as a hostage in the  Middle East. He has been held longer than  any other American. For the families of An derson and the other eight hostages, the  change  in administration  in Washington  offers hope for a new effort to bring their  loved ones home. Other governments have  obtained the release of their citizens. The  question is whether President Bush is will ing to follow their examples or adhere to  the unsuccessful Reagan policy.  The signals emanating from Lebanon re garding the hostages are mixed. The kid napers held  a  strong  antipathy  toward  Ronald Reagan and has no desire to give  him the political credit for obtaining the  hostages' release. It is not clear if Bush is  viewed any differently.  Mohammed Mahdi Shams al-Din, deputy  chairman of the Islamic Shiite Council in  Beirut, said on Jan. 11, ""the time has not  yet come""  for a  solution  to  the hostage  problem. He expected some progress after  Bush has been in power for ""a sufficient  period"" but cautioned that the issue had  become more complicated.  In the meantime, Hezbollah, the Iranian backed Lebanese Shiite faction, apparently  has decided to use the hostages as a pawn in  its battle with  its Shiite Amal rivals. Al though the Syrians have expressed a desire  to free the hostages, they still allow the per petrators and other militants free rein in  areas under their control in Lebanon.  One benefit of the arms-for-hostages deal  made by  the Reagan administration was  it  that it ended any doubt as to whether Iran  controlled  the  hostage-takers. The  best  hope for a solution,  therefore, remains in  Tehran. The problem is that factional in fighting among the aspirants for the Aya tollah Khomeini's legacy precludes negotia tions: ""Moderates"" attempting to deal with  ""the Great Satan"" will forfeit their claim to  power. And the outcry over publication of  Salman  Rushdie's  book  ""The  Satanic  Verses"" has halted Iran's movement toward  improving relations with the West, making  the opportunity for talks on the hostages  more unlikely.  Although the situation in Tehran is prob ably worse today than in years past, France  managed to cut a deal to gain the release of  its hostages. The French consistently have  denied making concessions, but according to  a study by the Jaffee Center for Strategic  Studies, French hostages were released in  1986 only two weeks after the government  expelled hundreds of Iranian exiles belong ing  to  the Mujahidin I-Khalk opposition  group. Later that year, two more hostages  were  released after France announced  would repay Iran $330 million of a  loan  made to the Shah.  In 1987, another  two hostages were  re leased.  This  time  the  French  dropped  charges against an Iranian who took refuge  in his government's embassy to avoid being  questioned about possible  involvement  in  that summer's rash of bombings.  Last May, the remaining French hostages  were released by Hezbollah after France re portedly agreed to repay its debt to Iran,  consider the release to a Fatah terrorist and  pay $30 million in ranson to Hezollah.  Two West Germans were kidnapped  in  January, 1987, after West Germany arrested  a member of Hezbollah implicated in the hi jacking of an American plane. The kidnap ers threatened to kill their captives if Ger many extradited the terrorist to the u'iiited  States. The  first  hostage was  released  almost nine months later after the West  Germans agreed, according to Hezbollah, to  release their prisoner. The second hostage  was supposed  to be released  later  in ex change for $3 million. The Jaffee Center  study notes that the West Germans, unlike  either France or the U.S., made concessions  to the kidnapers rather than to Iran.  The Soviet Union  took a different ap proach. In 1985, four of its diplomats were  seized in Beirut. Hezbollah executed one of  the hostages and threatened to kill the rest  if the Soviets did not force Syria to lift its  siege of Tripoli. A cease-fire was later an nounced in the northern Lebanese city and  the Soviets were freed.  The Soviets were rumored to have taken  more direct action  to free  its citizens. A  team of KGB agents kidnaped either a rela tive of one of Hezbollah's leaders of three of  this assistants. They were murdered and  their mutilated bodies sent  to Hezbollah  with a warning that further action would be  taken if the diplomats were not released. No  other Soviets were kidnaped.  The people holding the Americans have  demonstrated that they can hold out for  years. We have done the same, but to what  end?  It is  true, as Henry Kissinger has  argued, that saving one American's life is  not worth risking the security of all Ameri cans. But of what value is it to be an Ameri can if our government gives the impression  it will abandon us?  Israel  is often applauded for  its policy  toward terrorists, but even though the Is raelis share our  reluctance  to negotiate,  they have made deals with even their bitterest enemies. Israel believes it must protect  the lives of all its citizens.  President Bush can obtain the release of  American hostages, but to do so he will have  to make concessions-to Iran or the kidnap ers-or authorize a covert operation to in timidate the perpetrators.  RABBI GUNTER HIRSCHBERG  ",1989
603,18,12,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, it is  with  sadness  that  I  rise  today  to  inform my colleagues of the death of  an outstanding  religious  and  social  leader and great New Yorker.  Rabbi Gunter Hirschberg,  senior  rabbi at Temple Rodeph Sholom  in  Manhattan and president of the New  York Board of Rabbis, died just last  week. His death means the loss of a  great Jewish leader but also of a great  man-a man of compassion,  justice,  and vision.  Rabbi Hirschberg was born in Berlin  in 1920 and only escaped the Holo caust due to his involvement in a Brit ish-German  exchange  program  for  young students. His parents, however,  did not escape and were sent to their  deaths.  After serving with  the Australian  Army, he came to the United States to  pursue a singing career. Although he  had intended to be an opera singer, his  vocal talent and spirituality led him to  a career as a cantor, the beginning of a  long  and  prosperous  career with  Rodeph Sholom. After further study,  Rabbi Hirschberg was  ordained  in  1963, became associate  rabbi at the  synagogue and  in 1972 was named  senior rabbi, a position in which he  served until his death.  Rabbi Hirschberg was  a man of  wisdom and a man of action.

605,31,12,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, that is  most helpful. We certainly wish to ex press our appreciation to the Senator  from Ohio. He has taken a very strong  role in the entire B-2 debate. Those of  us on the committee, and indeed the  Senate as a whole, have a profound re spect for his knowledge of aviation  and, particularly as a former test pilot,  given the situation in which this coun try now finds itself with this unique  type of aircraft, with certain designs  with which we have, really, had no ex perience heretofore  in actual flight.  Although at one point, it is interest ing, Mr. President,  and  someday  I  hope to develop this chapter, the Air  Force did have three or four Flying  Wing aircraft.  For some  reason  that eludes me,  even though they worked,  they tore  them all up, scrapped every one of  them. Not one single Flying Wing was  ever preserved  for  a museum  and  therein lies a bit of mystique, a mys tery, that I have never been able to  fathom.  Mr. President,  for  some  time, at  least for several days,  I have been  working with the White House, and,  indeed, have spoken to the President  on two occasions, about the need to  inform the Senate more fully with re spect to the issue of the accounting  rules which has been discussed here  this afternoon.  I would like to read a letter which  was delivered just a short time ago to  me and to the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee  from  the Presi dent's National Security Adviser, Mr.  Scowcroft. I  read it simply to make  Senators aware of the content. It is  available here and copies will be dis tributed  so  Senators  preparing  to  enter into this debate this afternoon  will have the benefit of the President's  views as expressed by his National Se curity Adviser.  DEAR SENATOR w ARNER: As you know, al though there still remains much to be done  before  signing  a START agreement, we  have made considerable progress. However,  I ~ concerned that the current Congres siotmJ debate over the future of the B-2  stealth  bomber  threatens  to  slow  this  progress and could undermine  the entire  agreement. It is important that we not send  the wrong signal to the Soviets regarding  U.S.  resolve  to maintain a strong, viable  triad.  This is a critical year for the B-2. It offers  the most advanced aircraft technology we  have ever flown. It is not just an evolution ary change  in  technology-it  is a break through, the future of air combat. From a  military sense, we cannot afford  to walk  away from this great advancement. Without  the B-2 we will forfeit our capability to pen etrate the world's most modem air defense  system and begin an inevitable loss of the  manned bomber as a stabilizing element of  strategic deterrence.  We have structured our entire START ne gotiating strategy-and our strategic force  modernization package-around the objec tive of increasing stability and reducing the  risk of war. The ""slow-to-anger"" features of  the manned, penetrating bomber are central  to these objectives.  Both sides agree the bomber is the most  stabilizing nuclear system in that it holds  significant numbers of targets at risk in re taliation but cannot be regarded as a first strike system. It is for that reason that the  bomber weapon counting rule  tentatively  agreed  to at Reykjavik  in 1986 between  General Secretary Gorbachev and President  Reagan places such a high premium on pen etrating bombers. This rule counts the pen etrating bomber loaded with an entire pay load of nuclear bombs and short-range mis siles as only one strategic nuclear delivery  vehicle and one warhead against the ceilings  tentatively agreed to in the START talks, of  1,600 and 6,000,  respectively. By contrast,  each ballistic missile warhead will count as  one against the 6,000 limit. The U.S. posi tion on ALCMs is that each ALCM-carrying  bomber would count as ten weapons against  the 6,000 ceiling, regardless of the number  actually carried.  The B-2 has been a cornerstone of the  START agreement since negotiations began.  Further delays  in the program will only  raise increasing doubts in the minds of the  Soviets about our resolve and commitment  to maintain the bomber leg of the triad.  This would seriously undermine our capabil ity to negotiate from a position of strength.  Even worse, should the program eventually  be cancelled,  it would  force us  toward a  major restructuring of the U.S. negotiating  position.  Mr. President, I will have more to  say later following  the distinguished  chairman on this particular issue. But,  as I said briefly this morning, in my  humble judgment we can discuss here  what takes place after a first strike or  the exchange following the use of any  nuclear system by the Soviet Union  against the United States. But in my  judgment,  the B-2 stands for deter rence.  I disagree with my distinguished col league from Maine, because  I  think  the B-2 remains the biggest question  mark in the minds of the Soviet plan ner, and its job is to stay on the air strip with the exception of an occa sional training mission or with the ex ception of possibly a conventional mis sion. And I  join with my friend from  Ohio saying it does have a very limit ed, rare opportunity to be used in that  role.  The mission of the B-2 is to stay on  that airstrip in the United States of  America. The moment it has to cross  the Soviet borders on a penetrating  mission,  then deterrence has  failed.  What price of that deterrence, no one  can calculate.  I will talk later about the conven tional role, and I compliment the Sen ator from Ohio. As I sat here and lis tened to the conventional role chal lenge,  I  thought of earlier missions  flown by our aviators. And I think as  we address that issue we should assure  ourselves if, in fact, this B-2 can pene trate  virtually  undetected  in  the  Soviet Union,  then certainly against  any other target in a nation with less  air defenses it will be highly success ful. What price do we assign to the life  of one airman? Or what price do we  assign to one downed airman who is  held hostage if we have to get up that  ransom? To me, the cost of that B-2  bomber is well worth saving any life or  being confronted with any ransom of a  downed flier.  ",1989
606,31,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Georgia.  ,1989
607,31,12,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, I want to  make it clear as to my response to the  Senator from Maine. What I hope I  said very clearly was not that the Sovi ets did not have a fear of the B-2, but  that  the Soviets would not have a  reason to believe that the B-2 was a  first strike system. That is a different  situation than saying that they would  not respect the B-2 and calculate very  strongly the ability of the B-2 to sur vive an attack and to be able to suc cessfully retaliate against Soviet tar gets.  Those are  two different  things.  I  think we want to make sure that we  always are very, very successful in de terring and making certain we make  the Soviets understand we have the  ability to survive and retaliate. But I  do not believe it is in our best strategic  interests nor, frankly, in the Soviets'  best strategic interests in the reverse  situation, to lead the Soviet Union to  believe that we are about to launch or  are capable of launching a first strike  attack.  Those are two different things. One  is destabilizing and the other is very  stabilizing. I think we always have to  keep that in mind in debating arms  control as well as our strategic pro grams.  Mr. President, the course the Con gress elects to follow this year with re spect to the B-2 bomber is in all likeli hood the most controversial issue in  this bill. At over $500 million a copy,  including  the research and develop ment money, and I will discuss that in  a minute, and with a  total program  cost of over $70 billion, many in the  Congress and around the country are,  not unexpectedly, suffering from what  has been called sticker shock. All of us  are going  through  some degree of  sticker shock regarding the cost of this  aircraft.  In an era of tight defense budgets  and massive Federal deficits, any deci sion to spend these sums of money on  a particular defense program obvious ly cannot and should not be  taken  lightly. If this bomber cannot be justi fied on the basis of cost and perform ance it should not be built. Period.  I know of no single weapons system,  whether B-2 or any other program,  which is so valuable it must be bought  whatever the price. So I will not make  that argument. I believe, however, the  B-2 is well worth the cost that is now  projected,  provided we  assure  our selves it can and will perform as adver tised.  ",1989
608,44,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Chair must inquire: What is the will of  the Senate?  ,1989
609,44,12,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, I suggest  the absence of a quorum.  ",1989
610,44,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the  roll.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  ",1989
611,44,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President,  I be lieve that we have a great deal to be  proud of in presenting this year's De fense Authorization Act to the Senate.  It is far more free of micromanage ment and damaging amendments than  in past years. Our act  responds  to  President Bush and Secretary Che ney's concern with the budget deficit  and the need to keep tight limits on  Federal spending. It is free of the kind  of destructive  arms control amend ments that impede the President's ef forts and has been a major impedi ment in the past, but it has strong pro visions that reflect both the commit tee's interest in making every effort  possible  to  reach meaningful  arms  control agreements and to ensure that  such agreements really do reduce the  risk and cost of war.  There are many detailed provisions  we can be proud of that represent the  result of a dialog with the administra tion, rather than arbitrary microman agement. The act contains many provi sions that will strengthen our conven tional capabilities. It represents  the  committee's deep  concern with  the  need for adequate levels of munitions  and to avoid creating a hollow force  structure by underfunding such sup plies.  The act funds the naval and power  projection forces we need, while ex pressing the proper concern that every  effort be made to manage and modern ize these forces as effectively as possi ble. The act does not reflect the kind  of damaging debate over the carrier  we have had in previous years, but it  does require better reporting on the  nature and cost of modernizing our  carrier forces.  The act reflects our growing concern  with the lack of adequate efforts by  the services  to develop cost-effective  force modernization plans that can be  implemented within current resource  constraints. For example, it requires a  comprehensive long term naval avia tion plan and the Army to develop a  realistic long-term plan for improving  our armor and antiarmor capabilities.  This legislation clearly reflects the  committee's concern with manpower  and readiness. There are strong provi sions  to ensure we  retain key skills  such as pilots. There are provisions  that send a clear message to the Na tion's budgeteers that they cannot bal ance  the national budget at the ex pense of fair pay for our servicemen,  or by hacking away at cost-of-living al lowances and flight pay.  There also are provisions that reiter ate the committee's concern with the  lack of any  integrated readiness  re porting system for any service  that  links key factors like Active and Re serve readiness, sustainability, and sea  and air lift.  The act reflects our concern with  the fact that we risk creating a hollow  National Guard and Reserve structure  because we do not have a cohesive con cept for ensuring the overall readiness  and balance of these forces. It reflects  our concern  that we have no  real  world capability to meet our commit ment to provide 10 divisions to NATO  in 10 days, and do not even really  know the extent of the problems that  have created a ""hollow commitment""  in the late 1980's that is as dangerous  as the ""hollow forces"" of the 1970's.  THE NEED FOR STRATEGY  Having said this, however, I have to  note that the Defense Authorization  Act also reflects the same basic limita tions  that are present  in  the fiscal  years 1990-91 budget submission, and  in the documentation supporting this  ",1989
612,57,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Kansas.  ,1989
613,57,12,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. Preisdent, I  thank  the chairman and the manager on this  side, Senator WARNER  and Senator  NUNN.  Mr. President, the United States has  come to a critical juncture. We must  decide now how our strategic forces  will be structured over the next sever al decades.  This is a tough decision-not just be cause of the costs  involved, but be cause we will have to live with our ac tions for some time to come.  For over 40 years, nuclear deterrence  has guaranteed the safety and free dom of this country. For the better  part of that time, our nuclear deter rence has been based on the concept  of a nuclear triad.  I think we would all agree that the  triad has served us well. I think that is  also  the President's view. The  triad  figures prominently in the President's  strategic modernization package.  Now, I want to emphasize the word,  ""package."" Our bombers,  land-based  ICBM's, and our SLBM forces are in dependent, but they work as a pack age-they each have their particular  role in deterrence. I would also add  that SDI is a key part of that modern ization package.  The President has sent to the Con gress his plans for modernizing each  leg of  the  triad. He has decided to  move forward with two ICBM's, the  D-5 SLBM, and the B-2.  Now, I think we all agree that our  bomber forces are no less important in  that  triad  than our other strategic  forces. And, I think we all agree that  they need to be modernized.  Some of you will say, ""yes, we need  modernization, but not at the B-2's  price."" I think we were all taken aback  the first time we saw the figures. Let  us not forget, we are buying the latest  technology-the best America has to  off er-and we need the best because it  will have to last. We are making deci sions that will have consequences for  our national  security  for  years  to  come.  These consequences are even greater  if we reach a START agreement with  the Soviets. A manned penetrating  bomber will become even more impor tant under a ST ART treaty than it  was over the past 40 years. The B-2 is  at  the center of U.S.  strategy  for  achieving stability at reduced levels.  Now, it seems to me that the Armed  Services Committee has given this pro gram the serious attention it merits.  They have not only recognized the im portance of the B-2 in terms of our de terrence strategy and arms control sta bility, but have also recognized that a  program which involves such substan tial investment during these times of  tight dollars, requires close monitor ing.  I  commend my colleagues on  the  Armed Services Committee for taking  a  sound approach  toward  this pro gram. The B-2 means a lot of money  spent, but thanks to the efforts of the  committee  it will  be money  spent  wisely. I urge the Senate to support  their approach and this amendment.  Mr. President, I would like to end  my remarks with an excerpt from an  article written  in 1953,  in Aviation  Week, at the time the United States  was considering the B-52:  Feeling in some U.S. Air Force quarters is  that the difference between B-47 and B-52  performance is not worth the cost of the  latter program. Strategic Air Command also  anticipates getting supersonic bombers soon  enough to make the B-52 strictly a short in terim measure.  After 30 years of the B-52 we know  better.  I thank the Senator for yielding the  floor.  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.  ",1989

615,57,12,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, we  thank  the distinguished Republican  leader. It is always wise to look back  and examine history. It indeed  is a  rearview window of much of our activi ties of life. I think that citation of his torical precedent of the B-52 should  carry great weight with many today  who question  this price  tag, which  price tag, as the leader knows, has ba sically been information available  to  ",1989

For the past 11 years Reverend  Wegener  has  been  the  pastor  of  Georgetown Lutheran Church here in  the District of Columbia as well as  serving as  the Lutheran Church  in  America's campus minister at Ameri can University  and  at Georgetown  University. While I am a member of  our Savior's Lutheran Church in Fond  du Lac, WI, when we are in Washing ton, my family and I very much enjoy  participating in the life of Reverend  Wegener's congregation, where we are  stimulated by and learn much from  his sermons.  My colleagues in the House may be  interested to learn that the gentleman  who led us this morning in the Pledge  of Allegiance,  the  gentleman  from  South Carolina CMr. SPENCE], was a  member of Reverend Wegener's con gregation for many years while Rever end Wegener was there at St. Peters  Lutheran Church in Lexington, SC.  I should also  like  to welcome  the  Reverend's wife, Ellie, other members  of the Wegener family, and members  of the congregation who have joined  us on this occasion.  WHO GETS THE TAX BREAKS?  (Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  ",1989
617,96,12,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  1980 Ronald Reagan said:  in  I'm going to cut your taxes, and I'm not  going to stop there. I'm going to cut your  boss' taxes, and when I do, you are going to  have more money in your pocket and you  can spend that money. Even though I cut  your taxes, the Gross National Product is  going  to grow and our tax revenues are  going to grow, even though you pay less  taxes.  Well, here  is how that worked. If  you were a  family of  four making  $25,000, you got a  tax break about  enough to take your family to a good  dinner.  If you made  $250,000  you  could take that tax break and buy a  brand new Mercedes Benz,  the best  one made, and then take your family  to dinner. So much for the tooth fairy!  Now President Bush wants  to cut  the capital gains tax. I say, right on,  Speaker FOLEY, keep fighting before  the cab drivers in New York are haul ing Americans around in rickshaws.

618,96,12,Mr.  SMITH  of Mississippi.," Mr.  Speaker, I call attention today to the  House Energy and Commerce Commit tee, as it relates to the war on drugs.  Here is another committee that has  jurisdiction over  the Nation's drug control efforts, and the work of the  drug czar. Here is another part of the  maze of more than 80 committees, sub committees and select committees that  the drug czar must pass through to  arrive at a national drug-control strat egy.  Mr. Speaker,  the American people  are expecting a  lot from the war on  drugs. My constituents in south Mis sissippi tell me drugs and crime are  their No. 1 issue of concern. Surveys  show the same is true across the coun try. Now, the people expect to see re sults.  Will it not be a shame if we cannot  give them any results? Will it not be a  shame if the drug czar, Bill Bennett,  cannot get anything done because he  has  to  spend  from  now until  the  middle of next year in a maze of con gressional panels? Will it not it be a  shame if the American people find out  the war on drugs is just a public rela tions campaign?  Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress  to consolidate these panels into one ef fective committee. It is time to fight  the war on drugs by troop, and not by  choir. I urge my support for consolida tion legislation.

620,161,12,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of  the Dellums-Boxer amendment  to H.R.  2461, the Defense Authorization Act of 1989. I  do so because I strongly believe that the Na tion's scarce resources are being squandered  on  the strategic defense initiative  [SDI], and  that it is time to put this idea to rest once and  for all.  The SDI was not  the product of careful,  thoughtful scientific  research, but  the brain child of a handful of self-interested nuclear  theorists. Before this costly and complicated  idea could be scrutinized by independent sci entists, President Reagan mounted an enor mous public relations campaign  for the SDI.  Before any  research had gotten underway,  President Reagan had already announced that  the United States favored scrapping our long standing commitment  to  the ABM  treaty  in  order  to pursue  the SDI  fantasy. Even as  mounting budget deficits suggested  that we  needed  to  take a second  look at programs  like  the SDI,  the President refused  to  listen  and urged even higher levels of spending.  Mr. Chairman, we have already spent $20  billion  pursuing  President  Reagan's  pipe dream. First we were promised a comprehen sive defensive shield against incoming ballistic  missiles.  Scientist  after  scientist  said  it  couldn't be done, but the SDI project went for ward anyway. When  research  indicated  the  scientists were right, supporters of SDI came  up with the idea of a limited defensive shield  that would enhance deterrence by stopping  some unknown percentage of incoming mis siles. When scientists again demonstrated the  flaws of this limited shield,  the SDI boosters  developed the ""Brilliant Pebbles"" concept, a  space-based  defense  depending  on  small  rockets being able to intercept enemy missiles  during the boost phase.  So what have we bought at the end of this  mad search? Certainly not a defensive shield.  Certainly not a feasible, affordable defensive  system that would enhance our security. Cer tainly not commercial applications of the SDI  technology. No, what we have bought  is a  huge budget deficit and a pile of glossy brief ing books describing our  former President's  dream.  That  is why  the Joint Chiefs of Staff this  past April recommended a significantly lower  level of spending for SDI and stated that the  United States ""should not insist on the explicit  right eventually to deploy extensive antimissile  defenses."" I share the skepticism of the Joint  Chiefs, and their concern for the ABM treaty,  and  I suggest that in  this time of budgetary  constraints, we do the smart thing and aban don the goal of quick deployment of SDI tech nologies.  Let us instead rely on the proven worth of  our strategic deterrent, pursue arms control  talks with the Soviet Union, and keep SDI re search at  the reasonable  level proposed  in  the Dellums-Boxer amendment.

625,174,12,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, today, the gentleman  from Kentucky, my  colleague  and  ranking member  on  Investigations  Subcommittee, and I bring before the  House  a  drug  interdiction package  based on extensive hearings and staff  work. This is a package that the House  can be proud of-not a quick response  to the floor action and politics of the  moment.  In last year's Defense authorization  bill, the Congress seized the initiative  and, under the leadership of our late  colleague, Bill Nichols, created a new  role for the military in drug interdic tion. Today, we clarify, strengthen and  fund that new role.  Let me tell you what this package is  not:  It is not the answer to the enormous  drug problem in this country.  It is not a program which will de stroy  the  readiness  of  the Armed  Forces.  It is not a plan to put the military  on the streets enforcing the laws of  this country.  This package calls upon the military  to help fight the real threat to our na tional security in a way that enhances  conventional  readiness,  without  making  the military a  law enforce ment agency.  Last year we put our money where  our mouth was to the tune of $300 mil lion. We are making progress. We have  seen some successes,  some changing  patterns  of  smuggling,  and  some  changing attitudes on the part of the  Department of Defense. This year we  put our money where our mouth is to  the tune of $450 million.  Here is what we fund: $100 million  for  operations-steaming  days  and  flying hours, $125 million for equip ment such as radars and aerostats and  associated communications, $70 mil lion for State National Guard oper ations, $50 million for  interoperable  communications gear for law enforce ment agencies, $48 million for aircraft  conversions <Marine OV-10), $35 mil lion for intelligence support, $20 mil lion for drug-related R&D for law en forcement agencies, and $1 million for  Civil Air Patrol flying hours in sup port of law enforcement agencies.  Once again Congress must seize the  initiative because the President's and  Defense Secretary's budget contained  no funding for drug interdiction. We  know what the people of this country  are concerned about in the area of na tional  security-and  drugs  is  their  number one concern. Make no mistake  about  it,  this  is a national security  matter. Congress must  respond and  this package keeps the initiative in the  Congress.  I  urge my  colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to get behind  this program and send a clear message  to our citizens and the drug smugglers  alike.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  gentleman  from Massachusetts CMr.  MAVRouLEsl  has consumed  3112 min utes.  ",1989
626,174,12,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield  3 minutes  to  the  ranking  member, the distinguished gentleman  from Kentucky CMr. HOPKINS].  ",1989
627,174,12,Mr. HOPKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank my colleague for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to join  my friend and Chairman of the Inves tigations Subcommittee, NICK MAv ROULES,  in bringing  this comprehen sive military drug interdiction amend ment before  the House.  I want  to  extend my congratulations to the gen tleman for his leadership in this area.  Everyone  in  this Chamber knows  that the war on drugs is being lost.  Look at our schools,  look at our  streets, look at the borders and in our  Nation's Capital City the drug smug glers and drug traffickers are laughing  at the best efforts of our law enforce ment community. They need help.  It should be clear that America must  deploy whatever  resources,  like  the  military and use them where prudent  and necessary.  For the past 2 years, the House has  adopted  amendments  during  this  debate strongly directing the Depart ment of Defense to help out in this  war on drugs.  Last year, the House-Senate confer ence yielded an agreement which es tablished a brand new mission for the  military in the area of drug interdic tion.  Predictably,  the military's immedi ate knee-jerk reaction was one of skep ticism and opposition, but I believe  this is changing. They wouldn't volun teer, so we drafted them.  After a number of hearings and ex tensive  consultation with  the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, I am pleased to report  that progress is being made.  The Department of Defense is begin ning to formulate the necessary plans  and resources to put together a credi ble  and effective drug enforcement  plan.  Last year, we not only gave them the  charter, we also gave  them funds to  get  this effort off  the ground and  meet the challenge head on.  With our amendment today, we are  ready to take the second step.  We have crafted a responsible, meas ured and effective package which de serves  the  strong  support  of  this  House.  In the future-consider using-spe cial operations like SEAL teams who I  think would welcome  to help with  drug interdiction.  But for now, vote ""yes"" on the Mav roules drug interdiction amendment.  ",1989

629,174,12,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to thank the gentleman from Massa chusetts for yielding me 1 minute, and  want to thank him and his colleague  the  gentleman  from Kentucky  for  doing good work in this entire area. I  have a question of the gentleman.  ",1989
630,187,12,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to commend the gentleman on his ar gument. He is absolutely right, by the  United States showing the will of the  West  and  going  forward with  the  ground launch cruise missile and the  Pershing missile, we brought the Sovi ets to the bargaining table. Members  could use exactly the same argument  that it was a waste of money to have  ever built these in the first place, but  the facts are, if we had not built these,  the Soviets would never have removed  the SS-20 that they were intimidating  our allies with.  This is a very important manif esta tion of the will, not only of this coun try but of the Western alliance. Mr.  Gorbachev has been over there driving  the wedge, and we need to show our  allies that it has not worked, and show  our adversaries that it has not worked.  I commend the gentleman.  ",1989
631,187,12,Mr. KYL.," Mr. Chairman, SRAM-T is  the No.  1 priority of SACEUR,  a  weapon that our National Security Ad viser and Secretary of Defense have  written to us saying, whatever you do,  do not reduce the funding of this very,  very important program.  As a result, Mr. Chairman, I urge all  Members to vote no on the Dellums  amendment  to zero out the funding  for  this  very  important  tactical  weapon  in Europe,  the SRAM-T.  I  urge all Members to vote no on the  Dellums amendment.  ",1989
632,187,12,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman, first,  I  suggest that we already have  the  SRAM-T missile. The opponents of  my  amendment  suggest  that  the  SRAM-T missile being deployed  in  Europe is unsafe,  it would not meet  European standards, but the SRAM-T  is deployed here. I find that fascinat ing. That is not acceptable on the con text of Europe, but it is acceptable to  be deployed here among the American  people. I do not understand that argu ment.  No.  2, we  still  have  assigned  to  NATO 1,500 warheads, plus bombers,  plus Trident submarines, assigned to  NATO.  Fifteen  hundred warheads,  bombers, and Trident submarines, but  not  enough,  not  only  to  destroy  Europe, but  the entire world. Why  two additional  would we need  these  weapons systems?  My colleagues suggest that R&D is  only $270 million. That is just the nose  under the tent.  D 1530  Once we go  to  full scale develop ment, once we go to production, we are  talking about billions of dollars, and  now we are talking about real money.  We are not talking about simply R&D;  we are talking about billions of dollars  to build these weapons that we do not  need and that we can negotiate away.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would sug gest to my colleagues that we ought to  wake up and smell  the coffee. The  world is changing, the cold war is over.  Let us quit marching  into  the well  talking about the ""Evil Empire."" This  is not the cold war era. If Margaret  Thatcher, who is no flaming radical by  any stretch of  the  imagination, can  awaken to the reality that the cold  war is over, can we not in this body un derstand that there are new emerging  realities in the world?  We do not need SRAM-T, and we do  not need the follow-on to Lance. What  we need is people with enough courage  and enough heart to sit down and ex ploit the potential of this movement,  to  take  the world  toward peace,  to  take the world  toward disarmament.  We continue to be the hawks here, as suming that we can engage in nuclear  war.  Mr. Chairman, our children do not  need it. Neither do our children's chil dren. I ask the Members to join me in  stopping this $55 billion.  ",1989
633,187,12,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Chairman, I want to voice  my opposition to the amendment to eliminate  authorization for the SAAM-T. With all due re spect to my honorable colleague from Califor nia,  I do not believe  that  in  funding  the  SAAM-T the Air Force violated  the spirit of  the INF Treaty.  The INF Treaty is very clear as to the types  and ranges of the missiles it sought to elimi nate. They were  ground-launched missiles  with a range of 500 to 5,000 kilometers. The  SAAM-T missile is air launched and its maxi mum range would be well under 500 kilome ters. Further discussion of  this point  is not  possible because we are in open session.  Furthermore, I wish to point out that in de veloping a missile such as the SAAM-T, the  United States will match an already existing  Soviet capability. Soviet missile systems, such  as  the AS-X-16 Kickback, and  the  longer  range AS-3 and AS-4, carried on Backfire  bombers, are all comparable to the SAAM-T.  During negotiations, which  I hasten  to point  were painstaking and  thorough, a decision  was made to exclude such missiles from the  INF Treaty. This coupled with  the  fact  that  similar Soviet systems already exist, suggest  that in no way is the SAAM-T a violation of  the spirit of the INF Treaty.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge my colleagues to re store funding to the SAAM-T Program. Devel",1989
634,200,12,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, first  on the substantive point, if the gentle man turned to page 7 of the amend ment, he would see very clearly that  the provision entitled ""Inapplicability  to  foreign  persons  licensed  by  an  MTCR country,"" member country who  grants export license, subsection does  not apply in this case, which is directly opposite to the point the gentleman  made.  ",1989
635,200,12,Mr. WELDON.," That may be  the  case.  If there  is  a  consideration,  I  should have looked at it. I apologize.  However, the point is, we have not  considered this legislation in the com mittee. It is unfair to ask members in  the Committee on Armed Services to  add a substantive piece of legislation  in this nature without giving members  the opportunity to debate to air the  pros and cons, and to have 5 minutes  back and forth on this issue. I do not  think we should vote.  ",1989
636,200,12,Mr. BERMAN.,"  If the gentleman  would yield further, procedurally, the  Committee on Foreign Affairs has con ducted hearings on this subject.  The committees  to which  this bill  has been referred in its freestanding  form have consented to the jurisdic tion of this committee.

",1989
641,200,12,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself 3 % minutes.  Mr. Chairman, our country contin ues to lose the war on drugs because  we persist in waging the war with our  hands tied and most of our weapons  sheathed. It is my often-voiced opinion  that we are not going to win this war  until we actively employ our military  to stop the flow of drugs pouring into  our country.  What we need to do is close our bor ders  except  for  strictly designated,  well-published  and  constantly  pa trolled corridors of exit and entry for  civilian ships and planes. All crafts  seeking to enter the United States out side these corridors should then, upon  some identification, be shot down or  sunk by our Armed Forces.  To those who say the task cannot be  done, cannot be accomplished by the  military, I say then what is our mili tary for? If we cannot stop the invas tion of drugs into the United States,  how can they be expected to def end  our shores from invasions by foreign  countries? Our military can win this  war on drugs, and they can do it quick ly.  I  have  advocated  this  course  of  action in a meeting with our drug czar,  William Bennett, who is not adverse to  my contention. Endless talk, bleeding heart wailing, and short-term jail sen tences in comfortable quarters for our  enemies never won any war. This con flict against drugs will ultimately be  won with the assistance of air-to-air  missiles and ship-to-ship missiles. How  many more millions of American lives  will be ruined or lost before we really  get serious and fight to win?

It is a  very  important  amendment,  and  I  think it really will define what this bill  is ultimately about.  Secretary Cheney came to the De partment and he made some choices,  and he  thinks  they  are  the  right  choices.  I  do not agree with  those  choices. I think we can do better than  that. I think in the main, the commit tee did that. The choice the committee  made was not to fund the strategic de fense initiative or the B-2 bomber to  the extent that the Secretary wanted,  but  instead to add some dollars for  interdicting drugs, to add some dollars  for cleaning up nuclear waste, and to  add  some  dollars  to  conventional  6112  D 1850  I  I  afford everything, and that is what  the Cheney budget does.

654,239,12,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, self-decep tion is an all too common disorder. We  can all deceive ourselves. We can all  believe that something  is  true-even  when this belief is directly contradict ed by the facts-by hard, cool reality.  SELF-DECEPTION  In an article published yesterday,  the Washington Post seems to be en gaging in a  little self-deception of its  own. It wants to believe-wants des perately to believe-that the American  people do not care about the so-called  flag issue; and that the constitutional  amendment to protect the flag from  desecration does not enjoy much sup port.  I do not know about other Senators,  but  this Senator has  received more  than 400  letters from all across  the  country backing our efforts to protect  the flag.  In fact, I brought in about 400 let ters, a  rather substantial amount.  I  have not answered them all, but there  is some of the mail coming in on the  flag  and  the  constitutional  amend ment. Maybe  the Post does not get  much mail. Maybe the liberals do not  write as much as the people outside  the beltway.  So  here  is  care.  Nevertheless,  the  liberals are out  there with their ""spin,"" hoping that  the  constitutional  amendment  flies  permanently at halfstaff.  The issue is not going to go away.  Some would  like  it  to go away and  some of the leading liberal newspapers  who keep saying it is an infringement  on the first amendment, in my view,  are engaging in deception.  proof-Americans  the  THE SIMPLE TRUTH  But what is the simple truth? The  simple truth is that the vast majority  of the American people want a consti tutional amendment-by 71  percent,  according  to  the  latest Gallup poll.  Americans want  to protect our flag  from the desecrators.  They want a lasting, permanent, so lution  to a Supreme Court decision  that they believe was a grave mistake.  And they do not want a solution that  may work. They want a solution that  is guaranteed to work.  THE PEOPLE OF KANSAS  I know that the hard-working people  of Salina, KS,  feel  this way.  In my  hand, I have a petition signed by many  of my friends in Salina, KS. In addi tion to the letters, there are hundreds  of names on the petition. They are  just good, hard-working people. They  do  not  take  the Washington Post.  They  do  not  take  the New York  Times. They go  to work every day.  They attend memorial services. If my  colleagues  ever  had  any  question  about not only the symbolism but the  importance of  the American  flag,  I  would recommend to those who have  not attended a memorial service for a  veteran or someone who has given  their life for our country, that they do  so.

658,252,12,Mr. EXON., This has to do with mili tary construction at what Air Force  base?  ,1989
659,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., Tinker Air Force  Base.  ,1989

661,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is exact ly correct.  ,1989
662,252,12,Mr. EXON., And it has been accepted  by the House of Representatives.  ,1989
663,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is again  correct. I appreciate his pointing that  out.  ,1989
664,252,12,Mr. EXON.," Are the amounts passed  by the House and this amendment, if  it is agreed to,  identical amounts of  money?  ",1989
665,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator again is  correct. The  amounts were  exactly  that requested by the administration  and also authorized by the House of  Representatives.  ,1989
666,252,12,Mr. EXON.," Therefore,  if we pass  this amendment, this would not be a  conf erenceable  item, since  the exact  amounts have been appropriated by  the House and Senate?  ",1989
667,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is exact ly correct.  ,1989
668,252,12,Mr. EXON., Tell me a  little more  about what type of construction this  is. Is this barracks or runways?  ,1989
669,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., Maintenance  and  repair facilities for the B-2 bomber.  ,1989

676,252,12,Mr. EXON.," If I understand it cor rectly, since we are trying to scrub this  bill down, when we only  talk about  $31.6 million, I would ask the chair man of  the committee,  the Senator  from Illinois, how is this being accom modated? Are other programs being  cut to accommodate this?  ",1989
677,252,12,Mr. NICKLES.,  I will be happy to  answer the Senator. There is an offset  provided.  ,1989
678,252,12,Mr. DIXON., There is an offset. The  offset is from Air Force family hous ing.  ,1989
679,252,12,Mr. EXON.," There  is an offset on  family housing operations,  I am ad vised by staff. Is that correct?  ",1989
680,252,12,Mr. DIXON.," Yes, that is correct.  ",1989
681,252,12,Mr. EXON.," Is that clear around the  United States or just Tinker Air Force  Base? It is from a  large, unspecified  pot of money, I am advised by staff.  Assuming that the Air Force is saying  this  is a priority matter, let me ask  specifically now,  if we are off setting  this, which I am glad to hear we are, is  it being specifically offset just out of a  pot or is  this money specifically au thorized for base personnel and  im provement in specific Air Force bases?  ",1989
682,252,12,Mr. DIXON.," Let me tell my distin guished colleague that this  is  taken  out  of  a  line  item  involving  $792,008,000, so  it is  taken out of a  very substantial line item amount. It  reduces that amount to $760,208,000.  ",1989
683,252,12,Mr. EXON.," If I understand correct ly, the amount that the distinguished  Senator from Illinois has just referred  to is the total line item and not speci fied as to where that money would be  spent?  ",1989
684,252,12,Mr. DIXON.," That is absolutely cor rect, may  I  say  to my colleague.  I  think it has already been pointed out  this  is  in  the House  bill  in  this  amount. We had,  frankly, been pre pared, may I say candidly to the Sena tor, to take the House position on this  matter in the conference.  ",1989
685,252,12,Mr. EXON., I thank the Senator.  ,1989
686,252,12,Mr. NICKLES., I thank the Senator.  ,1989
687,252,12,Mr. EXON.," I wanted to raise those  questions.  Mr. President, I  thank the Senator  and I thank my colleagues.  ",1989
688,252,12,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I urge  adoption of the amendment.  ",1989
689,252,12,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  to  join my  colleague, Mr.  NICKLES,  in expressing our apprecia tion to the Armed Services Committee  for agreeing to this amendment to au thorize the fiscal year 1990 budget re quest of $31.8 million to fund  three  military  construct'ton  projects  at  Tinker Air Force Base in preparation  for  the maintenance of the B-2 air craft.  The Air Force,  several years ago,  prepared the Depot Military Construc tin Program for the B-2 estimating a  budget of $113 million spread over 4  years  for  the most  cost-efficient  manner of providing the necessary calay  that  pability  to maintain this highly so phisticated weapons system.  Authorizing  the funding  for  these  three projects, which were included in  the Air Force fiscal year 1990 budget,  prevents  costly  delays. The  secure  storage facility design will be 100 per cent complete by January 1990. The  integrated support facility will be 100percent design complete by early No vember this year and the avionics fa cility  is  already  100-percent  design  complete.  The House and Senate have voted  this week to support the authorization  of the procurement of the B-2. This  amendment will make  it possible  to  keep  the  depot  activation  timely.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their  support.  ",1989

692,252,12,Mr. DIXON.,  I move  to  motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was  agreed to.  ,1989

695,252,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator must ask unanimous consent.  ,1989

702,278,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Idaho.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I, too,  want  to commend  the distinguished  Senator on the amendment. I have not  seen the table that he has used in the  explanation with respect to the alloca tion and, therefore, the amendment of  money contained  in  the President's  budget  request, and  I mention  that  only because I have had no reason to  determine whether or not there has  been any change of condition from the  administration's standpoint since the  original budget request was made.  Now, it is no secret that the adminis tration was somewhat slow in getting  recommendations to us with respect to  the appointments of senior personnel  within the Department. It is also no  secret  that since  those nominations  have been received by the Congress,  by the Senate of the United States, a  good many  of  those  appointments  have been, for one reason or another,  not completed.  I think it is fair to say that some of  that gap is filled by the payment of  consultant  fees. So  there may well  have been a change in the departmen tal requirement for the expenditure of  money in these accounts and,  there fore, I would like to have the opportu nity  to check with  the Department  and see what the  impact will be  in  placing its ceiling, which might have  to be revised.  I  recognize  that  that  takes  some  time,  that we have  the amendment  before us and the bill before us today,  and we hope to complete action on it  very soon. I will take the opportunity  to check and verify those figures be tween now and the time we are at the  conference. I, too, share with the dis tinguished chairman of the committee  a willingness to accept the amendment  at this time and take it to the confer ence.  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.  Hon. DAVID PRYOR,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR PRYOR: This is in further  reply to your letter of February 22, 1989 to  the Director regarding actions taken by this  agency to comply with the provisions of sec tion 114 of title 31, United States Code.  As we noted  in our response  to you of  April 19,  1989, certain of  the consulting  services budget justifications, as provided to  us by the agencies, did not fully comport  with  the statutory  requirements. We  re quested and have now received revised sub missions from those agencies. Those are en closed, as is the submission of the Environ mental Protection Agency. A revised sum mary of the data from the 19 agencies you  identified is also enclosed.  Please contact me if we can be of further  service in this regard.  Sincerely,  ALLAN V.

704,278,12,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President,  in re sponse  to  the distinguished Senator  from West Virginia, the chairman of  the Appropriations Committee,  and  the distinguished manager, my friend  from Idaho, Senator McCLURE, I would  like to ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the RECORD a letter written  to me dated June 20, 1989, from Allan  Burman, Deputy Administrator  and  Acting Administrator, Office of Man agement and Budget, and this includes  the table where it demonstrates that  some roughly $2 billion has been re quested  for  the various  agency  re quests for consulting services.  There being no objection, the letter  and table were ordered to be printed  in the RECORD, as follows:  OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET,  Washington, DC, June 20, 1989.  Enclosures.

Might I just make a  comment? I think the Senator said the  letter was signed by an acting director  at OMB.  ",1989
705,278,12,Mr. PRYOR.," I have sent that letter  to the desk. I can retrieve it.  Mr. McCLURE. If indeed his title is  acting, he is probably a consultant.  ",1989
706,278,12,Mr. PRYOR.," Let me apologize to my  friend from Idaho. Mr. Allan Burman,  as of June 20, 1989, was the Deputy  Administrator and Acting Administra tor of the OMB Federal procurement  policy. So that whatever that title in dicates, that is the title that was on  the letter.  Also, I will just take a moment and  respond generally to my friend from  Idaho when he states that he wants to  call the agency, in this case the De partment of the Interior, to get their  comments on  this particular amend ment. I can promise my friend from  Idaho that when he places that call to  the Department of the Interior, the  Department of the Interior is going to  oppose  this  amendment,  and  the  reason they are going to oppose this  amendment is we are taking away a  tremendous amount of their flexibility  in granting these contracts for profes sional private consulting contracting.  We are taking away a great deal of  that  flexibility  and we  are  simply  making this particular agency of the  Government, when  they  submitted  their request for consulting services in  this case $26,400,000, we are basically  saying that is all you can spend; you  cannot go over here and take from an other account;  you cannot go  over  here and take from another fund; you  cannot go down here and take from a  regional headquarters  these moneys  and go out and hire consultants once  they reach the $26,400,000.  I can only assume that the Depart ment of the Interior is going to oppose  this.  I know  that  the Housing and  Urban Development  is.  They will  oppose it when I off er it on the HUD  appropriation bill. The Department of  Justice  is going  to oppose  this. The  Department of Defense  is going  to  oppose this. The Department of Agri culture is going to oppose this.  But that is no reason for us to say to  the agencies: You submit this request,  and  if we give you that amount for  consultants,  you  cannot  spend  any  more. This is that simple. And we are  keeping what I  think is a degree of  common sense  in  the appropriations  process and exercising the power of  the purse that the bureaucracy has  taken away from the Congress of the  United States in these expenditures.  Mr. President, I have no other state ment on this matter. I thank the two  managers of the bill for  their kind ness, for  their accepting the amend ment. If it is timely now to ask for the  adoption I ask for the adoption of the  amendment.  ",1989
707,278,12,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there further debate on the amend ment? If not, the question is on agree ing to the amendment of the Senator  from Arkansas.  ",1989
708,291,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," Yes.  Mr. McCLURE. In the northern cen tral California area, there is a small  area of deferral between the coastline  and the moratoria area. Other than  that one area, the west coast-excuse  me,  there  is a  small moratoria area  farther offshore. It is between two de ferral  areas  in  southern California.  But in the main, and along the west  coast,  the deferral areas are farther  out  to  sea  than are  the moratoria  areas.  ",1989
709,291,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," While the Senator  is looking at that map, if the Senator  will look at one of the areas there, for  example, in extreme southern Califor nia, you will see yellow areas  there  that have red areas inside them.  Mr. McCLURE. Yes.  ",1989
710,291,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," On the coastal side  of them. If you look in central Calif or nia, I do not know, I would say that is  probably the Monterey area, you will  see that there are red deferral areas  inside the moratorium. You have  to  look at that closely to see that.  Mr. McCLURE. Because the deferral  area outside  the moratoria area  is  much  greater  than  that which  is  inside the moratoria area. There is one  other area that is off the tip of Florida  in which the deferral moratoria area is  outside the deferral area.  ",1989
711,291,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," I think the Senator  will agree with me, if you look at the  moratorium area in Florida, if you had  a  tanker and you were trying to get  into the west coast of Florida and you  were coming, say, with a load of gaso line from Puerto Rico, you can see  that you would have to come out, ac cording to  this chart, I would guess  that that tanker would have to go-it  would have to travel at least an extra  300  to 400 miles to get in to a west  coast port  in  the southern part of  Florida.  Mr. McCLURE. There is not a mile age chart on this particular map I am  looking at.  ",1989
712,291,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," I base this on my  particular knowledge of the area.  Mr. McCLURE. I would not guess it  that far. You will also note that the  deferral area goes out some distance,  but  there  is between  the moratoria  area and the coastline a band of de f erred area which would not be barred  by this amendment.  ",1989
713,291,12,Mr.  BUMPERS.," We  could  go  through this map for the next 2 hours  and  try  to figure out precisely how  many miles a particular tanker would  have to go out of its way to get to a  port. That would not tell us how many  tankers are going to do it, how many  miles. My guess is over a period of a  year, you are talking about millions of  extra miles that a tanker would have  to go in order to find a port, and for  what purpose? To make a point: The  point was made in committee yester day, and I do not refute, but it is not  enough to justify this amendment.  I personally believe, and I mean this  as no disrespect to the Senator from  Idaho, I really think this is punitive. I  think  it  is designed  to make  those  people who want their coast lines free  of drilling sorry that they have cham pioned moratoriums and deferrals and  not drilling off their bank.  The point the Senator made in the  Appropriations Committee yesterday,  and he prevailed on a vote of 12  to  10-just did not have enough Demo crats in there-is that the chance of  polluting water from a blowout from  drilling  is something like 95 percent  less than a tanker spill. We are talking  about a  thousand-gallon or a  thou sand-barrel  spill.  You  are  talking  about the chances of a  real oil spill  being much greater  from  a  tanker  than from drilling, and  therefore  if  these people feel that their coastlines  are so pristine that they do not want  anybody drilling on them, then maybe  we ought not to  let tankers go  into  that area either because the chances  are 95 percent that you are going to  get a spill of over a thousand gallons  from a tanker and only 5 percent from  a blowout.  I am not arguing that statistic. The  Senator may be absolutely right about  that. But that is not a sufficient justi fication for his amendment. And the  people in those areas are not raising  the question. Now,  there are  some  areas in the country, including Alaska,  where they are awfully apprehensive  about tanker traffic. If you had just  gone  through what  Alaska  went  through, you would have been appre hensive about it, too. But if we could  keep  the captains of  these  tankers  sober, we should not have too big a  problem.  I want to give you a list of the ports  in this country that ships could poten tially have to navigate around to get  to. Listen to this. I hope every Senator  here from one of these States is listen ing: Boston, New York, Philadelphia,  Wilmington, Long Beach, San Francis co, Portland, Miami, San Diego, and  all of Rhode Island.  Now, some of these people may have  wanted moratoriums off  their coast  and some may not. But all of them de serve better treatment than this. The  fact that tankers may  in fact cause  more oilspills than OCS drilling is not  the point. The fact is we are going to  be bringing in oil from abroad; we are  going to be bringing it from Alaska.  We are now 42 to 45 percent dependent on foreign oil. We are going  to  remain  that  dependent  and more  unless we get cracking with an energy  policy in this country. We are saying  to those people who have to have this  oil that we are going to make you pay  more for it. And I might also say this.  Let us assume that a tanker is cruising  along just outside a moratorium area  in California-and that is where they  would be cruising if this amendment  stayed  law-let us assume  they are  just a mile or a half mile outside the  moratorium area because this amend ment forces them to do that, and let  us assume they have a Exxon Valdez  type spill. Do you think that moratori um area is going to be saved? Why, of  course,  it  is not. They are going  to  suffer the same damage. Then let me  ask you this. What if Congress sudden ly took leave of its senses and said we  are declaring all of the area around  Valdez a moratorium area; no drilling  anywhere from Valdez south?  How are you going to get a million  and a half barrels of Alaska a day on  which this Nation really is dependent?  Answer: You are going to have to build  a $50  to $100 billion pipeline across  Canada. We  have  been down  that  road. We know we are not going to do  that.  Mr. President,  I  could stand here  and tell you war stories all day long  about what this amendment is  likely  to do, and the interesting thing about  it is I do not have a dog in this fight. I  promise you there are no ports in Ar kansas. But I can also promise you  that the rate payers of Arkansas will  suffer if this amendment stays and the  ratepayers  of  every  State  in  the  Nation will suffer unless this amend ment is deleted from this bill. It does  not make any sense. I am depending  on the judgment and common sense of  the Members of the Senate to say so.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed  Chair.  ",1989
714,291,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from New Jersey.  ,1989
715,291,12,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I support the views and the position of  the Senator from Arkansas. I share his  dislike and his mistrust of the amend ment  offered  by  the  distinguished  Senator from Idaho.  I do want to clarify the RECORD be cause the Senator suggested that my  amendment would  have  prohibited  any prelease activity for the investiga tion of value or efficacy of deposits off  the mid-Atlantic coast. That is slightly  in error. We did  in our amendment  permit some prelease activity and we  as a matter of fact suggested that re search could be done, evaluation of  these sites could be taken upon the  shoulders of the companies that were  interested and  they  could continue  their pursuit of the opportunity there.  the  ",1989

719,317,12,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President,  thank  you very much. I  thank the Senator  for yielding.  I want  to make one point here.  While this is a regional cut, there is no  doubt about it. In region 1 where it  falls  into Montana, we have  a  log  supply problem, and I will agree with  the distinguished Senator from Colo rado that there are economic values to  our National Forest System like fish ing,  hunting,  and  recreation of  all  sorts, snowmobiles,  the whole  thing.  But how do people get there? They get  there by roads.  We know from the studies that have  been  done  in Montana  and  Idaho  these roads are very important.  I yield the floor.  ",1989

722,317,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Who  yields time?  The Senator  from Georgia has 3  minutes and 53 seconds remaining; the  Senator from Idaho, 59 seconds.  ",1989
723,317,12,Mr. FOWLER.," Mr. President, first  of all, let me thank the Senator from  Colorado [Mr. WIRTH] for his fine con tribution  not  only  to  this  debate,  which  being  a  representative  of  a  the Senator  thank  Western State I  think removes some  of the sectional arguments that were  alleged. But also I thank him for being  a leader in the protection of our public  lands in his capacity as a member of  the Energy and Public Lands Subcom mittee,  the  authorizing  committee,  and reminding all of us of the Forest  Service charge to balance the use of  our public lands in their public trust  for timber, yes, but for recreation, for  wildlife habitat, for biological diversi ty, for scenic beauty, for tourism, all  that go into both the esthetic and the  economic and the environmental pro tections  that we  all want  for  our  public lands.  Mr. President, the facts are simply  these in closing: Forest Service loses  an average of $350 million for timber  sales every year. That money comes  out of the pockets of people in Geor gia, Alabama, South Carolina, Kansas,  and Iowa. Those subsidies go to these  timber sales and these timber roads as  well as the citizens of Alaska, Idaho,  and other States.  These are national treasures. They  are not national tree farms.  The law of the United States, adopt ed by all of  its citizens,  is  to make  these forests in the public interest in  the diversity which certainly includes  logging and  timbering, and  I might  remind my  colleagues  in  this  fine  debate we had that timber is the No. 1  industry in my State, but I off er and I  support this amendment for many of  the  reasons  that  the Senator  from  Colorado  said  far more  eloquently  than can I.  We have an opportunity, my col leagues in the Senate, to save money,  to put our money in reallocations that  will help in all of the dimensions of  conservation and economic and envi ronmental protection. It is an amend ment on reallocation that helps all of  us who are taxpayers in support of the  fore st system and the public land of  our country, and it also has a net sav ings in these budgetary times of $25  million for which all  the  taxpayers,  wherever  they  live, might  have  a  minor cause to rejoice.

We  had a dip in the years since then for  reasons which were explained previ ously.  It is time for us to get back to the  balanced program  in  timber harvest  that  is  contemplated by  the  forest  management planning process which  this amendment would undercut and  frustrate.  Certainly,  I  reiterate  the fact you  lose revenues to the Federal Govern ment by this action. You lose $285 mil lion in direct receipts and counties for  schools and road purposes would lose  $70 million annually under this level  of funding.  This  is  an  irresponsible  action.

732,330,12,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I would  like to call the attention of my col leagues to an article from the Bangor  Daily News describing  the business  success and community service of one  of my constituents, G. Clifton Eames,  Bangor.  Mr. Eames is the president of N.H.  Bragg &  Sons, an automotive parts  and  industrial supply company  that  has been in his family for 135 years.  He represents the fifth generation to  run the company.  Originally a supply store for horse  carriages, N .H. Bragg &  Sons was  forced by the creation of the automo bile  to modernize and expand. They  have opened branch stores  in eight  other Maine communities in the hope  of providing better service.  In addition  to his business career,  Mr. Eames' involvement in the com munity includes work as chairman of  the board at both Eastern Maine Med ical Center and Bangor Savings Bank.  Consequently, he has developed a deep  interest in the health care industry, in  particular the plight of rural hospitals  and their many uninsured patients, as  well as issues of concern to the many  nonprofit savings institutions through  the Northeast.  Mr. Eames dedication to community  and business affairs is truly admirable.  He has made an indelible mark on the  Bangor community and it to be com mended for his outstanding record of  achievement.  The article follows:  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  CHANGE, CONTINUITY AT N.H. BRAGG  <By Carroll Astbury)  As president of N.H. Bragg & Sons, chair man of the board of Eastern Maine Medical  Center,  and  chairman  of  the board  at  Bangor Savings Bank, G. Clifton Eames is  one of the more titled men in Bangor.  But Eames is no stuffed shirt. Friendly  and easy to talk with, he is at home with  anyone who likes to discuss Bangor and its  economy. And he knows something about  that economy.  At N.H. Bragg, Eames carries on a 135year-old  tradition. He represents the fifth  generation at the family-owned supplier of  automotive parts and industrial and welding  supplies.  But 135 years ago, the business obviously  wasn't selling auto parts. Norris Hubbard  Bragg  and  a  partner, Summer Basford,  started the company in 1854, when it was  known as Bragg & Basford. Bragg bought  out his partner in 1863, and the business  has been in the family ever since.  The Bragg business started by supplying  items for horse carriages, specifically tires,  &  bolts, whiffletree ferrules, tailboard springs,  and other metal parts which went into the  finished assemblies of carriages.  Eames explains that with the advent of  the automobile, the town blacksmith shop  became the town garage. Welding and ma chine-shop trades soon followed. N.H. Bragg  Sons changed with the  times and now  supplies a full line of automotive, industrial  and welding supplies.  In order  to broaden  its market for  the  automotive  lines, N.H. Bragg has  added  branch  locations  in  Fairfield, Winslow,  South  Paris, Augusta,  Rockland Unity,  Bridgton and Millinocket.  During recent years, there has been a pro liferation of the number of auto parts that  Bragg's must stock. ""There are a lot more  models of both domestic and import cars,""  Eames  said.  ""This puts  a  challenge on  people trying to carry a stock of replace ment parts.""  Stocking  parts  also  involves  keeping  abreast of the population of different car  models in the state. Manufacturers provide  popularity codings for parts, but there can  be regional differences that companies like  N.H. Bragg must heed, For example, Eames  says that there is a relatively large number  of Subarus in the Bangor area.  Bragg's labor force totals about 140, with  105 of the workers being at the company's  headquarters at 92 Perry Road in Bangor.  Eames says  that  the  labor  force  isn't as  stable as it used to be. As the company has  grown, workers who haven't settled on a  career choice have joined the ranks. That  naturally results in some turnover.  Eames is bullish regarding the economic  future of the Bangor area, but he sees some  challenges.  ""Bangor has the seeds of some consider able growth,"" he said. ""The challenge will  be how to manage it without losing it. There  will be  those who will want to control it  agressively.  ""You've got to be careful,"" he said. ""If  you don't take advantage of the opportuni ties, when times aren't so good you'll wish  you had.""  As a result of his involvement at Eastern  Maine Medical Center, Eames has received a  firsthand education on the health-care in dustry. The hospital  industry poses some  unique challenges, Eames said. For example,  medical  doctors  are  responsible  for  the  health care  in a hospital, but they don't  control the trustees. And the trustees are  responsible for the overall guidance of the  hospital, but they don't control the doctors.  Recently, Eames was encouraged by L.D.  1322, the action by the Maine Legislature to  pay part of the hospital bill for the state's  uninsured population. He also was pleased  with the measure that ""amended strict reg ulatory measures."" This, Eames said, ""will  give hospitals more ability to control things  locally.""  Regarding the banking industry, and spe cifically  his  interest  in Bangor Savings  Bank, Eames' biggest concern has to do with  the media and public relations. He says that  the media tend to group all savings banks  into the ""thrifts"" category, and gives little  mention to the non-profit nature of many of  the banks in the northeastern part of the  country.  Bangor Savings is one of those non-profit  institutions, and Eames wants everyone to  know  that  it  is  doing  quite well  and  shouldn't be associated in any way with the  savings-and-loan crisis.  Meanwhile, back at his corner office at  the family-owned shop, Eames watches his  son, Jonathan, function as Bragg's industri al sales manager. Jonathan represents the  sixth generation in the business.  Eames' cousin, John W. Bragg, is the com pany's vice president and will some day take  Eames' job.  In terms of maintaining the family owner ship at Bragg's, Eames says, ""We've beat  the law of averages, perhaps a couple of  times over."" He said that strong interest by  the  family  in  running  the company and  seeing it prosper has been the reason that  the ownership has continued.  And with  John Bragg  and  Jonathan  Eames in place, Eames says that the owner ship looks to be ""in good hands for another  generation.""

733,330,12,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  congratulate the Huron, South Dakota  Senior Citizens Center  for  its out standing work with senior citizens. As  a  result  of  its  efforts,  the Huron  Senior Citizens Center  is  1  of  10  projects, from a total of 34, to receive  a  1989  Community  Achievement  Award  from  the Administration On  Aging.  Receiving  a  Community Achieve ment Award  is  a  very  important  honor. The award is given annually to  model aging projects. Each State has  the opportunity to select one project  or program and submit a proposal to  the Administration On Aging. Follow ing a  rigorous  internal and external  review process, only 10 projects or pro grams receive this award.  I am proud of the Huron Senior Citi zens Center and  the many ways  in  which  its staff and volunteers reach  out to meet the needs of the elderly in  Huron, SD, and surrounding communi ties.  The  Huron  Senior  Citizens  Center has a membership of 1,500 vol unteers. The volunteers are organized  under  the Retired Senior Volunteer  Program [RSVP]. In addition to the  usual services of  tours, crafts, cards,  health  prevention  programs,  dance  and exercise,  the center has congre gate and home delivery nutrition pro grams, as well as a transportation serv ice.  The nutrition program extends  to  several other nearby communities, in cluding Hitchcock, Wessington, Woon socket, Wolsey, Wessington Springs,  and Highmore, SD.  The center, in cooperation with the  city of Huron, provides transportation  service for seniors in Huron. Seniors in  small communities near Huron who  need  transportation are able  to use  this service to travel into Huron for  groceries,  shopping, medial  care or  social activities.

B-2 BOMBER IS A PLANE  WITHOUT A MISSION  <Mr. BRENNAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ,1989
740,369,12,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Speaker,  the  principal mission of the B-2 bomber is  to penetrate Soviet airspace after both  sides  have  already  launched  their  thousands of nuclear missiles. Presum ably these missiles will have hit their  targets and both  the United States  and the Soviet Union will have been  destroyed.  In essence, by  that  time  the war  would have been lost by both sides.  Then after both countries are devas tated, the B-2 would fly into action,  penetrate Soviet airspace and drop its  bombs. This comes as close as I can  possibly envision to a mission literally  to make the rubble bounce.  To me, that sort of mission for the  B-2 does not justify the spending of  $70  to $100 billion of the taxpayers'  money. Yes, the B-2 bomber is a plane  without a mission, certainly a plane  that does not justify the most expen sive weapons system in history.  It is time to stop a weapons system  we do not need, cannot afford, and  really has no justifiable mission.

Several  experts  tell  us  that  the  wooden baseball bat is doomed to ex tinction,  that major  league baseball  players will soon be standing at home  plate with aluminum bats  in  their  hands. Baseball fans have been forced  to  endure  countless  indignities  by  those who  just  cannot  leave well  enough alone.  Designated hitters, plastic grass, uni forms that look like pajamas, chicken  clowns dancing on the baselines, and  of course the most heinous sacrilege,  lights in Wrigley Field.  Are we willing to hear the crack of a  bat replaced by the dinky ping? Are we  ready to see the Louisville slugger re placed by the aluminum ping dinger?  Is nothing sacred?  Please, do not tell me that wooden  bats are too expensive when players  who cannot hit their weight are being  paid more money than the President  of the United States.  ",1989

744,382,12,Mr. FOGLIETTA.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in strong support of the amend ment  offered  by Messrs. DELLUMS,  KASICH, and ROWLAND.  The B-2 bomber makes no sense on  strategic  grounds,  or  on  budget  grounds. Arguments for the B-2 and  against this amendment are seriously  flawed.  Some B-2 supporters argue that it is  necessary for arms control. I disagree.  The United States has no intention of  bargaining away the B-2. A bargaining  chip is not a bargaining chip if you  will not bargain.  Some B-2 supporters say that stop ping this bomber will ruin the triad.  But the B-1 bombers-which have  already been purchased-could be up graded to be a penetrating bomber at  about one-tenth the cost of the B-2  program.  Some opponents of this amendment  argue that we must find some sort of  middle  ground.  I  say  there  is  no  middle ground. According to the cur rent 5-year plan,  in  1992  the B-2  bomber will get $8 billion. Come on,  there is hardly a person in this room  who realistically thinks that we will  give $8 billion to one program.  However, if the budget is chopped in  half, the per plane costs will double.  So we spend 50 percent of the money,  and we get a 25-percent return on our  investment.  By  restructuring  the program, by  trimming the buy, all we do is drive  the costs per plane through the roof.  If we think $600 million per bomber  is  sticker  shock, wait  till we  start  spending over $1 billion per bomber.  Let's be real.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on  the Dellums-Kasich-Rowland amend ment. Vote YES for sanity.  ",1989
745,382,12,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oregon [Mr. AUCOIN].  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman,  I do  not like paying this kind of price for a  weapon any more  than anyone else.  But more  important  than price  is  value. And  the Stealth  technology  bomber is high value.  Slow weapons are better than fast  weapons, because they can't be used  for a surprise attack first strike. By  the same logic that makes MX, D5,  and their Soviet quick-strike counter parts destabilizing, the B-2 is stabiliz ing.  Any manned bomber  is stabilizing,  but the B-2  is  the most stabilizing.  Why? Because you not only have to be  slow, you have to be sure you're going  to penetrate whatever defenses  the  other side can put up. And the B-2  gives every evidence of being the best  penetrator ever built.  Its Stealth technology is even better  than that of the advanced cruise mis sile. Its range with a heavy payload is  exceptionally long.  And while this hasn't been discussed  by the Air Force, any airplane with  such large wing area is going to have  phenomenally long loiter time. This is  critical, because long loiter is exactly  what a President needs in a crisis. He  needs an airplane that can take off, fly  to the fail-safe point, keep it orbiting,  safe, recallable-and nonprovocative over American territory for the long est possible time while he negotiates  to prevent Armageddon. The B-2 gives  him that capability.  Another apparent advantage of the  B-2 that hasn't been discussed is the  no-tail design. Generally speaking, the  part of an airplane that's most vulner able to nuclear blast is the vertical fin.  The B-2 doesn't have one. This would  appear to give it better pre-launch sur vival than conventional airframes.  I know many of you approach the B2 with a jaundiced eye, because of the  bad experience we've had with the B l. I agree with you. The B-1 was a mis take. It was Reagan's Folly, one of  many. We should never have built it.  But this isn't the B-1, it's the B-2. If  it tests out OK, it'll be a far better de terrent than the B-1, the MX, the D5,  and star wars combined.  So please, don't let the sticker shock  be the whole story. The B-2 is high value, well worth the price. I respect  the  sincerity  of my  friends, Mr.  KASICH  and ",1989
746,382,12,Mr. DELLUMS., But let's  vote down their amendment.  ,1989
747,382,12,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Kansas [Mr. GLICKMAN].  ",1989
748,382,12,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in support of  the Aspin-Synar  compromise which cuts $470 million  from the bill's authorization for the  Stealth,  requires  the Department of  Defense  to  restructure  the program  and meet  test and performance  re quirements limiting to two the number  of airplanes bought in fiscal years 1990  and 1991. The DOD must come up  with a plan about this airplane which  requires a subsequent vote from the  Congress.  Mr. Chairman, of all the proposals  this probably  is  the most intelligent  way to deal with this particular air plane.  I  know  that Americans  are  shocked because of the cost of this air plane, but, quite frankly, it speaks to  the imprudence of keeping a program  of this size in a classified nature for so  long. The sticker shock is largely due  to the fact that it is a surprise because  it has been a classified program, and it  speaks for the fact that we ought not  to  ever  let  this happen again. We  ought to never let a program of this  magnitude stay secret for so long so  that the American people do not believe that they have the knowledge of  whether the weapon system is useful,  can fly, can do what we say it can do.  Mr. Chairman, we have spent a lot  of money on this plane. I do not know  for sure whether we ought to continue  it or cancel it, but I know that it is im prudent for us, 3 months after it has  come out of a classified status, to just  cancel it given all of the money that  has been spent into it to date.  If its mission is anywhere near what  the military says it is, it is probably a  pretty good deal for us. If the mission  is what the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  KAs1cHl says it is, it is a lousy deal for  us.  The question  is: What  is  the best  way for us to find that out? Mr. Chair man, I  think the Aspin-Synar is  the  best way  to do  it. Test it seriously.  Decide whether the money spent in  the past is worth the money or not,  and vote on it again based upon that  data, and, if the gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. KAs1cHl  is right, we will can the  program in 6 months to a year, but, if  he is wrong, we will scale it back, and  we will have a weapons system that is  more prudent and more cost efficient.  So, Mr. Chairman, it is not a com fortable position for me because my  constituents are not crazy about the  cost of this program, but I  think it  best for the national security of this  country and  for  fiscal prudence  to  adopt  the middle-ground  approach  which is the Aspin-Synar approach.

750,382,12,Mr.  PORTER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  strongly support the amendment of fered by Mr. KASICH,  and commend  him for his tireless efforts on this very  important matter.  Today we are  faced with another  vote  that  requires us  to make  the  tough choices, choices we must make  if we are to take our continued budget  deficits  seriously  together with  the  need to provide responsibly for the de fense of our Nation.  I opposed the B-2 program for two  reasons-its outrageous cost, and  its  nonexistent mission.  At a time when we must exercise ex treme budgetary restraint, it would be  inappropriate to press ahead with pro duction of the B-2. This is a program  which would rob dollars from more im portant weapons  systems and other  defense needs. These highly complex  and as yet unproven aircraft are esti mated to cost $550 million each, and if  past experience  in weapons procure ment is any guide, I would expect the  final cost to be closer to $750 million  each or  even more. The Pentagon  would  like an eventm .. l  force of 132  planes, which puts the overall cost at  ",1989
751,395,12,Mr. ROWLAND.,"  I strongly oppose the Skelton amendment,  which  is  really  the status quo amendment.  Enough questions have been raised about the  B-2 to merit significant changes  in  the pro gram: The Skelton amendment says full speed  ahead, we don't need reform.  I urge my col leagues to vote against this amendment.  I also want to make it clear that a vote for  the Dellums-Kasich-Rowland amendment is a  vote  to kill  the B-2 program. While  I have  been a strong critic of the B-2, I believe such  an action would be premature until we know  whether or not the plane will work and wheth er or not the program costs can be reduced.  I would urge my colleagues who do vote for  the Dellums-Kasich-Rowland amendment  to  vote  for  the Aspin-Synar amendment  if Del lums-Kasich fails. As I mentioned before, the  committee-reported bill and the Skelton amend ment provide for only cosmetic changes in the  current program.  I offer this amendment with Chairman ASPIN  because I believe that Congress must ensure  accountability in the B-2 program. By mandat ing a reduction in the cost of the program and  requiring that the plane meets both its testing  and mission criteria, this amendment does just  that. If you are unsure about canceling the B2 but want to put some controls on the pro gram,  I urge your support of the Aspin-Synar  amendment.  ",1989

Second,  performance standards and  rigorous  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  July 26, 1989  testing. Third, a reduction of the con currency which is presently going on.  Finally,  and most  importantly,  the  strengthening  of  the  oversight  through  independent audits and the  lifting of the excessive secrecy which  for too long has plagued this program.  If Members want to get reins on this  program, if they want to come back in  a year and make an informed and com plete decision about  the B-2,  then  they have but one choice left, and that  is to support the Aspin-Synar amend ment.

759,408,12,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Chairman, nu clear deterrence has preserved peace  over 44 years.  Mr. Chairman, our nuclear deterrent has  preserved the peace over the past 44 years  primarily because  the United States decided  to split our strategic forces among land, sea,  and air components. This strategic triad is cru cial to a stable and effective deterrent against  our adversaries.  When the B-1 bomber was considered for  production  by  the  Reagan  administration  during the early 1980's, many opponents felt  that  this weapons system was a waste of  money. They argued that we should upgrade  our 30-year-old B-52's with cruise missiles  and other advanced electronic gear.  In addi tion, they proposed that the United States ac celerate development of the Stealth bomber,  which was then viewed as the technology of  the future.  Now the time has come for a decision on  building the Stealth bomber, and these same  liberal critics all of a sudden have a change of  heart. They now oppose this system because  it's too costly and it may not fly.  These critics have  forgotten  the strategic  importance of  the need  for  this weapons  system. The Soviets have deployed several  hundred mobile missiles, similar  to our pro posed Midgetman and MX on  rail cars. Be cause  of  the  vast  air  defense  network  throughout  the Soviet Union, we  need  a  bomber that is capable of evading radar to hit  these mobile missiles.  The Stealth bomber fits these requirements.  Its  design  and  composition  repels  radar  scans, and  its advanced electronics  could  track down Soviet mobile missiles and destroy  them.  In addition,  the potential spinoffs from  the research  in  this advanced  technology  is  limitless. These  two  factors  in  the minds of  Soviet war planners would serve as a deter rent to starting a nuclear war. That is,  in es sence, real peace.  Attempts  to stretch out  this program will  only  increase  the cost of the B-2 Program.  We've heard  from opponents of the Stealth  that the bombers may eventually cost over $1  billion a copy, using sticker shock to scare the  American people into believing that we can't  afford this weapon system.  But  this  is  not what Defense Secretary  Cheney proposes. If we endorse his proposal,  the procurement costs will be kept at  the  lowest  level. However,  this means  that we  must appropriate sufficient funds to keep the  lines open at  the most cost-effi production  cient level.  It's basically a simple lesson in economies  of scale. You can't expect to save money by  stretching out the costs over a longer period  of time.  It may work in the short-run, but ulti mately it will cost the taxpayers more money.  Just like family budgets, you can't expect the  total cost of an  interest-bearing  loan  to de crease if you keep lowering the monthly pay ment and agree  to  lengthen  the payment  period. Ultimately, it'll cost you more money.  If Cheney's proposal is enacted, the Stealth  bomber would be built over a period of 5 to 7  years, making the yearly cost between an af fordable $10  to $12 billion. This would com prise about 1.3 percent of the total defense  budget, which is proportionally less than what  was required to build the B-47, the B-52, or  the B-1 bomber force.  Mr. Chairman, we need  the B-2. The Air  Force plans to retire the aging B-52 bomber  force by the end of the 1990's. With only 97  B-1 bombers  forming  the  remaining compo nent of the air breathing leg of our triad, this  will not be a sufficient force to evade the so phisticated and dense air defense network  surrounding  the Soviet Union. The bomber  force comprises  the most stable  leg of our  triad because of its ability to be recalled after  take-off. Unlike  the  ICBM  force, we cannot  bring  the missiles back once  they've been  launched. That's why we need the next gen eration of aviation technology to maintain our  deterrent.  Finally, because the President has empha sized retaining the most stable component of  our nuclear deterrent in arms control talks, the  bomber  force will be assigned a very  large  percentage of our targets. In the initial START  negotiations, despite the number of warheads  a bomber can carry, it will be counted as one  nuclear weapon for purposes of arms reduc tion. Other strategic systems will be counted  on the basis of the number of warheads they  can carry.  In other words,  the Soviet Union  and the United States have agreed in principle  to assign a greater priority  to  the bomber  component of the triad.  As a  result,  to cut  the B-2 will severely  d.amage our capability to penetrate the Soviet  Union in the post-START environment. This is  not the time to abolish the bomber component  of our  triad. Combined with  the  land-based  mobile missile force,  the bomber wing would  add a stabilizing factor to our deterrent.  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to  oppose all amendments that restrict our ability  to proceed with  the B-2 program. These  amendments undercut  the President's arms  reduction proposal  in Geneva.  In addition, all  that  research  into  the cutting-edge  stealth  technology would go down the drain.  What a waste that would be. Stealth tech nology is the next generation of research  in  aviation, which have many other military and  civilian applications. Let's resist sticker shock,  and support the President's bipartisan strate gic nuclear modernization proposal.  ",1989
760,408,12,Mr. DAVIS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 1  minute to the distinguished gentleman  from Alabama CMr. DICKINSON],  the  ranking member of the Armed Serv ices Committee.  ",1989
761,421,12,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I ap preciate the comments made regarding  the questions that were asked. I really  would like to submit to the committee,  if there is anyone who can find a fool proof system  in  this whole military  thing, I woud like to see it. I do not  think there is one.  I  remember  as  a State  legislator  when we were worried about Hill Air  Force  Base  because  planes  were  coming in. These were not 757's; there  were test aircraft, and they would go  through  areas,  and my  colleagues  know that problems can occur. In a  vertical silo my colleagues know prob lems can occur. We talked about the  idea of, well, what about going to the  civilian population. Well,  I hope my  colleagues  in  the East  realize  that  those of us out in the West have a lot  of wide-open spaces, and sometimes  one can go  for miles and miles and  miles and one will see nothing but rat tlesnakes and  jackrabbits, and I am  not too concerned about some of those  particular areas.  Also one can talk about civilians per  se. If we  look at our Navy, our Air  Force and our Army, we find that ci vilians are working on  those  things  constantly. So, when my colleagues  get right down to it and take those  things  into consideration, we  realize  that we have a lot of problems in this,  but there is no foolproof system.  I think those who have had some of  these briefings realize that the mili tary is doing the very best that they  can and possibly this is as foolproof as  any aircraft would be, any military in stallation, and so when my colleagues  get to this, I really do not feel these  are honest, viable questions that have  been brought up concerning this.  A rail garrison, the small ICBM and  the train, the truck, however my col leagues want to do this, is again an ad vanced piece of technology, and it is  important to the United States, to the  military. It is important to the idea of  defending this country, and, as we see  the Soviet Union do this, we find out  how difficult it is. We know that they  would have the same problem. I really  feel that we look at the big picture,  and the big picture is that we go ahead  and continue on with the rail garrison  and the small ICBM.  Mr. Chairman,  I would urge  def eat of this amendment.  The  CHAIRMAN  pro  tempore.

764,434,12,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like to ask the gentleman a question:  As I recall it, the House adopted the  Mavroules cap of 50 MX's deployed  about 3 years ago? Is that not correct?  ",1989
765,434,12,Mr. MAVROULES.," If the gentleman  will yield, about 3 years ago.  ",1989
766,434,12,Mr. DICKS.," I  think that has been  overwhelmingly  the policy  that we  have had here in the House, that we  would deploy 50 MX's in the current  basing mode? Is that not correct?  ",1989
767,434,12,Mr. MA VROULES., That is correct.  ,1989
768,434,12,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to rise  in support of the Mavroules  amendment. I think when we had the  negotiations with  the administration  over the MX missile,  the agreement  was that we would deploy some MX's  if they would go ahead and deploy the  small ICBM and move ahead on arms  control. As everybody knows, we got 50  MX's, but the administration did not  move ahead on the small ICBM, and  until we see a little more good faith on  the small ICBM, I think we are wise  and prudent to keep the cap on the 50  MX's.  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona [Mr. KYL].  ",1989
769,434,12,Mr. KYL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  just  wanted to take 1 minute to respond to  the  argument  that  the  gentleman  from Washington just made. He is cor rect that there was a deal negotiated 3  years ago, but he says that the admin istration has not made good on its part  of the deal to properly fund and pro ceed with the small ICBM.  0 1820  That  is what  the agreement with  President Bush and Secretary Cheney  was all about. Secretary Cheney stated  in testimony before the House Armed  Services Committee that there is a full  commitment to the small ICBM. As a  matter of fact, there is a commitment  to put an additional $1 billion over the  next 3 years into the small ICBM.  So while the gentleman from Massa chusetts may have some reasons for  proceeding with this, I do not think we  can say that one reason is because of  bad faith on the part of the adminis tration, and I want to make that point  very clear so that we can dispel it and  get it out of the way in this debate.  ",1989
770,434,12,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 2 minutes to my friend and col league, the gentleman from Massachu setts [Mr. FRANK].  ",1989
771,434,12,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, we just  heard that the President showed his  good faith with another $1 billion. We  are going to love each other to death  in this process and totally run out of  money.  The argument appears to be that we  no longer need to limit the ICBM on  rail, and by the way, we are not just  talking about 50, we are talking about  500 because each one has 10 warheads.  So we are not only not going to have a  500 cap here, but we are also going to  have more Midgetmen, and then we  need more than that.  There has to be some common sense  about this process. Do my colleagues  know what happens when the adminis tration is allowed to begin spending?  They commit money, and then they  come in here and say, ""Oh, don't try  to  slow  us  down,  you will waste  money.""  The only way to be fiscally responsi ble is to use the legislative authority  to set limits at the outset. The gentle man  from Massachusetts  [Mr. MAv ROULEsl has said all right, some of us  were not for the rail garrison and we  lost, we are going to have a rail garri son. We said that should be no more  than 500 warheads, and the gentleman  from Louisiana says  it is not neces sary. We all know that the argument  of last resort when you do not want  something is to say that it is not nec essary. If it was not necessary it would  not be harmful. If it was not necessary  you would not be fighting it, because  there would not be any intention to  evade it.  If we do not now limit the 50, 500  warheads, we will confront a situta tion, my colleagues can be sure, where  we will say, ""Well, you did not say this  could only be 50, you gave us  this  money and we put a  little more into  it."" They will come back and say we  have to give them more.  Vote this down and we will complete  the  process  of  this  bill. We  have  mailed  ourselves  a  financial  time  bomb, and then we are going to com plain when we get it in the mail and it  blows up our budget. This can at least  put a little bit of a limit on it. We are  exercising here our congressional pre rogative.  Members voted for 50. I say we need  50, that is 500 warheads plus you have  the Midgetman warheads. That  is  enough for now. If they want more,  come back and tell us, but do not do it  without any authority.  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York [Mr. SOLOMON].  ",1989
772,434,12,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding the  time.  Mr. Chairman, I want to talk to my  colleagues on this side of the aisle for  1 minute. During the debate in the  Rules Committee, with all due respect  to the sponsor of this amendment, and  with all due respect to the chairman  of the Rules Committee, we were told  ",1989
773,447,12,Mr. BUSTAMANTE.," Mr. Chairman,  let me assure my friend from Utah it  was not my intention, and I know the  amendment  reads otherwise,  to cut  the binary chemical weapons, but just  in case that money was not used as the  chairman said, if it is not used, I cer tainly wanted the C-26 as considered,  and also the retrofit of the engines on  the F-15 and F-16's. That is a needed  item.  The chairman says these planes are  going to be used to move generals and  high officals of  the Guard. These  planes are scattered all over the coun try. In an emergency we have to mobi lize troops, we have to mobilize troops  and we have to bring them together,  and we have to map our plan of action.  These planes would serve that mission  in mobilizing our people in case of an  emergency.  ",1989
774,447,12,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  my remaining time to the gentleman  from Louisiana [Mr. McCRERYl.  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in opposition to the Bustamante  amendment. Now is the time for this  Congress to reaffirm its commitment  to controlling the scourge of chemical  weapons. Over the last several years  we have repeatedly debated this issue  and have always come to the conclu sion that we need to modernize our  chemical  arsenal. The  reasons  are  clear to me.  We all know our unitary stockpile is  grossly inadequate, that is one of the  reasons we are so willing to destroy it  by 1997. More than 90 percent of our  current stockpile  is not useful  in a  future chemical conflict. It is a stock pile built to fight a chemical war in  the 1950's and 1960's using delivery  systems, technologies, and doctrine of  that era. It is an old stockpile and get ting older. In just a few more years,  the useful percentage of this stockpile  will be even smaller as the 8-inch artil lery pieces and F-4 fighters leave the  active inventory.  Many people, including Members of  this body, have pointed to recent news  stories about a United States/U.S.S.R.  agreement on chemical weapons as a  reason  to stop our binary chemical  weapons programs. Well, they are en gaging in wishful thinking. The State  Department even  responded  to  that  story saying, in essence, don't get your  hopes up. Over 20 countries now have  chemicals-not just us and the Soviets.  In addition, we still have many prob lems to overcome in the area of verifying  compliance with  the  chemical  weapons ban. To me the only guaran tee in the interim is an adequate, cred ible stockpile of binary weapons and  the will to use them.  Now  is not the time to back away  from our commitment to arms control  by  foolishly  reinstituting  what  amounts  to a unilateral moratorium  on chemical weapons. It did not work  in the past, and it will not work now.  ",1989
775,447,12,Mr. NIELSON of Utah.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in opposition  to the Bustamante amendment  calling for a diversion of funds from the pro duction of chemical weapons to the National  Guard for the purchase of six C-26 aircraft.  What a choice?  On the one hand we have the opportunity  of producing a highly efficient and completely  safe chemical weapons system  to deter our  enemies, to defend our country, and to serve  as a chip in reaching any international accord  regarding these munitions.  On the other hand we have a chance to buy  the National Guard a half-dozen airborne staff  vehicles which have not been  requested by  the Secretary of Defense or  the administra tion, and which serve only a few.  The threat of chemical warfare is real.  There are 20 nations with chemical weapon  capability,  including  Iraq, Afghanistan,  and  Libya.  Iraq and Afghanistan already have used  their chemical weapons against enemies who  could not retaliate, and Qadhafi is building up  his arsenal right now.  Assuming we can only afford one or  the  other, would you rather vote to keep us safe  from a fanatic like Qadhafi who has no fear of  anyone who cannot retaliate?  Or would you rather vote for an expansion  of the National Guard Airborne Taxi Service?  I call for defeat of this amendment.  D 1950  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

779,447,12,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Chairman,  since 1917, the worldwide foreign port  authority for tugboats has been vested  with the Army. The Navy is responsi ble  for  tugboats  in  the continental  United States and  in  towing ocean  tugs.  In 1985 the Army concluded a world wide tugboat cost risk analysis study  looking at our lift capabilities. It con cluded that tugs, both commercial and  host nation tugs, were available with  the exception that 23  tugboats were  needed to meet our lift needs.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment deals  with 13 of these large tugs. Six have  been built. The seventh is currently  under construction.  My amendment is to earmark money  for the eighth tug. The Army has indi cated that it has sources of funding  available for  these tugs. I have con firmed this with the chairman and the  ranking minority member of the Com mittee on Armed Services, and I be lieve that they understand the impor tance to the Army of the continuation  of a  large Army  tugboat program. I  have also spoken with the Appropria tions Subcommittee.  Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact  that this tugboat is currently in the  Senate Armed Services Committee bill,  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw  my amendment at this time.

780,460,12,Mr. BROWN  of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today t am introducing legislation to revise the  current  rules governing eligibility  for Aid  to  Families With Dependent Children [AFDC] for  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  plo~ed  victims of major disasters. As a result of two  tragic accidents which occurred  in  the con gressional district which  I represent,  I have  learned of an injustice in AFDC eligibility rules.  The current law punishes the victims of major  disasters by terminating all aid to families who  accept compensation.  On May 12, a 69-car Southern Pacific train  jumped  the  tracks at  the  foot of the steep  Cajon Pass in San Bernardino, CA. The trai~  was unable to navigate a sharp turn when 1t  reached the bottom of the hill, after it acceler ated to more than 90 miles per hour. The run away  train  jumped  the  tracks, and  through a residential neighborhood, demolish ing seven houses and killing four people. The  train also landed on top of a pipeline, operat ed by  the Calnev Pipeline Co., which  trans ports gasoline from California to Nevada. Fol lowing  the accident,  the  resident were  told  that the area had been inspected, and that it  was  safe  to  return  home. Someone was  wrong. Only 13 days after the train accident,  tragedy struck the San Bernardino neighbor hood again when the pipeline exploded in _the  same location. The flames rose 500 feet into  the sky. Two people were killed, 1 O homes  were burned  to  the ground, and dozens of  people were injured.  .  Fire crews were unable to put the fire out  immediately because faulty check valves per mitted the backflow of gasoline to fuel the fire  even after the pipeline was shut down. The  firefighting  efforts  caused  fluctuating water  pressures, and several homes  flooded as a  result.  The most severely damaged homes have  been bulldozed, and  trucks rumbled  through  the neighborhood as they removed  the fuel soaked soil. Lawns  throughout the neighbor hood were charred. While touring the site re cently, I saw an automobile with tail lights that  melted off the car  from  the heat of the  fire  that burned several blocks away. The air still  reeks of gasoline, and much of the trona car ried by  the  train  remained on  the ground 3  months after the accident to remind the resi dents of the tragedies that have taken place.  Residents are experiencing upper-respiratory  ailments, yet they are told the chemicals they  are breathing are not toxic, just ""irritants"" that  are uncomfortable. Yet, no one will sign a  statement calling the neighborhood safe.  Families have been torn apart as a result of  the stress, and children still live with relatives  because they are afraid to return home. One  mother  told me  that her children ask her  whether their house will blow up in the future.  But it is not just the children who are terrified  to return to their neighborhood. The residents  were told it was safe to return after the rail road accident-someone was wrong that time,  and maybe they are wrong again. Many want  to sell their homes, but their property values  have declined so dramatically that they cannot  afford to move.  In order to help the victims recover from the  accidents, the railroad and pipeline companies  offered each household that had been evacu ated  $5,000 as  a partial  settlement. This  money was to be used to cover the inconven ience,  transportation, housing,  food, clothing,  and incidental expenses during the evacuation  period. Should a family feet that they are emo tionally unable  to  return  to  their home,  this  July 26, 1989  money would enable them to look for a new  place to live. In time,  I expect the courts will  see to it that the victims are fairly compensat ed for their damages and losses. In the mean time, most of  the  residents have spent  the  money, and are working to pick up the pieces  of their shattered lives.  The families in the neighborhood have ex perienced two major disasters in the past few  months. Now  some of  these  families will  endure yet another crisis. Last week I learned  that the County's Department of Social Serv ices sent  letters  to several  families  in  the  neighborhood to inform them that their AFDC  payments would be terminated-until February  1990-because the victims accepted compen sation  for expenses and  losses experienced  as a result of the accidents. Clearly, the inten tion of the law is not to cause victims addition al suffering, yet this is what is happening.  Because there is no distinction in the eligi bility rules, the State considers this to be the  same  type of windfall as winning the lottery.  AFDC  regulations consider  it to be  income,  and declare the families  ineligible for aid  for  the number of months equal to the lump sum  divided by each family's monthly need stand ard. The State has agreed to disregard por tions of this money,  if the victims can supply  receipts proving that this money was used to  replace  items  lost or damaged  in  the acci dents. Considering  the circumstances of the  twin disasters,  it is highly unlikely that these  victims kept full records and receipts of how  the money was spent. These people experi enced multiple evacuations, and many were  victims of extreme emotional trauma. Keeping  sales receipts was the least of their worries at  the time.  Given  this  injustice,  I have  introduced  the  Victims' Welfare Compensation Act  to help  victims of accidents such as  these.  It disre gards disaster relief compensation for victims  for 3 months. This gives victims a short time  period in which they can use the money to put  their lives back in order. The bill also accounts  for those who may receive a large settlement,  and whose situation may improve in the long term. After the 3-month time limit, the remain ing cash on hand would be considered when  determining eligibility. Furthermore,  the new  assets purchased by the victims could be in cluded as resources. This effectively caps the  amount that a victim could claim as disaster  assistance.  By allowing this compensation to be disre garded as income, we are permitting. victim~  of major disasters to move ahead with  their  lives. Accidents such as these do not happen  often, but when they do, we must be sure that  we do not punish innocent victims.  INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  RE VERSE MORTGAGE INSURANCE  FOR OLDER AMERICANS ACT  OF 1989  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 26, 1989  ",1989
781,460,12,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman of  the Subcommittee on Housing and Consumer  ",1989
782,473,12,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation that has far-reaching im plications for two very important Northwest re sources:  fisheries and  hydroelectric power.  This measure authorizes the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission [FERC] to extend the  deadline for the commencement of the Cow litz Falls Hydroelectric Project, No. 2833.  The  Lewis County Public Utility District  [PUD]  has been  pursuing  this project  for  nearly 1 O years and was given the green light  by FERC in June 1988. In April 1988, FERC  granted the one-time, 2-year time extension to  the PUD. The project is now required  to be  under construction by June 30, 1990. FERC  has no discretion to further extend the dead line, only Congress can do so.  The Senate has already passed the neces sary legislation (S. 750) on June 8, 1989, to  permit FERC  to  issue as many as  three, 2year extensions on this project. The bill that I  am introducing today would do the same.  Mr. Speaker,  the PUD has  identified  the  Cowlitz Falls project as the only major energy  resource, apart from energy conservation, that  is both cost-effective and  located within  the  district. Earlier this year, the Northwest Power  Planning Council agreed with the PUD's con clusions and projected a need  for more re gional power resources  in  the 1990's. Addi tionally,  the Bonneville Power Administration  announced recently that there no longer exist ed a regional energy surplus and  that new  sources would need to be developed.  The Cowlitz Falls project, with the generat ing capacity of 70 megawatts and an average  of 261,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annu ally has the potential to contribute substantial ly  to the region's future energy needs. This  energy production  is the equivalent of about  428,000 barrels of oil or 128,000 tons of coal  per year.  Despite the need  for  the project,  it is too  costly for the ratepayers of Lewis County to fi nance alone at this time. With the extensions  provided by this bill, the PUD hopes to attract  other utilities who will share  the costs-and  benefits-of  the Cowlitz  Falls  project.  In  agreements signed earlier this year, the PUD  assured its customers that it would raise rates  by no more than 14 percent. This extension  will provide needed  flexibility  to develop the  best financing program for the project.  This project is also the only potential means  of someday restoring the magnificent salmon  and steelhead runs that once returned to the  upper Cowlitz River. Older dams, built in anEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  other era, have cut off this habitat. Because of  its  run-of-the-river design,  the Cowlitz Falls  project will permit fish collection in the future  when scientists cure  the  fish diseases now  plaguing lower Cowlitz River fish runs.  Mr. Speaker, the question that many of my  colleagues will have is why Congress should  allow  this project  to  receive additional  time  before proceeding with construction?  The answer is simple.  After  the Cowlitz Falls project  received a  FERC license in 1986, the PUD applied for a  Washington State Shoreline permit. At  that  time, three separate parties-a State agency,  a corporation, and a local citizen-filed formal  appeals before the State Shoreline's Hearings  Board. The PUD, while recognizing its Federal  preemptive rights, did not exercise them.  In stead it attempted to negotiate reasonable so lutions acceptable to all of the parties.  Last month,  the PUD  reached an accord  with all appellants through separate, but inter related, settlement agreements. These agree ments contain many project enhancements  and provide added environmental mitigation.  One of  the most exciting aspects of this  project is its potential benefit to the fisheries  resources in the upper Cowlitz drainage. I am  particularly pleased that the PUD will be pro viding financial support for a new Trophy Trout  Program being sponsored by one of my local  sportsmen's organizations, the Friends of the  Cowlitz.  Under the Trophy Trout Program, the PUD  will  grant $100,000  in  capital  construction  matching funds to build trout rearing pens on  the upper reaches of the Cowlitz River. In ad dition, the PUD will contribute up to $35,000  annually to rear and stock trophy-sized rain bow and cutthroat trout. These are trout which  will be raised in river water ponds for 3 to 4  years,  on a natural diet, before being  re leased.  Once established,  the  trophy  trout  fishery  on  the Cowlitz River  is expected  to attract  sports enthusiasts from throughout the Pacific  Northwest, pumping needed  tourism dollars  into the local economy.  In short, I want my colleagues to know that  this utility district used its one-time, 2-year ex tension  to address  the environmental  con cerns of the three appellants. It chose not to  enter the courts to seek its Federal preemp tive rights and it agreed to provide additional  mitigation for fisheries resources that were not  required under its FERC license.  Mr. Speaker, my legislation differs in minor  respects to the Senate counterpart. To begin,  it pertains only to the Cowlitz Falls project. My  colleague from Arkansas, Mr. ALEXANDER, re cently has introduced H.R. 2694, which covers  the  three projects in his State  that were  in cluded in the Senate bill.  Also, my bill does not include provisions of  S. 750 relating to the time limits within which  the PUD must complete construction of  the  project and acquire necessary real property in terests. While I would be quite content if this  body were to pass legislation identical to the  Senate bill,  I will be encouraging the Energy  and Commerce Committee to consider several  deletions from the Senate bill.  First, the Federal Power Act does not spe cifically  limit  the  time  for completion of a  project's construction. It requires the licensee  16451  to commence such construction in good faith  and with due diligence, but gives FERC  the  discretion  to extend  the  time  for  finishing a  project when necessary.  Similarly,  the Federal Power Act presently  does not constrain  the  time  in which  the  li censee may acquire the property needed for  project construction and operation. FERC typi cally requires that all necessary property rights  be acquired within 5 years after issuance of a  license, but  that  time can be extended  for  good cause. Therefore, there really is no need  for  the provisions  in S. 750  that authorize  FERC  to extend  the  time  requirements  for  project  completion  and  acquisition  of  real  property-the Commission already has  the  discretion to do so.  Not only are these provisions unnecessary,  they actually create deadlines that don't pres ently exist and  thus could detract  from  the  flexibility this legislation is intended to provide.  While  the PUD  believes  it  can  complete  project  construction well within  the 5-year  timeframe,  it  is concerned about  tying  the  deadline for property acquisition to the date of  the bill's enactment. The legislation might re quire the PUD to purchase thousands of acres  of  land  in and around  the project  reservoir  years before the project becomes operational.  In such a case, a premature and onerous ex pense would be  imposed upon  the PUD's  ratepayers.  Mr. Speaker,  I offer these minor modifica tions of S. 750  in an effort to fine-tune  that  legislation, not to overhaul it. I do not want the  differences in my bill to delay consideration of  this legislation in any way. As I have indicated,  if my alternations pose significant problems, I  would be pleased to amend my bill to conform  to S. 750.  A TRIBUTE TO MR. CHARLES  CROWE  HON.

785,499,12,Mr. DICKINSON., Mr. Chairman re serving the right to object under my  reservation I would request of the dis tinguished gentleman from California  [Mr. BROWN] an explanation of  the  effect of the modification here so that  all members might be  apprised of  what is involved.  ,1989

788,499,12,Mr. BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, this gentleman from Cali fornia considers  the language which  has just been read by the Clerk to be  clarifying  language  expressing  the  intent of  the amendment, although  perhaps it is not as well expressed as it  should have been.  The amendment itself calls upon the  President of the United States to seek  a mutually verifiable  treaty which  places  limitations  on  antisatellite  weapons.  It is, of course, our assumption that  that would be consistent with the se curity interests of the United States,  and  the  language suggested by  the  gentleman  makes  that  absolutely  clear. That is why we are more than  pleased to accept the language.  ",1989
789,499,12,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman from California  [Mr. BROWN].  Mr. Chairman, let me say, if I might  continue under my reservation, that  the gentleman from California  [Mr.  BROWN] and I have been on opposite  sides of the issues of ASA T's for sever al years now, he being the protagonist  for the exclusion of the right, I being  the antagonist to his amendments to  deny  the United States  the  right  under certain circumstances to devel op and test ASAT's.  Mr. Chairman, this is a sense-of-the Congress-amendment  that we  have  worked out, as I understand it, saying  that the President should work toward  an agreement: first, that the President  should urge that the Soviets dismantle  a site that we are aware of, that they  have in being now, and that we work  toward  a  verifiable  prohibition  on  antisatellite weaponry in the future.  Mr. Chairman, the words added were  consistent with the security interests  of the United States and its allies, so  we certainly want to do whatever is in  consistency with our interests. There  is nothing wrong with working toward  that goal. The gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. BROWN] and I both agree  on that.  Mr. Chairman, since this is a sense of-the-Congress language amendment  consistent with the security interests  of the United States and its allies, we  find no fault with it.  ",1989
790,499,12,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1989
791,499,12,Mr. DICKINSON., I yield to the gen tleman from Pennsylvania.  ,1989
792,499,12,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman, I  want to thank the distinguished rank ing member  of  the Committee on  Armed Services, the gentleman from  Alabama [Mr. DICKINSON],  for yield ing to me.  Mr. Chairman,  I rise today to urge my col leagues  to support  the Brown-Coughlin Asat  amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  the Asat amendment that is  being  introduced  this year  is quite different  from  the measures  that the gentleman  from  California and  I have put forth  in years past.  Though this year's measure is modest relative  to previous efforts, it remains a very important  initiative.  We are offering an amendment on anti-sat ellite weapons again  this year because  the  fundamental  reasons  for  supporting  con straints on Asat's remain basically unchanged.  A United States-Soviet competition in the Asat  arena would be contrary to United States in terests. The United States remains  far more  dependent on our satellites than  the Soviets  are on theirs, for a number of reasons. First,  because our forces are more widely dispersed  around the world, we must rely on our satellite  constellation  to maintain effective command  and control. Second, because our technology  is so much more sophisticated than the Soviets', we derive greater benefits from our satel lite network than  the Soviets do from  theirs.  Third, while glasnost has opened  the Soviet  Union up in important ways, the Soviet Union  remains more closed  to outside observers  than does  the United States. We need our  satellites  to know what  is going on  in  the  U.S.S.R. Finally, because our satellites are  more  reliable  than are Soviet satellites, we  can  afford  to  rely  on  them  to a greater  degree.  We are offering this particular amendment,  however, because some aspects of the situa tion here and abroad have changed markedly.  This year's Brown-Coughlin amendment  re flects the fact that we have a new President,  whose national security adviser, General Brent  Scowcroft, has in  the past indicated support  for negotiated limitations on Asat weapons.  It  reflects the fact that there is a new reality in  United States-Soviet  relations, built on  the  success of the Reagan administration's deal ing with Mikhail Gorbachev and the signing of  the INF Treaty. It reflects the fact that the So viets have signaled a willingness  to explore  verification measures they have not been will ing  to discuss before, as  is clear  from  the  highly  intrusive verification provisions  in  the  INF Treaty and the Soviets' recent  invitation  to our colleagues JIM OUN, JOHN SPRATT, and  Boe CARR to visit the Sary Shagan laser site.  Simply stated,  the Brown-Coughlin amend ment expresses the sense of the Congress on  four points:  First,  it calls on  the President to seek the  dismantlement of  the Soviet coorbital Asat.  Certainly this is a goal that everyone here can  support.  Second, it urges the President to seek strict  limits on Asat's with the Soviets. We have not  held discussions on antisatellite weapons for  some 1 O years, since the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan. The time is right to resume these  talks.  Third,  it  recommends,  in  the  course of  United States-Soviet Asat discussions,  that  the President explore cooperative verification  measures with  the Soviet Union. As noted  above,  the Soviets have expressed a willing ness to consider new means of verification.  Fourth, finally, it requires a report that would  provide  information  to  the Congress about  United States  satellite  survivability, United  States Asat programs, and the nature of the  threat to our military forces should the Soviets  build Asat's similar to those now on our draw ing boards.  Mr. Chairman,  the amendment  the gentle man from California and I are putting forward  this year is very important in its purpose, but  very  restrained  in  its approach.  It does not  prohibit testing.  It does not alter funding pro files.  It does not  impose constraints on  the  President or  require a particular negotiating  stance or strategy. Our amendment merely  expresses Congressional concern about  the  dangers of an Asat arms race  in space and  the huge accompanying costs that we would  bear if such a race goes unchecked. I urge all  my colleagues to support this measure.  ",1989

797,512,12,Mr. DONALD E.," ""BUZ"" LUKENS.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Owens-Aspin-Fascell amendment  prohibiting fiscal year 1990 funds for  Army production of binary chemical  weapons.  I am not in favor of chemical weap ons. I do not know a Member of this  body who  favors  chemical warfare.  However,  I  do believe  in protecting  those soldiers who are willing to put  their lives on the line  in defense of  freedom and democracy.  Mr. Chairman, modernization of our  chemical weapons is critical to deter ring other nations from using  these  weapons  against  our  soldiers. The  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  William Crowe, has stated that deter ring a chemical attack is one of his  most deficient areas. Many leaders in  the military have stated that failure to  modernize our chemical weapon arse nal  leaves our  forces  so vulnerable  that it invites an attack from  those  who are capable of doing so. Since the  end of World War I, the only nations  that have used these weapons are the  ones who know the other side is lack ing a credible deterrent.  FDR said in the 1940's that, ""it is in  the general opinion of civilized man kind, that chemical weapons should be  outlawed,"" and I agree with this as sessment.  In fact,  the Soviet Union  has been suggesting  that  they will  stop producing these horrible weapons  and even destroy their existing stock pile. However, the simple fact is that  to date, to our knowledge they have  not destroyed any of their chemical  weaponry. And they are, by far,  the  possessor of the world's largest stock pile. And  they are still  the world's  largest  manufacturer  of  chemical  weapons.  The United States has participated  actively in the negotiations at the con ference  on disarmament  since  1971  where we have been committed to the  eventual destruction of all chemical  weapons. But as  then-Vice President  George Bush said in 1984, a compre hensive  ban  on  chemical weapons  cannot work unless states are prepared  to ""commit themselves to a new, but  absolutely necessary degree of open ness-a new way of doing business.""  Mr. Chairman, I want to see the end  of these terrible weapons, but a unilat eral decision to stop producing chemi cal weapons will not force others to  stop. This program is a small price to  pay to bring the other nations of the  world  to the bargaining table and I  urge my colleagues to vote against this  misguided amendment.  ",1989
798,512,12,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself the balance of the time.  I thought the gentleman from Flori da CMr. FASCELL] made an interesting  statement. He said that the committee  handled this right. I hope Members re alize that the committee fully funded  it. The Armed Services Committee decided that. It is my colleague, the gen tleman from Utah, who is taking the  money out.  I wonder if the chairman, the gentle man  from Wisconsin  CMr.  AsPIN],  would respond to a question.  I think the real hangup we have got,  and I appreciate the Chairman's com ment when he talked about the idea  that it is not on line, I received a letter  today from Mr. Richardson pointing  out that the three legs of this that we  are in trouble with, I guess we agree is  the Marquardt part of the binary pro gram, have they got it done? We have  a man down there and we think they  are on  line, but  if we  accept  the  premise  they are not on  line, what  would be wrong with authorizing  it  and fencing it as we have in numerous  places throughout this bill? It seems  to me that would be a reasonable ap proach.  ",1989
799,512,12,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1989
800,512,12,Mr. HANSEN., I yield to the gentle man from Wisconsin.  ,1989
801,512,12,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, I have no  objection to that response. What we  just decided to do  in the context of  this bill was to take the money out be cause we thought that, in fact, prob ably the right thing to do would be to  have it closer to zero than full fund ing, take the money out and seek a re programming, or allow  the Army  to  seek a reprogramming, encourage the  Army to seek a reprogramming. It has  the same effect. The difference is only  a little bit of drafting and it was just  drafted this way.  I  think the effect of this business  where we say no money and encourage  a reprogramming is the same effect as  having  the money  in  there  and  a  fence.  ",1989
802,512,12,Mr. HANSEN.," The only problem I  see in that, Mr. Chairman, is that if  we  reprogram we have  to  take  the  money out of somewhere else. If I un derstand it right, if we  just take the  money out and kind of fence it, we can  use the money we have got.  I would urge a vote against this.  ",1989
803,512,12,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today in  support of  the Owens-Aspin-Fascell amend ment on binary chemical weapons.  In  1969,  the United  States  unilaterally  stopped  production  of  chemical weapons.  That moratorium  remained  in  force  for 18  years with no harm  to our security.  In 1987,  the Soviets also stopped production of chemi cal weapons.  In response, we resumed pro duction 10 months later.  We should not be here today considering a  request for production of new chemical weap ons for four very important reasons.  First, we don't know how to safely dispose  of the huge and dangerous stockpile of chem ical weapons that already exists and yet we  want to build more. According to a 1988 Army  study on current research  facilities, chemical  safety has slipped through a crack and poses  increased  risk  to workers and  surrounding  ",1989

We  do not even throw them in the front  lines equally, but if we want to look at  it, all we are saying is give everyone in  America a chance.  Women are not included in this, yet  they are moving into small businesses  at a rapid pace, and they get less than  1 percent of Government contracts.  If anybody  really believes govern ment contracts are done on a competi tive basis,  they believe  in the tooth  fairy.  I  support  ment.  ",1989
810,525,12,Mr.  IRELAND.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself my final minute to close  the Mavroules  amend by saying the record is true, no small  business hearings have been held on  this matter.  I would also address the figures that  have been manipulated here from time  to time. Of the 40 percent of the De fense Department contracts that were  offered to small business, that is the  universe that was available to all small  business,  small  and  disadvantaged  firms got 7 percent of that total. Of  the ones that were offered and award ed to small business, small disadvan taged firms got 14.4 percent.  The gentleman from California CMr.  DREIER] made  an  important  point.  This  section 1207  cvuld be put  in  better order, but we were denied the  opportunity  to address  the  improve ments that could be made to it, so in  its present form it should be stopped  before  the program ends up  in  the  world of Wedtech.

812,525,12,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong  support  of  the Mavroules  amendment and would  like  to  take  just a moment to commend the gentle man  from Massachusetts who  took  this issue on a few years ago with a lot  of conflicting claims, and an awful lot  of screaming and shouting here on the  floor when the original legislation was  passed. He  led  the way  to devising  what I think is a workable formula in  order to increase the amount of small  disadvantaged businesses doing work  with the Pentagon.  We have a program that I think is  on the way. It is a long way before we  get anything that is workable yet, but  he is on the right track and we need  an extension.  Congratulations  to  the gentleman  from Massachusetts. Let us support  his amendment.  ",1989
813,525,12,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself my remaining time.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  amendment  would extend the section 1207 5-per cent  goal  an  P.dditional  3  years,  through fiscal year 1993.  Armed Services Committee work on  this issue began with the adoption in  the fiscal year 1987 DOD Authoriza tion Act <Public Law 99-661) of the 5percent goal for awards of contracts to  small  and  disadvantaged  businesses  CSDB'sl by  the Department of De fense. The committee joined with the  Black and Hispanic Caucuses to push  for appropriate implementation of the  program  and  intervened with  then  Deputy Secretary of Defense Taft to  have the DOD regulations amended. It  was not an easy process.  I and several other Members met  with Secretary Taft on numerous oc casions in an effort to resolve issues  surrounding the Department's imple mentation of section 1207.  In 1987  those efforts culminated in the adop tion of a new provision in the DOD  Authorization Act mandating the issu ance  of  regulations which  among  other  things would:  First,  provide  guidance  to contracting officers  for  making advance payments; second, es tablish goals for DOD prime contrac tor subcontract awards; third, provide  incentives for primes to increase sub contract awards to SDB's; and fourth,  establish policies and procedures  to  ensure that current levels of contracts  awarded under the 8(a) and small busi ness set-aside programs did not dimin ish as a result of section 1207.  At the same time, we were holding  hearings  both  in Washington  and  around the country. In 1988 we held  eight hearings in Chicago, Memphis,  Montgomery, Lawton, OK, Houston,  Hawthorne, CA, Morristown, NJ, and  Oakland, CA.  Then in September 1988, again with  the support and assistance of the His panic and Black Caucuses, we began a  series of roundtable meetings with in dustry and the Under Secretary of De fense for Acquisition. At the January  31,  1989,  roundtable meeting,  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association  CAIAl, on behalf of the industry work ing group, presented a  resolution of  the AIA board of governors. That reso lution  indicates  the commitment of  AIA member companies to share their  SDB sources,  set  internal goals  for  SDB  awards,  review  their  present  buying practices, designate a  senior  management focal point, pursue team ing  agreements  with  SDB's,  and  pursue programs with HBCU's and  Mi's.  As a followup effort approximately  35 staff of interested Members of Con gress went on a trip to Wright-Patter son AFB, Oklahoma Air  Logistics  Center, and General Dynamics, Fort  Worth, to examine the efforts of both  industry and DOD to increase awards  to SDB's.  The latest roundtable meeting with  industry CEO's was held on May 17,  1989,  and attended by Don White,  president of Hughes, ""K"" Hurt, presi dent of Martin Marietta, Sam Icobel lis, president of Rockwell Internation al,  Jim Dever, vice-president, TRW,  and Don Fuqua, president, Aerospace  Industries Association.  AIA  subse quently announced that data base col lection contract they agreed to spon sor was awarded to Conwal, Inc., an  SDB. Approximately 4 weeks ago, the  contract  to survey  the programs of  member  companies  and  develop  a  report on the most effective aspects of  their programs so that other compa nies could develop a more effective  SDB program was awarded.  As you all know, it is one thing to  pass a law. It is another to work with  the agencies who implement the law,  and to work with the major prime con tractors, who are perhaps  the best  source of contracts for SDB's, on an  ",1989

815,538,12,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  just would like to reply to a remark  that was just made a moment ago that  people who are liberal in nature admit  that this is not a very logical law, and  there  is  something wrong with  the  law. I am not very liberal. I think I am  probably a middle-of-the-road individ ual. But I must say that I think this is  a  very  logical  law. Herbert Hoover  signed this law into effect. We have  lived with it for a long time, and if we  want to change this law we ought not  to do it before full hearings in some  committee of Congress, and not in this  way at this time.  ",1989
816,538,12,Mr. MURPHY., I yield to the gentle man from Texas.  ,1989
817,538,12,Mr. STENHOLM.," I will return the  favor when I have the chance.  Mr. Chairman, I am not contending  that all of this savings is  in the de fense bill. This is  total Government  contract work. Defense is only 30 per cent of these numbers.  DOES THE MURPHY AMENDMENT EXPAND  PREVAILING WAGE LAW? NO  Some  of  the  opponents  of  the  Murphy  amendment  have  invested  considerable time and expense spread ing misinformation  about  how  the  Murphy amendment supposedly vastly  expands Davis-Bacon prevailing wage  law. This simply is not true. I under stand and sympathize with my col leagues who do not serve on the Labor  Committee and may become confused  about some of the complicated provi sions in the Davis-Bacon Act, as well  as related administrative and judicial  rulings and how the Murphy amend ment affects current law.  This amendment saves money-read  the CBO  letter  in our Committee  Report 100-504.  This amendment does not expand  the Davis-Bacon Act to cover Federal  lease construction. It already covers  lease construction. Call the Secretary  of Labor and ask her for her own  Wage Appeals Board rulings  in  the  Fort Drum case and the Crown Point,  IN, Veterans Clinic case. Both apply  Davis-Bacon to Federal leases. That is  how the Secretary of Labor currently  interprets the Davis-Bacon Act.  This amendment does not expand  the Davis-Bacon Act to offsite fabrica tion facilities. The current law already  covers offsite work, which is undertak en solely in support of a Davis-Bacon  project. Call the Secretary of Labor  and ask her.  This  amendment does  not vastly  expand the Secretary of Labor's au thority to interpret the Davis-Bacon  Act and make her rulings binding on  other  agencies.  The  Secretary  of  Labor already has that authority pur suant  to Presidential Reorganization  Plan No.  14 of 1950-an Executive  order which  is still  in effect  today.  Call the Secretary of Labor and ask  her.  This amendment does not violate  privacy rights by ordering release of  Copeland Act payroll reports. A Feder al circuit court of appeals decision al ready has ordered release of such pay roll reports. This amendment actually  narrows the payroll information that  must be disclosed under that court de cision.  This amendment does not subject  construction employers to a new and  dangerous private right to action for  unpaid wages. The private right in this  amendment is identical to the existing  private  rights of actions  in section  16<b> of the Fair Labor Standards Act  CFLSAJ. Construction employers are  already subject to this identical FLSA  private right of action for any over time pay violations they may commit.  Call the Secretary of Labor and ask  her.  I could go on, but I  think my col leagues can already understand that  this bill is not imaginative, new or rev olutionary. It is largely a codification  of existing prevailing wage law, court  rulings, Presidential Executive orders,  administrative  rulings by  the Secre tary of Labor, and other aspects of the  extant body of prevailing wage law, or  related wage and hour law.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise  today to ask  the House to join with me once again  in support of reasonable reform of the  Davis-Bacon Act. I can only wish that  the rest of my life would be as certain  and as  regular as our perennial at tempts to reform Davis-Bacon. Manag ing this issue every year has become so  familiar to me that I find myself men tioning the words ""Davis-Bacon"" when  I  encounter  someone  complaining  about how life is constantly changing,  and  taking with it the many things  that they have come to rely on. With  Davis-Bacon the old adage ""the more  things change the more they stay the  same"" could not be more true.  Some of my colleagues may have  preferred to deal with this controver sial issue earlier in the lOlst Congress.  That may have been a better time.  However,  there were no requests  to  hold hearings and in light of the discord which prevailed during the earli er months of this session. It was a wise  move for the Committee on Education  and Labor to wait until now to address  this issue.  The question now, as it was in past  debates on Davis-Bacon, is the same;  do we want real reform or repeal of  the act? In hearings held by the Sub committee on Labor Standards, we de termined  during  the  last Congress  that the Davis-Bacon Act remains an  important means of protecting  the  livelihoods of American workers. And  like  anything  that works well, we  would like to keep it in good working  order so we proposed modest changes  that would fine tune the act, not de stroy its effectiveness by narrowing its  scope.  Last year, the Committee on Educa tion and Labor  supported a Davis Bacon  reform  proposal  that would  have  increased  the act's thresholds  from  the current  level of $2,000  to  $50,000. This modest approach was  adopted by the House as an amend ment to last year's defense authoriza tion bill on May 3, 1988, but unfortu nately it was removed in conference. I  am hoping that today as we prepare to  vote, to give the Pentagon $300 billion,  that we will not forget the millions of  American workers who depend on the  decent wage established for them by  the Davis-Bacon Act.  We find now ourselves in the exact  same battle as a year ago with the  same players and the same numbers.  The amendment that I am asking you  to  support  today with  some minor  technical changes is the same amend ment adopted by the House last year.  And for those of you who may need a  refresher course,  let me outline for  you my amendment.  As I stated earlier, it will raise the  act's coverage threshold for construc tion projects financed with tax dollars  from $2,000 to $50,000. It raises from  $2,000 to $15,000 the threshold for re pairs and remodeling on Federal con tracts.  It provides an objective standard to  prevent agencies from splitting con tracts to avoid the application of the  new threshold.  It compels the Department of Labor  to issue more timely wage determina tions.  It restores  the scope of prevailing  wage surveys to include all similar con struction in an applicable area and not  statewide.  It provides  two alternatives to the  present much  criticized  compliance  system of exclusive relief from the De partment of Labor. It expedites  the  administrative process, and it provides  a private right of action.  It reduces by 50 percent employer  payroll reporting requirements under  the Copeland Act. Employers are now  required  to  file weekly  reports and  ",1989
818,564,12,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in sup port of  the amendment offered by my col league from Michigan [Mr. BONIOR].  Few people know that the United States is  virtually unprotected from a Soviet air attack.  With all of the debate surrounding the strate gic  defense  initiative,  I'm  sure Americans  would be surprised to learn that all we have to  shoot down cruise missiles and ICBM's are a  handful of fighter aircraft from various National  Guard units on 5-minute alert. Surprisingly  enough, the Air Force wants to cut even this  very modest air defense protection.  Let me remind this body of a little history. In  1985, President Reagan and Canadian Prime  Minister Mulroney signed an agreement as  part of the Quebec summit to modernize the  air defense network of North America. Many  of our radar systems date back to the 1950's,  which were originally designed  to  counter  Soviet bomber threats.  We all realize now that the new threat to  continental air defense comes primarily from  cruise missiles  fired  from  submarines  or  bombers. These are launched long before the  subs or bombers enter U.S. territory. As a  result, the old radar network is obsolete.  Last year, Congress approved  the Bonior  amendment, which prevented  the Air Force  from taking the Air National Guard units along  the border with Canada off 5-minute alert  pending  the  results  of  a  report  on  the  progress of the new radar line. Unfortunately,  up until just a few days ago, the Pentagon ignored this request of Congress. However, just  as talk of a new amendment was brewing, De fense Secretary Cheney  issued an  interim  report, which  skirted many  of  the  critical  issues  facing  the Air Guard units along  the  northern tier.  I have  included a copy for the  RECORD.  Let me make  this absolutely clear.  I fully  support the modernization of our air defense  capability.  I share  the concern of Defense  Secretary Cheney  in  addressing  the  new  cruise missile  threat. However,  I believe  the  Pentagon has embarked on a counterproduc tive policy without sufficient consultations with  civilian leaders, which may open a window of  vulnerability to a Soviet bomber attack before  all of the new radar systems are functioning  and the new runways are fully operational.  The Air Force  has  prematurely  brought  down  the Cadin-Pinetree  air  defense  line  before a coherent policy of radar implacement  and forward deployment of air interceptors in  North America have been fully approved and  operational. Did you know  that  the  runways  supposedly constructed for alert status are in  places you wouldn't even send your dog? Ba sically, these men are supposed to pull alert  in areas in the uppermost regions of northern  Canada that just has an airstrip and a shack.  There  is  little support  for the pilots and  the  fighter interceptor. It's simply awful, especially  during wintertime.  It appears  that  the Air  Force expects the Soviets to launch a cruise  missile attack during the summer.  That's why  I support  the amendment of fered by Representative BONIOR. The leaders  of  the House and Senate Armed Services  Committees  received an  interim  report but  Members need a more comprehensive  re sponse, specifically focusing on the progress  on the construction projects of the new radar  line and  future plans  for  the Air National  Guard units along  the northern  tier currently  on 5-minute alert. We also need to know the  extent the United States plans to rely on the  Canadian Air Force for the air defense of the  North American continent.  These are critical questions for the air sov ereignty of the United States. We have yet to  receive adequate answers.  I encourage my  colleagues to support the Bonior amendment.  Hopefully, we will get them.  THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,  Washington, DC, July 16, 1989.  Hon. LES ASPIN,  Chairman, House Armed Services Commit tee, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Attached, as request ed, 1 is my report on the employment of stra tegic air defense assets along the northern  border of the United States through FY  1991.  The report:  a. Describes the availability of alert and  nonalert fighters during FY 1989 through  FY 1991 for the conduct of the strategic de fense of the United States along the north ern border.  b. Describes the contributions to the stra tegic air defense mission expected  to be  made  by  the modernized Air National  Guard units.  1 Conference Report  to Accompany H.R. 4481,  September  28,  1988, House  of Representatives  Report 100-989.  c. Recommends recision of  the congres sional direction restricting the Secretary of  the Air Force from making changes in the  status and deployment of northern Air Na tional Guard units from their status and de ployment as of 10 April 1988.  Duplicate copies of this report have been  sent to the President of the Senate, Speaker  of the House, the Chairman, Senate Armed  Services Committee, Senator Warner, and  Congressman Dickinson.  Sincerely,  DICK CHENEY.  THE  SECRETARY  OF  DEFENSE  REPORT  TO  SENATE AND HOUSE Alu4ED SERVICES COM MITTEES ON  THE STRATEGIC AIR DEFENSE  ALERT MISSION  1. In 1982, Secretary Weinberger provided  Congress  the Air Defense Master Plan,  which laid out the strategy for countering  the growing Soviet strategic  threat. The  plan outlines a far forward perimeter de fense of North America  that can detect,  intercept, identify and negate air-launched  cruise missile CALCM] equipped bomber air craft before  they  launch  their missiles.  Since then, the United States and Canada  have invested heavily in a number of pro grams that will improve our ability to pro vide  timely and reliable  tactical warning,  attack assessment, and damage limitation to  North America.  2. Our investment in the Over-the-Horizon  Backscatter Radar System COTH-Bl  and  North Warning System CNWSl will signifi cantly improve our air defense warning and  assessment capability. Modern NWS radars  are  replacing  the obsolete Distant Early  Warning CDEWl line radar. They will have  substantially better  low altitude coverage  than the DEW Line ~d will complement  the additional capability provided by  the  OTH-B radar system in the future. Fifteen  long-range NWS radars are now  in oper ation across Canada a.nd 39  short-range  NWS radars will be fielded. This improved  capability to detect the airborne threat and  direct modern, long-range,  interceptor air craft to their targets permits us to better  align our strategic defense force structure.  3. The nature of the evolving threat and  our limited number of defensive forces dic tate a perimeter defense. Extended-range  cruise missiles can be launched well outside  the boundaries historically established by  strategic  air  defense  forces  around  the  CONUS. To defend the United States from  this threat, we must forward deploy inter ceptor aircraft and our 1-3 Airborne Warn ing and Control Systems CAW ACSl aircraft  to locations in northern Canada in periods  of heightened tension. The changed threat  rendered the previous line of 1950's technol ogy aircraft control and warning radars ob solete. Therefore, the Canadian Air Defense  Identification Zone CCADIZl  in southern  Canada was deactivated by agreement be tween Canada and  the United States on  June 30,  1988 and  its associated  line of  radars was closed.  4. The  requirement  to  forward deploy  interceptors along the northern reaches of  North America in time of crisis is consistent  with the cruise missile and bomber threats.  As such, there is no plan to relocate the 18  fighter aircraft and associated support from  each of five squadron locations alvng the  northern-tier. However, the military need to  maintain 24-hour home-base alert using two  fighter aircraft from each of five CONUS  northern-tier units is no longer valid in light  of the elimination of the supporting radar/  ",1989
819,577,12,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  proud to introduce along with my dis tinguished colleague, the chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee,  H.R. 3030, President Bush's Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1989.  The President's bill demonstrates a  strong commitment to cleaning the air  we breathe. It achieves more reduc tions  than any acid  rain bill  intro duced to date, and attains 94 percent  of the reductions achieved by the most  stringent nonattainment bill already  introduced. It adds $19 billion per year  in new pollution control costs, a 50  percent increase in what the Nation  already spends on clean air, and repre sents  the best opportunity  to break  the 12-year  logjam of  rigidity  and  stubbornness that has prevented the  enactment of any clean air proposal.  For the past 12 years, we've listened  to the professional environmentalists,  and for 12 years our air quality has de teriorated drastically  for  the simple  reason that we could not reach agree ment. An inability to compromise has  left us without any clean air legisla tion, and we have all suffered from the  obstinance of those who demand their  program in its entirety to the exclu sion of all else.  29-059 0-90--19 (Pt. 12)  Senator GEORGE MITCHELL, perhaps  the leading advocate of strong envi ronmental legislation,  last year criti cized  the  environmental  lobby  for  being ""rigid and unyielding, wholy un willing  to  compromise,  even when  faced with the certainty that their ri gidity would result in no action this  year."" The professional enviromenta lists are employing  the same  tactics  this year. The result of this attitude,  said Senator MITCHELL, would be that  the ""health of more American chil dren will suffer, more lakes will die,  more forests will wither.""  We have a clear choice before us. We  can continue with the uncompromis ing ways of the past that produce no  legislation,  or we  can  support  the  President's  attempt  to move  this  debate  forward and ensure  that air  pollution is not the only legacy that  we leave to future generations.  I would  like  to  include  for  the  RECORD at this point highlights and a  brief summary of the bill.  H.R. 3030, THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS  OF 1989  HIGHLIGHTS  Acid Rain  The bill will achieve a true 10 million ton  reduction in annual sulfur dioxide emissions  from 1980 levels by the year 2000. By requir ing new sources of pollution in future years  to be offset by  reductions  from existing  sources, the bill ensures that this 10 million  ton reduction is permanent.  The bill contains one to two million tons  more 802 reductions than the leading com peting legislation in the House.  The bill contains a workable and innova tive trading system, so that utilities can use  market mechanisms to seek the most cost eff ective reductions.  Nonattainment  Through a series of cost effective controls  on sources of urban ozone, the bill would  bring the overwhelming majority of Ameri can cities into attainment with the health based ozone standard by the year 2000.  The cities with  the most serious ozone  problems would be required to reduce ozone causing emissions by 3 percent per year to  ensure that steady progress is made toward  meeting the nation's clean air standards.  The bill contains  tougher standards for  hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon  monoxide from automobile tailpipes. It also  contains provisions  to  reduce evaporative  emissions from running losses, tailpipe emis sions  from  light  duty  trucks,  emissions  which occur during refueling, and pollution  from urban buses.  The clean fuels program will bring clean  burning alternative fuels and clean-fueled  vehicles  into  the market,  thus  reducing  smog-producing and toxic air emissions in  America's most polluted cities and providing  a  longer-term  reconciliation between  the  automobile and the environment.  Air toxics  The bill puts  forth a  set schedule by  which regulations to reduce public health  risk from emissions of airborne toxic chemi cals will be promulgated.  The regulations will be set on the basis of  ""Maximum Achievable Control Technolo gy"" <MACT), a concept contained in several  pending pieces of Congressional legislation,  which would require existing sources of air  toxics to achieve the same emissions stand ards as those achieved by the best perform ing  plants  now  operating. New  sources  would be subject to an even tougher stand ard, matching that set by the best perform ing source.  Enforcement  The bill contains tough new penalties for  those who violate our clean air laws.  H.R. 3030, THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS  OF 1989  SUMMARY  The bill would guarantee by  the year  2000, a permanent reduction of 10 million  tons  in  sulfur dioxide  from 1980  levels;  would sharply reduce pollutants that con tribute to urban ozone and would establish  a set schedule for regulation of toxic air  emissions using  the Maximum Achievable  Control Technology <MACT>.  The bill would also-establish a system of  marketable permits to allow acid rain reduc tions  to be achieved  in  the  least costly  manner. It would also stiffen penalties for  those who violate our clear air laws.  The bill allows  for both environmental  protection and economic growth, two long standing concerns often considered at odds  with each other. By incorporating both con cerns, the bill seeks to break the gridlock  which has characterized the debate on clean  air for the past several years.  The bill has seven titles.  Title I: Nonattainment with standards for  ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate  matter  Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments  of 1989 addresses the particular air pollu tion problems that have been most difficult  to solve  in recent years (i.e., urban smog,  carbon monoxide, and particulate matter>.  as well as basic structural problems in the  current Clean Air Act. The title would re place the current structure in the Act with  an updated approach that will address all  current and future efforts to attain national  ambient air quality standards <NAAQS>.  Title I would establish a set of general re quirements that would apply to the air qual ity plans for all areas of the country. It sets  forth a process for areas to be designated as  in ""attainment"" or ""nonattainment"" for a  pollutant. Title I contains various require ments that would apply specifically to areas  designated non-attainment for the six pol lutants  for which EPA has  already  set  NAAQS: ozone, carbon monoxide, particu late matter, lead, sulfur oxides, and nitro gen dioxide.  For ozone nonattainment areas, one of the  major focuses of the current Clean Air Act  debate, the title proposes attainment dead lines of 1995, 2000, or 2010 depending on the  severity of the problem. Virtually all Ameri can cities would be required to come into at tainment by the year 2000. As part of the  effort to reduce emissions of volatile organic  compounds in the most serious ozone non attainment areas,  the bill would  require  those areas  to reduce  those emissions by  three percent per year beginning with the  year of enactment. This requirement will  ensure that steady progress toward attain ment is achieved. In addition, this bill re quires EPA to  issue guidelines on control  technology applicable to seven types of in dustrial facilities, which States will then use  to develop emission control  requirements  for those facilities. The bill also calls upon  EPA  to study means of controlling emis",1989

833,629,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Nevada.  HIGH-LEVEL NUCLEAR WASTE  ,1989
834,629,12,Mr. BRYAN.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak with a sense of indignation and  outrage over terms that appear in the  Appropriations Act that we are about  to vote upon. These provisions are  unfair to my State. They are unrea sonable. They are onerous and in my  opinion  they are unconscionable.  I  ref er specifically  to  those provisions  that address  the high-level nuclear  waste site at Yucca Mountain, NV, and  the restrictive language contained in  both the act itself and in the report  language accompaning the bill.  In order to understand the perspec tive from which I speak, I would like  to retrace a bit of history as it relates  to  the nuclear waste policy of our  country.  In 1982 the Congres adopted the Nu clear Waste Policy Act.  It may not  have been a perfect piece of legislation  but it did reach a series of compro mises, and it was a delicately and care fully crafted piece of  legislation.  In  effect, by adopting  it, Congress said  that no region in our country should  unfairly bear all of  the burden of  high-level  nuclear  waste  disposal.  Indeed, there would be regional parity.  There would be a site  in  the Ea.st.  There would be a site in the West.  In addition,  the act fully contem plated that the States ultimately se lected for site characterization would  participate  as  partners,  that  there  would be funding provided by the Con gress from the nuclear waste fund for  the States to conduct an independent  oversight of DOE,  to  independently  evaluate and to develop scientific data  that ultimately would be presented to  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission if  licensing were sought based upon that  study.  The Department of Energy was the  agency charged with the responsibility  of administering the 1982 act.  Mr. President, I must say that we in  Nevada had an expectation that the  interpretation and the application of  that act would be fair. Indeed, at the  outset,  there were expectations and  hope that fairness and scientific data  would be the driving force behind the  selection process.  Unhappily, Mr. President, that has  not been the case. No sooner had the  act been signed into law than the De partment of Energy refused to make  funds available to those States which  had been preliminarily designated as  study areas. I ref er particularly to the  State of Texas, to the State of Wash ington,  and  to my  own State  of  Nevada.  Indeed,  the Department of Energy  became so unyielding that it was nec essary  for  the  respective  attorneys  general in each of those States to file  suit against the Department of Energy  to secure the release of funds which  the act contemplated would be made  available to each of the States to con duct their own independent-and I un derscore the word ""independent""-sci entific evaluation.  The States were successful at the  U.S. district court level, but that did  not stop the Department of Energy,  They continued to resist and ultimate ly the case was appealed. The appel late court affirmed the decision of the  district court and indicated that the  Department of Energy make  those  funds available to the State. Notwith standing the decisions of the U.S. dis trict court and the appellate court, it  became necessary for a committee of  the Congress to direct the Department  of Energy to release the funds so the  States  that had been preliminarily  designated  as  site  characterization  States would have money available for  independent oversight.

835,642,12,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of the amendment by  my colleague, Senator McCAIN.  I supported Senator McCAIN'S earli er effort-in June of this year on the  dire emergency supplemental appro priations bill-to reconsider portions  of the catastrophic loss protection pro gram and on that occasion stated my  views on Senator McCAIN'S proposal at  some length.  As I said on that occasion,  it has  become absolutely clear that a very  large group of those affected by the  program are passionately opposed to  it. This is clear from the mail we have  received which is opposed to the pro gram. I have received now more than  8,000  letters on the program, all, or  virtually all, opposed  to  it. This  is  clear also from comment received at  my listening posts around the State,  from poll results, and from positions  taken by many organizations purport ing  to  represent  groups  of  older  people.  I  should note also, Mr. President,  that many of those who supported the  original  legislation had  reservations  about it when it passed. While some  benefits seemed good, other did not  seem  as  good. Estimates of  future  costs seemed understated, and the po tential for redtape great. Many Mem bers decided that, on balance, the ben efits of the legislation outweighed the  liabilities. Other Members  decided  that  the  liabilities  outweighed  the  benefits.

841,655,12,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I thank  my friend from Arizona for yielding 3  minutes. I also thank him for focusing  attention on this issue. As I sit here  and listen to this debate, I find this is  a classic example of the debate that I  have been hearing in Washington, DC,  for many years: An example of where  we allow policy  to be driven by the  bean  counters.  I  am on both  the  Budget Committee and  the Finance  Committee-committees  that  have  given us almost $3 trillion of red ink.  I can tell you that outside the belt way, people could care less about the  Budget Act. They know we have $2.8  trillion  of  red  ink.  Congress  has  handed  them  a  bunch of benefits  called the catastrophic insurance pro gram that they did not ask for, they  did not want, and they do not want to  pay for it. It is easy for this Senator to  point out the fact because I was 1 of  only 11 Senators who on June 8, 1988,  stood on the floor and voted against  the bill.  I still think it's a bad bill. Congress  should admit it made a mistake, repeal  this act, go back to ground zero, and  pass a catastrophic bill for the Ameri can people based on true catastrophic  needs, without  limiting  it  to senior  citizens, Mr. President. This program  should cover all Americans and we  should all share  the cost. Congress  should not force citizens to go on Med icare. Let  them keep  their dignity.  That is what most Americans thought  they were going to get when we began  discussing  the  issue  years  ago.  turned out to be something completely  different from what President Reagan  It  and others talked about in 1986 as cat astrophic insurance.  Mr. President, as  I have said, we  probably cannot win  this today. We  probably cannot repeal it. But I, as a  member of the Budget and Finance  Committees, salute the Senator from  Arizona. I think he is right on target.  The American people deserve to have  this Congress admit it made a mistake,  as well as the administration. We need  to come up with a reasonable proposal  and fix what we have without taking 2  years to do it. Some of our seniors will  be in the highest tax bracket in our so ciety as a result of this legislation. We  ought to fix it. I reserve the remainder  of my time, and I thank the Senator.  ",1989

But  I also appreciate the frustration that  many of us feel over the inability to  deal with what I think most consider a  flawed program, a program that needs  reform and needs it quickly if we are  going to salvage it at all.  I hope, regardless of the outcome of  the vote about to take place, we will  move forward as expeditiously as pos sible to revisit the entire Catastrophic  Coverage Act and look at both the cost  side and benefit side and revise it in  such a way that we can continue to  provide  basic  catastrophic  coverage  which most seniors want at a cost that  they can afford.

I com mend him for his efforts, although I  do disagree with his conclusions. We  face an amendment-forget the point  of order-which fundamentally alters  the benefits under  the catastrophic  law which we worked so hard to pass.  Who is to say that the distinguished  Senator from Arizona has picked the  best benefits to keep or whether in  fact his new proposal is the proper one  to have.  I make this point. I review my mail,  as I think do most of the other Sena tors. Nearly  everybody who writes  thinks they are going to be paying the  maximum of  the $800  supplemental  premium. This is not the case. Only 6  percent of the taxpayers of the coun try, of the 31 million Medicare benefi ciaries, will be paying the maximum  premium.  ",1989

855,655,12,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, what a  choice the Senator from Arizona gives  us in this amendment. We all want to  fix the catastrophic health care bill.  We have all heard from the ""benefici aries"" of that act-and they have told  us in no uncertain terms that they do  not like it. We asked the Finance Com mittee to study the issue and give us,  after careful reflection and investiga tion,  some  recommendations  for  changes.  The Senator from Arizona, however,  was not satisfied with that. He has a  temporary solution-and it may be a  good one-and he wants  it adopted  now, today, without full examination  or hearings. Well, I do not think that  is the best way to serve the needs of  our senior citizens.  I also do not think we serve our sen iors by adopting this amendment on  this bill. As the chairman of the Ap propriations Committee told us, if we  adopt this amendment we will exceed  the allowable budget deficit for this  year and, under the law, we will face a  sequester-an across-the-board cut in  every program in the Federal Govern ment. Programs which help seniors.  Programs which help children. Pro grams which clean up  the environ ment. Programs which provide for our  national defense. That is not helping  seniors. That is not helping America.  And I cannot support it.  What I can support are changes in  the Catastrophic Health Care Act. I  have heard the message of the seniors  in Wisconsin and I want to respond to  their concerns. But the best way to do  that is carefully, after we have consid ered all  the  implications. We have  time to do  that. We have a promise  from the bipartisan leadership of the  Senate that we will do it.

874,681,12,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, I guess  one thing the new budget reality has  brought to the Senate, which I rejoice  in even when it cuts against the things  that each of us would do,  is  it has  brought the necessity that we choose.  The distinguished Senator from Lou isiana  propounded,  initially,  an  amendment that put me in a very dif ficult position and that was an amend ment  that would  fund  the V-22,  a  system that I strongly believe  in, a  system that is also built in my State,  and would fund it by cutting SDI.  The rub came that it cut SDI by  $550 million, while  it put only $157  million into a program that I strong  support. And let me make it clear, Mr.  President, if the motion on the floor  now was  to cut SDI, even  though I  support SDI, by enough money  to  assure that we build a revolutionary  aircraft which I believe is needed for  the military and which  I believe  is  needed for the civilian sector of the  economy and will mean jobs, growth,  and opportunity for our people in the  future, I would vote for that amend ment.  But, Mr. President, where we are  now is we have an amendment before  us that cuts SDI by $558 million and it  does not fund any other single pro gram if this cut is passed. We will then  vote on a series of add-ons. Any substi tute would be in order for any one of  those add-ons. So I have no guarantee.  If I vote to cut SDI by $558 million, I  have no guarantee that one penny of  that is going to V-22.  In addition, I have $205 million of  SDI projects in Texas.  So, Mr. President, when we vote on  funding the V-22, given the level of  funding of over $4 billion for SDI, I  am willing to take a $150-odd million  ",1989

And, I do not believe it is essential  for  our  national  security.  There are much more affordable alternatives.  Mr. President, several years ago  I  strongly opposed President Reagan's  decision  to buy the Bl-B bomber. I  felt the Stealth bomber should be the  next generation of penetrating bomb ers. However, I never said I would sup port two new strategic bombers and  never offered carte blanche support to  the Stealth.  Over the past several weeks, as the  layers of secrecy on this program have  been peeled off, the case against the  B-2 has grown. The plane is not worth  its cost.  We presently have more than ade quate deterrence with cruise missiles,  the MX, the Minuteman, the Trident  D-5,  the Bl-B,  and  the  advanced  cruise missile. Armed with cruise mis siles,  B-52  and B-1  bombers  can  launch thousands of nuclear warheads  from a standoff position outside Soviet  air defenses. In the age of cruise mis siles, we no  longer need penetrating  strategic bombers.  Back when the B-2 was being sold to  Congress in the development stage, we  were told its main mission was going to  be  to attack mobile missiles  in  the  Soviet Union. The  latest Air Force  briefing paper now reluctantly admits  that the B-2 will be unable to attack  these targets in the near or mid-term  future.  Earlier this month, Defense Secre tary Cheney begged Congress not to  nickle and dime the B-2 program. This  week we  ignored  that  advice. The  House amendment to cut procurement  by $1 billion will increase program cost  by $3.3 billion according to Air Force  budget officials.

891,785,12,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  an editorial in the San Jose Mercury News on  July 4, 1989, offers an  insightful look at the  Supreme Court's recent decision  in Webster  versus Reproductive Health Services. The edi torial  illustrates what a fractured, unfortunate  opinion Webster offers.  It demonstrates that  this case undermines  the 1973 Roe versus  Wade decision, which affirmed  reproductive  freedom as a constitutional right of privacy.  The date of July 4 was an excellent choice  to print this editorial as  it demonstrated  the  irony of celebrating America's  independence  when  the day before-July 3-the Supreme  Court decision made many women  less free.  As  the Mercury points out:  ""for women,  the  celebration of Americans' inalienable rights to  life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness rings  hollow today.""  The editorial shows clearly that by uphold ing  the Missouri statute's prohibition against  the use of public facilities and public employ ees to perform abortions, the Court essentially  ruled against poor women, minority women,  and rural women, whose only access to medi cal  facilities may be the  local city or country  hospital.  There is no doubt in my mind that this deci sion invites the Government to intrude into the  bedroom of every American family. As the edi torial states, what is at risk ""here and every one, is not simply a woman's right to an abor tion, but women's right to control their lives.""  The editorial follows:  [From the San Jose Mercury News, July 4,  19891  A RIGHT DIMINISHED  All men  are  created  equal. But,  for  women,  the celebration of Americans' in alienable rights to life, liberty and the pur suit of happiness rings hollow today.  Monday, a narrowly and bitterly divided  Supreme Court expanded state power  to  regulate abortions, and promised  to hear  cases next term that could strip away the  constitutional right to abortion.  If the Webster  ruling  is  the first step  toward overturning the 1973 Roe vs. Wade  decision, as the court minority warns, then  it will mean that men in state legislatures  across  the  country will  decide whether  women shall bear children.  It will be the first case of a constitutional ly determined civil right being withdrawn  from the people. This is no decision to ap plaud.  The five-member majority in the Webster  case upheld a Misosuri law that bans state funded hospitals and state employees from  providing abortions or counseling, unless  necessary  to save a woman's life, and re quires doctors to test a fetus for viability  before perfoming an abortion after 20 weeks  of pregnancy.  The decision ducked ruling on the consti tutionality of  the  law's preamble, which  proclaims  that ""the  life of each human  being  begins  at  conception""  and  gives  unborn children ""all the rights, privileges,  and immunities available to other persons,  citizens, and residents of this state.""

892,798,12,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time a.s I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by  commending the subcommittee chair man, the gentleman from California  [Mr. ROYBAL]  and the subcommittee  ranking Republican,  the  gentleman  from New Mexico  [Mr. SKEEN]  for  their fine work on this bill. In the sub committee they had to deal with some  very  contenious  issues. They did  a  masterful job in working out a solu tion to most of those problems before  they came to the floor.  There was one item added in the full  committee which generated substan tial interest in the Rules Committee.  That was a provision to prevent the  implementation of what has become  known a.s section 89. Section 89 a.s cur rently drafted promises  to work  a  major hardship on our small business men and  their employees. Many of  them may cancel their health insur ance plans for employees, rather than  go through all the redtape in section  89. I not only support his concept but  I would also support the concept of an  actual repeal of section 89.  If it had been necessary, I was pre pared to offer in the Rules Committee  an amendment to the rule to protect  the section 89 provision from a point  of order. However, the Rules Commit tee majority ultimately decided to in clude protection for the provision in  their proposed  rule, even  though  it  had not been requested by the Committee on Appropriations. As a result,  I never had to off er my amendment.  0 0940  Mr. Speaker, the amounts appropri ated in this bill fall within the amount  allocated under the budget resolution.  However, for my colleagues who are  concerned about waivers of the Budget  Act, I should note that at lea.st a tech nical waiver is  included in this rule.  The bill  includes  a  3.6-percent pay  raise which is  technically an entitle ment. Since the Appropriations Com mittee did not receive any new entitle ment authority for  fiscal year 1990,  the waiver was included in the rule.  The chairman of the Budget Com mittee wrote a letter noting that the  pay rate increase provided in the bill is  consistent with the budget resolution  for fiscal year 1990. The budget resolu tion assumed a pay raise of 3.6 percent  for fiscal year 1990.  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  CMr.  GEKAS].  ",1989
893,798,12,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  This a good day to be a Member of  the House of Representatives of the  U.S. Congress because we  are now  poised to strike a blow in the eventual  elimination of section 89 from the face  of the Internal Revenue Code a.s pro pounded in 1986.  This odious section, section 89, has  caused so much trouble with our small  and large businessmen, not to mention  the working people  themselves who  are threatened to lose health benefits  because of the provisions of section 89.  The Committee  on Appropriations,  through the leadership of the gentle man from Texas and the gentleman  from Oklahoma were able  to  insert  into this rule and into their bill, and  subsequently approved by  the Com mittee on Rules, a measure by which  we could halt in its tracks the imple mentation of section 89.  This makes it an excellent day to be  here in Washington, DC. I commend  the  gentleman  from  Texas  CMr.  DELAY] for bringing it to the Commit tee on Appropriations, the gentleman  from Tennessee  [Mr. QUILLEN], who  was ready to help in the Committee on  Rules  to make  sure  this provision  would stay in place, and to the others  on the Committee on Rules on both  sides who have crafted such a  rule  that will let Members vote up or down  on the Treasury appropriations while  simultaneously saying to the business  world, to our free enterprise system, to  our working people, that we are going  to  remove  that noose around your  necks known a.s section 89.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.  Speaker,  for  the purpose of debate  only, I yield 2 minutes to the chair man of  the Budget Committee,  the  [Mr. PA gentleman from California  NETTA].  ",1989
894,798,12,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to discuss the relation of H.R. 2989 to  the 1990 budget resolution and to clar ify one technical budget point raised  by the bill.  The Budget Committee has provided  a ""Dear Colleague"" to all Members on  this appropriations bill. There is one  Budget Act waiver required under sec tion 302(f) because, in providing for a  3.6-percent pay raise for Federal civil ian employees on January 1, 1990, the  bill creates new entitlement authority  CNEA], and new entitlement authority  was not allocated  to  the Appropria tions Committee  for 1990. However,  the  1990  budget  resolution  does  assume such a 3.6-percent pay raise ef fective on January 1, 1990. Therefore,  the Budget Committee has no objec tion to a  technical waiver of section  302<0 of the Budget Act because this  pay raise is consistent with the budget  resolution and the bipartisan budget  agreement assumptions.  In total, this bill provides $9,391 mil lion of discretionary budget authority  and $9,350 million of discretionary  outlays. These amounts are,  respec tively, $19 million below  the discre tionary budget authority and equal to  the discretionary outlays included in  the section 302 subdivision assigned to  this subcommittee. Consequently, the  spending provided by this bill is con sistent with both the 1990 budget reso lution  and  the  bipartisan  budget  agreement worked out with the admin istration.  This subcommittee has done a good  job in meeting the spending targets es tablished under the budget resolution.  We  congratulate Chairman ROYBAL  and the other members of the subcom mittee, and we are pleased to bring  this information to the attention of all  Members.  There is one technical budget point I  wish to clarify in order to avoid a po tential budget problem with the con ference report on this bill later in the  session.  The  bipartisan  budget  agreement  scorekeeping  guidelines, which  con form to Gramm-Rudman scorekeeping  rules,  indicate  that  appropriations  bills or  reports should contain  lan guage  specifying whether  funds  to  cover pay raises are either provided  for or absorbed within the amounts in cluded  in  the bill or  remain  to be  funded. Such language was contained  in the conference reports or the texts  of all 1989 appropriations laws. Under  the guidelines, if such language is not  included in an appropriations bill or  report and a part or all of the pay  raise remains to be provided, a score keeping adjustment is to be made con sistent with the Gramm-Rudman base line estimating rule for pay raises.  ",1989
895,811,12,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of  this  legislation and,  in particular, section  619  on Employee Disclosure Agreements,  which places a moratorium on  the executive  branch's use of certain nondisclosure agree ments, standard forms 312 and 4355.  The provision will prevent the administration  from collecting new signatures on these con tracts or enforce certain aspects of them  in  the coming fiscal year.  This moratorium is meant to allow time for  continuing discussion between  the executive  branch and the Congress with regard to these  contracts. This issue has been under review  and negotiation and more time is needed for a  successful resolution. The moratorium would  provide that.  This issue has been the subject of litigation  regarding a prior, similar moratorium on em ployee disclosure agreements,  in which my  colleagues in  this lawsuit, and  I, argued that  the executive branch was not in compliance  with the law. The case went to the Supreme  Court. The Court sent the case back to  the  district court suggesting that the case may be  moot.  This new moratorium addresses new con tracts promulgated by the administration while  our case was pending. Litigation before  the  Court pertains to the old contracts, therefore  there  is no  longer a basis  for  the suit. The  lawsuit, therefore, is moot. The two branches  will then be able to work toward a resolution  of  their differences  regarding nondisclosure  agreements.  ",1989
896,811,12,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today  in  support of H.R. 2989,  the Treasury, Postal  Service, and General Government Appropria tions bill.  I want  to congratulate  the Appropriations  and Rules Committees for zeroing out funding  for the enforcement of section 89. Although  this action  is not a substitute  for complete  repeal of this burdensome law, it is a step in  the  right direction. Denial of  funding would  ensure  that businesses need not spend ex cessive amounts of money and time comply ing with  rules universally  recognized as un workable.  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and,  in doing so, support  fairness  for small busi nesses.  ",1989
897,811,12,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Chairman, the pro visions in section 89 of the Internal Revenue  Code are overly complicated and an onerous  burden that has been placed on the shoulders  of American businesses. I applaud the Appro priations Committee's actions today in prohib iting the Treasury Department from enforcing  penalties on businesses who  fail  to comply  with  the section 89  rules. Their action reaf firms Treasury Secretary Brady's statement  that section 89 ""imposes unreasonable com pliance burdens on business,"" and that ""the  law needs to be changed.""  Although  I believe that the delay in  imple menting the section 89 regulations is a step in  the right direction, I also believe that the ulti mate solution lies in a repeal of the entire pro vision. By  the  fact that over 300 of our col leagues are cosponsors of Congressman LA FALCE' s bill  to  repeal section 89,  it is clear  that  the overwhelming majority of our col leagues share in that belief. In  light of this,  I  would ask that Mr. LAFALCE's bill be brought  to the floor for a vote by the full House.  I believe that no amount of change is going  to prevent compliance with section 89  from  being an undue burden on business, especial ly small business. In an effort to insure better  benefits for workers, section 89 may be ensur ing that fewer companies offer any benefits at  all for fear of noncompliance or that the cost  and bother aren't worth it. That sounds like a  law that won't work, and I encourage my col leagues to support its repeal.  ",1989
898,811,12,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to H.R. 2989,  the Treasury, Postal Serv ice, and general Government appropriations  for fiscal 1990. This measure appropriates a  total of $18.4 billion for the Treasury Depart ment, U.S. Postal Service, various offices of  the Executive Office of the President, and for  certain independent agencies.  The bill's total is $2.4 billion-15 percent more than  the fiscal 1989 appropriation and,  in many categories and programs, represents  increases over the request of the administra tion. This  level of increase  is  too great and  should be reduced.  Mr. Chairman,  this  is  the  appropriations  measure for most general services of the Fed eral Government and as such is a reflection of  our willingness to reduce the size and scope  of the Federal bureaucracy at a time of large  budget deficits. By increasing the funds for the  general services of Government over 15 per cent, as this bill does, we are sending a signal  that we cannot hold down the very costs of  operating Government, while at the same time  we are  reducing and even cutting  important  programs like education and the environment.  Is this the signal we wish to send here today?  I hope not and I will oppose this measure on  final passage.  Some in this body will argue that we will not  eliminate  the deficit and balance  the budget  by eliminating the Federal infrastructure itself.  This statement is entirely correct and  I con cede the point. However,  this appropriations  measure contains a number of questionable  expenditures.  For example, next fiscal year, this measure  appropriates $1.8 million for the expenses and  pensions of former Presidents of the United  States. I strongly object to this appropriation,  which  is $392,000 more  than was appropri ated for fiscal 1989. I had planned to offer an  amendment to reduce the appropriation for al lowances of former Presidents but  I will not  offer that amendment today. I want Members  to know, however,  that  I may offer amend ments in the future to reduce spending in this  area.  Mr. Chairman, in examining spending in this  area of the budget, I was disturbed to discov er that our former Presidents will receive any  future pay increases awarded to Cabinet Sec retaries. Should we  later consider  legislation  to  increase compensation  for Cabinet members and Members of Congress,  I intend  to  offer amendments to prohibit any adjustments  to  the salaries of  former Presidents of  the  United States as well as former Members of  Congress.  Former Presidents today receive a pension  of $99,500 per year.  It  is well documented  that our  former Presidents have substantial  outside incomes and have little need for sig nificant adjustments to their pensions. I do not  begrudge our former Presidents a pension;  I  do object to significant adjustments to those  pensions that come as a result of adjustments  in salaries of current officials of the executive  branch.  Mr. Chairman, we should vote this bill down  as excessive, but we should also closely ex amine specific programs like Presidential pen sions.  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  support the provision of the Treasury/Postal  Service appropriations measure which prohib its the use of these funds to enforce the com plex and burdensome  regulations  in section  89. Let me applaud the subcommittee for its  understanding and creativity. Many business  owners in Ohio have expressed their concerns  for this provision, which will cause them to ter minate their health benefit plans. Certainly the  history of these rules indicates the inappropri ateness of this provision. Last year Congress  found  it necessary to include a simplification  of this section in the technical corrections bill,  before the section went into effect. Even with  this action,  the Treasury Department  found  the section so complex  that  it was months  late in  issuing the proposed regulations. The  Commissioner of IRS has found  it necessary  to continually move  the effective dates be cause  few people could understand, much  less  implement  these rules. This  law places  small business employers between the rock of  the long, arduous, expensive testing, and the  hard place of  terminating  the health plans  which would become prohibitively expensive  for their enterprises, benefits which  the sup porters of section 89 mistakenly thought they  were promoting. The prevention of spending  funds to enforce this provision is a step in the  right direction, and one which I hope will lead  to its complete repeal. I urge my colleagues to  support this ban.

899,811,12,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Chairman, section 619 of  H.R. 2989, a bill making appropriations for the  Treasury Department, the U.S. Postal Service,  the Executive Office of the President and cer tain  independent agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 1990, would place a  moratorium on certain nondisclosure agree ments.  Similar provisions have been part of appro priations bills in the past several Congresses.  As a consequence,  the administration's non disclosure program has been improved. How ever, there are still several areas of controver sy that need to be resolved.  Mr. Chairman, since 1983 I have been work ing to provide relief to employees of the exec utive branch  from excessively burdensome  nondisclosure contracts.

900,824,12,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  this amendment  ceived and shortsighted.  The  gentleman's  amendment  seeks  to  strike funds  from a number of initiatives de signed  to  improve  this Nation's disastrous  shortage of strategic and critical materials. As  anyone who takes time to learn about this sit uation will quickly  recognize, our country  is  precariously dependent upon unstable foreign  supplies of strategic materials. In the event of  war or national emergency, these supplies will  simply dry up.  The Soviet block and South Africa control  over 70 percent of world production of  the  four highest priority strategic minerals. These  are chromium, cobalt, manganese, and plati num. Without these four minerals, our military I  industrial complex would come to a standstill.  It is ironic that less than 24 hours after we  passed a National Defense Authorization Act  providing for the security and defense of the  country, we are asked to consider an amend ment to deprive our Armed Forces of the stra tegic minerals which are essential to produc ing  the sophisticated  fighting equipment  for  our modern Army.  The minerals I speak of are essential to the  production of high-grade steel and superal loys. They are also used extensively by  the  electronics and medical industries. Our coun try simply cannot afford any interruption in the  development  of  future . supplies  of  these  metals.  Unfortunately,  the  gentleman's  amendment would do just that.  For the past decade, my State has been fo cusing on ways  to  reduce our dependence  upon uncertain foreign supplies of critical and  strategic materials. Few people realize  it but  the world's greatest untapped mineral depos its lie beneath the ocean. And the richest of  these  deposits  are  in  the waters  around  Hawaii.  One of the agencies within our subcommit tee's jurisdiction is the National Critical Materi als Council. It's a small agency, but it serves a  very important function.  According to the National Critical Materials  Council, there are over $40 billion-that's bil lion, not million-worth of strategic and critical  minerals  in Hawaii's 200-mile exclusive eco nomic zone. These deposits are but a small  part of  the worldwide seabed minerals  re source.  For years, scientists have known  that  the  sea holds vast mineral deposits, known as  seabed modules and sea mount crusts  to  those  in  the  trade. Their existence, and  the  potential  they hold as a minerals  resource,  have been known  for decades. All  that  is  missing is the technology to harvest these re sources.  That is why the University of Hawaii, with  the support of the Federal Government, has  been exploring ways of harvesting  these re sources and putting  them  to productive use  for American industry. This is not the first year  that funds have been included in our bill for  this purpose.  In each of  the past 4  fiscal  years, Congress has supported funds for stra tegic minerals development. The funds in our  fiscal year 1990 bill will complete the project  in my State. The other projects in this bill are  designed  to achieve  the  same  result,  but  some of them use different methods such as  the development of synthetics  that can be  substituted for minerals now in short supply.  During general debate,  I heard the propo nent of the amendment state that perhaps this  research could be carried out more cheaply or  more efficiently by other universities. Speaking  for Hawaii, I can tell you that Hawaii is located  in the heart of the richest ocean mineral re source known in the world.  In effect, we are  sitting on top of the mother lode. There is not  another State within 2,400 miles of Hawaii and  I can't imagine anyone doing a better job of  investigating this resource than Hawaii.  Mr. Chairman,  the modest  investment we  make  to develop these minerals will yield a  handsome return for our Nation. This is an in vestment in America's future.  I urge Members to defeat the amendment.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr. Chair man, I rise today in opposition to this amend ment which would allay plans currently under way at the Rochester Institute of Technology  to develop a Center for  Integrated Manufac turing Studies. This CIMS project proposes  critical materials research which is essential to  the construction and maintenance of buildings  throughout the United States. The Appropria tions Committee, after extensive hearings, has  affirmed  the importance of the CIMS project  by providing for its funding through the Gener al Services Administration.  I urge my  col leagues  to make  this same affirmation by  voting ""no"" on the amendment.  The GSA,  as  primary  builder,  landlord,  wholesaler,  retailer, and  largest procurer of  materials, equipment, and services, sets qual ity standards for the materials and equipment  used in the construction of buildings used for  Federal or federally related purposes. Vested  with  this responsibility,  the GSA has a direct  interest  in promoting  research and develop ment of new materials and innovative technol ogies which will provide the Federal Govern ment access  to state-of-the-art building and  manufacturing technologies. The technological  advancements we anticipate will be equally as  beneficial to the private sector. The manufac turing systems which CIMS seeks to develop  can be readily adapted by industry.  The Rochester  Institute of Technology  is  uniquely suited to meet the challenge of de veloping  these  state-of-the-art  technologies  which will not only ensure the sound construc tion of Federal buildings, but also  improve  competitiveness  of U.S.  industries  in  the  global marketplace. RIT has a long tradition of  innovation and success in its problem solving  and practical approaches to complex techno logical problems. The most recent example of  this is the completion of the Nation's only ac credited  undergraduate  degree  program  in  microelectronic engineering.  Like  the CIMS  project,  this engineering center serves a na tional constituency and  is closely linked with  the  strategic  needs of manufacturing  and  product development. RIT  is also building a  research and business park on  its campus  which will provide opportunities  for  joint re search by business, industry, and academia.  Mr. Chairman,  the CIMS  project at  the  Rochester Institute of Technology show great  promise  for giving U.S.  technology research  the boost it needs to compete effectively in  world markets. The Federal  funds which  the  committee has appropriated  for  the CIMS  project will leverage funding provided by State  government, local industries, and other private  sources. These sources are expected to pro vide nearly $22 million of  the CIMS  total  budget of $33 million. We must not shutdown  funding  for  this  important project.  I urge my  colleagues to oppose the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Pennsylvania [Mr. WALKER].

",1989
903,837,12,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would just like to reaffirm some of the  points that the gentleman from North  Dakota CMr. DORGAN] was making in  connection with the FSX agreement.  That is as a Member of Congress who  represents a district that produces a  lot of airplanes, I naturally have some  concerns  about  giving  technology  away to a country who could then use  that technology  to achieve economic  supremacy in the area of manufactur ing airplanes.  D 1350  We have basically  two products in  our country that no one else  in the  world has managed to equal in terms  of economic viability. One is our food  and fiber production, our agricultural  power.  We still dominate the world in the  production of food and fiber and we  probably always will,  largely because  of the productivity of our farmers and  ranchers, and the geographical  loca tion of the United States and our abili ty to produce food and fiber  in our  great country.  The other area besides  food  and  fiber  is  the area of airplanes. When  you combine airplane production with  our production of food and fiber, we  get a majority of our balance-of-pay ments surplus for the United States.  What worries me, Mr. DORGAN and  others about the FSX deal is that it  has the possibility of giving the Japa nese  the  opportunity  to  bootstrap  themselves ahead of us in the produc tion of both commercial and military  airplanes. It does not guarantee that,  but it does give them the opportunity  to jointly participate with the United  States in the production of a fighter  airplane  involving exotic composites,  exotic materials, new systems technol ogy, new systems  integration and a  whole assortment of other things that  would allow that airplane to be  the  highest and most modern state of the  art.  My concern is that if in fact we are  going to provide that kind of technolo gy, there ought to be a quid pro quo  from Japan or any other country that  wants  to  share  that  technology  to  assure  that we  in  this country are  given the opportunity to sell our prod ucts in their markets.  More importantly, I  think we have  to stop and analyze are we gratuitous ly and voluntarily and improductively  in terms of our workers giving Ameri can workers the shaft by handing that  technology over to Japan?  What the House and Senate did was  provide reasonable restrictions. I hope  the President concurs with that.  OUR FLAG SHOULD NOT BE  USED AS A WEDGE  <Mr. WALKER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1989
904,837,12,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, a  few  moments  ago  the  gentleman  from  Maryland I  think outlined a position  which someone from our side probably  ought to respond to, and that is he in dicated there are people in our party  who sought to develop a wedge issue  of the flag. I do not know of anyone in  the Republican Party who seeks  to  make the flag a wedge issue.  I thoroughly agree with the gentle man from Maryland the flag is a uni fying symbol for this country and the  fact that it is a unifying symbol for  this country means that we ought not  desecrate it.  I think a question that a number of  us do feel may end up being a divided  issue is whether or not you take a stat utory approach to protecting the flag  or whether or not you take a constitu tional amendment approach. The con cern that is developing on our side of  theaisle is the concern about the stat ute that has come forward from the  Committee on the Judiciary.  The Committee on the Judiciary has  brought  forth  a  statute which  weaker than the current law. It takes  language which is in current law out,  namely defiling  the  flag,  and  then  allows defiled  flags  to be destroyed  and burned.  We would contend  that  there are  real questions about  the nature of  that statute and  feel very  strongly  that you have to take the constitution al amendment route in order to assure  real protection of the flag.  is  ",1989
905,850,12,Mr. MILLER  of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today I, along with Mr. GUNDERSON, am intro ducing  the Non-Traditional Employment  of  Women [NEW] Act. The purpose of the NEW  Act is to encourage greater efforts to train and  place women  in  nontraditional employment  through  the  Job Training  Partnership Act  [JTPA], and requires coordination, at the State  level, with  the Perkins Vocational Education  Act.  Equal opportunity  in employment may be  the law of the land, but it is not yet a reality in  the workplace. Women  in  this country still  earn less than 70 percent of what men earn.  One of the reasons  for this persistent wage  gap is that men and women work at different  types of jobs. Occupational segregation of the  sexes is a fact of American life.  Regrettably, Federal  job  training programs  have contributed  to  the problem.  In  far  too  many instances, our Federal job training pro grams, however unintentionally, are steering  women into lower paying female jobs. Studies  conducted at the State and  local  level have  shown  that  those seeking assistance under  JTPA end up in traditionally male and female  fields of work. The limited national figures that  are available support these findings.  Studies show that there is a dramatic differ ence in future earning potential between what  JTPA programs seem  to  regard as men's  work and women's work. In Chicago in 1985,  91 percent of  the participants  in word-proc essing courses under JTPA were female; 87  percent  of  the  participants  in  electronics  courses were male. The median hourly wage  for word processing operators in the Chicago  area is $9.40 per hour, while the correspond ing wage for electronics technicians is almost  $6 higher, $15.30 per hour. Likewise, 89 per cent of  the enrollees  in clerk-typist courses  were female; 86 percent of the participants in  truck driving courses were male. The median  hourly wage  for  typists  in Chicago  is $7.01,  but  truck  drivers earn more  than  double,  $15.08 per hour.  Women who enter Federal job training pro grams  need  to  be  told  that  no work  is  women's work, that all jobs are open to them.  Despite  the  fact  that women comprise over  half of JTPA program participants,  it is clear  that women have not received their fair share  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  of the  training available under JTPA  for  the  jobs that offer the best wages, benefits, and  long-term earning potential. This  is a short coming  in  JTPA which Congress can and  should do something about.  The NEW Act will provide for greater oppor tunities  for women  to  receive  training and  placement  in  construction,  electronics, and  other nontraditional fields of work, where the  rates of pay are substantially higher. The bill  will accomplish this objective in two ways.  First, the NEW Act requires service delivery  areas and States  to  include goals  in  their  annual job training plans for training and plac ing  women  in  nontraditional  employment.  Second, the NEW Act creates a 4-year dem onstration program at a cost of $1.5 million  annually,  to  foster  the development of pro grams  to  train women  for nontraditional em ployment.  This  is modest  legislation, but  it  is much  needed  legislation.

906,850,12,Mr. ROWLAND of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  rise at this time to state my support for Presi dent Bush's Clean Air Act proposal but with  strong  reservations.  I am sure  that many of  my colleagues have wrestled with  the same  questions and complexities of the issues that  have troubled me in the days since the Presi dent made public  the  legislative specifics of  his previously outlined goals.  The President should be commended  for  his  leadership  in moving  the debate forward  for the first time in a decade.  However,  I am deply concerned about the  weaknesses and omissions  I see  in his pro posals. Over  the  last several days  I have  spoken at length with industry representatives,  State government officials and environmental  groups about the problems each interest per ceives. We all share the desire and the strong  motivation  to achieve real  reductions of the  pollutants which threaten our environment, our  health and the future of the next generations.  But  there  is, sometimes, wide disagreement  as to what specific actions will get us to our  destination.  For instance, Georgia is one of the fastest  growing States in  the country. Population  in creases demand more  jobs. Both residential  and  industrial  growth will  require  greater  energy needs. Additionally, Georgia  is also  trying to overcome the poverty and lower than  average standard of  living conditions of  the  past. This,  too,  requires more energy. More  cars and other transportation modes usually  result  from growth and  improved  life-styles.  July 28, 1989  The caps implicit in  the President's proposal  will not allow continued progress in Georgia's  economy.  In another area,  the President's bill does  not seem to take into account some very im portant regional differences. For example, At lanta and the rest of the State have to contend  with an unusually high  release of hydrocar bons  from vegetation and our pine  forests,  which are very important to our economy. We  will need  to control  the other ozone precur sors,  nitrogen  oxides  emissions, more  to  offset  the naturally occurring  releases. The  Bush plan stresses reductions  in volatile or ganic  compounds  [VOC's]  and  should  be  more flexible in this area.  Many States, such as Georgia, have already  made and paid for serious clean air programs,  while others,  for varying  reasons, have not  made much progress. I feel whatever bill ulti mately passes should give credit  to States  which have achieved real  reductions. Other wise, we will be penalizing them for getting a  head start on  the problem, while  rewarding  other States  for having delayed  facing  the  issue.  In spite of all  these and other criticisms,  I  have decided in my own mind, after much re flection,  that the President's plan  is the best  vehicle at hand by which we can move for ward.  It needs significant modification. But  it  has drawn on the several bills already pending  in  the Congress as well as other  ideas ad vanced by the experts. Therein lies its great est strength in my opinion.  It seems to have  the greatest potential for real compromise and  consensus. In cosponsoring the bill, I hope to  be part of the strong team we will need to be  successful in enacting a good, workable Clean  Air Act this year.  TRIBUTE TO FRIEDRICH LIST  HON. GUS YATRON  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATl VES  Friday, July 28, 1989  ",1989
907,850,12,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to Friedrich List, on  the occasion  of the 200th anniversary of his birth. Friedrich  List, a West German economist who resided  in Reading, PA,  for 5 years  in  the early  1800's, made many contributions to the Read ing area and to our Nation. The history of his  life is a long a storied one, but worthy of brief  explanation at this time.  Friedrich List was born in Reutlingen, West  Germany and immigrated to America in 1825.  He settled in Pennsylvania and eventually to  Reading where he worked as an editor for the  Reading Adler newspaper-the forerunner of  our present Reading Eagle.  In addition  to  being an important columnist, he was also im portant in the political world and is claimed to  be  responsible  for Andrew Jackson winning  Pennsylvania during  the  1828 election. He  was a personal friend of Lafayette as well. As  an economist, Mr. List was considered one of  the most prominent of the 19th century, in the  same category as Adam Smith and Karl Marx.  His experience and observations  in America  are said to have had a substantial impact on  his economic theories. Mr. List eventually re",1989

909,863,12,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, I wish to  submit for insertion into the RECORD a  number of  resolutions submitted by  various organizations in my state of Il linois. These organizations are the La salle County Board, the Illinois Ameri can Veterans of World War II, Korea,  and Vietnam [AMVETSl and its auxil iary, and the Bureau County Board.  All of  the organizations expressed  the need for a constitutional amend ment to protect the flag of the United  States of America from burning and  other desecration.  In addition, these organizations have  described  the flag as a symbol that  represents the valor of the young men  and women  throughout history who  have fought and died for their coun try.  I am pleased to submit these resolu tions in the RECORD for my colleagues'  perusal.  There being no objection, the resolu tions were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT FOR CONSTITUTION AL .AMENDMENT TO PREVENT DESECRATION OF  THE .AMERICAN FLAG  Whereas, the right of political dissent and  right to speak freely are valuable rights of  individuals; and  Whereas, the exercise of those rights can  be accomplished by means and methods  other than desecration or burning of the  American Flag; and  Whereas, the County Board in recognition  of  the symbolic powers of  the American  Flag to inspire loyalty and devotion, and to  honor and remember the valor and heroic  sacrifice of many citizens of the County by  service in the Armed Forces of this Country,  both in peace and in war, and in further rec ognition that without such honor or protec tion the power and glory symbolized by the  American Flag will fade.  Be  it  then  resolved by  the County of  Bureau, a body politic and corporate, acting  by and through its County Board in regular  meeting assembled;  ARTICLE ONE  The acts of desecration or burning of the  American Flags as forms of expression are  to be condemned as unnecessary and unwar ranted.  ARTICLE TWO  The efforts of the President of the United  States to protect the American Flag against  desecration and burning are to be further  encouraged.  ARTICLE THREE  The County of Bureau pledges its support,  aid and encouragement to further such ef forts.  ARTICLE FOUR  This Board further endorses the need for  an amendment of the Constitution of the  United States for protection of the Ameri can Flag and pledges its support to secure  adoption and ratification of such amend ment.  ARTICLE FIVE  The County Clerk is hereby directed to set  forth  this Resolution  at  length  in  the  records of  this County and  send copies  thereof  to  the President of  the United  States of America, the United States Sena tors from the State of Illinois, and all the  members of  the United States House of  Representatives from the State of Illinois.  RESOLUTION  Whereas,  the United  States Supreme  Court on June 21, 1989, handed down a deci sion  permitting  the  desecration  of  our  American Flag, and  Whereas, this decision has horrified the  vast majority of American  citizens who  strongly feel that our American Flag truly  represents hope for  the oppressed of the  world, security from  totalitarian forms of  government, and freedom to those who live  in areas where she waves freely in the air,  and  Whereas, this great symbol has been car ried by our young men and women who  throughout history have fought and died in  order to guarantee that our nation remains  free, and  Whereas, our American Flag  in all  its  glory  and dignity  is  respectfully present  when our American Veterans pay their final  respect to their deceased comrads, and  Whereas, the vast majority of American  citizens do not consider our nation's flag to  be just a piece of cloth that various revolu tionaries and subversive activists can de stroy or otherwise mutilate under the guise  of protests as a means of expression of their  political differences, and  Whereas, our LaSalle Board feels strongly  that in order to guarantee that our nation  remain free that there should be a Constitu tional Amendment passed to prevent in the  future  any  further  desecration  of  the  United States of America Flag so these anti American subversives will be punished for  the irresponsible and immature behaviors.  Therefore, be it  Resolved, That we  request our Congres sional Representatives to initiate the action  needed to amend the First Amendment of  the Constitution of  the United States so  that desecration of our nation's flag will  never again be  interpreted as a mode of  freedom of speech or expression.  CERTIFICATE OF COPY  I, Tom P. Walsh, County Clerk and Ex Of ficio Clerk of the LaSalle County Board  within and for said County and State afore said, Do Hereby Certify the foregoing to be  a  true and complete copy of a Resolution  approved by the LaSalle County Board of  LaSalle County at the Second Day of the  June Session held on the 10th day of July,  A.O., 1989.  The original of which has been recorded  at the Official Proceedings of the LaSalle  County Board of LaSalle County and that I  am the legal custodian of the same.  .  AM VETS  The Department of Illinois American Vet erans of World War II, Korea and Viet Nam  <AMVETS> and the Department of Illinois  AMVETS Auxiliary assembled at their De partment Convention in Peoria, Illinois, on  June 23-25, 1989 endorsed the following res olution:  Whereas,  The American  Flag  is  the  symbol  of  Freedom  and  Democracy  throughout the World; and  Whereas, The Veterans  of American's  Wars, former and current military person nel and  to  all Patriotic Americans,  the  American Flag is more than a symbol for  which it stands, the American Flag is the  tangible form of Freedom and Democracy;  and  Whereas, Certain  individuals, most an nounced members of various revolutionary  or communist parties, have historically de stroyed or otherwise mutilated the American Flag as a form of protest and, by their  actions, have  invoked outrage and assault  upon the hearts and minds of a Patriotic  America; and  Whereas, On June 21, 1989  the United  States Supreme Court ruled that no person  may be punished for burning or destroying  our beloved symbol of freedom thus creat ing another day in our history besides De cember 7,  1941, which will  ever  live  in  infamy; and  Whereas, The Court decided  that  the  American Flag is just another symbol about  which not only opinions pro and con can be  tolerated, but for which the most minimal  public respect may not be enjoined; and  Whereas, The government may conscript  men into the Armed Forces when they must  fight and perhaps die for the Flag but the  government may not prohibit  the public  burning of the banner under which they  fight; and  Whereas, the creation of Federal Right to  post bulletin boards and graffiti on  the  Washington monument or extinguish the  flame on President Kennedy's grave; and  Whereas, The case involves disagreeable  conduct that diminishes the value of an im portant National asset; and  Whereas, now  therefore be  it  resolved  that AMVETS and AMVETS Auxiliary at  its 44th Annual State Convention at Peoria,  Illinois  respectfully urge  the Congress of  the United States to prepare and submit to  the States of this Nation a constitutional  amendment that would make any conduct  that would destroy or otherwise mutilate  our American Flag, the symbol of freedom;  and be it further Resolved, That this resolu tion be forwarded to the AMVETS National  Convention for further action.  Forwarded  to AMVETS National Head quarters on June 26, 1989, for appropriate  action at the AMVETS National Conven tion.  ROBERT HETTINGER,  Commander, Depart ment  of  lllinois  AMVETS.  ",1989
910,876,12,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, first I  wish to acknowledge that our distin guished chairman, the senior Senator  from Georgia, has throughout the 11  years I have been privileged to serve  with him on the Senate Armed Serv ices Committee initiated strong meas ures in these areas. He seems to exer cise some restraint but he has fore sight and spends a great deal of his  time on this subject, not only here in  Washington but travels to the extent  that he can abroad to obtain firsthand  knowledge which enables him to work  on these questions of burdensharing.  I  am  pleased  to  join Chairman  NUNN,  Senator  LEVIN,  Senator  McCAIN, and others  in cosponsoring  this package of the four burdenshar ing amendments which express  the  concerns of the majority members of  our committee on the vital  issue of  burdensharing both in Europe and in  the Pacific Rim region.  Although this burdensharing pack age contains separate amendments for  Europe, Japan and  the Republic of  Korea-and we purposely determined  that it would be best to have a sepa rate amendment  for  each of  these  basic geographic areas-the underly ing concern is the same for all of the  amendments. Despite the growing eco nomic wealth of our European and Pa cific allies, the United States continues  to bear too large a share of the burden  for the common defense.  To give just one example, although  the combined gross national product  of our NATO alliance is  larger than  that of the United States, we spend  almost twice as much on defense as  our NATO allies. Corrections in this  situation, indeed, Mr. President, Mem bers of the Senate, are long overdue.  Although our allies have talked a good  deal about  increasing  their burden sharing  effort,  very  little  concrete  progress has been made  in reducing  the U.S. defense share. It is time for  the Congress to require results but to  do so in a responsible way to result in  a strengthened common defense and  avoid harmful friction with our allies.  I believe these burdensharing amend ments meet that important standard.  We have emphasized a negotiated  and consultative approach to the bur densharing problems, not a U.S. dic tated solution.  First,  the NATO amendment. The  NATO burdensharing amendment  is  an attempt to maintain the status quo  in Europe  as we  negotiate  a CFE  agreement. I want to stress that. The  entire formula is predicated on eventu ally reaching a CFE agreement, but  once that agreement is reached, then  the purpose of this amendment really  is no longer a guideline.  The amendment establishes a ceiling  on  the  ratio  of U.S. Active Duty  Forces stationed in Europe to allied  active duty forces deployed in Europe,  and  to  discourage  our  allies  from  making unilateral reductions in man power levels prior to the conclusion of  this CFE agreement. The net effect of  the amendment is  to require propor tional U.S.  troop  reductions  from  Europe to match allied reductions.  Unfortunately, it appears that such  an amendment is necessary despite the  fact  that  the member  nations  in  NATO have unanimously  supported  President Bush's comprehensive CFE  arms control proposal. Several of our  allies are considering making substan tial  reductions  in  the size of  their  armed forces over the next few years.  Such unilateral reductions would un dermine NATO's negotiating positions  in  the  CFE  talks  and  undercut  NATO's efforts to improve its conven tional defense posture. As was the case  with INF, negotiating from a position  of strength in the CFE talks  is  the  only way to achieve a successful arms  control agreement in the conventional  system. We will not be successful  if  our allies begin at this time to make  the reductions that they are anticipat ing will come under a CFE agreement.  Therefore, I think this amendment  sends a very necessary and important  message to our NATO allies that we  must all maintain our current defense  capabilities until successful conclusion  of the CFE negotiating process.  I will await further comments by the  chairman on other amendments.  ",1989
911,876,12,Mr. NUNN.,"  I  thank  the Senator  from Virginia for his kind comments,  and for his leadership.  I want  to stress that this amend ment  is  a  joint amendment. All of  these amendments are  joint amend ments. Senator McCAIN  took a  lead.  He had certain ideas about Japanese  burdensharing as well as Korea, and  Senator LEVIN made a special trip to  South Korea, had extensive discus sions  there, and came back with a  report. He has been very involved in  the South Korea amendment.  ",1989

913,889,12,Mr. WIRTH., Mr.  much time remains?  ,1989
914,889,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.,  Six  minutes and 43 seconds the Senator  from Massachusetts has.  ,1989
915,889,12,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. President, just in summary, we  make no ultimate judgment on wheth er this plant should go forward or not  go forward. All we are saying now is,  no construction until we know, one,  whether this new technology can be  effective and,  two, whether there  is  going  to be a necessity for weapon grade plutonium for planned weapons  system after the year 2000. We have  not heard that case made, Mr. Presi dent.  We know that this plant is being de veloped to fill a plutonium reserve, not  for immediate use in weapons. That is  an extremely important point.  Second,  the SIS  technology  is not  finished. We are effectively commit ting ourselves to a multibillion dollar  program with the hope perhaps that  this new technology might work, and  there is no guarantee that it will work,  and we should have in this body un derstood by now  that  it makes no  sense to spend billions of taxpayers'  money on technology that we do not  know, as a matter of fact, is going to  be effective.   Third,  the  lifetime mission of the  plant is not known. All we know, from  those who support it, is that when it  comes onstream, there is only 7 years  of feed. It can only be used for 7 years,  a 30-year plant used for 7 years of  feed. That ought to give at least some  pause to whether we want to embark  with scarce resources on that kind of  an investment.  Finally, Mr. President,  there is no  approved site for the SIS waste stor age. Serious issues and questions with  regard to the environment have been  raised. There is leaching of dangerous  material now into the Snake River aq uifer,  and  serious  concerns  about  those types of issues around the site of  this plant.  All we are saying is if this plant is  going to be necessary for our national  security, we will know more on that in  a year from now or 2 years from now,  and still be able to insure that if it is  ",1989
916,902,12,Mr. WARNER.," Madam President, I  join with  the distinguished Senator.  Also I would like to draw the Senator's  attention to the report to Congress on  the analysis of alternative strategic  nuclear force postures for the United  States  under  a  potential  ST ART  treaty. This was  delivered  to  the  Senate not more than 48 hours ago. If  you look at force structure 3 and force  structure 4, you will note that force  structure 3 requires a minimum of 20  boats and force structure 4 requires a  minimum of 22 boats. I will see that  the Senator gets that document.  ",1989
917,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," If I may, I have the  report in my hand. This report was  sent  to Congress pursuant  to a  re quirement on last year's authorization  bill.  I  think Senator BYRD, Senator  DoLE, and others, perhaps the Senator  from Georgia was on that, where we  request this. I suppose, I must say, I  did not think much of the report.  ",1989
918,902,12,Mr. NUNN.,  I have to say I agree  with the Senator on that. I did not  think much of that report either.  ,1989
919,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS., I could have spent  half an afternoon sometime and prepared this same report without very  much trouble with a pad and pencil.  Let me say  to  the Senator  from  Georgia two things.  ,1989
920,902,12,Mr. NUNN.," I am not sure whether I  previously said ""reduce the number of  missiles  per  boat""  or  ""reduce  the  number  of warheads  per missile.""  What the committee has proposed for  consideration is reducing the number  of warheads per missile on the Trident  boats.  ",1989
921,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," I say to the Sena tor, we had, I think it was, the CNO  testify before the Defense Appropria tions Committee on this business of,  No.  1,  possibly putting concrete  in  some of the existing launchers on ex isting submarines or somehow filling  up those tubes. In other words, instead  of the Trident carrying 24 launchers,  maybe they fill 4 to 8 tubes with con crete. I must say that does not titillate  me very much.  But I will also say that the Senator  makes a very good point that if we are  going to continue to build Tridents and I am not sure we should not be cause I still believe they are the most  invulnerable part of our system and I  am not at all sure we do not need  more. We are accustomed to having 35  to 40 SSBN's out there. Maybe that  gives us a little more coverage.  But if we decide, for example, to go  with, say, 25 Trident submarines, that  means we are going  to have  to cut  down, if we are still on that 4,900 bal listic missile warheads, we are going to  have to cut the remainder of our sub marines down  to somewhere  in  the  neighborhood  of  12  launchers,  or  reduce the number of warheads on the  D-5 or any number of combinations to  that.  I am not opposed to that. At this  point, I am unalterably opposed to the  suggestion  that we  fill  the  launch  tubes of existing Tridents. I do not  think the Soviets find they would be  very rhapsodic about that either.  ",1989
922,902,12,Mr. NUNN.," That would  take some  onsite  inspection,  I am sure, a very  pervasive nature to determine what is  in those tubes.  ",1989
923,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS.,"  The New York  Times editorial board and  the Tass  editorial board needs to be witnessing  the filling of these tubes with concrete  before anyone would believe  it. Be  that as it may, this report was due last  year. That is how on top of the situa tion the administration is. It was due  last year, and we just got it.  Having said all that, I want to say to  the Senator  that  I will modify my  amendment to provide as follows, Mr.  President:  Strike  all  the  language  from 2 down to ""President"" on line 4  and insert therein ""on or before July  31, 1990, the President will submit to  the Congress."" That  is  the way  it  would read, and then it just becomes a  reporting requirement.  ",1989
924,902,12,Mr. NUNN.," Madam President, could  I say to the Senator what date would  he have in the amendment for that  report?  ",1989
925,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS., July 31.  ,1989
926,902,12,Mr. NUNN., May  I  suggest  to  the  Senator that we make it a little earli er?  ,1989
927,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," I must confess the  earlier the better, and I would like to  do it, certainly, before this bill is back  on the floor again next year.  ",1989
928,902,12,Mr. NUNN.," I would suggest perhaps  May 1 or something of that nature.  That would give us time in the normal  cycle  to seriously consider it, maybe  even April 1.  ",1989
929,902,12,Mr. BUMPERS.," Well, let us make it  April 1.  ",1989
930,902,12,Mr. NUNN.," I believe the administra tion has a  real challenge  to  think  through its arms control position. I do  not think it has thought through its  arms control position on ST ART  to  the extent necessary. I think there is a  long way to go, and I think this kind  of report would help the administra tion  and  the  Congress  to  think  through the implications of some of  these decisions. I would say April 1 if  the Senator would  so  inodify  his  amendment.  AMENDMENT NO. 519, AS MODIFIED  ",1989

But as I understand it,  the Levin amendment would in theory  force the contractor, if I can abbrevi ate it to some degree, to use whatever  profit he was going to make toward  the  repair of  the  aircraft  if  that  should become necessary to keep it re paired.  ",1989
953,928,12,Mr. LEVIN.," If the Senator will yield,  only  to defects  that  the contractor  causes, which  is  in violation of  the  contractual obligation.  ",1989
954,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE., And the theory was  you were going to work it down so that  would be zero profit.  ,1989
955,928,12,Mr. LEVIN., Only if there is contrac tor-caused defects.  ,1989
956,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE.," That is right.  But  I  think under  the Senator's  amendment  the  contractor  actually  could come out with zero, with  a  minus profit, or a cost because  the  Senator has not figured in the cost of  his money nor his capital investment  with his equipment.  I  understood  the  Senator's  answer to that was that the progress  payments would take care of the cost  of the money. Am I correct?  ",1989
957,928,12,Mr. LEVIN.," The capital investment  is amortized. That one there is no difAs  ficulty on. The cost of money is  in tended to be covered by the progress  payments which are negotiated as part  of the contract negotiations.  We do not get into what the price of  the plane is, what the fee  is, or the  actual profit in the amendment. We do  not get into that.  It is a very simple approach which  says  that  if  there  are  contractor caused defects that violate the obliga tions of the contract then the contrac tor would fix those up to at least the  amount of the fee or the actual profit  which has been negotiated.  But the cost of money can be negoti ated through progress payments. As  far  as  capital  investment,  the Air  Force assures us that it is amortized  and it is not a problem.  ",1989
958,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE.,"  I have  talked with  some officials from the Air Force who  are not in favor of this amendment be cause of that particular clause. I just  find  that if we have so  little confi dence in those people who are running  the Air Force,  the we ought to get  other people to run it. But to have two  pages  of  intricate material dealing  with negotiations and limitations on  the prime contractor's financial liabil ity I think the Senate is going too far.  I just do not quite understand why  the Senator is pursuing this amend ment.  ",1989
959,928,12,Mr. LEVIN., I would like the oppor tunity to respond to that last question.  That is the critical question.  ,1989
960,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE., That is correct.  ,1989
961,928,12,Mr. LEVIN.," In the first production  contract plane, if the profit that was  negotiated was $50 million and the ex pected limit on the liability of the con tractor to fix defects caused by the  contractor in violation of the obliga tions in the contract were $4 million,  now  I  say  to my good  friend  from  Rhode  Island,  there  is  something  wrong with that.  All this amendment says is negotiate  responsibility  for  the contractor at  least up to the negotiated profit, and  we put  in a waiver provision. So  it  would seem to me that it is a very rea sonable amendment. It is based pri marily on the B-1 experience where  we had a $1 billion repair bill for de fects which were caused by the con tractor.  ",1989
962,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE.," Let me just say this: I  know the manager on the Republican  side has a lot of experience in these  areas. I think we all want to play con tracting officer around here, and that  is fine. But to me, I have grave reser vations. I am looking at this amend ment and I cannot quite see where it  says that if the Secretary of the Air  Force-could the chairman enlighten  me?  ",1989
963,928,12,Mr. NUNN.,"  If the Senator would  look at page 2, specifically at <d><2>.  ",1989
964,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE.," I may not have the  proper amendment. I see ""The Secrethe  tary of Air Force  shall notify  Armed Services Committees.""  ",1989
965,928,12,Mr. NUNN., I have the portion cir cled and we have the same text.  ,1989
966,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE., I see where the Sena tor is ref erring.  ,1989
967,928,12,Mr. NUNN.,"  If the Senator would  look down to paragraph (2), we negoti ated this very carefully with the Sena tor from Michigan. After the mandate  to  the Secretary, we add  the words  ""unless the Secretary determines that  the specific benefits of such exclusions  or limitations substantially outweigh  the potential costs.""  ",1989
968,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE., Then he can disre gard this provision?  ,1989
969,928,12,Mr. NUNN.," Well, he can disregard  paragraph (2), yes.  ",1989
970,928,12,Mr. LEVIN., The Senator is correct.  There is an escape clause.  ,1989
971,928,12,Mr. CHAFEE.," If that is the case, I  am not quite sure why we have  to  have the legislation.  In my State, they passed a seatbelt  law, a mandatory seatbelt law, which  they made optional. Now,  it appears  that is what we are doing here. Why  we spend time passing legislation like  this, I find confusing.  ",1989
972,928,12,Mr. LEVIN.," If I could answer that  point. I think it is significant. This is  not a mandatory seatbelt law which  was made optional. This is not let's  play contractor provision. It is a let's  protect the Treasury provision. It is a  let's protect  the Treasury provision  from the kind of situation we find our selves in with the B-1 bomber where  we were repairing defects  that were  caused by the contractor in violation  of the contract.  Now,  I do not  think  the Senator  from Rhode Island can have it both  ways. I do not think he can say we are  micromanaging  when  we  provide  enough flexibility so the Secretary can  get out from under this provision if he  finds  it  too onerous.  I would  think  that the Senator from Rhode Island  would applaud that kind of flexibility  so that we can avoid that kind of mi cromanagement in putting something  in concrete.  But we  are putting ourselves on  record here, in a very significant way,  that we do not find acceptable a situa tion where there is a profit of $50 mil lion on an airplane, where there are  $30 million in repairs that are caused  by the contractor's violation of his ob ligations, but where the contractor's  responsibility is limited to $4 million.  That is the situation with the first five  production aircraft. It is unacceptable.  This is a statement of the Congress  that it is unacceptable.  ",1989
973,928,12,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, might  I say to my friend from Rhode Island  and others that we find ourselves in a  bit of a procedural bind here. I shall  not interpose an objection-I am not  going to say I am going to accept the  amendment-I shall not interpose an  ",1989
974,954,12,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr.  President,  today, I join with Senator MOYNIHAN,  Senator DIXON, Senator PELL, Senator  RIEGLE, Senator SASSER, and Senator  CHAFEE in submitting a Senate resolu tion to commemorate the employees  of the Social Security Administration.  For over 50 years, the dedication and  resourcefulness of Social Security Ad ministration employees have touched  virtually every American. Today, SSA  employees annually process over 6 mil lion claims  for Social Security and  supplemental security income benefits,  maintain earnings records for 130 mil lion workers, and pay more than $230  billion  in benefits  to 1 of every 6  Americans.  This sustained dedication to the fun damental objectives of the Social Se curity Program has been the agency's  bedrock in its effort to make a transi tion from an antiquated, paper-domi nated way of doing  business  to  a  modern office environment serving the  American people with state-of-the-art  technology.  At the same time that agency staff  has been reduced by 20 percent, em ployees have achieved  improvements  in productivity that have yielded sig nificant savings. Yet there can be no  greater  testimony  to  the efforts of  these  individuals than that given by  those they serve. The appreciation of  SSA clients has been documented in  surveys by  the General Accounting  Office, which show that over 80 per cent of clients rate SSA services as  good or very good.  Therefore,  it  is  only  appropriate  that the Nation should recognize and  express its appreciation to the employ ees of the Social Security Administra tion for the public service they pro vide.

983,993,12,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Speaker, the Veter ans' Affairs Committee met on July 13  and  unanimously  ordered  reported  H.R. 2486, as amended, a bill which  would extend and improve the Veter ans Readjustment Appointment Au thority, generally known as the VRA.  Under current  law,  the VRA  is a  noncompetitive appointment to Feder al employment for Vietnam era veter ans which leads to competitive status  upon satisfactory completion of serv ice and education or training. This has  been  a  successful  employment pro gram with over 279,000 veterans of the  Vietnam era entering Federal service  by way of VRA appointments.  During the hearing held by the Sub committee on Education, Training and  Employment on June 21  to  review  H.R. 2486, we discussed what the pur pose and structure of the VRA pro gram should be in order to best serve  the needs of veterans and Federal  agencies  today. We  received a great  deal of useful testimony and conclud ed that this hiring authority should be  amended so that it can serve two pur poses: First,  to  enable  the Federal  Government  to hire vetrerans, who  have demonstrated  they are among  the best workers available to any em ployer, quickly and easily; and, second,  to enable the Federal Government to  continue to meet its responsibility to  provide employment opportunities for  those who have served in defense of  our Nation. We believe that H.R. 2486,  as amended, would accomplish both of  these goals.  The committee bill would do the fol lowing:  First. Remove the termination date  for the VRA program, thus making it  permanent.  29-059 0-90-32 (Pt. 12)  ",1989
984,1006,12,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 2783, the Minnesota Public Lands  Improvement Act of 1989. Chairman  VENTO has drafted a bill which has  been sponsored by the entire Minneso ta congressional delegation. It also is  supported by the administration and  the State of Minnesota.  I believe  this  legislation, which  is  similar to the Michigan Public Lands  Improvement Act  that was  enacted  last year, will serve as a model for  cleaning up other Eastern State BLM  land management problems. As Chair man VENTO has stated, we are only  dealing with about 850 parcels of land  amounting  to  less  than 8,000 acres.  The  isolated nature of  these  tracts  have  made  management  by  the  Bureau of Land Management quite  difficult.  The Minnesota Department of Natu ral Resources and Eastern States BLM  Director Kurt Jones have worked with  the Interior Committee to draft this  legislation. Without H.R. 2783, admin istrative  transfer  of  these  parcels  would be extremely time consuming,  bureaucratically burdensome, and ex tremely costly.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2783.  ",1989
985,1006,12,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. 0BER STAR], who has a special  interest  in  this legislation, as his district is affect ed by it.  ",1989
986,1006,12,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to compliment the gentleman on  his prompt action on the legislation  and  for his very  thorough ma1""!age ment of the bill, both in the commit tee hearings and markup, and here on  the House floor. The gentleman has  rendered land management issues  in  our State, nationwide, a great service  not only here but in his other work in  the committee of which he  is  the  chair.  I strongly support H.R. 2783 to allow  the Bureau of Land Management to  transfer small parcels of land to the  State of Minnesota. If this is enacted,  the BLM will transfer 850 parcels of  land. These small land parcels, primar ily islands, are now owned by the Fed eral Government. The Federal  land  management agencies simply are not  able to effectively manage these small  and widely dispersed parcels.  The Minnesota Department of Natu ral Resources, county and local agen cies are better suited and have better  resources to manage these lands eff ec tively.  I support the legislation for two pri mary reasons: first, the Minnesota De partment  of Natural Resources  is  better  suited  to manage  effectively  small, widely scattered parcels of land  than are the BLM or other Federal  agencies; Equally important, the legis lation will grant the BLM greater ad ministrative authority to resolve land  title disputes in an equitable manner,  and  to assist Minnesota  landholders  who find their title to lands clouded  by Federal interests, surveying errors,  and other oversights and misunder standings. This  legislation will help  BLM  resolve numerous  longstanding  land title disputes, a matter of particu lar interest to landholders in my con gressional district.  Several  landholders  in my district  have  occupied  parcels  of  land  for  many years, believing they hold title  to those lands. Some have built homes  and cabins on those lands. Some have  paid property  taxes on  those  lands.  These same property owners now find,  much to their surprise, that the land  they believed they owned is actually  owned by  the Federal Government,  under  the  administration  of  the  Bureau of Land Management.  Under current law, such landholders'  only recourse is to seek remedy under  the very complex and stringent proc ess required by the Color of Title Act.  Unfortunately, many landholders who  have a reasonable claim are unable to  qualify for transfer of title or other  equitable resolution of  title disputes  under  the stringent,  time-consuming  and often expensive color of title proc ess.  Therefore,  under  current  law,  landholders who  have  occupied  a  parcel of land for many years, erected  structures on that land and paid prop erty  taxes on  that  land may  find  themselves forced to vacate the land  without compensation for their invest ments of time and money.  The bill  I  am cosponsoring  today  will grant the Bureau of Land Man agement greater flexibility to resolve  legitimate claims of landholders in an  equitable  and  expeditious manner.  The bill grants BLM authority to sell  land under its jurisdiction in Minneso ta to holders of legitimate claims to  that land, and to consider such factors  as longevity of occupation of the land,  payment of property taxes and value  of structures erected on the land in  discounting  the price of sale of the  land. This process would be far superi or to the procedure in place under cur rent law-more effective, more expedi tious, and more equitable.  This new procedure  to settle  land  title disputes will work properly only  if affected landholders are aware of  the clouded title and their options to  resolve the problem. When I first re viewed this bill in draft form,  I was  concerned that landholders with legiti mate claims but who  live  in remote  areas might not be notified of their  options in time to take advantage of  the new title review process. Careful  review of the final form of the bill and  discussions with the Bureau of Land  Management,  the Minnesota Depart ment of Natural Resources and  the  Parks and Public Lands Subcommittee  have persuaded me that all parties in volved are committed to making their  best effort to ensure that landholders  with  legitimate claims are aware of  their land title situation and their op tions under the new legislation.  If the bill is enacted into law, affect ed  landholders will have 6 months  from the date of enactment to make  their claim known to BLM. The trans fer of the lands to Minnesota will be  made  at  the  end of  the  6-month  period. The BLM and the Minnesota  DNR already know the occupation or  landholder status of the vast majority  of the parcels to be transferred to the  State and have attempted to contact  all affected landholders to notify them  of  their options. As a  further safe guard against omission of  legitimate  claims from consideration prior to the  transfer,  the bill requires that BLM  make aggressive efforts to notify Min nesota residents of the status of the  lands, of the intent to transfer those  lands to the State, and of the options  available  to  landholders  occupying  those lands. The Bureau of Land Man agement plans to advertise in local and  regional  papers  in Minnesota  and  make other efforts  to  ensure  that  landholders are properly notified of  the impending transfer and are aware  of the options of claimholders.  Officials of the Minnesota Depart ment of Natural Resources have as sured me they will not accept transfer  of any lands whose title remains in dis pute,  clouded  or  unclear.  Further,  BLM  is committed to resolving  title  disputes  fairly and equitably before  transferring lands to the State. This  bill provides both impetus to discover  and resolve title disputes and a mecha nism  to  facilitate  fair  resolution of  those disputes.  Despite all of the above safeguards,  there  remains  a  remote  possibility  that a  landholder with a  legitimate  claim,  acting  in good  faith, would  somehow be unaware of clouded title  ",1989

995,1019,12,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2712,  the Emer gency Chinese Adjustment of Status  Facilitation Act of 1989, introduced by  Congresswoman PELOSI, was approved  by  the full Judiciary Committee on  July 26, 1989, by voice vote.  H.R. 2712 has been introduced in re sponse to the recent Chinese Govern ment massacre and continued persecu tion  of  prodemocracy  students  in  China. I am pleased to note that H.R.  2712 enjoys strong bipartisan support  in Congress.  On June 4, 1989, the Chinese Gov ernment ordered the use of machine  guns and  tanks  to suppress student  demonstrators in Beijing. Up to 1,000  or more civilians were killed. Since  that massacre,  the Chinese Govern ment has been carrying out a hunt for  student  leaders  in China as well as  keeping  blacklists  of  prodemocracy  students here in America. In view of  the Chinese Government's actions, it  is frightfully clear that Chinese stu dents in the United States fear return ing to  the People's Republic at this  time.  Mr. Speaker, H.R.  2712  grants  a  waiver  from  the  requirement  that  holders of a J visa return to China for  2 years before being eligible to change  their immigration status. The Chinese  students should not be  forced back  into almost certain persecution.  It's  the least we can do. I urge a positive  vote on H.R. 2712. An outstanding con tribution of Congresswoman PELOSI to  the legislative agenda of this Congress.  ",1989
996,1019,12,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the admin istration and urge my colleagues  to  vote against H.R. 2712, legislation that  waives  the 2-year  residency  require ment for all Chinese students holding  J-1 visas. Although I agree that Chi nese students and Chinese nationals  should not now  go  back,  this bill  simply waives the 2-year foreign resi dency requirement without providing  a statutory framework for their tem porary stay in the United States.  The 2-year foreign resident require ment applies  to all J-1 student visa  holders and provides that foreign na tionals, upon completion of their edu cation,  return  to  their  country  of  origin. Education  is  a  valuable  re source to all countries. The 2-year for eign  residency  requirement protects  foreign countries that send students to  the United States from losing the ben efits of their education and abilities.  The bill before us today waives the  requirement for all Chinese students,  not just those who are now eligible for  this requirement. At this time we do  not have enough information to know  what will happen 7 or 8 years down  the road, when some students might  be required to fulfill their foreign resi dency requirement. At the very least  this waiver should be limited to a time  certain consistant with def erred depor tation status.  The Department of State and the  USIA  testified on July 20  that this  blanket waiver may create problems  for future Chinese students seeking to  come here and study. A different Peo ple's Republic of China regime may  welcome back these students in future  years, and, no doubt, their education is  of tremendous value to their country.  Such a blanket proposal  jeopardizes  our student visa program with China  and perhaps our future relations with  another Chinese regime.  It has been argued  that Congress  can always  reverse  its decision and  change the blanket proposal once an other regime comes  to power in the  People's Republic of China. However,  as my colleagues know, reversing such  a decision is much more difficult than  making step-by-step decisions in grant ing extensions.  I am a cosponsor of another bill,  H.R. 2929,  introduced by Subcommit tee Chairman BRUCE MORRISON, that I  believe is a better solution. This bill  does establish a statutory, framework  for protecting all Chinese nationals  ",1989
997,1032,12,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in support of H.R. 1391, the Tele vision Violence Act of 1989. This bill  would insulate the television networks,  the  cable  interests,  producers  and  others in the industry from any anti trust risk should they decide to meet  to develop voluntary guidelines to alle viate the impact of televised violence.  I  think that this is an area which  cries out for the application of some  common sense. There should be little  doubt in anyone's mind that excessive  exposure to violence can have harmful  effects, particularly  in  the  case of  young people. A 1982 report issued by  the  National  Institute  of Mental  Health, summarizing the literature in  the field, states that ""recent research  confirms  the  earlier  findings  of  a  causal  relationship between viewing  televised violence and later aggressive  behavior."" Resolutions adopted by the  American  Psychological Association,  the American Psychiatric Association,  and the American Medical Association  are consistent with these findings.  As  a  society which  cares  for  its  young people and which is rightfully  alarmed by the rising tide of violent  behavior  in our homes and  in  the  streets of the communities in which  we  live, we  are  compelled  to  take  action.  As I said at our hearing on this bill  last May, I think a lot of commonsense  things can be done to take the worst  violence off the air. I think that most  shows can be done and the story line  can be developed without  the grue some  and  abhorrent  details which  have become commonplace  in televi sion programming. It does not  take  great wisdom to perceive this and, I  think, to devise workable guidelines to  deal with it.  There has been reluctance by the  networks and others in the television  industry  to  take collective  steps  to  reduce the level of violence  in their  programming. This has been  tied to  their uncertainty about potential anti trust liability should they, as competi tors, meet to discuss collective action  in  this area. The entire purpose of  H.R. 1391, accordingly,  is  simply  to  eliminate antitrust anxiety as a reason  for inaction by the television industry.  Mr. Speaker, I do not see a constitu tional impediment to this bill. At our  hearing, Prof. Cass Sunstein, of the  University of Chicago Law School, tesI appreciate the sincere motivations  tified that the bill is constitutional beof the Members who support this bill.  cause ""it is entirely not coercive.

1001,1045,12,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in  support of H.R. 24,  the Child Nutri tion and WIC Amendments of 1989.  This bill, which makes a variety of  important improvements to the School  Lunch, School Breakfast, WIC, Child  Care Food and other child nutrition  programs, is the result of a bipartisan  effort. It includes many of  the  im provements suggested by witnesses at  the four hearings held by the Subcom mittee on Elementary, Secondary and  Vocational Education.  I am particularly pleased that the  bill addresses my concern that school  food  service  personnel were  being  overburdened with  the  number  of  audits they underwent each year. H.R.  24 calls for a unified system of audits  and requires States to coordinate all  compliance and accountability activi ties so the burden on schools is mini mized. I believe this provision reduces  the burden on schools without dimin ishing the ability of the Government  to ensure  that  they are complying  with  the  regulations of  the School  Lunch Act.  This legislation also responds to con cerns about unnecessary paperwork in  the School Lunch Program and WIC  Program. For instance, the bill allows  schools operating an after school care  program as of May 15, 1989, to provide  children with a  snack  through  the  School Lunch  Program. Currently,  schools with  such  programs must  apply for snacks  through the Child  Care Food Program. The end result is  the use of valuable time by school per sonnel filling out forms for both the  Child Care Food and School Lunch  Programs.  While I believe H.R. 24 makes a good  initial effort toward reducing unneces sary paperwork,  there are obviously  other areas where can can  further  reduce  the  paperwork  burden  on  school food service personnel. There fore, H.R. 24 also creates an Advisory  Committee on Paperwork Reduction  to  find ways and means  to  further  reduce paperwork and regulatory re quirements under  the School Lunch  Act.  Finally, in response to concerns that  eligible children were not  receiving  free and reduced price lunches because  of problems with  applications,  the  committee has made several important  changes  in  the  law.  For  example,  schools will be permitted  to certify  children as eligible for free or reduced  price meals by obtaining pertinent in formation from AFDC or food stamp  authorities. Application forms will no  longer have to include the social secu rity numbers of all adult members of  the family. Only the number of the  adult filling out the application will be  required. Last, but certainly not least,  USDA is directed to simplify the appli cation form so  individuals with  less  than a 12th grade reading level and  limited literacy skills can fill out the  forms enabling  their children  to  re ceive free or reduced price meals.  The  committee has  also  provided  money  to State educational agencies  to assist schools with significant per centages of  low-income students  for  one-time expenses incurred in starting  a  school breakfast program. Studies  have  shown  that  students perform  better in school if they have a good  breakfast. This provision should assist  in bringing additional schools into the  School Breakfast Program and reach ing additional numbers of needy chil dren.  WIC is, of course, one of the most  successful Federal programs. This bill  contains several major improvements  which will enhance the ability of this  program to locate and serve the eligi ble WIC population.  In addition,  it  streamlines the application process by  permitting an individual at nutritional  risk  to be  eligible  for WIC  if  the  family qualifies  for  free or  reduced  price  lunches,  receives  assistance  under the AFDC or Food Stamp Pro grams, or is a member of a family that  participates in Medicaid.  H.R. 24 also addresses the unfair sit uation where you have  two military  families with similar incomes and one  qualifies  for WIC and one doesn't.  This occurs because one family lives in  free on-base housing which does not to  count  against  them  in determining  WIC income eligibility and the other  family cannot obtain on-base housing  and receive a housing allowance which  does count against them when deter mining  income  eligibility  for WIC.  This bill prohibits military housing al lowances  from  being  counted  as  income  in determining eligibility for  the WIC Program.  The last program I want to discuss is  the Summer Feeding Program, which  provides meals  to  children  during  those months when the School Lunch  Program does not operate. In the past,  this program has come under a great  deal of criticism because of widespread  fraud and abuse. In response, our com mittee decided not permit private non profit organizations to participate in  the Summer Feeding  Program.  In  some  areas,  this has  restricted  the  availability of meals  to hungry chil dren. In order to address  this situa tion,  the committee has crafted lan guage once again allowing nonprofit  organizations  to  participate  in  the  Summer Feeding Program. However,  we have included a variety of restric tions which we feel will prevent the  earlier problems from reoccurring.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It  will help us to better meet the nutri tional needs of our Nation's children  and help them grow into strong, pro ductive adults. I urge my colleagues to  support this bipartisan bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  Missouri [Mr. EMERSON].  ",1989
1002,1045,12,Mr.  EMERSON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 24, a bill to reauthorize the child  nutrition programs. These are very  worthwhile  programs  that  provide  much needed help to needy individuals  and families. These are programs ad ministered by the Department of Agri culture and either provide direct as sistance  to  families or provide cash  and commodities to qualifying institu tions that off er meal services, such as  the National School Lunch Program.  Federally  supported meal  service  programs operate in public and private  elementary and secondary schools and  payments are provided based on the  number of meals served to qualifying  children. One part of these programs  is the provision of commodities by the  USDA.  The purpose of the Commodity Dis tribution Program, as it relates to the  School Meal Service Programs and  other programs,  is a dual one: It is  aimed at, in this case, providing food  to schools  to aid them in preparing  low cost, nutritious meals for school  children, and it is aimed at providing  assistance  to our Nation's  farmers.  Through the Commodity Distribution  Program,  the USDA purchases food  when markets are depressed, thereby  increasing demand for these products.  It is important to remember the dual  goals of the Commodity Distribution  Program and to ensure that the design  of the program adheres to both goals.  This program, which has been  in  effect  for  decades,  has  served  the  farmer and the ultimate consumer as  well. Through the use of this program,  the Secretary of Agriculture can use  the large volume purchasing power to  assist farmers as well as the agencies  receiving the surplus commodities.

1004,1058,12,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, let me say to my col leagues  that  the gentlewoman  from  California  [Mrs.  BOXER]  presented  some of the statistics involved in the  substance of our argument to keep the  Presidio open, pointing out  that  it  simply does not save  the  taxpayers  money.  I would  like  to share some  thoughts with the Members about the  base closure of the Presidio.  As a Christmas present to many of  us in the bay area, to the gentlewoman  from California  [Mrs. BOXER]  and  myself, we received the message that  three, not one, not  two, but  three  bases in our districts would be on the  base closure list. As we looked at the  damage  to  our  communities  and  weighed the benefits to the taxpayer  versus the damage done to our com munity, we decided that two of the bases  indeed should be closed, but that one of  the bases, the Presidio, should not be  closed. When weighing  the benefits  versus  the hardships,  in  fact over whelmingly we discovered that it was a  hardship  to  the  taxpayers of  this  country, even more than to our own  community, in addition to our being  taxpayers, being the beneficiaries of  having the Presidio there. We found it  was a hardship  to  the  taxpayers  to  close this base, so we brought our case  here.  The  gentleman  from Texas  [Mr.  ARMEY]  has pointed out  that other  bases have a better case because the  hardship is greater to the community.  We have never come here and said to  the Members what it does to our com munity. That would not interest the  Members. Our vote here is in the na tional interest, and considering the na tional interest, the Base Closure Com mission made a mistake in not calcu lating that they could not indeed close  the Presidio and sell  the  land, but  indeed they had to continue to main tain it to fulfill our responsibilities for  the health benefits to military retirees  and their families and to continue the  work of the 6th Army, that there was  no elimination of mission at the 6th  Army. The gentlewoman from Califor nia [Mrs. BOXER] pointed out very well  the cost to the Federal Government,  according to the GAO, and when two  chairmen, the chairman of the House  Armed Services Committee and  the  chairman of the Senate Armed Serv ices Committee, commission a report  from the GAO, I have confidence that  this House will pay attention to the re sults.  So I believe that it is appropriate for  us not to have this vote today, because  in the tradition of the Presidio and in  its history, not one shot was ever fired  in anger, and I believe that the Mem bers of this body, when they her.r our  case more specifically and when we got  not  the  interim but the final GAO  report, will support us and the vote  will be with us.  I would like to just share with the  Members a thought I had in preparing  for today, because we have put in the  RECORD many times over the statistics  about the Presidio, and hopefully as  Members begin  to pay attention  to  this important issue,  they will know  that we cannot avoid the fact that it  does not save money but it costs the  taxpayers money.  Frankly,  hardly  anybody is even making an argument  on that score; everybody is just saying  it will unravel the commission. But the  gentlewoman  from California  [Mrs.  BOXER]  and  I  joined our mayor  in  making this fight. We knew that we  had merit on our side, and we believe  sincerely, since we have confidence in  this body, that we will prevail. But as I  was thinking about this, I was think ing of one of my predecessors who rep resented the Fifth Congressional Dis trict of California in the Congress of  the United States, Phillip Burton, and  in the past, when we have been enthu siastic about some  issue or another  and we knew we had merit on our side  and  figured  that  something would,  therefore,  then happen, Phil would  always say, ""You really think this is  on  the  level,  don't you?""  Perhaps  Members here in this body heard him  say that.  ",1989
1005,1071,12,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3012 is, I  am told, within the 302(b) limits, and, wonder  of wonders,  is actually below last year's ap propriation. Normally such wonders should be  rewarded by an affirmative vote.  In  this case, however, my  intention  is  to  vote ""no."" Nearly $9 billion  is  too much  for  this function. Defense spending has been  in  decline since  fiscal year 1985. Military con struction ought to be descending even more  rapidly. Until it does, I won't vote for bills like  this.  ",1989
1006,1071,12,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman,  House is considering H.R. 3012,  construction  appropriations  for  1990.  This measure contains $8. 7 billion in funds  for military construction and  family housing  projects  in  the United States and overseas.  The bill supports the active military forces, the  National Guard and Reserves, defense agen cies, and NATO.  In keeping with the budget agreement,  the  bill  is $260 million  less  than  the  fiscal year  1989 appropriations level. It reflects, however,  an  increase of $145 million more  than  the  President requested-money which would go  principally for family housing and military con struction  for  the National Guard  and Re serves. There are more dollars for domestic  family housing than for overseas construction,  and the bill will provide also for child care fa cilities construction and operating costs. The  need for child care has been found to be as  urgent a matter for military families today as it  is for other families in the United States.  While  I support unreservedly  funding  for  family housing, child care, the National Guard  and the Reserves, there are things in this bill,  Mr. Chairman,  that I do not necessarily sup port expenditure of  funds  for-such as B-2  Stealth related support facilities, construction  projects for the rail garrison system for basing  of the MX missile, and funds related to con struction and development of SDI.  I opposed  expansion and  increased  funding  for  these  programs during House consideration of the  fiscal year 1990 Defense authorization bill.  My second concern is with respect to base  closings.  In April of this year, Congress sup ported the Grace Commission's recommenda tions on the closure of certain military bases  which are creating a drain on Government  funds. In other words, the bases no longer ful filled a strategic military or defense mission.  Unfortunately, in this bill today we have a pro vision allowed under the rule permitting one  amendment to the bill that would preclude clo sure of the Presidio, CA, base.  I fully understand the efforts by the Appro priations Committee to determine whether, in  fact,  closing  the bases will ultimately cost  more than  leaving  them open. We were as sured, early this year,  that as much as $700  million a year would be saved. Now we are  awaiting the findings of GAO's study to deter mine whether base closures and realignments  will result in any savings.  I do not think it is prudent, at this time, to  allow one amendment preventing a base clo sure in a particular State or district, while ex pecting all other Members whose States and  districts are affected by base closures to bite  the bullet and  let their bases be closed with out another word on  the subject.  I am very  much afraid that this opens Pandora's box and the next thing we know, Congress will be  thrown back into the chaos of having to deter mine,  in  fact, whether any base should be  closed and savings realized as a result. We  made our decision on  base  closings, Mr.  Chairman. This bill acknowledges that and by  this fall, Congress should have its report from  GAO confirming whether savings will exceed  the costs of base closures.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, it pleases me  to note that the bill requires a report, by Feb ruary 15, 1990, on specific actions taken by  the Defense Department to encourage NA TO  members and Japan  to assume a greater  share of the common defense burden. Burden  sharing is an idea whose time has come, and  I look forward to having DOD's report on any  progress being made toward that goal.  ",1989
1007,1071,12,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3012,  the  military  construction  appropriations  bill  for  fiscal year 1990 provides $8. 7 billion  for the  Department of Defense to cover the cost of  military construction and  family housing  for  military personnel.  I note that the committee  bill which  is under consideration  today  is  within  the  302(b)  discretionary  allocation,  within  the  congressional  budget  resolution,  and within the overall budget agreement.  I am disappointed, however, that the Appro priations Committee chose to include a provi sion  in the bill  to prohibit the expenditure of  any funds for the closing or realignment of 14  of the 87 military bases that Congress voted  to close and that are currently being reviewed  by  the General Accounting Office  [GAO]  to  determine  if  the savings over 6 years  from  closing these bases will exceed the costs.  By  including  this provision  in  the bill,  the  committee has weakened this legislation and  is  seeking  to  undo  the  recommendations  made  last December by  the Commission on  Base Realignment and Closure which  this  Congress ratified only  last April when  it de feated a resolution disapproving the base clo sure Commission's  recommendations.  The  Commission's report called  for  the complete  closure of 87 bases,  the partial closure of 5  bases, and  realignments  involving either  in creases or decreases  in  personnel  at 53  bases. These closures and  realignments will  ultimately save billions of dollars at a critical  time when our Federal budget deficit is at an  unprecedented level.  I supported the creation of this Commission  and  supported  its conclusions. However,  I  also agree with the sentiments expressed by  those Members who were critical of specific  base closing recommendations who suggest ed  that  the Commission's mandate should  have gone farther to include foreign as well as  domestic military bases. Clearly,  the same  reasoning which was applied by the Commis sion to its recommendations for the closing or  realignment of certain domestic military bases  may also be applied to some of our military  bases located in foreign countries.  I would surely support the point of order to  strike the provision of the bill  to prohibit ex penditures to implement the base closing rec ommendations. If such a point of order is sus tained, I intend to support final passage of the  bill.  I am pleased that the bill contains funding  for  important projects of  the Army National  Guard and the Air National Guard in my home  State of Minnesota. The bill includes $4.2 mil lion for an armory at Camp Ripley as well as  $8 million for training facilities in Troop Area 7  at Camp Ripley; $4.1 million is also included  for the Minnesota Air National Guard Duluth  ANGB. The Air Force Reserve at Minneapolis St. Paul  International Airport will also receive  $370,000 under the bill  to modify its aircraft  maintenance facility.  The largest single item for Minnesota in the  bill is for $14.1 million for the Army Reserve to  construct a training center and maintenance  facility on the grounds of the Twin Cities Army  Ammunition Plant [TCAAP] in Arden Hills, MN,  in the district I represent. While I fully appreci ate the importance of modern and adequate  training facilities for Army Reserve personnel,  I regret that the Army Reserve has apparently  to date not fully enlisted the support for this  project from public officials and local residents  who  live adjacent  to  the planned Army Re serve  facility  in Arden Hills. Neighborhood  residents are concerned about  the potential  impact of increased traffic and congestion  in  the area near the planned Reserve  facility.

1010,1097,12,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1989
1011,1097,12,Mr. FRENZEL., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from California.  ,1989
1012,1097,12,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Chairman, I think it  is clear we are going to be dealing with  the Senate on these matters and in a  conference they will, of course, focus  on the amount of the total appropria tion that they receive versus what we  receive. Of course, they are interested  in individual accountability for each  Member's mail program.  But I think the effort that the gen tleman from California, Mr. LEWIS, is  making,  and my amendment  to  it,  really are a more sensible approach. I  would want to indicate that I personal ly agree very much with the gentle man from Delaware [Mr. CARPER]. We  do not want to prevent Members from  having successful meetings with their  constituents, and I am not sure that  they will always be successful  from  the Members' standpoint, but  they  may be positive experiences. We do  not have enough contact with the very  many people we represent these days.  I  u.11derstand  the  gentleman  has  identified a problem. There are abus ers. There are Members with large dis tricts, maybe as large as the gentle man from California [Mr. LEWIS], for  example, who will paper their districts  every  time  they have a  town hall  meeting somewhere. There are other  Members with more contiguous dis tricts who will give people four oppor tunities within one day, within a 20minute drive to come and meet with  them, and given the busy and hectic  lives  that many of our constituents  have, that is appropriate.  So I guess my point simply would be  to let us not precipitously throw the  baby out with the bath water. Let us  let  the  Commission  on  Franking  review these things, attempt to elimi nate abuses, and then  take another  look at  it when we  have a better  handle on just how many Members are  not using the town hall meeting no tices and the franking privilege as it  should be.  I  really have no way of  knowing how many are abusing it, and  I would not want to overreact at this  time.  ",1989
1013,1097,12,Mr. FRENZEL.," I thank the gentle man for his contribution, but I would  say that the use of town meeting no tices insofar as I am able to determine,  and  the gentleman  is  correct,  that  there are not accurate figures, is great er than the use of postal patronage.  Mr. Chairman, on July 22 the Congressional  Research Service completed a report,  ""U.S.  Congress Official Mail Costs: Fiscal Year 1972  to Present,"" which ought to be of interest to  every Member of Congress. Surely it will be of  overwhelming interest to every taxpayer.  For  reasons  of  cost,  and  because  the  RECORD cannot reproduce the very effective  charts and graphs in the report, it will not be a  part of this statement. I commend it to the at tention of my colleagues.  The report contained good news and bad. If  the  fact that mailing costs in current dollars  has more than doubled from fiscal year 1972  to 1988 is troubling, the fact that those costs  have not increased at all in constant dollars is  a consolation.  If  the soaring volume of con gressional mail  is distressing,  then  it  is  less  distressing to know that outbound mail volume  has actually declined since 1984.  Even though some of the news is good, my  impression of  the  report  is  that  it shows,  sometimes between  the  lines,  that there are  millions of dollars of savings for the taxpayers  to be found in the exercise of simple and rea sonable restraints on congressional mailing.  First, however, it is necessary to understand  that the cost and volume figures are only esti mates.  Estimates  of  outbound mail  from  Washington come from counting bags and as suming how many pieces of mail are in them.  Outbound mail  from congressional districts is  a little different kind of guessing game, prob ably less accurate than  the Washington esti mates.  There's a problem with  the appropriations,  too.  Billings  from  the  Postal Service  lag  behind actual use by a quarter and half. Pay ments against those billings are not revealed,  but they surely are seldom made very quickly,  and I suspect not even always made quarter ly. There are no rules  that force prompt, or  even leisurely, payment.  For me, there is also a problem with count ing  inbound mail.  Inbound volume  increases  are deceptive. A lot of the apparent increases  are mail that requires no answer. A substantial  portion is ""Dear Colleague"" letters which we  write  to each other  to describe our brilliant  programs and wonderful amendments. These  letters swell our totals, but don't have to be  answered.  Another  large, and growing, portion of  in bound mail does not need  to be answered.  This consists of ads,  catalogs,  announce ments, reference group mailings, newsletters,  newspapers, magazines,  and  the  like.  In creases  in  these types of incoming mail are  deceptive because they carry no obligation to  the Representative to make a reply.  Congressmen  receive a  lot of postcards.  They are preprinted and generated by refer ence groups. We love them because they rep resent an opportunity for us to write back, but  they are at the low value end of the communi cation scale.  Actually,  there  is no computation, or esti mate, of the numbers of good, old-fashioned,  first-class  letters coming  to Member's Wash ington offices  from  their own  constituents.  This component,  the  real mail, comprises a  small percentage of the huge figure called in bound mail.  The report shows clearly that there is plenty  of money to be saved. The Senate has given  a good example of forebearance. The Senate  with exactly  the same constituency as  the  House uses less than one-half the funds con sumed by  the House. The difference  lies  in  the  restraints  the upper House has  laid on  itself, and  in  the unwillingness of  the  lower  House to accept similar restraints.  The  report draws a stark distinction be tween  the Houses  that ought  to embarrass  this House into the adoption of self-imposed  restraints. There is no reason for the House to  be the big spender.  There are lots of good ideas to reduce mail ing costs. Here are the ones that seem to me  to be the best opportunities to reduce waste  without unnecessarily restricting needed com munications:  First, the House must assign accountability  for mail  costs  to each  individual Member.  Every Member must have  the same  limits,  either  in pieces of mail, or dollars of cost,  preferably  the  latter. The modest election  year, and r:ewsletter, restrictions are really not  restrictions at all.  In  fact, we have an open ended entitlement for Congress in our mail ac count.  Second, accountability limits must result in  less mailing and  lower costs  than  current  ones. The higher spending in even numbered  years reveals the frank as a blatant election  device. The disparity between House and  Senate costs shows  the difference between  control and willfulness. Accountability won't  help much if the limits are set at the current  high-spending levels.  Third,  loopholes must  be  closed. When  newsletters were restricted, Members flooded  district mailboxes with  town meeting notices.  Each of us knows anecdotal lore which tells  of hundred of  thousands of such  notices  being sent for meetings at which a handful of  constituents were present. Many observers  consider such mailings a  reelection device  which puts an  incument's name  in a  lot of  mailboxes. Limits on notices are essential.  Another new  loophole  is  the automated  letter. Members can now personally address  and  individually type letters in any volume to  any group on any subject. Reporting to con stituents is one  thing, but sending out many  letters for each one received or to people who  never write  is considered another reelection  device. Some new restrictions on this relative ly recent type of letter are also necessary.  House newsletters are restricted to six per  year. Six  is more than enough, especially in  election years. Six per biennium is more rea sonable.  ",1989

1015,1110,12,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr.  Speaker,  a  number of us this evening have taken  out a special order even at this late  hour to pay special tribute to a friend  and  colleague,  an  individual who  served in this House for some 14 years  and who passed away in Texas with  his  family  a week  ago Friday, my  friend, my predecessor, in many ways  the individual who helped to get me  started in politics, James M. Collins.  I have asked a number of our friends  to be with us tonight.  First, I yield to the gentleman from  Ohio [Mr. MILLER] who was elected in  the same class as Mr. Collins in 1966.  Jim Collins was elected in a special  election, so he came halfway between  the class of 1966 and the class of 1968.  He was an individual who shared his  entire 14 years with Jim Collins, and I  yield to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  MILLER].  ",1989
1016,1110,12,Mr. MILLER of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.  Two weeks ago this Chamber lost a  good friend and former colleague, Jim  Collins of Texas. As one who served  with Jim during his entire 14-year  tenure in this House of Representa tives, I came to know and admire him,  not only for his extremely pleasant  personality and good works, but for  his unyielding convictions and high  standard of performance.  Congress watchers tend to measure  the performance of Members of Con gress by what some call  the horse  standard. They categorize a Member  as either a workhorse or a showhorse.  Jim was  clearly  a workhorse. He  worked hard at what he did. Con cerned, committed, and conscientious,  all the good adjectives applied.  Jim came to Washington out of con cern for his country and for his fell ow  man; he felt that by being a Repre sentative in Congress from the Third  Congressional District of Dallas, TX,  he could make a difference. His being  here did make a difference.  To his lovely wife, Dee, and to his  children and grandchildren,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity to ex press my deepest  condolences  over  their loss. Jim Collins was a good and  dear friend, the type of colleague that  makes it an honor and pleasure to be a  part of this great body.  ",1989
1017,1110,12,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for his moving  tribute and his  friendship with Mr.  Collins  for  the 14 years  that  they  served together and subsequently as a  measure of the respect that Jim Col lins was held in this body. I would take  note that the gentleman from Ohio in  fact has a serious illness in his own  family, a family member who is ill this  evening,  but he  stayed here  after  hours in order to express his own trib ute to Jim Collins.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle man from New York  [Mr. GILMAN],  who has served with Jim Collins from  1972 to 1982. The gentleman from New  York  [Mr. GILMAN]  and Mr. Collins  found on a number of occasions, of  course, they were on the same side of  the issue, but on a number of occa sions, being from different parts of the  country,  they would find  themselves  on opposite sides of some issues; but as  we were visiting earlier in the Cham ber, the gentleman from New York ex pressed  to me his deep appreciation  for Jim Collins' approach to life and  his approach to issues and his ability  to articulate those issues that were im portant for his part of the country in  southwestern Texas.  ",1989
1018,1110,12,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Texas for yielding  to me and arranging this special order.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sense  of sadness  that I  join with my col leagues  in paying tribute  to a good  friend,  our  recently  deceased  col league,  the gentleman  from Texas,  James M. Collins.  Jim Collins who served in the House  of Representatives from 1968 to 1983,  was  first elected to fill  the vacancy  caused by the death of Representative  Joseph R. Pool. Jim represented the  affluent north Dallas Third Congres sional District. In 1982, he did not run  for reelection to the House, choosing  instead to seek election to the Senate.  Unfortunately,  the people of Texas  were not ready to endorse Jim's cam paign.  A native of Dallas County, TX, and a  1937 graduate of Southern Methodist  University, Jim distinguished himself  by receiving two master's degrees in  business  administration  from  both  Notherwestern and Harvard Universi ty. In addition, it always impressed his  colleagues and myself  to know  that  this Representative who  cared  so  deeply for our Nation's armed services  was,  in  fact,  a  serviceman himself  during time of war, having served 3112  years in the U.S. Army and completing  his service as a captain with the Army  Corps of Engineers in Europe.  Later on, Jim Collins again added to  his already extensive experience by be coming president of Fidelity Union  Life, which he  transformed  into  a  major  national  insurance  company  that was sold for a substantial sum in  1978. His business expertise was un paralleled and his leadership qualities  came through in every aspect of his  life. Without his personal counseling  on the problems of the petroleum in",1989

BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 31, 1989  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker,  I would like to  call to the attention of my colleagues the fol lowing  editorial-opinion written  by Charles  Whited. It is my hope that Mr. Whited's writing  will raise Member's consideration of the Amer ican aviation  industry, Government  interven tion in a free marketplace, the determination  of the human spirit, and the advancement of  technology  for both military and commercial  use.  How POLITICS BURIED A GOOD AIRPLANE  DESIGN  <By Charles Whited)  MIAMI.-This is the story of an American  aviation scandal.  The Burnelli aircraft.  You never heard of it. Few people have.  Few encyclopedias make mention of it. Bur nelli. Even pilots will give you a blank stare.  For 50 years,  the Burnelli, an original  ""lifting body"" aircraft similar to the flying  wing, has been relegated to the dustbin of  U.S. aviation because of a U.S. president's  fit of political temper.  Despite tributes to the design from such  giants of early military aviation as Gens.  Billy Mitchell and Hap Arnold, bad luck so  dogged its creator, Vincent Burnelli, that he  went to his grave broke in 1964. The last  Burnelli was built in the late '40s.  And yet a small clutch of believers still  cite the Burnelli as a stunning example of  power politics in the military-industrial es tablishment, by which rival airplane manu facturers have kept the flying public shack led to inefficient, dangerous aircraft types  that today girdle the earth.  ""It's insane ... an evil conspiracy that  starts at the Pentagon.""  Thus, in an office in Dade County, Fla., a  debonair one-time  test pilot of America's  first supersonic aircraft, Chalmers ""Slick""  Goodlin, 66, keeps vigil for the creations of  Burnelli, whom he has venerated since boy hood as an unsung aviation genius of all  time.  In the late 1940s, Goodlin flew the Bell X1 rocket plane to the verge of Mach 1 before  turning it over to Chuck Yeager, who broke  the sound barrier. Today, Goodlin makes  his living running a firm that buys, sells and  leases aircraft. But his heart  is with the  Burnelli Co. Inc., of which he is board chair man and president, holding  the Burnelli  patents.  The old  frustrations are  revived afresh  following two aviation events last week.  One was  the maiden  flight  of  the  batwinged B-2 stealth bomber, whose design  so  closely  resembles Burnelli  technology  ",1989
1020,1136,12,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  in troducing, at the request of the Securities and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Exchange Commission, the Investment Advis er Self-Regulation Act to provide for the es tablishment of one or more self-regulatory or ganizations for registered investment advisers.  These SRO's would establish qualification and  business practice standards, perform  inspec tions, and enforce compliance with the law. At  no additional cost to the taxpayer, the industry  itself, under tough SEC oversight, would set  standards for and police its own members for  the protection of public investors.  Earlier this week, NBC Nightly News did a  segment on 67-year-old Norm Dietrich who  had  to come out of  retirement and start a  metal parts business when he lost his life sav ings, over $206,000. The Dietrichs were  re portedly among 2, 700 people who allege that  they lost a total of $40 million through Finan cial Concepts, an  Illinois  financial planning  firm. Lured by advertisements to attend  free  seminars, clients were persuaded to invest in  apartments, motels, and other real estate lim ited partnerships that  turned out disastrously  for most of them. Seventy-eight-year-old Eliza beth Synder learned she lost her $25,000 in vestment when she received an envelope in  the mail stamped: Sorry. You lost your money.  On June 11, 1986,  the Subcommittee on  Telecommunications,  Consumer  Protection,  and Finance held a hearing on investment ad visers,  financial planners, and customer pro tection. The  record  revealed  that while  the  vast majority of financial planners and invest ment advisers operate with integrity and com petence, there were far too many examples of  egregious fraud of unsophisticated  investors.  Many of the malefactors fell outside the regu latory reach of  the SEC. And  the growth of  the regulated industry was far outstripping the  Commission's resources.  On February 12, 1988, the SEC submitted  to  the subcommittee a  report based on a  study of the  financial planner industry  in  re sponse  to  the subcommittee's July 9, 1986,  request.  It examined a number of customer  demographics, characteristics of planners, and  the regulatory program for registering and  in specting p.lanners. The report also evaluated  the National Association of Securities Dealers'  pilot program to inspect NASO members who  are also investment advisers.  In September of  last year,  the SEC pub lished a  rule proposal, which  I strongly op posed, to exempt thousands of small-scale in vestment advisers from its registration require ments and  shift  its  responsibilities  to  the  States. Those rules have not been adopted.  Earlier this month the Committee on Energy  and Commerce ordered favorably reported to  the Budget Committee, for inclusion in budget  reconciliation,  legislation to provide the Com mission with the budget resources it needs to  police  the  securities markets  effectively.  These resource issues are real.  Since 1980,  the number of investment ad visers has more  than  tripled,  to 15,000 cur rently registered with  the SEC. These range  from sole proprietorships,  to  large  firms with  hundreds of employees. Assets under  their  management have increased more than 1,000  percent, now  totaling $5.3  trillion, which  is  greater than the combined deposits of banks  and savings and  loans. These assets now  amount  to 20  to 25 percent of all  financial  assets owned by Americans. There are also  July 31, 1989  approximately 200 foreign firms registered as  investment advisers in this country, reflecting  the  increasing globalization of our  financial  markets.  In the face of explosive growth in this indus try over the past decade, SEC staff levels de voted  to  supervising  the  industry have  in creased only slightly. As a consequence,  the  SEC is able to inspect investment advisers at  the rate of only once every 12 years.  On June 19, 1989,  the SEC submitted  to  Congress the legislation that I am introducing  today in order to further the public debate on  the problems associated with  inspecting and  regulating the mushrooming investment advis er industry in the face of severe limits on SEC  resources.  The committee will also be  looking at a  number of other substantive areas such as  how to regulate  those who hold  themselves  out to be financial planners, but who are not  registered as  investment advisers with  the  SEC. We also need  to look at the need  for  greater disclosure and customer education,  regulation conflicts of  interest, and ensuring  private rights of action under the  Investment  Advisers Act.  The  International Association  for Financial  Planning has announced its enthusiastic sup port for this legislation, while the National As sociation of Personal Financial Advisers has  issued a position paper opposed to self-regu lation in the investment advisory industry. I en courage all  industry members and  investors  who have an interest in this legislation to con tact the committee with their views so that we  may responsibly and effectivley fill in the exist ing regulatory gaps and protect the American  public and its savings from unethical and dis honest conduct.

DINGELL,  Chairman, Committee on Energy and Com merce, U.S. House of Representatives,  Rayburn House Office Building, Wash ington, DC.  DEAR CHAIRMAN DINGELL: I am pleased to  transmit, on behalf of the Securities and  Exchange Commission, the attached legisla tive proposal to amend the Investment Ad visers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"") to pro vide for the establishment of one or more  self-regulatory organizations <""SROs"") for  registered investment advisers. The propos al  is  patterned after  the  self-regulatory  scheme for broker-dealers established in the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Exchange  Act].  The proposal would amend the Advisers  Act primarily by adding a new section, Sec tion 203A, that would authorize the Com mission to register one or more national in vestment adviser associations to provide a  self-regulatory mechanism  for  investment  advisers, subject to Commission oversight.  These associations would establish qualifica tion and business practice standards, per form  inspections, and enforce compliance  with the law. As a general matter, member ship in an association would be mandatory  for all registered investment advisers.

Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in strong support of the propos al by DAN ROSTENKOWSKI and DICK  GEPHARDT  to  give  a  tax break  to  middle-income Americans, while at the  same  time  reducing  the  Federal  budget deficit. The simple closing of a  loophole-which currently permits the  wealthiest among us to be taxed at a  lower rate than middle-income Ameri cans-can accomplish this.  The enactment of this proposal will  increase savings, help families to buy a  first home, help pay for college educa tions, and reduce the budget deficit by  about $25 billion in the first 5 years.  That's the kind of positive action the  American people would  like  to  see  from Congress. Let us not disappoint  them.

1023,4,16,Mr. SAXON.," Mr. Speaker, the age of  the environmental ambulance squad  must end.  For years we have found ourselves  suddenly reacting to clean up the envi ronmental  messes  that  we  have  dumped on our own doorstep.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join  with me,  in taking the first step to  change all that.  Yesterday, I  introduced legislation,  House  Concurrent  Resolution  which calls for the creation of a Na tional Environmental Institute.  This institute would tap into our Na tion's great scientific intellect and co ordinate it, and enable us to finally  adopt  environmental  policies which  anticipate problems before they fester  and explode.  We do not need another unexpected  oilspill, another shocking epidemic of  dolphin deaths, or another toxic waste  surprise  before we  begin  to  take  charge  of  the  environmental  chal lenges which, up until this time, have  taken charge of us.  Mr. Speaker, our national institute  will enable us to bolster the education  of graduate and undergraduate stu dents, to offer training to those in the  policymaking arm of government, and  to  sponsor  public  awareness  cam paigns.  202,  ",1989

1025,17,16,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the rule and to note that  the very  first amendment made  in  order is an amendment by Mrs. RouKEMA of New Jersey, who is the rank ing member of the Subcommittee on  Labor-Management  Relations,  to  strike the so-called Visclosky amend ment that was added in about 60 sec onds' time at a hurried-up markup by  the Committee  on Education  and  Labor with no hearings and very little  opportunity for debate.  I want to bring to the attention of  the Congress some facts about the Vis closky  amendment,  the  damage  it  would  do  to  pension  beneficiaries  throughout this country.  First, by way of background and  backdrop, please remember that pen sion and profit-sharing plans are op tional. They are voltintary, they can  be established or  terminated  in  the  sole discretion of the employer.  There has in fact been a slow erosion  of these plans in recent years. If we  allow  the Visclosky  amendment  to  stay in this bill, that slow erosion will  become a mass stampede.  There is no requirement that an em ployer have a pension or profit-shar ing plan. They are considered an op tional fringe benefit.  Those  pension  and  profit-sharing  plans are typically paid for entirely by  the  employer. The  employers will  simply choose not to pay them, not to  start them or in fact choose to termi nate the ones they have.  There are two reasons employers in  fact will run away from pensions or  profit-sharing plans if Visclosky stays  in the bill.  First, for nonunion plans, which is  most of them, it sets up a regulatory  nightmare that wilr make section 89  pale by comparison.  In fact, what the Visclosky amend ment  contains  is  a Department of  Labor-supervised  election  for  non union  companies,  DOL-supervised  elections to have an election for the  trustees of the plan. Employers will  run like crazy from that prospect.  Second,  the Visclosky  amendment  separates  the financial responsibility  from the authority to make good in vestment decisions.  The  employer  is  singularly  and  solely and completely responsible for  the funding of that single employer  pension plan or profit-sharing plan.  If you place trustees elected for po litical  reasons  into  that  trusteeship,  then they have the authority to make  the investment decisions but the losses  accrue to the employer.  So an employer looking at that situ ation, understanding that he makes up  for all the investment losses but has  none of the decisions, will simply ter minate the plans and the employees  will lose.  I  urge  a  amendment.  ",1989

1027,17,16,Mr. MOODY.,"  man.  As we discuss the rule and consider  the contents of the amendments that  will be made in order under this rule I  want to take a few moments to discuss  several points  regarding  the capital  gains feature of the bill. I also would  comment briefly on some of the argu ments  that have been advanced  in  favor of the Bush-Jenkins proposal.  One of  them which has been ad vanced is that it will create jobs. Now,  if we had a 7 -percent or a 9-percent  unemployment  rate,  that might be  persuasive but the fad is we are effec tively near full employment.  If you talk to Alan Greenspan, or  the people who manage our macroeco nomics, I do not think they want to  see a  large stimulus  to create  jobs  right now because it would be inher ently inflationary.  So the jobs argument does not make  a lot of sense because we are at a very  low rate of unemployment, as it is.  0 1400  The second point often alleged  is  that this will .increase savings. Well,  let me remind Members that savings  do not depend very much at all on the  aftertax rate for some specific uses of  capital.  Aggregate  savings  in  the  Nation is only running at 3 percent of  net national product now.  It is not  really a  function of the tax system,  how that capital is allocated between  uses. It is a function of how the Gov ernment taxes  the different uses of  the capital. However, the total amount  of savings in a society is very much de pendent on the national income and  on a variety of other factors, not the  Tax Code. The Tax Code has shown  itself to be a very, very weak device for  increasing total savings. A very power ful device for channeling savings, but  not  for  increasing  total  savings.  I  think that argument is not valid and  says we will substitute our knowledge,  and  the Tax Code,  for  the private  market. The private market knows  how to allocate capital between real  estate and utilities, and steel plants  and auto plants. For Members to use  the Tax Code to push capital into dif ferent uses never seems to work very  well,  and  it  is very  inefficient  for  Members  to put a political spin on  that allocation process.  The third point often alleged is that  this will enhance capital markets. My  friends, I think tax stability would en hance capital markets, and somebody  joked the other day that tax refQrm  would be tax stability. We are in a po sition where we are changing the Tax  Code every single year, and one thing  I hear from business friends in Wis consin is, ""Please leave the Tax Code  alone for a while so we can plan."" Cap ital gains, it is argued, would stimulate  long-term planning, which we need in  ",1989

1030,264,16,Mr. PICKLE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I  agree with my  friend from Florida that this is not the  proper way to find an answer to the  problem we have facing us in the pen sion program.  The Committee on Ways and Means  and the Committee on Education and  Labor have been at odds here now for  the past two sessions,  trying to find  some kind of an answer. I do not think  the proper way, in a matter of trustee ship, should be handled in a reconcilia tion bill. We ought to have a bill come  out of the committee, so that we have  a chance to vote on it, where we have  hearings and know exactly what it is.  As it is, we are trying to settle very  major issues in reconciliation.  Now I am not going to vote for this  Visclosky amendment, but I say that  without prejudice, because it seems to  me that both the working people and  the management have got to realize  we need to make some changes and I  hope in the next session we can ap proach it in that kind of spirit.  At this point I think it would be im proper to do this through reconcilia tion.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1989

1033,264,16,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Chairman, how  many times on the floor of the House  have we heard Members speak, par ticularly on the Republican side of the  aisle, about their belief that opening  the economy of a nation to competi tion  and  collective  bargaining will  result not just in industrial democracy  but in political democracy. Whether  the setting  is  in Eastern Europe or  Central America, many times we have  heard the argument that democracy is  followed or  is complemented by an  open economy.  The  Visclosky  amendment  tests  whether Americans believe in industri al democracy only as an export prod uct or will accept it for domestic con sumption in the United States.  Historically in the United States we  have expanded the voice of American  workers with  collective  bargaining,  profit sharing, employee membership  on corporate boards. Mr. VISCLOSKY  challenges us to give American work ers a voice in deciding the fate of their  retirement plans, an issue just as criti cal as wages, hours, working condi tions.  Opponents would  argue  that you  just cannot trust employees to make  the best decision when it comes to the  investment of their retirement funds. I  do not believe that for a minute.  Workers will  guard  these  invest ments in their future just as carefully,  if not more so, as management.  Others just do not want to see blue  collars or coveralls in the board rooms.  To that elitist and reactionary posi tion I can only say, ""Step aside.""  The democratic principles that guide  this country are just as valid in the  work place as they are in the polling  place. The Visclosky language is an af firmation of our confidence in democ racy and deserves our solid support.  Vote ""no"" on the Roukema amend ment.  ",1989

1035,264,16,Mr. CHANDLER.," I  thank the gen tlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I  join many of my  colleagues in suggesting that Mr. VIs CLOSKY has in mind here a perfectly  legitimate goal. I do not question his  motives in the least.  Let me make a couple of points that  would tend to, I think, persuade per haps one to conclude this is not a good  idea.  First of all, Mr. VISCLOSKY  in his  comments said that leverage buyouts  would somehow be affected by mem bership on these investment boards of  workers. That is a  totally irrelevant  issue to this debate. It has absolutely  nothing to do with this.  In a leveraged buyout, when a plan  termination is involved, that is a deci sion of the employer. The employer  makes that decision, and this group of  workers would have absolutely noth ing to do with it. So set that aside;  LBO's are totally separate.  Our  colleague  from Florida  [Mr.  GIBBONS], who just happens to know  something about this issue from his  years of experience, concluded, as I  did, that workers also do not need this  so-called protection.  0 1510  In 1974 President Ford signed the  Employee Retirement Income Securi ty Act [ERISA]. When he did so, he  put in place protections for workers  that had never existed before, and  ERISA has worked pretty well.  The problem is now we are going to  say that an employers must share re sponsibility with employees for deci sion making on the investment of pen sion plan assets. Also, employers are  going to say, ""No."" They will not do it.  What is  their alternative? Well,  the  answer is clear in the response to the  question  from  the gentleman  from  Texas. They can and will terminate  their plans, or as our friend from Flor ida said, they will not set them up in  the first place.  In the last 10 to 15 years this Con gress has changed tax and pension law  practically every year. The Congress  has heaped on new requirements, year  after year. What has been the result?  Members can look back at years 1983,  1984, 1985, and I will  tell Members  what plan sponsors were doing. They  were doing then what they will do if  this amendment stays in place. They  were terminating their plans in record  numbers, and that is what will result  from the Visclosky amendment.  ",1989

1037,264,16,Mr. MILLER  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise in strong opposition  to the Roukema amendment, and in  support of the amendment by the gen tleman from Indiana [Mr. VISCLOSKY].  The issue here is one of fairness. Sev eral people have risen already today  and said that, in fact, this is a radical  proposal, that somehow to give em ployees a voice over their retirement,  over the use of their pension funds, is  radical. Did the Congress think it was  radical when we provided tax benefits  so that the employer could hand off  ownership  to  the employees, as we  give them ESOP's? Do they think it is  radical when we give them IRA's, so  people can take control over their re tirements, and make the investments  wherever they want? Is it radical that  the employees of United Airlines are  smart enough, apparently,  to guide  this company against some of the cap tains of private enterprise, to win that  effort to buy United Airlines, but they  are not smart enough to invest their  pension funds?  How can this be? How can this be?  We celebrate employees  taking over  the Gdansk shipyard in Poland, but do  not let an American employee have a  say in their retirement, because they  would  squander  the money. What  would they do? Would they do what  the employers are doing now, put it  into a fund to participate in the pur chase of junk bonds, as they are doing  today with employees? Would  they  ",1989

1039,277,16,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in  opposition  to  the Dorgan  amendment.  First, let us get the facts straight.  Section 89, contrary to what the Wall  Street Journal contends, did not come  from the tax staff, but from the Treas ury Department. Second, section 89  does not force employers  to provide  benefits, but simply says that to the  extent an employer chooses to provide  benefits, they must be provided on a  nondiscriminatory basis.  Now I know that we have all heard  that section 89 is too complicated. And  it was, which is precisely why we on  the Ways and Means Committee re vised it, not once but three times, in  response  to  just those concerns. We  enacted a series of safe harbors and  simplifications last year in the Techni cal and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1988.  The chairman then introduced H.R.  1864 which totally revamped section  89. The committee then held hearings  and heard from over 30 witnesses, the  majority of whom did not advocate  repeal, but agreed with the chairman's  bill.  ",1989

1041,290,16,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding to me the 2  minutes and strongly rise in support of  the Anderson amendment.  I would say to every Member in this  House,  Democrat  or  Republican,  shame,  shame,  shame, because  the  reason that we are not able to do the  infrastructure work in this country is  not because the Appropriations Com mittee has not provided the money.  We have had the opportunity there. It  is called a trust fund.  Trust means to me that the money is  kept in trust for the purpose intended.  We voted for that, all of us did, and we  voted to set up trust funds that pro vided the resources for the people of  this country. This is not a question of  shifting money around.  Fundamentally what we are coming  back and saying, and hear me, we are  using the trust fund to shield the defi cit. Shame on Congress. Shame on  Congress. Shame on Congress.  Face up to it. That is what the issue  is about, and in effect here is one step  somebody  is  trying  to  take at  this  point to say we will not do that any more now, we will take the first step,  we will take the first $1 billion and put  that $1 billion into the general treas ury, and tomorrow we will  take the  second $1 billion and put that in.  But the fact fundamentally remains  that the trust funds are held in trust  in the name of the people of the coun try, and that is the bill that Congress  passed, and you  are attempting  to  divert away the funds that the people  were allocated for the purpose intend ed. That is the truth, and that is the  issue we have to deal with.  This is the wrong time to do  this.  This is not a jurisdictional fight what soever. It simply comes back and says  that the future capital of the infra structure of this country is involved in  this debate. It is not that simple, and  once we start to divert those funds we  break trust with the American people,  and that is the reason fundamentally I  support  the Anderson  amendment  over anything else that is before us  today.

1043,290,16,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  to me and only want to corroborate  and  reiterate what  the  gentleman  from Minnesota  [Mr. FRENZEL]  said.  This money that is being spent, No. 1,  is being spent for safety, and safety on  airline traffic is as important as buildis  to  ing runways. I do not think any of us  can deny that.  It is being spent for a purpose for  which  it was collected, which  make the airports safer.  But second, Gramm-Rudman makes  tough choices. We have to face up to  that, all of us in this body, and they  are not going to get easier. I for one  would rather see the trust funds put  off budget, and one day I believe we  will do  that. But  they are not off  budget today.  A deal was made in order to imple ment the budget summit agreement, a  compromise, and now the Committee  on Ways and Means is going to stand  full force behind that compromise. It  may not be totally acceptable to every one in this body, but it is the only way  we can go at this point and measure  up  to our responsibilities under the  budget agreement.  ",1989

1045,290,16,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of  the Anderson  amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with the dis tinguished chairman of the Public Works Com mittee  in support of his amendment and  in  support of his strong commitment to ensuring  that the future of American air travel will not  be held hostage by budget tricks or short-term  thinking.  I would urge my colleagues  the purpose of a trust fund.  It  is to endow a vital activity with  sources needed to ensure its future.  Diverting funds from a trust fund for immedi ate emergencies ensures that when the future  arrives, when the rainy day comes, we will be  unprepared.  This  proposal would  divert  funds which  could modernize our air traffic control system;  fund the capital developments which will allow  our airports to expand and better serve Ameri can travelers and businesses; and provide the  maintenance which  is vital to the safety and  security of every traveler.  Don't be mistaken by the fact that huge sur pluses have built up in the fund.  Those surpluses exist not because they are  not sorely needed for our air  infrastructure,  but because they are victim of an administra tion budget trick.  Building up the airport trust fund with one  set of budget tricks to keep the deficit seem ing  smaller and  then using another budget  stratagem to take the money, does not live up  to the idea of a trust fund, and does not serve  the public interest.  The CBO and the House Budget Committee  have issued opinions stating that the added  revenues from suspending the tax trigger will  count toward the $5 billion no matter which  fund these moneys go to.  So let's keep them where they belong,  the airport trust fund.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the  Anderson amendment, showing that when we  in  ",1989
1046,303,16,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," I  thank  the  gentleman  from Michigan  for  taking  this special order  tonight  to  inform our colleagues and, hopefully.  some other people that we do have a  real problem here  in  the Congress  which is not new.  I have been  in  the Congress now  almost 8 years and we have had to  struggle with continuing  resolutions  throughout that entire period of time.  In fact, I only recall 1 year, I think it  was  in 1987, when Ronald Reagan  came before this body in his State of  the Union Message with a 14-pound  document that he dropped on the lec tern up there and said this was the  last continuing resolution that he was  going to sign.  We all applauded wildly because we  knew  that  as  the gentleman  said,  nobody knew really what was in that  continuing  resolution  in  1986-87.  What  really  concerns me  and  the  reason I am very happy to participate  in this special order is not that we do  not get our work done on time, al though that is a major problem-we  should get our work done on time. We  wasted a tremendous amount of time  in the early part of the year. What  really concerns me  is the chicanery  that takes place when you pass a con tinuing resolution. The last continuing  resolution  that  I  remember  we  brought  before  the  House,  they  brought  it out here about 11:30 at  night, it was wrapped in string, there  were big red lines through it. People  did not really know what was in it. I  doubt seriously whether the people on  Ways  and Means  knew  everything  that was  in that bill. But later we  found  out  there were  pork-barrel  projects for special apartment build ings in Chicago, there was a new park ing  lot approval  for  a  stadium  in  Miami, FL, there was all kinds of pork barrel projects, tax forgiveness in Tar rant County, TX.  I  remember  that  specifically very well, in Jim Wright's  district. Those kinds of things bother  those of us in this body because we  know they are pork-barrel projects, we  know there is chicanery, stuff that is  done under the table. But it bothers  the American people even more be cause they lose confidence in us.  Lord knows we have enough prob lems around here right now that lead  the American people  to  lose confi dence in Congress.  I think we only add fuel to the fire  when we do not go through the regu lar appropriations process and meet  the deadlines that have been set out  by the Constitution and by law.  When we pass a continuing resolu tion, we violate the trust of the Ameri can people. I think it is time that we  as  a  body  pass  the  constitutional  amendment  to balance  the budget,  pass a constitutional amendment or a  law that would give the President a  line-item veto and say once and for all  we are going to live within our means,  we are going to live within the laws.  we are going to get our appropriations  bill done on time, we are going to go  through all the processes required in a  reasonable amount of time and cut out  these continuing resolutions once and  for all.  I think the American people would  applaud it. I  think they would look  upon Congress with much more favor  than they do. It would restore a lot of  trust which has been lost by the Amer ican people as respects the Congress of  the United States.  Once again  I  thank my colleague  from Michigan. I know this is a real  drain on him to set this thing up.

1055,329,16,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President, at the  moment of the vote on the drug agree ment, let me join my colleagues in ex pressing my appreciation to the distin guished President pro tempore of the  Senate, the Senator from West Virgin ia, who  is also  the chairman of the  Senate Appropriations Committee.  He has performed a very valuable  service to our Nation as we try to con front  this  terrible problem  in our  midst. He has found a way for us to re allocate needed resources without the  need for new tax revenues. And he has  gotten all this done after having start ed with less than 30 days remaining in  our fiscal year.  It is a remarkable accomplishment,  worthy of praise, and recognition. His  work will save lives and improve the  chances that America will succeed in  triumphing over this terrible enemy.  Mr. President, let me take this op portunity to make several other obser vations that I believe are worthwhile.  First, this across-the-board spending  reduction that have us $2 billion of  savings was endorsed by all 55 Demo cratic Senators. Fifty-five Democratic  Senators agreed to reduce the budget  by $2 billion and to apply the money  to the solution of a problem that carries a higher priority-in this case, the  violence and destruction  that are a  consequence of illegal drug usage in  America.  I think it is clear that Democrats are  willing and able to match their prior ities with discipline.  We offered a $2-billion reduction in  spending to be reallocated to a higher  priority. But the administration said  no. They would only agree to allocate  $800 million more to drug programs.  Mr. President, I have suggested that  we take that $1 billion and spend that  money on another American problem  that has a high priority: growing U.S.  debt. I have suggested that we in the  Congress show the American people  that we know how to pay off the debt,  that we know it is done a little at a  time, that we know it is done by exert ing  the discipline not  to spend  the  money on things that have a lower pri ority.  My suggestion, however,  is not ac ceptable. It is not practical, I am told,  because it will break this agreement  that was  put  together after much  work. I am told that our procedures  will not allow us to take this action.  And I regret this very much.  The distinguished chairman of the  Appropriations Committee has  con vinced me that there is a better and  more appropriate place to fight this  battle. I have unequaled respect for  the Senator from West Virginia and  have heeded his advice. However,  I  want to put my colleagues on notice  that I will be back.  There is a second observation that I  believe  is worth nothing, Mr. Presi dent. I also believe the action we are  taking is significant because it is the  legislative branch exerting spending  constraint upon the executive branch.  It is the legislative branch, specifically  the chairman of  the Senate Appro priations Committee, who found the  realistic and acceptable way of provid ing the off -setting funds to finance the  drug program additions so that our ac tions would not contribute to the defi cit. He did not propose cuts which he  knew could not be adopted. Instead,  he asked all appropriations subcom mittees to contribute to a reallocation  of resources.  In  this  case  it  is  the  executive  branch  that  is out of control. Our  President wants to go to the Moon and  to Mars. He wants us to declare war on  drugs. He is worried about our chil dren. And he is concerned about our  environment. He says we need to do  something-for  gosh  sakes-about  Poland and Hungary.  There seems  to be something new  every day that the President wants to  spend money on. Yesterday  it was  Third World debt. Today it is educa tion. Tomorrow, who knows.

But cer tainly it deserves our look.  I thank the Senator from New York  for his thoughtful comments.  Mr. President, I yield myself about 5  minutes. I know of no other request  for time on this side. It would be my  hope after I complete to yield back the  time on this side, which might move  the vote up a little earlier because I  know the majority leader would very  much like to finish this bill and get  back on  the Defense appropriation  bill.

DRUG NEGOTIATIONS  Mr.  President,  for  the  past  1%  weeks, 18 of our colleagues having  been meeting for hours on end, well  into several nights, on the so-called  drug bill.  It has been a tremendous effort to  craft an agreement.  I want to first state very clearly that  these negotiations were undertaken  following the lead of President George  Bush and his Drug Control Director  Bill Bennett. As I have stated previ ously,  the  President's  strategy  is  sound, will be effective, and deserves  bipartisan support.  THE AGREEMENT  The President called for increasing  antidrug and crime activities by the  Federal Government by $2.7 billion  over  last year's level,  to a  total of  about $8.4 billion. The Senate agree ment will  increase  this amount by  $410 million-that is $400 million for  treatment and education and $10 mil lion for State and local law enforce ment.  The bottom line, as far as the Ameri can people are concerned,  isn't how  much money we can spend: It is how  effective are we going to be in a real  crackdown on drugs and crime.  There are four matters contained in  the President's drug strategy that will  be offered on the Transportation ap propriations  bill-increased  account ability and data assimilation by treat ment  providers,  requiring  drug-free  school plans in all elementary, second ary, and higher education institutions,  providing transfers to the special for feiture fund for use by the Drug Con trol Director, as well as a waiver of two  provisions of current law to permit the  Andean cocaine reduction initiative to  go forward.  While the negotiators were unable  to agree on the final request of the  President-a  requirement  that  all  State and  local arrestees, prisoners,  and those on probation and parole be  drug tested. Again, the agreement con templates a future drug bill for consid eration of  this and other antidrug  amendments.  Mr. President,  the agreement also  calls  for consideration of  the Presi dent's crime bill this year. We simply  cannot adjourn for  the year talking  tough on drugs without addressing the  fact  that  the drug problem  in our  ",1989

1071,368,16,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  this amendment provides for drug and  alcohol  testing  for  safety  related  transportation personnel. It is virtual ly identical, with only very minor and  technical changes, to a bill which was  passed by the Senate twice during the  100th Congress, once on a rollcall vote  of 83 to 7.  The drug-testing aspects are  sub stantially the same as regulations al ready promulgated by the Department  of Transportation. Therefore, with re spect  to drug  testing,  it does  little  more  than  codify Department  of  Transportation  regulations.  It does  add alcohol testing to the Department  of Transportation Testing Program.  Mr. President, I think that the need  for this legislation is obvious. It has  been widely recognized by the Senate  and  the 100th Congress. Since  the  Chase, MD,  disaster,  in which  16  people were killed 3 years ago, there  has been an average of one train wreck  every 10 days in which testing has sub sequently disclosed drug or alcohol  use.  The incident with the USAir plane  where  the pilot  and  copilot disap peared last week raises further ques tions of drug and alcohol use in trans portation.  Obviously,  this  is a matter whose  time has come. Therefore, on behalf of  Senator HoLLINGS  and 14 other co sponsors,  I offer  this amendment.  I  say on behalf of Senator HoLLINGS be cause this legislation has been report ed unanimously out of the Commerce  Committee this year.  ",1989

1078,368,16,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  rise to urge my colleagues to join us in  our fight to improve the safety of the  traveling public by ending drug and al cohol abuse by  transportation work ers. Right to the point, there is a criti cal need for increased testing, includ ing mandatory  random  testing,  to  deter such abuse. That is the point of  this amendment, and I urge its adop tion.  Twice during  the 100th Congress,  the Senate passed legislation virtually  identical  to  this, mandating random  drug and alcohol  testing for safety sensitive employees in the rail, motor  carrier, and commercial airline indus tries. Support was overwhelming, as  the provisions of our bill were adopted  on an 87-to-3 vote in late 1987, and  without debate during consideration  of the omnibus drug bill late last year.  Both times, however, our efforts were  stymied  by  our  colleagues  in  the  House.  It is  impossible to ignore the pres ence of alcohol and illegal drugs in the  transportation workplace. The  facts  speak for themselves. This year alone,  there have been 13  rail accidents in  which either alcohol or drugs were  found to be present in employees re sponsible for safe passage. Last year,  on average, there was a rail accident in  which drugs or alcohol were involved  every 12% days. And we cannot forget  the  tragic January 1987 accident  in  Chase, MD, in which an engineer's use  of marijuana was the probable cause  for  an  accident between  a Conrail  freight train and an Amtrak passenger  train that resulted in 16 fatalities and  17 4 injuries.  Mr. President, other examples show  this is not an isolated problem:  In 1986, an insurance industry study  found  that 30 percent of some 300  truck drivers randomly sampled tested  positive for drugs.  Investigators  determined  that  a  pilot's cocaine use was a contributing  factor  in a January 1988 crash of a  commuter aircraft in rural Colorado in  which nine people died.  In April 1987, a bus struck a bridge  on the George Washington Parkway  in Virginia, killing 1 and injuring 32  passengers. The driver tested positive  for cocaine, valium, and marijuana.  The grounding of the Exxon Valdez  earlier  this year  in Prince William  Sound, AK, in which the captain's his tory of alcohol use is at issue, is an other vivid reminder of the extent of  this problem.  Fortunately, our efforts have borne  some fruit. Last year, the Department  of Transportation  issued rules man dating testing of safety-sensitive work ers for illegal drugs in the rail, motor  carrier,  aviation, maritime, pipeline,  and mass transit industries.  However, enactment of legislation to  mandate drug and alcohol testing for  transportation workers  remains my  objective  and  top  priority.  Very  simply, the DOT rules do not go far  enough, failing to include alcohol in  industry  testing programs. Accident  statistics prove alcohol abuse a threat  to the safety of the American travel ing public at least as big, if not bigger,  ",1989
1079,381,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  we will shortly be voting on the trans portation bill and I will just take this  opportunity to make a few comments  before that action takes place.  I believe that this bill represents a  good balanced funding approach for  various and often competing modes of  transportation.  I  take the opportunity we have to  thank my colleague, the distinguished  ranking member of the subcommittee,  Senator D' AMATo, for his support and  advice. This bill was done in a full bi partisan spirit in which all members of  the subcommittee and the full com mittee worked so that we could move  this bill.

In addition, I  recognize and thank  for  their work Mitchell Ostrer and  Jeff Morales of my personal staff and  thank some people who were of tre mendous help in relation to the smok ing ban amendment.  There were a great number of volun teers, working through health groups  and the flight attendants, who put in  a lot of time to help in this effort. To  all of them, I offer my thanks-in par ticular: Arnita Hannon of the Ameri can Lung Association; Cliff Douglas of  the Coalition on Smoking or Health;  and Juliette Lenoire and Jo Ellen of  the Association of Flight Attendants.  Their efforts were critical, and I thank  them.  But their real reward is in the ac complishment. They can be proud of  their work.

1090,394,16,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to join Senator MITCHELL and  my colleagues from New England in  introducing legislation to establish a  nationwide  uniform minimum  size  standard for lobsters shipped or sold  in interstate commerce. While current  U.S.  fisheries  conservation  law pre vents  lobstermen  in Maine, Rhode  Island, and Massachusetts from land ing lobsters below a certain minimum  size, there is presently no mechanism  for insuring that imported undersized  lobsters from Canada do not show up  in Dallas, Chicago or Los Angeles. In  fact, the need for this legislation has  become  even more  compelling  in  recent months as  the United States  has been flooded with undersized lob ster imports which threaten to undermine  longstanding U.S. conservation  efforts.  Frankly, I was disappointed last year  that the administration refused to in clude language in the United States Canada Free Trade Agreement to pro mote  the conservation of American  lobsters.  New  England  lobstermen  must observe  existing Federal  and  State regulations which set a mini mum legal size for a harvested lob ster's body shell length to insure that  only mature lobsters can be caught.  Even though some 50 percent of the  lobsters  consumed  in  the United  States are imported from Canada, Ca nadian  lobstermen do not have  to  meet the minimum size requirements  for their export sales. This situation  clearly undermines the U.S. conserva tion system and places U.S.  lobster men a.t a competitive disadvantage.  Federal management of the U.S. lob ster fishery falls under the Magnuson  Fisheries Conservation and Manage ment Act which regulates the catch  from 3 to 200 miles offshore. Individ ual State laws govern the inshore har vesting out to 3 miles. Under current  Federal  conservation  regulations,  those American lobsters with a body  shell smaller than 3 lf4 inches-or about  1 Vs pounds-cannot be landed. In addi tion, to insure the continued reproduc tion of the species, it is illegal to land  egg bearing females or those females  whose  eggs  have  been  forcibly  re moved. While  these  regulations  re strict the actions of U.S.  lobstermen,  they do nothing to prohibit the sale of  undersized  imported  lobsters-thus  creating  a  dangerous  two-tiered  system  which  could  irrevocably  damage our U.S. conservation efforts.  The legislation we are  introducing  today fills in the enforcement cracks  presently existing in Federal conserva tion law by banning the sale or ship ment of undersized lobsters in inter state commerce. For  the first  time,  both United States and foreign  lob stermen would be required to maintain  the same minimum size standard for  interstate sales in the United States. It  is  important  to remember that  this  legislation does not violate U.S. obliga tions under international law as both  article 20 of the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade and chapter 12  of  the United States-Canada Free  Trade Agreement clearly allow such  governmental actions for conservation  purposes.  Maine lobstermen have a  long and  proud heritage of battling  the ele ments to harvest food from the sea.  They have made the sometimes pain ful sacrifices necessary to ensure the  continued abundance of  their catch.  Therefore, it is simply a matter of fair ness and equity to apply a uniform  minimum size standard to all lobsters  shipped or sold  in  interestate com merce in the United States. In this era  of diminishing resources, I believe that  we should be rewarding sound fisher ies conservation practices, not pushing  those who practice them.  ",1989
1091,394,16,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be a cosponso ..  of this very  important bill that will help conserve  the American lobster and at the same  time protect our New England lobster men from unfair competition from im ports.  The American  lobster  is managed  under a combination of Federal and  State laws. Limits on the size of lob ster that may be taken and prohibi tion of harvest of egg-bearing females  are the principle mechanisms for con servation. Federal size restrictions are  defined by the American lobster fish ery management plan as implemented  under the Magnuson Fishery Conser vation and Mangement Act. These re strictions apply to all lobster caught in  Federal waters and to those caught in  State waters by lobstermen holding a  permit that applies to Federal as well  as  state waters.  State  regulations  apply within the 3-mile State jurisdic tion and are generally consistent with  Federal regulation. The Federal size  limit  is currently 3%  inches and  is  scheduled  to  be  increased  by  one  thirty-second of an inch in 1991 and  again by one thirty-second of an inch  in 1992.  About 50 percent of the lobsters sold  in the United Stats are imported from  Canada. The Canadians were sched uled to increase their size limits to the  current U.S.  level of 3¥4  inches, but  have  indenfinitely  postponed  this  action.  Mr. President, this places us in a dif ficult position. We would like the pro posed size increases go into effect be cause these were developed with con servation of the fishery in mind. How ever, we do not wish to place our lob stermen at a competitive disadvantage  by  raising United States  standards  while  Canadian  standards  remain  below our current levels. It is estimat ed that imports that do not meet the  U.S. minimum size requirements will  increase from 10 percent to about 30  percent when our size standards are  raised.  Our previous efforts to remedy this  problem by prohibiting importation of  undersized lobsters were unsuccessful  because some felt it violated our Free  Trade Agreement with Canada.  The legislation that we are introduc ing today would amend the Magnuson  Fishery Conservation  and Manage ment Act so that all lobsters that are  either sold or shipped  in  interstate  commerce in the United States would  be  subject  to  Federal  regulations.  These regulations would then apply to  both  foreign  and domestic  lobsters.  This legislation will strengthen Feder al and State conservation and manage ment efforts while protecting our lob stermen from an influx of undersized  ",1989
1092,433,16,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker,  in a  time  when we are witness to a seemingly endless  struggle between industry owners and employ ees,  I rise to recognize the third annual Na tional Employee Ownership Week, October 17, 1989. The week is to recognize employee owned companies across the Nation  for the  contribution they make to American's econo my. Throughout the country and  in  the 18th  District of Ohio, employee stock ownership  plans  [ESOP's] have been preserving  jobs  and helping to avoid the rash of closings that  have been sweeping through America's indus tries.  In 197 4 when Congress enacted  its  first  ESOP  legislation,  there were  few employee owned companies. Today there are over 200  employee-owned businesses  in Ohio alone  and more  than  1 0,000  s_uch  enterprises  across the United States.  In 1986, the E.W. Bliss Co. of Salem, OH in  my congressional district, was on the verge of  a shutdown. Citing general decline in the steel  industry,  the heavy equipment manufacturer  laid off 300 employees and demanded wage  concessions from  the 100 that remained.  In stead, Steelworkers local 3372 rejected con cessions and suggested an employee buyout.  Since  the  institution of  the ESOP  in 1986,  Bliss-Salem  Inc.  has  seen  profits  improve  steadily. Over 150 new employees have been  hired, sales have  tripled, and employees re ceived their first bonus this September.  Management  attributes  the  recovery  of  Bliss-Salem  to  its ESOP. By expanding  the  workers' role and encouraging employees to  participate in the decisionmaking process, the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  owner employees find they have an interest in  the results of problem resolution.  Employee-owned businesses  tend  to out perform  their non-ESOP competitors. When  you work for yourself, you find more efficient  and more productive ways of getting the job  done. Management attributes the recovery of  Bliss-Salem  to  its ESOP. By expanding  the  workers' role and encouraging employees to  participate in the decisionmaking process, the  owner employees find they have an interest in  the results of problem resolution.

1093,433,16,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Mr. Speaker, not long ago,  Lee Guy, editor of the Panhandle Press in my  home district, wrote an editorial expressing  the  frustration  that many Americans  feel  re garding the threat of terrorism. Mr. Guy's edi torial follows:  I do not remember the exact details of the  story because I read it many years ago, but  the  following  incident actually happened  during  the  administration  of  President  Theodore ""Teddy"" Roosevelt  in  the very  early years of this century.  It seems that a Middle Eastern sheik, ac tually more of a desert maurauder or what  we might call a  terrorist  today, had kid napped a wealthy Amerian heiress and was  holding her for a huge ransom which the  kidnappers  demanded  from  the United  States Goverrunent.  For want  of  remembering  the  lady's  actual name, we'll call her Mrs. Smith for  this  re-created  account. The  kidnappers  sent their ransom demand to the U.S. Gov errunent. President Roosevelt sent the fol lowing 12-word reply in a  telegram to the  sheik: ""24 hour stop Mrs. Smith stop Or  your head on a stick."" Within 24 hours, the  U.S. Government  received notification of  where Mrs. Smith would be waiting to be  picked up.  During the war with the Japanese, 50,000  U.S. Marines stormed the beaches of Okina wa, which was fortified to the hilt with sev eral hundred  thousand  Japanese  soldiers  and enough supplies  to  last  for months.  Enormously outnumbered, the Marines re lentlessly drove  the numerically  superior  hordes of Japanese back across the island  until the last 3,000 of them jumped over a  cliff and into the ocean. From several hun dred thousand Japanese, the U.S. Marines  took approximately 1,300 prisoners.  On the cruel, barren Pacific volcano island  of  Iwo  Jima, outnumbered U.S. Marines  doggedly  slugged  it out with  the enemy  until five bloodied and battle-weary Ameri cans firmly planted Old Glory on  top of  Mount Suribachi. And that, thank you very  much, was all she wrote for the Japanese.  You all remember the picture-the world famous photograph was the model for the  U.S. Marine Corps Memorial at Arlington  National Cemetery.  On June 6, 1944, Allied forces-American,  British and French-stormed the beaches at  Normandy and Omaha in the face of unbe lievable, dPq.dly, withering gunfire from the  firmly-enti,  ched  and  fortified German  22193  army. Today, such a scenario might cause  modern soldiers to ""fall back and re-group.""  But, our men  relentlessly drove  forward  through the lethal onslaught, overran the  enemy, and that was the beginning of the  end of the world-conquest dreams of Adolph  Hitler.  Where have all our soldiers gone? Where  is the guts and backbone of the American  fighting man and his leaders? Throughout  the history of the United States of America,  from Valley Forge and Bunker Hill to Balti more Harbor; from the Marne to Belleau  Wood;  from Pearl Harbor to Okinawa to  Iwo Jima; and from the Thirty-Eighth Par allel  to Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak  Ridge, the American fighting man has faced  insurmountable odds and has always pre vailed against the most aggressive and de termined enemies. During this century, the  accomplishments of the American fighting  man have become legend, as well as fact, in  our history books.  Now, America lowers her eyes and stares  at the ground like a subservient slave when  an unspeakable act is performed against one  of her citizens in a foreign land. Witness the  alleged brutal murder of Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins, USMC, in Beirut. Col. Higgins was  an American fighting man who faced hostil ity and aggression in the service of his coun try, and he did so without backing down or  compromising with  the enemy. Now  that  this brave soldier has been taken from the  service of our nation by a cowardly act of  terrorists, the United States must not back  down from exacting the last ounce of justice  from his kidnappers.  When  is  the United States of America  going to stand up to these cowardly acts of  terrorism and punish them severely, instead  of holding hysterical talk sessions on televi sion in which our national leaders mumble  inane phrases like ""delicate situation"", ....  ""can't upset the balance"" ... , ""negotiations  are going on"" . . . , etc.?  How long is it going to be before United  States military forces see to it that terror ists in the Middle East are afraid to so much  as snatch an American woman's purse?  How long do we have to tolerate the mos quitoes without being allowed  to use  the  simple solution of insecticide? How long?  TRIBUTE TO DOROTHA  FREDERICK  HON. DAVID E.

1096,446,16,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the amendment to lower  the capital gains tax rate.  Mr. Chairman, the Democrats have been fu riously backpedalling to come up with an idea  to offset President Bush's desire to cut capital  gains  tax  rates and encourage  investment.  Their  idea,  to  stimulate  greater  savings  through encouraging Individual Retirement Ac counts  isn't a bad one  if considered  in a  vacuum. The problem is, the reconciliation bill  is not a vacuum, rather it's part of the budget ary process, the part that is mandated to raise  revenue.  Now, encouraging investment in IRA's does  not raise revenue. Even the Democrats under stand  this. So  they propose also  to simply  raise the income tax rate at the far end of the  scale to 33 percent. Since they love to tax,  this fits exactly with their philosophy and the  populists among them-almost all of them are having a field day representing their pro posal as one to protect middle-income Ameri cans and make the wealthy pay.  I suggest that whenever you raise the tax  rates, we all pay.  If you want to encourage  savings and investment you lower the tax rate,  not raise it. But more than this, the Democrats  represent that their tax rate increase is merely  carrying out  the original  intent of  the Tax  Reform Act of 1986 and correcting an anoma ly in the reform provisions that caused the top  tax rate of 33 percent to reduce for the far  end of the scale to 28 percent after a certain  level of income was reached ($200,000).  No, Democrats, this is wrong. There was no  anomoly. There was an agreement to provide  equity to those at the far end who, under the  reform provisions, were losing almost all de ductions in order to achieve the lower rate.  I believe that the proposal to lower capital  gains taxes is an economically sound one. In  honesty, however, I don't feel very comforta ble  finding  it  in  the  reconciliation package,  either. Obviously,  the members of the Ways  and Means Committee  fished around  for a  way to find revenue in the President's propos al in order to make the budget numbers come  out right. They found sufficient revenue if they  limited the lower capital gains rate to a short  2-year period, but after that the economists  predicted a net revenue  loss. So Ways and  Means  limited  the  lower rate  to  the  first 2  years to gain the revenue and make the num bers look good. Can't Congress ever do any thing because it's the right policy rather than  because it makes the numbers look artificially  good?  Still, the remainder of the proposal to index  capital  gains  to  inflation  after  the  2-year  period  is so equitable, so compelling as tax  policy,  that  this provision, even though sup ported  by  some Members  for  the wrong  reason, deserves the support of the House.  I'm completely amazed at how weak  the  Democrats are as an opposition party. I used  to believe that they were simply cowed by the  great communicator, President Reagan. But  it's clear that they're no better under George  Bush and that the problem isn't so much the  Republican  leader as  it  is a bankruptcy of  ideas and political philosophy on  the other  side of the aisle. Most of the Democrats have  their hearts and minds locked in the Great De pression and sound economic thinking has to tally passed them by. I wonder when someone  in their party will figure this out. Until then, lis tening to them on the House floor is a case of  deja vu, a dream from days past, with ideas  then and never will work,  which didn't work  locked in time.  Mr.  ",1989
1097,446,16,Mr.  JENKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. ANDREWS].  ANDREWS. Mr.  Chairman,  competition: That's what this issue is  about. This debate  should not  be  snarled  in  partisan  politics-Demo crats and Republicans have champi oned capital gains treatment for over a  quarter of a century. President John  F. Kennedy said:  The tax on capital gains directly affects  investment decisions, the mobility and flow  of risk capital from static to more dynamic  situations, the ease of difficulty experienced  by new ventures in obtaining capital, and  thereby  the  strength  and  potential  for  growth in the economy.  How well America competes today in  an international marketplace will de termine our standard of living for the  next generation. Lower capital gains  rates will make America more competi tive in the very industries and technol ogies where we must win.  The cost of investing in new equip ment is higher in the United States  than anywhere else in the industrial  world. There is a penalty for invest ment in the United States. In Japan,  the cost of business invesment is twice  as low as in the United States. Or in  the United Kingdom, where the cost  of new investment is 3.56 percent, or  West Germany where the cost of in vestment is 4.39 percent. Many of our  competitors-Belgium,  Italy,  The  Netherlands, Hong Kong,  Taiwan,  South Korea, and Singapore-do not  tax capital gains at all. And our other  competitors-such as Japan, Canada,  France, and Sweden-tax capital gains  at a much  lower  rate  than  in  the  United States. The link between cost  of new investment and capital gains  taxes is clear: A recent study shows  that a permanent  reduction of  the  capital gains rate to 15 percent would  lower the cost of capital by 14 percent.  Let's look at our savings rate. Our  national savings rate  is much lower  than those of our competitors. United  States savings averaged only 5.3 per cent, compared to 10.3 percent in West  Germany, 18.6 percent in Japan, 9.4  percent in Canada, and 9 percent in  France.  IRA's can facilitate savings,  but lower capital gains will reduce the  tax on savings,  thus raising our na tional savings rate. IRA's do not have  a direct  impact on the cost of new  business equipment. A capital gains  tax rate will have a greater positive  effect on investment and the economy.  Some have suggested that a capital  gains rate is unfair because a dispro portionate share of the benefit would  go to the rich. Yet the opponents fail  to mention that their statistics are not  based upon earned income, but rather  their  numbers  include  the  capital  gains income itself. So that a farmer  who earns $40,000 a year and who sells  his farm at a profit of $60,000 is con sidered  to have earned $100,000  for  that year. The opponents also ignore  the fact that a greater number of tax payers  benefiting  from  the  capital  gains  reduction  are  not  rich-but  middle class. Three-fourths of all tax  returns with capital gains were report ed by  taxpayers whose  incomes are  under $50,000.  The elderly especially benefit from  capital gains. While the elderly repre sent only 11 percent of all tax returns,  they represent 26 percent of all tax re turns reporting capital gains.  The family who owns some stock or  real estate and who sells  this asset  when their children go to college, or  for their retirement, want to make the  most of their investment. This issue is  clearly not a Republican or Democrat ic idea. It is an idea that makes sense  for all Americans.  0 1000  ",1989

Today we  have a choice that is very simple. We  can  extend  IRA's  for  individuals.  Eighty-four percent who make more  than $50,000 benefit. Reduce the cap.  ital gains tax, 75 percent making less  than $50,000 benefit. It is that simple.  High capital gains are a penalty on  middle-class savings and investments.  ",1989

But it must  be permanent and it must be paid for.  And the Bush-Jenkins proposal before  us fails on both counts.  It is ridiculous for us to cut capital  gains tax rates for 2 years, which will  do nothing but stimulate  a  lot of  churning on Wall Street while at the  same time compounding and worsen ing the deficit problem over the long  term.  This proposal will increase the defi cit, it is going to increase interest rates  in this country, it is going to reduce  the national savings rate and, to add  insult to injury, the big winners, ladies  and gentlemen, are going  to be the  quick-buck artists on Wall Street who  are making millions  today  through  leveraged buyouts and all the merger  mania that is going on in New York.  In closing,  like all  tax cuts, Mr.  Chairman, it is easy to vote for the  Bush-Jenkins proposal; it is a tax cut.  It is bad fiscal policy, bad tax policy,  and ladies and gentlemen, it should be  defeated.  ",1989

I  spent  the  last week  agonizing  about the choices offered here, and  was undecided until  last night. But  after  researching both proposals,  I  reached some conclusions.  I am philosophically in favor of a  differential in rates, but the Bush plan  is  simply  the wrong scheme at the  wrong time.  We have got to start looking at the  next decade and the next century in stead of the next election. The fact is  that the Bush capital gains plan will  have  a  devastating  effect  on  the  budget deficit in 1993 and 1994. Over a  10-year period, it will have a $21 bil lion shortfall.  The Rostenkowski-Gephardt amend ment will not only help families pur chase a  first home or send a child  through college, but according to the  Joint Committee on Taxation, it will  also earmark over $25 billion for the  deficit reduction trust fund.  Accordingly, I'm casting my vote for  this amendment and I have no reser vations about  the political or fiscal  consequences.  ",1989

1105,459,16,Mr. RITTER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of Jenkins-Archer and echo the  comments of NEAL SMITH of Iowa, who  said the indexing provisions in this bill  alone are  important enough for  the  Democrats as well as Republicans to  support the measure.  Mr. Chairman, make no mistake about it, my  colleagues, capital gains  tax  reduction  is a  winner for America. It provides seed corn for  our  jobs and  for our  future. Right now,  the  United States has the highest capital gain tax  in  the  industrialized world and we've been  beaten to the punch too often by foreign com petition.  Senior citizens, small business people, aver age  citizens  selling assets-a business, a  farm, a property-whose increase in value is  packed with inflationary gains will benefit from  the capital gains indexing in Jenkins-Archer.  talk  doesn't  leadership  The Democratic leadership just doesn't real ize how many middle-class Americans benefit  from capital gains and thus would benefit from  this reduction.  The Democratic  about that.  Instead,  they challenge  the President and  many of their own hardworking, knowledgea ble Members with a jerry-rigged,  last-minute  appeal for class warfare. They don't talk about  how capital gains revenue to the Government  increased when rates have been reduced  in  the past.  They talk competitiveness, but won't reduce  the cost of capital.  They rail against Japanese R&D  intensive  industries and the inroads they've made into  our markets, but back down when something  could be done about it.  On  the other hand,  I understand some of  their other reservations.  I believe we could have crafted a better  capital gains  tax  reduction-more  like  the  President's original idea for a 15-percent rate  or more  like what Treasury Secretary Brady  has been talking about to spur longer term in vestment.  But the political process is not always so  easy and compromise comes  into play. We  are, in this case, hamstrung by static econom ic models being used  for Gramm-Rudman  number crunching where the numbers them selves are often far from real. We are forced  not to recognize the growth-creating, revenue increasing  stimuli  that  all  previous  capital  gains reductions have provided.  Nevertheless, Jenkins-Archer  is a step  in  the right direction. It has the exceedingly im portant feature of indexing capital gains for in flation and making  long-term investment that  much more attractive to the American people.  As the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITH], a  Democrat, stated,  it's fair because it doesn't  force people to pay excessive taxes on gains  which are the result of inflation. He implored  his colleagues to do what's right and support  the capital gains measure.  Indexing capital gains for inflation, I say to  my colleagues on the Democratic side of the  aisle, is, in and of itself, solid, substantive ra tionale for supporting Jenkins-Archer.  Finally, many in this House believe as I do  that America needs to  look to the long term  rather than the next quarterly report. America  has too  long underinvested in the plant and  equipment,  research and development, and  the technologies of the future which  lead to  better jobs, higher living standards, and an en hanced quality of life. Jenkins-Archer should  be viewed as an  initial step  in enhancing  longer term thinking about our economy. It's a  foot in the proverbial door of a rational, longer  term savings and investment tax policy.  ",1989

1108,472,16,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in full sup port of the Rostenkowski amendment to H.R.  3299. The choice between  IRA and capital  gains  tax reduction as vehicles  for boosting  our economy comes down to two questions.  Do we want prosperity to trickle down  from  our wealthiest citizens, or do we want Ameri ca's financial strength to surge upward, em powering every family?  Do we want to encourage a short-term fi nancial fire sale which will enrich a few with a  shower of dollars, or to enhance the ability of  every American  to gain  the  true  long-term  benefits of a college education, a home, and  a stable, dignified retirement?  On  these simple  issues on national policy  IRA's are clearly preferable  to reducing  the  capital gains tax.  A capital gains rate  reduction would also  undermine the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and  our  long-term commitment  to  reducing  the  budget deficit.  In  light of that deficit any new tax prefer ence must be scrutinized  for  its  impact on  Federal  revenues,  its economic effect, and  most importantly, for whether it meets the test  of treating all of our taxpayers with basic fairness, regardless of their incomes. The capital  gains tax rate cut fails all three tests.  First,  it claims  to raise $9.4 billion  in  the  next 2 years to aid us in reducing the deficit.  What we're not told,  is that over a 5-year  period, the Treasury would lose revenues esti mated at $2 to $25 billion, which would con tribute  to  increasing  the Federal deficit, not  solving it.  .  Second, a temporary rate cut for currently  held assets actually reduces savings and  in vestment in  the short run, since realizations  will result in consumption of some portion of  the gain. We must encourage savings but not  at the expense of eroding the hard-won 1986  Tax Reform Act that cut tax rates in return for  reducing  tax deductions and elimination of  loopholes.  Third, over 80 percent of the benefits of the  capital gains rate cut will go to the individuals  with incomes in excess of $1 00,000. Such a  windfall fails the test of basic tax fairness.  Unlike the capital gains cut, the Rostenkow ski amendment reduces the deficit in the short  and  long term, a total of $2.5 billion over 5  years. This  is achieved by restoring  the 50percent deductions  for  individual  retirement  accounts and eliminating the current ""bubble""  tax rate structure which, in tum, provides relief  to the middle-class, not just the rich.  Mr. Chairman this vote is a clear choice be tween enriching individuals and enriching our  Nation and its. future.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Rosten kowski amendment.  ",1989
1109,472,16,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Chairman, we  have  some important issues facing this Nation, and  this Congress. People want us to reduce the  appalling national debt-and rightly so. People  in Maine, and, I think, around the Nation, want  us to clean up our environment. People are  willing to spend more on education, because  they know how critical a good education is to  our children and to our future. People want us  to fight a real war, not a phony slogan war,  against drugs. They want us to work on pro viding affordable health care, and affordable  housing.  But when we try to come up with aggres sive, meaningful  plans  to  address  these  issues, we run  into a red  light. Where is the  money? Congress is almost paralyzed by the  national debt and by the artificial, short-term  limits of  t!'le Gramm-Rudman Act, which  is  prompting short-term solutions that make no  long-term sense, that in fact cost the taxpay ers extra money in the long run.  So what do we do? We vote  today on a  plan to give a special  tax break to the very  wealthy. President Bush's own Office of Man agement and Budget admits that this will cost  the U.S. Government money after a brief, 2or 3-year windfall. It will increase the deficit. It  will do nothing  to address  the  felt human  needs, the serious problems facing ths coun try.  In fact,  if you were to ask average Ameri cans what Congress should be doing, I don't  think that giving a tax break to the very rich  would even show up on the list.  Eighty percent of the benefit of this capital  gains tax cut would go to people making over  $100,000 a year. Sixty percent would go to  those making over $200,000-less than 1 per cent of the people in this country. Only 8 percent of the benefit would go to people making  less  than $50,000. As  the Washington Post  said today, this legislation is the equivalent of  giving a $25,000 grant to the 375,000 richest  families in the Nation.  Mr. Chairman, I know a lot of families who  could use a $25,000 grant. None of  them  makes over $100,000 a year. For most of  them, $25,000 would be more than they would  see after a full year of hard work, day in and  day out. But for some reason, the proponents  of this tax break think that the U.S. Govern ment should be  in  the business of giving a  break  to  the  rich. Somehow,  it will  trickle  down to the rest of us, they seem to say. I do  not believe it.  President Bush wrote a letter. I think some  of my colleagues may have received one, too.  He said that this legislation ""will ensure con tinued economic prosperity and provide pow erful incentives for investment and jobs."" But  how can this be true, when the special break  is scheduled to end 21J2 years? Are we inter ested in creating businesses and jobs that will  be quickly sold off, and  lost, before the tax  break ends in two years? Or is this, pure and  simple, a quick fix to encourage people to sell  their investments quickly, right now, so we get  some cash  in the U.S. Treasury to meet the  Gramm-Rudman target and avoid raising taxes  this year? Why should we worry about 2 years  from now? Why should we worry about the in credible, growing debt we are passing on to  our children? Just as  the administration  is  adding to the true deficit, while trying to hid it,  by putting the huge savings and  loan bailout  off budget,  it is now adding to the long-term  deficit for  the sake of a short-term gimmick  that will benefit the very richest Americans, at  the expense of the average taxpayer.  If this bill were designed to help average,  middle class Americans who had worked hard  to make  long-term  investments,  it would be  worthy of serious consideration. But we were  not given the opportunity to vote on a propos al designed with  those people  in mind. The  proposal before us does not differentiate be tween an  individual  in a nursing home who  must sell his lifelong home to pay for his care,  and a Donald Trump or Malcolm Forbes.  There  is a serious  issue of fairness here.  This administration vetoed an increase in the  minimum wage  for  the working poor. But  it  can hardly control its eagerness for a break  for the very rich. It isn't the rich who need our  help,  its  the poor,  and  the middle  class.  Wealthy Americans got a break in  the 1986  tax law changes. The tax rates for the wealthy  were  lowered drastically.  In return, many tax  loopholes and breaks, such as  the capital  gains  tax break, were eliminated. Now Con gress may act to give the rich back their tax  break, too.  I cannot support this capital gains tax break,  and  I sincerely hope my colleagues will not  support it either.  ",1989

The second observation that I would  make is this: To associate newsletters  that give us the opportunity to direct ly communicate, to keep the American  people knowledgeable about what it is  we do on a daily basis here, and the  military budget is a flight into fantasy.  If we want to help babies born ad dicted to cocaine, then why do we not  cut the B-2 bomber program where  each plane will cost us in excess of  $600 million per copy,  a  ludicrous  notion at best. a plane that looks like  a Batmobile, that serves no useful pur pose, and has no useful function in de fending the United States or bringing  us major security?  What we have done, Mr. Speaker,  members of the committee, is to deny  ourselves significant concern.  I came here from  the civil  rights  movement in the 1960's, to Congress in  1971, because people said to bring my  concerns. to bring my pain to the floor  of Congress, operate within the frame work of the political system.  I am here to do it. So now you are  denying me the opportunity to com municate effectively with my constitu ency. That is bizarre in the extreme.  This is a precious responsibility we  have, a precious gift that we have been  given. and that is to represent our con stituency faithfully.  I choose not to want to keep them in  ignorance. They have a right to know  what it is we do and have a right to  I  thank  know what we  do  faithfully. They  should not have to go to the press who  are financed by commercials,  to the  television,  financed by corporations.  Public money in a democratic society  to communicate with our constituen cy; we should not deny ourselves this  precious right, and that is to commu nicate with our people, and the Ameri can people do support that.

1122,498,16,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  a notable lack of enthusiasm that I  rise to discuss this conference report.  We have achieved a partial victory,  which  is  somewhat akin  to kissing  your sister. Postal patron mailings will  be cut from a limit of six per year to  three, effective January 1, 1990. The  official mail  costs  appropriation  is  nearly $9 million below  the House  amount. And the strengthened 60-day  rule for mailing newsletters before an  election has been retained in essential ly  the  same  form  as  the Thomas  amendment adopted by the House.  Also,  there  is watered-down  lan guage in here designed to bring some  restraint on mailings when appropria tions are running out. Under this pro vision,  the Postmaster General is  to  alert Congress after the second quar ter of the year, if it looks like we are  overspending  the  appropriation  for  mail. The respective committees in the  House and Senate are to consider reg ulations to assure that the amounts  available are not exceeded. We shall  see what that means when it happens.  This is all well and good, but what  happened to the Wilson amendment?  You remember that one. It prohibited  any postal patron mailings, both news letters and town meeting notices, and  it provided $45 million of the savings  from such mailings for treatment and  prevention of crack babies. You also  remember that 245 of you voted for  my motion to instruct the conferees to  agree  to  the Wilson  amendment,  which earlier had been adopted by the  Senate by a vote of 83 to 8.  So what happened to it? Not 2 hours  after the House vote,  the conferees  dumped it. Dumped it.  I tried to save it. I even offered an  alternative amendment. After all, that  is what conferences are all about compromise. I offered an amendment  which would have applied the Wilson  amendment only to the Senate. Since  they had voted 83  to 8 to eliminate  their newsletters and spend the money  on the war on drugs, I thought they  would jump at the chance I was giving  them. They could have applied the $21  million in savings to crack babies.  But  they didn't bite. They didn't  even nibble. They laughed. Can you  believe  that? They  laughed at  the  thought of applying their own amend ment to themselves. I'm disillusioned.  And  it wasn't  just  the Wilson  amendment they backed away from.  Except for the ranking Senate Repub lican conferee.  they didn't utter a  word when the proposed compromise  dropped Senate provisions calling for  mail-cost  allocations  to  individual  Members and Senators. It dropped in dividual disclosures  in  the CoNGREs SIONAL RECORD of what Members and  Senators are spending on mail. It even  dropped the requirement that newslet ters carry the legend, ""Prepared, Pub lished, and Mailed at Taxpayer Ex pense"" on the cover page.  No protest was heard when  those  provisions were dropped. Can you be lieve that?  Mr. Speaker,  I  have been around  here long enough to know that half a  loaf is half a loaf. What you see here  is what you get. It's a start. For the  first  time, some reasonable restraint  will be placed on postal patron mail ings. Some restraint will be placed on  overspending our mail-cost appropria tion. And some restraint will be placed  on the practice of winking at the 60day rule on mailings prior to elections.  Furthermore,  this half  a  loaf  is  probably all the campaign reform this  Congress is going to get. Here it is, Mr.  Speaker, campaign reform 1989. Is the  system broken? Don't worry. We'll fix  it. And here's the fix. Three newslet ters instead of six.  We can build on this start in the  coming years. We can depend on the  leadership and wisdom of the chair man and ranking member of the sub committee, my good friends VIc FAZIO  and JERRY LEwis. They will lead us to  responsibility.  I am not going to tell anyone else  how to vote, but I cannot in good con science support the conference report.  A majority of the conferees totally ig nored the House and Senate votes on  the Wilson amendment. I think we can  do better.  0 1420  ",1989

Hugo caused unprecedented devasta tion to the islands in its path and the  coastal and inland areas of South and  North Carolina. As the storm moved  ashore  it  brought with  it  several  inches of rain and winds in excess of  100 miles per hour. As  the  storm  moved north over land during the day  it dropped several more inches of rain  from Charleston to central Pennsylva nia and New York State,  including  over my State of West Virginia.  Mr.  President,  the  amendment  which I will offer on behalf of myself,  Mr.  HATFIELD, Mr.  HOLLINGS, Mr.  THURMOND, Mr.  SANFORD,  and Mr.  HELMS will continue the direct Federal  presence in the region of greatest dev astation.  It provides $1.1  billion  to  help clear debris, restore power, and  protect public safety.  These funds are to be scored as man datory under  the bipartisan budget  agreement and therefore neither the  budget authority nor the outlays will  be scored against the VA-HUD and In dependent Agencies  Subcommittee's  302(B) allocations.

1152,550,16,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President,  I  would  like  to say one word on  the  matter of the reason for the continu ing resolution. I  think it ought to be  clearly understood that at this date  the Senate Appropriations Committee  has responded, acted upon, and report ed every one of  the appropriations  bills to the floor. We have three to  complete with floor action. There are  those that have been sent to confer ence. There is one on the President's  desk.  I  should  like  to make a point of  record on behalf of our committee,  and certainly commend the chairman  at the same time I make this point,  that the Senate Appropriations Com mittee and the House Appropriations  Committee have  certainly  acted  in  good time to try to avoid this continu ing resolution. I think it ought to be  pointed out that an ordinary problem  of the drugs and that issue that super seded procedures and dates and all cer tainly is the reason, legitimate reason,  for us having this particular continu ing resolution  I join, as the Senator from West Vir ginia has indicated, in support of this  one amendment relating to the disas ter of Hugo in the Carolinas. I think it  is straightforward, effective, October  25,  no hidden agendas or anything  else. It is a very straightforward for mula, a classic extension of the fiscal  year time in order to keep the Govern ment running. I support the amend ment.  ",1989

Mr. President, my remaining time I  yield  to  the  distinguished Senator  from South Carolina [Mr. HoLLINGS].  ",1989
1154,550,16,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  thank  our  distinguished  chairman,  Senator BYRD,  for his leadership, as  well  as our majority  and minority  leaders.

I  also  thank  the distinguished  chairman of our Budget Committee,  Senator SASSER, and the extraordinari ly capable efforts of the outstanding  Senator from Maryland [Ms. MIKUL SKI].  In this amendment, we are providing  under the Budget Act for mandatory  expenditures outside of the 302(b) al location. Let me emphasize that this is  not only for the Carolinas; it is also  for Puerto Rico and  the Virgin  Is lands. Everyone should grasp the mag nitude of the blow inflicted by Hugo.  At Charleston Air Base they clocked  winds of 166 miles an hour. The hurri cane hit at high tide. It threw up a 20foot surge of water, which not only  covered totally the Barrier Islands but  back miles behind by the Inland Wa terway, wiped away houses in McClel lanville and Awendaw  It has now left 40,000 people with  homes uninhabitable or  totally de stroyed. It has severed electric power  and communication 'lines. In the af fected counties, 36 percent of trees are  on  the ground. Seventy percent of  trees in the national forests are down.  One-third of  the highway system  is  damaged. Crop  losses stand at $100  million, and that number will rise.  Yet, amidst this wreckage and ruin,  the word generosity has taken on new  meaning.

1156,563,16,Mr. WARNER.," Once again, I will en deavor to invite my distinguished col league,  the chairman of  the Armed  Services Committee, to join me on the  floor and lay before the Senate our  perspectives on the direction in which  the conference between the House and  the Senate on the authorization bill is  now taking and how this decision on  SDI is progressing.  Once again, to refresh the recollec tion of our  colleagues,  the Senate  Armed Services Committee reached a  figure of $4.3 billion; the House Armed  Services Committee $2.8 billion;  the  House Appropriations Committee co incidentally,  came  in  at  the  same  figure, $2.8 billion, and, of course, the  Senate Appropriations Committee at  $3.7 billion.  The difficulty we are having in our  conference is that the focus of atten tion is not on the figures arrived at by  the authorization committees but the  figures as arrived at by the Appropria tions Committees thereby leaving us  with what I regard as an untenable po sition in terms of our conference.  At this point, I would like to invite  the  attention  of my  distinguished  chairman to provide me with his views  because, as I said, this decision is going  to control the outcome  in many re spects of the conference we are now in  on the authorization bill.  There has been considerable discus sion respecting the issue raised by the  Senator from Louisiana; namely, the  advisability of earmarking certain per centages of these funds for a category  which he feels very strongly about,  and that to me is the subsidiary issue  which possibly could be resolved if we  could get support for  increasing the  dollar value of the figure we are work ing on in the conference between the  House and Senate on the Armed Serv ices Committees.  Mr. President, it appears to this Sen ator that more time is needed for pri vate consultation. Therefore, I suggest  the absence of a quorum.  ",1989

1162,563,16,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of  the pending amendment,  and the Senator from Virginia has ba sically  stated  the  case  accurately.  What we have here is a novel situa tion, and only in America, only in the  Senate, only in this kind of Govern ment can we reach these kind of di lemmas. Of course, this is the positive  side of our system, as well as some times the frustrating side.  What we have here are two different  sets of negotiations going on. We have  the Appropriations Committee  that  has reported out this bill that we have  before us in the Senate. We have the  House appropriations bill that has al ready passed, a bill that is waiting to  go  to conference, and in addition to  that set of negotiations, which will  soon take place-hopefully the Sena tor from Hawaii will be able to get this  bill  passed  today  or  tomorrow-we  have the House and Senate authoriza tion committees that are in conference  and have been in conference for sever al weeks.  We are here on the same things. We  are here in our conference, and we just  met a few minutes ago; we met yester day and we met over and over again.  We are  trying to solve  the strategic  issues,  strategic programs. That  in cludes  the  two missiles,  the Midget man and the MX rail mobile, and the  B-2 and the strategic defense  initia tive.  I believe that the Senator from Lou isiana has made a number of valid  points about SDI. I am not a cheer leader for SDI, and I never have been.  I have always voted to cut some of the  program from the administration's re quest, but I also felt it was a valuable  resource program,  and  I  have  also  felt-and we have never succeeded in  this, and I hope that the options are  still open-that the way that the ad ministration really should look at this  program is not only as a long-term re search program, but a buffer against  the Soviet breakout in this area. And  they are doing their own research.  I have always hoped that we would  get some people over in the Pentagon  and SDI and in the White House, to  take a look at a system that would not  be a defense against a massive attack,  but a defense against a lesser attack,  whether by accident or by some form  of unauthorized launch.  It seems to me that is the kind of  system that really would be stabiliz ing. That is an argument for another  day.

1164,589,16,Mr. DANFORTH.," I would only say  to the Senator from Arizona that the  amendment that will be offered by the  Senator  from Missouri does not do  what the Senator describes. In other  words,  the  spousal  impoverishment  provisions,  the Medicaid  provisions,  would  be maintained  similarly  for  those benefits that have already gone  into  effect. The  repeal would  not  occur until January 1, 1991. So that  people who are now  receiving  those  benefits would  continue  to  receive  them.  The  repeal,  the  immediate  repeal,  would be  for  those provisions  that  have not yet gone into effect, such as  the drug benefit and such as the part  B  benefit;  and  the provisions  that  have already gone into effect, includ ing the hospitals and the skilled nurs ing homes, would be repealed effective  January 1, 1991.  Mr. McCAIN. Let me  say  to my  friend, he and I are not as far apart as  perhaps some may believe. I again, as  we have discussed in the past, ask him  to give consideration to the proposal  and the amendment that I am making  which  basically  retains  core  cata strophic benefits, long-term hospitali zation protection, spousal impoverish ment, Medicaid buy-in  the pregnant  mothers and infants programs, retains  skilled nursing facility benefits, with  modifications of  reimposing a 3-day  prior hospitalization  rule,  increasing  the number of copayment days from 8  to 30,  retains  the blood deductible,  home health, respite, mammography  screening, the so-called Mitchell drugs  and hospice  in return for  repeal of  outpatient prescription drug programs  beyond  the Mitchell drugs, and the  part Bout-of-pocket program.  I would suggest to my friend from  Missouri that being able to retain all  of  those benefits with simply $4.80  that seniors are now paying is a viable  option that I hope most of my col leagues will consider at the time I pro pose this amendment.  Also, let me point out to my friend  from Missouri that we can pay for this  proposal, as I said, not only by the  $4.80 per month, but also we will have  an increasing cushion of moneys paid  for by the flat premium in the years  ahead that will accommodate for ex pansion in costs of the program.  I would like to point out that under  the present program the costs have  risen from an initial estimate of some  $31 billion to $45 billion just in the in tervening year  since  the  legislation  was passed. And there is, of course, no  sign of any reduction.  Let me also again  talk about  the  issue of addressing  the deficit prob lem. The administration, I understand,  is not only opposed, has been opposed,  and will continue to oppose repeal or  even dramatic revision of this program  not because they do not recognize it is  a bad piece of legislation, not because  they cannot see the continuing cost es calations and misestimates on the part  of the committee when the proposal  was originally made, but because of  the fact it will impact the budget defi cit.  I say again, since when do we make  bad laws and support bad legislation  so that we can use the taxes that we  take from seniors which we tell them  are for their benefit and indeed turn  them into ways  to disguise  the real  size of the deficit?  Mr. President, recently the Director  of  the Office of Management  and  Budget has gotten some notoriety for  talking about now-nowism, how Ameri cans only seek gratification now and  are not concerned about the pain that  may be caused in the future because of  spending or other lack of savings and  other practices that seem to be preva lent in our society.  I have to say in response to the Di rector fo  the Office of Management  and Budget, there is no greater exam ple of now-nowism than to stick to a  bad policy that seniors do not want in  order to address the size of the budget  deficit for 1 year, and now that the  new estimates of the cost of the pro gram have been revealed, the follow ing year it will increase the size of the  deficit.  So I have to say to my friends at the  Office of Management and Budget the  worst example of now-nowism is to dis guise the budget deficit for 1 year and  defend a program that the overwhelm ing majority of  those affected by it   neither support nor want.  Let me point out again, Mr. Presi dent, 4 months ago when I brought up  this amendment the first time, no one,  not the Republican leadership, not the  Democratic leadership, not the admin istration, thought that there would be  any possibility of change. Now there is  a  total admission on the part of all  that there will be significant changes.  The  question  is what  are  those  ",1989
1165,602,16,Mr. COHEN., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,1989
1166,602,16,Mr. INOUYE., I will be very happy to  yield.  ,1989
1167,602,16,Mr. COHEN.," I pose a question to the  chairman of the Appropriations Com mittee. As  I  read  this amendment,  none of the funds appropriated under  this act may be used for the purposes  of supporting an end strength level of  September 30, 1990. I do not see any thing  in this particular amendment,  either the underlying amendment or  the perfecting amendment, that says  these troops will be inactivated. Does  the Senator from Hawaii have a differ ent understanding?  ",1989
1168,602,16,Mr. INOUYE., I would assume that  these troops would be shipped back to  the United States together with their  dependents.  ,1989
1169,602,16,Mr. COHEN., And  duty.  ,1989
1170,602,16,Mr.  INOUYE.," And  left on active  duty. If that is the case, it would mean  at least an additional cost of $120 mil lion to transport wives and children  and the soldiers back to the United  States. Then you add to this housing.  Assuming that the best we can provide  for our troops would be barracks, it  will still cost in excess of $50 million to  provide  this barracks housing. Then  the other matter such as hospitals,  clinics,  other personnel  to  support  this, and all this to be done in 4 days  unless the intention is to discharge the  troops in Europe and just leave them  there with  their wives and children  and tell them you find your way back  at your own cost.  ",1989
1171,602,16,Mr. COHEN.," So as  I  understand  what the chairman is saying, this is to  left on  active  fire 30,000  troops and leave them in  Europe or else,  inccur an additional  $120 million  in responsibility  in the  next 4 days?  ",1989
1172,602,16,Mr.  INOUYE.,  I would estimate  it  would cost at least a quarter of a bil lion dollars.  ,1989
1173,602,16,Mr. COHEN.," If the the chairman  will yield further, there are two things  that  trouble me about  the amend ment. No. 1, it is held out saying that  we are going to save $1 billion by this  amendment, which in fact it will not  do unless we are talking about inacti vation of the troops. No. 2, it suggests  that that $1 billion is all going to be  achieved in 1 year. According to what  I have heard on the Senate floor this  evening,  it is going  to  take at least  over a 5-year period of time in order to  achieve  the  so-called  reductions  in  spending.  Yet, according  to  this amendment  they take it all out in 1 year. Assuming  the figures were even accurate which  they are not they take $1 billion out in  a very first year of savings that do not  exist. So it seems to me it fails on two  accounts. No. 1, it does not accurately  reflect the situation that the troops  would be deactivated, or inactivated is  the proper term, and, No.2, it assumes  a billion-dollar savings in 1 year be cause this amendment would transfer  $1 billion out and to the educational  budget in a 1-year period of time. Is  that not the case?  ",1989
1174,602,16,Mr.  INOUYE., The Senator is cor rect.  ,1989
1175,602,16,Mr. METZENBAUM., Will the Senator from Maine yield for a question?  ,1989
1176,602,16,Mr. COHEN., I do not have the floor.  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.  ,1989
1177,602,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Hawaii.  ,1989
1178,602,16,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr. President,  the  debate we  are  engaged  in  at  this  moment  is a very  important one.  I  regret very much that there are only  five of us here because it affects the  defense of  the United States. Much  has been said this afternoon about we  defending Europeans,  that we  are  sending our men and women overseas  to defend Germans, French, Italians,  and British. Mr. President, we are in  Europe  to defend ourselves. We are  not  in Europe because we want  to  defend  the Swedes and  the Norwe gians. We are in there because of our  national welfare and our national in terest. Imagine if we decided that at  the end of World War II to say to our selves we won the war, now let us all  go home. Let the Europeans who have  been devastated fend for  themselves.  Imagine how long after that we would  have had a Sovietized Europe. Imagine  if we had followed our beloved leader,  Mike Mansfield, and began withdraw ing our forces 15 years ago at a time of  Krushchev and Brezhnev. You did not  have a Gorbachev at that time. They  had no  intentions  to  reduce  their  forces.  We are there to make certain that  the Europeans remain strong to check  the Warsaw Pact nations and to keep  the Soviets in check.  Speaking of costs,  I  believe most  every Member in debating this issue  would suggest that we are spending  approximately $30 billion in Europe.  That is $120 per citizen in the United  States. That is 10 percent of what we  are considering at this moment. It is  not $1,200 as suggested by some. Keep  in mind that the cost the Europeans  are bearing for the defense of their  nations are all in Europe.  I do not suppose  that the  troops  that we have deployed in the Philip pines are part of the European defense  or troops in Okinawa are for the Euro pean defense. Our taxpayers pay heav ily, yes; $120 per person. But as I said,  we are there to defend ourselves.  In the past several months we have  experienced much  euphoria  in  the  United States. The statements of Mik hail Gorbachev have excited all of us.  He has made stunning announcements  of reducing Warsaw Pact troops and  Soviet troops by large numbers. But,  Mr. President,  as of  this moment,  Warsaw  Pact  nations  have  52,000  tanks. We have, that is NATO, 22,000.  Warsaw Pact nations at this moment  have in place, ready to fire, 43,400 ar tillery pieces. On the other side of the  border, NATO, that is  including the  United States,  has  17,300  artillery  pieces;  17,000  against 43,000,  52,000  against 22,000 tanks.  Warsaw Pact has 55,100  armored  troop carriers. They are very mobile.  We have 28,000. This is after Gorba chev's reductions.  That  is why  the President of the  United States  is presently  together  with our allies in NATO engaged in  negotiations on a conventional force  reduction in Europe. That is on our  President's agenda. If he were to uni laterally, as proposed by this amend ment, cut our troops we would be un dercutting the President of the United  States and our allies in the midst of  this negotiation. Yes,  the President  has indicated that he would be willing  to reduce U.S. soldiers and sailors in  Europe by 30,000 but under a negotiat ed and verifiable agreement between  NATO and the Warsaw Pact. That is a  big difference. If we are to reduce our  forces by 30,000,  then  they should  reduce their tanks by more than what  they have now.  So, Mr. President, the issue before  us  is not  that simple. As my dear  friend  from Maine has pointed out,  much as I applaud Senator CoNRAD for  his desire to add  to our educational  funds, my amendment together with  that of the amendment of my dear  friend from Ohio will not bring about  any savings. It costs $4,000 per service  person now and dependents to be just  shipped back to the United States",1989
1179,615,16,Mr. FORD.," Then that means it is  just a delay and not elimination of the  catastrophic illness health insurance?  Mr. McCAIN. No. The amendment  as it was very briefly described in a  preserving of many of the benefits in cluding  catastrophic  hospitalization  and most others, repeal of prescription  drugs and some other parts of the bill  in order to eliminate the surtax, yet  maintain  the $4.80 part B payment  that is being kept now. I will be glad to  run through them.  ",1989
1180,615,16,Mr. FORD.," No, I do not want the  Senator to do that.  Mr. McCAIN. It is not delay,  it is  repeal of some portions, maintaining  of others.  ",1989
1181,615,16,Mr. FORD.," But it is basically the  amendment.  Mr. President,  still  reserving  the  right,  this bill can be amended  to  eliminate catastrophic, can it not.  ",1989
1182,615,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., It is  the understanding of the Chair that  the bill will be open for amendment.  ,1989
1183,615,16,Mr. BENTSEN.," Further let me com ment, as the Senator was explaining  the provisions of this bill, our informa tion from CBO is that it is approxi mately  billion  and we will  be  making a point of order on that.  ",1989

1187,615,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Maryland is recognized  for reservation and a point of order.  ,1989
1188,615,16,Mr. SARBANES.,  Is  it my under standing that part of the unanimous consent request is that this issue will  not be brought up on reconciliation  once  the  freestanding bill and any  amendments thereto are considered?  ,1989
1189,615,16,Mr. BENTSEN.," It is not my under standing. My understanding is that it  will not be brought up by the Senator  from Arizona. He cannot speak  for  other Members of the Senate, obvious ly; nor can I.  ",1989
1190,615,16,Mr. SARBANES.,  Is  it  the chair man's desire that that be included as  part of the request?  ,1989

Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.  ",1989

1200,615,16,Mr. DOLE.," Reserving the right to  object, I understand there is another  amendment that has been agreed to, a  Hatfield amendment for the Secretary  of Labor.  ",1989
1201,615,16,Mr. INOUYE., It has been agreed to.  ,1989

1212,615,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Colorado.  ,1989
1213,615,16,Mr. WIRTH.," Everybody in the body  should understand where we are. The  amendment offered by  the Senator  from North Carolina,  the  so-called  Mapplethorpe amendment, is an issue  that came onto the floor, Senators will  remember, in the dark of the night.  People really did not know what was  happening  at  that  time,  and  the  amendment went through. Since then,  Members are aware of the extraordi nary storm that has arisen, not only  from the arts community but from all  of  those who  believe  in  the  first  amendment to the Constitution of the  United States. I need not remind my  colleagues of what the first amend ment says. What we have is a resolu tion in front of us that relates directly  to the first amendment. Senators to night have no opportunity to do any thing but vote up or down. There is no  place to go on this one, and it seems to  me that what we must do in all good  conscience as defenders of the Consti tution is to clearly vote no.  Now, I understand what is going to  transpire out of this is that our good  friends in the media on the negative  world are going to have a  field day  with this particular amendment. The  time has come for us  to make very  clear we understand that is going to go  on, we understand  that presumably  Senators  in the greatest deliberative  body in the world should not be allow ing ourselves to be diverted with this  kind of activity but,  rather, should  belly up and be serious about the de fense  of  the Constitution  of  the  United States.  Here we are  in the Senate, and I  have now been here for 2% years. I  will say that I have enormous respect  for  this  institution and  the way  in  which this institution respects minori ties, the way in which this institution  protects small States, and the whole  way in which this institution was set  up.  But it seems to me, Mr. President,  we are getting to the point where we  are being asked to cast a lot of votes,  make a  lot of alleged political state ments for the purpose of not what the  body was set up to do, but rather for a  variety of other reasons.  I understand and respect the right  of every individual in the Senate to be  ",1989
1214,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Would the Senator  be willing to cut it to an hour and half  then, so we can complete?  ",1989
1215,628,16,Mr. HELMS., No. I mean here we are  at 11:19.  We have family life. I do not have  much family with me up here but I do  have a granddaughter up here visiting  me. If the majority leader will make it  9 he will have himself a deal.  ,1989
1216,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL., I would say to the  Senator from North Carolina I have  tried very hard to do this in a manner  that is fair to everyone. I do not want  to  infringe upon his  time with his  granddaughter. But is it not possible?  The Senator does not have to be here  during the first half hour of debate.  Perhaps it would be persons that have  stated things that have otherwise been  said.  ,1989
1217,628,16,Mr. HELMS., Why must we start at  8:30?  ,1989
1218,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Because we hoped  to finish  this bill at 6 this evening.  What is sacrosanct is I tried to do it in  1 hour and it is the Senator who insist ed on doing it in 2 hours. We also have  the State, Justice, Commerce bill.  ",1989
1219,628,16,Mr. HELMS.,  I was  ready  to vote  when you were clustered with all your  colleagues at the well trying to find a  way to circumvent this amendment.  ,1989
1220,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL., The Senator is in correct in stating what my intention  was.  ,1989
1221,628,16,Mr. HELMS., I can hear. The House  did circumvent a vote on the amend ment when many Members of  the  House wanted to vote.  ,1989
1222,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," The Senator from  North Carolina knows a lot of things,  but  there  is one  thing he does not  know: What is  in my mind. He was  characterizing my intentions.  ",1989
1223,628,16,Mr. HELMS., I did not mean to imply  that I knew what was in the mind of  the Senator.  ,1989
1224,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Well, I hope we can  get this done in a way that will com plete action. We have already wasted not wasted, but used up a substantial  amount of time  just trying to move  this matter forward. I attempted to ac commodate  every  request by  every  Senator. It is just very difficult to do.  ",1989
1225,628,16,Mr. INOUYE.," If my leader will yield,  we have alredy gotten the unanimous  consent to go to a third reading and  final passage of this measure; with no  amendments thereafter.  That being the case, I would like to  advise the leadership that I would be  willing to sit here all night long and  finish this. I think most of us are here.  ",1989
1226,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Will  the Senator  agree then to have 3 hours with 1¥2  hours of it this evening and 1 ¥2 hours  tomorrow morning, and anybody can  say anything they want for as long as  they want,  including  the Senator?  Then those who wish  to remain for  that portion of the debate this evening  could do so. Those who wish to may  remain and participate in that portion  It  of the debate in the morning, can do  so. We have  already had a  couple  hours; 3 more hours is fair to every one. We will start at 9 and vote at  10:30.  ",1989
1227,628,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from South Carolina.  ,1989

1229,628,16,Mr. THURMOND.," President Bush is  going to South Carolina in the morn ing on the disaster matter, and I am  getting up at 4 and leaving at 5 o'clock  in the morning. I just am wondering if  these votes can be put off until say 11  o'clock or 11:30, or could you stack the  votes? Senator HoLLINGS  and  I  feel  compelled to go. You can understand.  ",1989
1230,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL., We certainly un derstand that.  ,1989
1231,628,16,Mr. THURMOND.," If you stack the  votes, I was hoping maybe we could do  that.  ",1989
1232,628,16,Mr. METZENBAUM., Let us vote to night.  ,1989
1233,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.,"  It  is  impossible  with so many conflicting demands to  accommodate everybody.  I apologize.  It is simply impossible. We have 100  Senators,  each of whom  insistently  insist  that  the  operations  of  the  Senate be conducted in a manner to  accommodate his or her schedule in terests.  is  understandable.  It  is  human  nature. The Senator  from  South Carolina has been among the  least.  ",1989
1234,628,16,Mr. THURMOND.," If it is going to go  beyond that, if it can be stacked. I do  not ask you to hold up and wait.  ",1989
1235,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL., We will do the best  we can.  ,1989
1236,628,16,Mr. HELMS.," If you will accede to  the distinguished Senator from South  Carolina, I will take the proposition of  an hour and a half tonight, and tomor row morning.  ",1989
1237,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Can I get consent  to go to the State, Justice, Commerce  bill as soon as we finish debate, so we  do not have 3 or 4 hours consumed by  this?  ",1989
1238,628,16,Mr. HELMS.,  I do not think I can  comment on that. That will be up to  our leader.  ,1989
1239,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," He has asked only  that the vote be stacked at a time in  the future. If we cannot go to State,  Justice, Commerce, then there is noth ing to stack. I wonder if the distin guished Republican leader is here.  ",1989
1240,628,16,Mr. HELMS., I will see if he is.  ,1989
1241,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," So we can go  to  that, and then stack the vote to ac commodate  the Senator from South  Carolina but permit us to proceed with  the other business.  ",1989
1242,628,16,Mr. DOLE.," Would that be the only  business we take up tomorrow, then?  ",1989
1243,628,16,Mr. MITCHELL., I do not know that.  I want to discuss that further with the  distinguished Republican leader.  ,1989
1244,628,16,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I would object to the first vote and the  second. We are willing to vote tonight  and vote first thing tomorrow morn ing. I would object to any hiatus ar rangement. Let us vote tonight.  ",1989

1260,680,16,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to introduce a resolution to des ignate November 11, 1989, ""Washing ton Centennial Day."" I am pleased to  be joined by my colleague and fellow  Washingtonian,  Senator  SLADE  GORTON.  Mr. President, 1989 marks the 100th  year of statehood for our home State  of Washington. On November 11, 1889,  at 3:09 p.m.,  the  first Governor of  Washington State, Elisha P. Ferry, re ceived a telegram from President Ben jamin Harrison announcing the desig nation of Washington as the 42d State  in the Union. A story in the Tacoma  Daily News the following day exempli fies  the pride and  joy  felt by  the  people of Washington State:  Occupying, as it does, the very richest sec tion of the whole country, with its wealth of  inland shores lined with timber enough to  supply the world, with its rich veins of valu able  ores, with  its valuable  agricultural  lands  and  its  unparalleled  scenery  for  beauty and grandeur, combined with its un equalled climate, it starts out on its life of  statehood with not only the eyes of this  land, but the whole world upon it.  In addition to the obvious resource  wealth of our State, we have been  blessed  by  a  population  that  has  always shown a tremendous ability to  overcome adversity and lend a hand to  fellow Washingtonians  in  times  of  need. We have celebrated all of these  treasures  throughout  the centennial  year with hundreds of festivals, exhib its and other special events that signi fy all that is Washington. These activi ties will remind the residents of Wash ington and people around the Nation  of our resources.  We will also recall the tremendous  economic and population growth of  the 1700's and 1800's. We often hear  the stories of fur  traders and gold seekers who came West seeking fame  and fortune. First came  the  rugged  travelers, then the brides, and finally,  whole  families, determined  to brave  the hardships of a new life. The com pletion of a railroad with the East in  1883 eventually brought many of the  luxuries and innovations of an advanc ing nation to the Northwest.  Since statehood in 1889, Washington  has witnessed  tremendous  growth.  Washington State has become a leader  in aviation, shipbuilding, trade, forest ry, agriculture, and energy resources.  The population has reached over 4.4  million. The Puget Sound area flour ishes as a gateway to the Pacific. East ern Washington consists of rich agri cultural land that has made our State  famous worldwide for its Washington  apples and many other crops.  At the same time we look upon the  past with pride, we must recognize we  have made a good start and use this  momentum to lay the groundwork for  future excellence. While Washington's  vibrant economy remains a source of  ",1989
1261,693,16,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to applaud  the distinguished  chairman of the Finance Committee,  Senator LLOYD BENTSEN, for offering a  proposal to expand the tax benefits  for  individual  retirement  accounts  [IRAJ. The chairman's IRA proposal  is an important step toward reducing  the Tax Code's bias against saving and  investment.  Regrettably, Senator BENTSEN views  IRA's as an alternative to the capital  gains tax cut proposal now pending in  the House of Representatives, claim ing  that we  cannot afford both of  these measures.  I believe that we should enact both  proposals. Expanding IRA's and cut ting the capital gains tax would attack  the most severe economic problem in  America-the Tax Code's multiple tax ation of income that is saved and in vested.  Generally speaking, funds for saving  and  investment  come  from  income  that has already been taxed at ordi nary income tax rates. This income is  taxed once again when the investment  produces income in the form of inter est, dividends or capital gains. The  result is that individuals are discour aged from saving for their retirement  and investing in America's competitive  future.  Instead,  income  is channeled  into current consumption which is free  of Federal income tax.  We can afford both a properly craft ed IRA and a capital gains tax cut.  Our distinguished colleague, Senator  WILLIAM ROTH has proposed an IRA  bill, S. 1256, the ""Save America Act of  1989."" This bill would actually raise  revenues in the early years after en actment, as opposed to the Bentsen  IRA plan, which would lose roughly $8  billion a year for the first 3 years.  The Roth IRA would allow tax bene fits at the time of withdrawal, instead  of the up-front tax deduction proposed  in the Bentsen plan. It raises revenue  by  taxing previously deductible IRA  contributions  if depositors chose  to  transfer the funds into the new IRA Plus account. The money saved in the  IRA-Plus and all interest earnings will  be tax free upon retirement. IRA-Plus  savers can also withdraw  funds  tax  free before retirement to buy a home,  pay for catastrophic illness, or cover  education costs. IRA-Plus offers a tax  credit for low-income taxpayers of up  to 25 percent of their contribution.  More importantly, the Roth propos al would actually provide greater bene fits to America's middle-income work ers than the Bentsen plan. According  to the Treasury Department, 84 per cent of  the  tax benefits under  the  Bentsen IRA plan would go to those  with  incomes of $50,000  and up.  I  highly recommend that my colleagues  read  the cogent article by Senator  ROTH in the September 27 Wall Street  Journal, which provides  further de tails on how his proposal would work.  I will ask that it be included in the  RECORD following my remarks.  Mr. President,  the combination of  the Roth IRA-Plus plan and the Bush Jenkins  capital gains  tax cut plan  would actually raise over $3 billion in  tax revenues a year for each of the  first 3 years. As savings and  invest ment rates rise, the expanding econo my will bring in a permanent stream  of rising tax revenues. Clearly, we can  afford both an expansion of IRA bene fits and a cut in the capital gains tax.  Mr. President, our  tax  system  is  holding our economy back. The multi ple layers of taxation on savings and  investment is robbing America of its  future economic potential. We must  solve this problem by enacting a reve nue-winning cut in the capital gains  tax-and expanding IRA's along  the  lines  proposed  by  Senator  RoTH.  These two proposals will result in a  flood of savings and investment which  in turn means more jobs, more finan cial security and a higher standard of  living for all Americans.  Again, I want to commend Senator  BENTSEN for supporting an expansion  in IRA's. I  look forward  to working  with him in crafting an affordable tax  plan  that combines both IRA's and  the capital gains  tax cut when  the  Senate  begins  consideration of  the  budget reconciliation package.  I ask that the article to which I re ferred be printed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  A BETTER PLAN THAN BENTSEN'S  <By Wiliam V. Roth>  Americans  need  the  Individual Retire ment Account. When Congress passed the  1986 Tax Reform Act that pulled the teeth  from  the effective IRA program,  then in  place, my office rang loud with phone calls  from angry Delawareans who had trusted  Congress's earlier  IRA  legislation. These  people were upset that a program which  had grown to represent a quarter of person al saving was being cut. They were upset  that Congress was attacking their nest egg,  stripping them of a good program that led  toward self-reliance.  CONGRESS'S MISTAKE  Congress has seen the consequence of the  mistake it made by cutting the program:  Annual contributions declined by almost $25  billion, a serious drop that adversely affects  our gross national product and America's  ability to compete in the global community.  The time has come to bring back the IRA.  To correct the mistake, in June I introduced  an expanded IRA, known as the IRA-Plus,  and earlier this month Senate Finance Com mittee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen <D., Texas>  also supported the expansion of IRAs. Both  plans represent significant steps toward re viving this important program.  However, the Bentsen plan is proposed as  an alternative to President Bush's capital  gains tax cuts, another measure needed to  encourage  investment  in America. To ex change one for another would be like trad ing the tires on a car for a tank of gas. Both  are needed if the machine is to work proper ly and progress is to be made. More impor tant, the IRA, if properly crafted, could be  combined with the capital gains tax cut, in stead of being a substitute for it. Handled  correctly, the IRA-Plus could actually raise  revenues in the early years after enactment,  a necessary and attractive feature  in this  time of deficits.  Where Sen. Bentsen's plan will cost the  federal government around $8 billion in its  first three years, my IRA-Plus should actu ally raise revenue for the government while  providing a greater payoff for the contribu tor. This is done by shifting the contribu tor's benefit  to  the  time of withdrawal,  rather  than offer  the  tax deduction up  front, and by allowing current IRA deposi tors to transfer their funds to an IRA-Plus provided that they pay a tax on the previ ously deductible contributions. My IRA-Plus  requires after-tax contributions, but then  allows  the  contributor  to withdraw  the  earnings after age 59¥2, completely tax free.  This gives our senior citizens the security of  knowing that once they have paid taxes on  the earned  income during  their working  years, the money saved in an IRA-Plus, and  all interest, will be tax free at the time of  retirement. Also, the IRA-Plus offers a tax  credit for  low-income  taxpayers of up  to  25% of their contribution.  Even if the money is withdrawn before re tirement-to purchase a home, pay for edu cation, or cover catastrophic health care  bills-the withdrawal remains tax free. Sen.  Bentsen's proposal allows  for early with drawal, without penalty, only for paying for  a home and/or for education.  The differences  between my  IRA-Plus  option and  the Bentsen plan seem even  more poignant with this example:  If a couple contributes $2,000 a year from  the time they're 30, and receives an 8% yield  on their investment, they could, under my  plan, withdraw $23,080  tax-free each and  every year after reaching 59lh. Under the  Bentsen plan, the same investment would  yield $19,618 in annual after-tax retirement  income, if the couple is in the 15% bracket;  $16,617, if the couple is in the 28% bracket,  and $15,454 a year if they are in the 33%  bracket.  These examples do not take into account  the effect of the future value of the annual  tax deduction offered under the Bentsen  plan. If the tax saving were invested, the  Bentsen IRA might prove more attractive,  but still would not yield as well as the IRA Plus. And the sad truth is that for most  workers the income from saving with the  current IRA program, or through the Bent",1989

OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 28, 1989  ",1989
1263,706,16,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I have received  a copy of a letter from one of iT''J constituents,  Dr. Edward Tauxe of Knoxville, TN, to the Di rector of National Drug Control Policy, William  Bennett.  Dr. Tauxe proposes a Federal security sur charge on the filing of all  income tax  forms.  This revenue would go  to  fund our national  war on drugs. Additionally,  he  suggests a  system  for better management of handling  drug dependent persons.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  September 28, 1989  I comr.iend  this  thoughtful and  insightful  letter to my colleagues  in  the House, and  I  would  like  to submit  it  to be printed  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  I believe  that all  Members would gain insight from reading this  letter.  KNOXVILLE, TN, September 7, 1989.  Mr. WILLIAM BENNETT,  I  Director of Office of National Drug Control  Policy, Office of Secretary of Education,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. BENNETT:  I congratulate you on  your new comprehensive program to attack  the drug problem  in  the country.  am  indeed grateful to President Bush for his  support in purposing this and for his timely  speech introducing this to the nation.  I will be sending a copy of this letter to  my Senators and friends  in  the House of  Representatives in the hopes of strong bi partisan support for a terrible non-partisan  problem. As you know partisan politics can  certainly stifle  this program. We have  to  guard against that. It would be rare indeed  for the bill to go unamended and if the po litical powers that be are indeed able to give  useful amendments; then I  think this may  be useful in helping make this a bipartisan  bill.  The purpose of this letter is to propose a  couple of considerations that I would hope  may  improve  the bill. As you know,  the  Democratic leadership seems to be saying, it  does not go far enough. I am sure that all  Democrats and Republicans in our national  leadership would like for it to go further,  but, we must start somewhere. It is obvious ly the will of the nation that we do not in crease taxes. I do see a way, however, that  some partial funding can be made  if  the  President will agree not to veto and if the  Democrat leadership agree not to attempt  to capitalize on the idea of tax increase, and  if  the bipartisan  leadership would  agree  such that the vote would be so dramatic the  President would be unable to veto a bit of  extra funding. I am proposing a surcharge  for every household in the country who files  income  tax  forms.  I would propose  that  every household be given a $20.00 (plus or  minus) federal drug security surcharge. As  you have brought out, this is a multi-facto rial problem. The grower, the manufacturer,  the importer, the pusher and the user, as  well as  the person who  is aware of  this  going on and does nothing to stop it.  We  talk about disincentives and  this  is  true. The average citizen, however,  is not  getting a direct disincentive,  that I  really  see, that would be interpreted as such in the  present bill proposed.  do not see  the average citizen  really  doing anything, except perhaps small talk.  If we are not a part of the solution, we are a  part of the problem.  A  federal  security  surcharge,  however,  would be a direct disincentive and coupled  with ""hot lines"" can certainly encourage the  citizenry to do more toward being a part of  the solution to the problem.  As you know, the problem has been with  us for many scores of years and will always  be a problem as a result of the drug depend ent personalities, etc., with which we are  born. The problem becomes one of manage ment. When I began to practice medicine,  back in early 1952. We had a system of fed eral hospitals. When our doctors found a  person abusing drugs, they were simply re ported  to  federal authorities, and  in our  area they would be taken to the hospital in  Lexington, Kentucky. There  they may go  voluntarily or  involuntarily  for a  ""cure"".  This really worked quite well. While there  I  were a large number of failures, the prob lem was indeed managed relatively well; re alizing  the problem can never be  totally  gone.  I would  suggest  looking  into  this  system of federal hospitals that were ""on  the line"" back in those days.  I am sure there will be many other consid erations and possible amendments. I  think  this should be encouraged so the final bill  will still have the appropriate direction yet,  the support of both parties and hopefully a  100% vote  in both Houses to support the  final bill.  I want  to emphasize a surcharge would  not be a new tax and should not be con strued as a new tax. While incomes of a cer tain level, perhaps could be ""excused"" from  such a  surcharge. It is  important,  in my  mind, that this be a surcharge paid equally  by everyone, that it be coupled with a possi ble means of everyone being able to report,  and to be encouraged to report drug offend ers and possible verbal supportive criticism  to improve the problem and that the sur charge vary from year to year according to  the necessity for over and above normal law  enforcement. Also,  that  it have an end  point, such as five years.  With kindest personal regards and sincere  good wishes.  Yours very truly,  EDWARD L.

1264,706,16,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, over the last  several months all of us have been dismayed  by  the revelations of scandal coming out of  the Department of Housing and Urban Devel opment. As  the  ranking minority member of  the Subcommittee on Housing and Community  Development,  I have  been  particularly ap palled at the abuses which occurred and the  neglectful  attitude  which  was  pervasive  throughout  the  top management of  the De partment.  Our  own Housing Subcommittee  of  the  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Commit tee has  looked  into the scandal.  In addition,  the Subcommittee on Employment and Hous ing, chaired by  the distinguished gentleman  from California [Mr. LANTOS], has conducted a  superb series of hearings which has produced  extensive  information which has been both  relevant and disturbing. I have attended many  of those hearings and can attest to the com pletely professional, nonpartisan methodology  the committee has used  in uncovering  this  mushrooming scandal.  Just  this week we witnessed  the unfortu nate spectacle of former Secretary Pierce and  the man who was his chief assistant refusing  to  answer questions  from  a congressional  committee and invoking their fifth amendment  privileges. This just underscores the serious ness of this matter and the complexity of the  investigation.  Today,  I am  introducing  legislation  to ad dress some of the abuses which have come  to  light. This bill  is not an attempt to imple ment sweeping programatic changes at HUD.  ",1989

We tried every  twist,  every turn but were limited by our al location. The distinguished Presiding  Officer knows about this because he  has been chairing the drug matter.  It just so happens we have 27 differ ent related agencies and the 3 depart ments, and the entire Judiciary. We  have the trade representative, the Se curities  and Exchange Commission  which has problems, the USIA, every one has more and more problems. This  one, of course, fits  in our particular  bill and right when you get some repa rations under the section of the De partment of Justice, we were present ed with a summit agreement. That is  why we cut short and had to provide  this kind of language so we would not  continue  to delay  the acknowledged  act of the U.S. Government itself in  making  these  reparations payments  with the families waiting and dimin ishing each day and some will never  see it. So we wanted to honor it and  found out this was the best way to do  it. We compromised on a tough situa tion.

1271,745,16,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr. President,  the  matter of redress for Japanese-Ameri cans who were interned in the Federal  Government internment camps during  World War II has been before us and  debated  for over a decade. And my  participation  in  these  debates,  as  many  have  been  aware,  has  been  rather minimal. So it is most difficult  for me to admit that I have been in hibited and  reluctant  to  say much  about this because of my ethnic back ground. I reached the conclusion that  as a result of this reluctance to partici pate, I may have performed a great  disservice to many of my fellow Ameri cans with whom I served in the Army  during World War II.  So, Mr. President, I believe the time  has come for me to tell my colleagues  what has been  in my heart  for all  these many years.  Mr. President, I was a very young 18year-old high school graduate when I  volunteered and put on the uniform of  my country. At that moment, because  of wartime censorship in Hawaii and  other  restrictions,  I was not made  aware of  the strange plight of my  fellow Americans of Japanese ancestry  who were then residing on the main land United States. However,  I was  made  aware  of  their  unbelievable  problems soon after I joined them in a  training camp in Mississippi. I learned  that  over  120,000 Americans were  given 48 hours to settle their accounts,  businesses and they were required by  law  to leave  their residences and be  sent to barracks and makeshift camps  in distant parts of the United States.  History now  shows  that  their only  crime was that they were born of par ents of Japanese ancestry. History also  shows that there was no evidence of  any  fifth column sabotage activities  carried out by any of these Americans  of Japanese ancestry.  So when our special  infantry regi mept was being formed, I was aware  that half of this regiment was made  up of men from Hawaii and the other  half from the mainland United States.  Mr. President, all of our volunteers  were  of  Japanese  ancestry.  These  mainland  men  volunteered  from  behind barbed wire  in  these camps.  They  did  not  volunteer,  as  other  Americans did, in free American com munities. So to this day, I  look back  with awe and disbelief that these men  who had been denied their civil rights,  deprived of  their worldly goods and  humiliated with unjust  incarceration  would, nonetheless, stand up and take  the oath to defend the country that  was mistreating  them without  due  process of law.  So, Mr. President, I have oftentimes  asked myself  the question: Would  I  have volunteered under these circum stances? In all honesty, I cannot give  you a forthright answer. The men who  volunteered  from  these camps were  very reluctant to share their unfortu nate  internment  experiences. They  would just shrug their shoulders and  mutter, ""I suppose that is the way life  is."" But in a rare moment, one of them  would open up and tell us about some  episode in his camp. For example, I re member a  story  I heard on a  cold  night on the field. One of my main land buddies told us about his experi ences  in  the Manzanar camp where  soldiers shot and killed 3 internees and  wounded about 10 others because they  were demonstrating for the release of  a fellow internee who had been arrest ed for allegedly assaulting another in ternee. Just because they were demon strating, they were shot. According to  the provisions of this bill, these three  men who were killed would not receive  any redress payments. And then while  we were training in Mississippi to pre pare us for combat in Europe, word  came to several of my buddies from  California  that their State had  just  begun  to  implement  a  strange  law  which  authorized  the  seizure  and  resale of idle farm machinery. Obvi ously,  idle farm machinery that was  found in the State of California during  that  time was  almost always  those  that  the  internees were  forced  to  abandon. Needless to say, these Cali fornia  internees were not around  to  bid for them.  Further, we were at times told about  the great losses that these young vol unteers  and  their  families  had  to  incur. For example,  it was common place for residences, farms and person al items to be sold for a fraction of  their market value.  In  fact, one of  those men in my squad sold his almost  brand new 1941 Ford for $100. He had  no choice. Although  it was  in good  condition,  that was all he could get  from his neighbors. And now we are  told that these losses have exceeded $6  billion.  Most of the Members of the Senate  have been in this body for at least 10  years, and during that time we have  given our vote and our support for  other reparations programs.  Mr. President,  redress and  repara tions are not unique  in our history.  For example, in 1980-that is less than  a decade ago-we in the Senate appro priated  funds  to provide $10,000  to  each of  the 1,318 anti-Vietnam war  demonstrators who were  found  to  have been wrongly jailed for 1 week end. They spent 2 days and 1 night  and we paid $10,000; no fuss.  ",1989

1275,758,16,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  wish to address a matter related to the  State Department portion of this bill  and to support a point made by Sena tor HATCH.  the world advocate  for human  rights, we have a duty to assure our selves that any changes in our refugee  policies must only come after intense  scrutiny and careful deliberation. We  must not compromise our traditional  role  of  setting  high  standards  of  human rights.  Tragically, scrutiny and deliberation  are lacking in the administration's ref ugee policy for fiscal year 1990.  Notice of the October 1 implementa tion date was served to the Senate on  the very late date of September 15, a  mere 15 days prior to the implementa tion date. This same notice was served  on the people of the Soviet Union just  this Tuesday, a mere 5 days before the  effective date. It takes 6 days just to  obtain a visa. And who can attest to  the effectiveness of this notice. There  are  too many unanswered questions;  there are too many unknowns in our  administration's programs.  First, how will the operation of the  refugee processing on Soviet soil affect  the  ability  of  applicants  to  freely  apply? This policy forces emigres  to  not only prove their life long persecu tion but do so in the very country that  oppresses them.  Second, how will the U.S. Embassy  operate to accommodate the influx of  applicants? We have 20 officials in the  Rome  office,  there  only  are  6  in  Moscow with no commitment from the  Soviets to increase that number.  Third, will INS officials be trained to  understand and detect the persecution  that many applicants have endured in  their lives but are not cabable of ex pressing?  Fourth, will the voluntary agencies  that operate  in Rome and Vienna,  which are crucial  to  the emigration  process,  be  allowed  to  operate  in  Moscow? Probably because the Soviets  do not like  the  idea of calling  their  people refugees and therefore do not  want these agencies operating in their  country.  Fifth, why  is  the  refugee  status  denial  rate  in Moscow  so  high,  as  much as three times that of Rome and  Vienna?  Sixth, how much are the real costs  of processing Soviet refugees and can  we afford to raise the ceiling  if the  costs are substantially lower than first  reported?  Inadequate notice has left Congress  between  a  rock  and  a  hard place.  Frankly, I resent the fact that we are  faced with choosing between accepting  the administration's proposal as is by  October 1, or racking up millions of  dollars in expenses for which there are  no allocations. At minimum, adequate  notice of  the administration's plans  would have provided concerned Mem bers of this Congress the opportunity  to work with the administration and  address the areas of concern we are  now faced with.  Why  didn't  the  administration  notify  us  about  these  proposals  sooner? Why haven't these very pivot al issues been addressed months ago?  On September 14, an official from  the U.S. General Accounting Office  testified that the voluntary agencies  that help Soviets prepare their refu gee applications,  including a written  statement of  their  reasons  to  emi grate, are not being allowed to operate  in the Soviet Union. The GAO recog nizes  the crucial role  these agencies  play, yet on October 1, none of these  agencies will be operating in Moscow  and we have no indications that they  ever will be able to operate there.  To ignore the manner in which the  administration  plans  to  implement  these dramatic proposals is to jeopard ize  the  destinies  of  thousands  of  people  for whom  this country has  fought too hard and for too long.  I am well aware that an agreement  has been reached between the admin istration  and  the  advocacy  groups.  But, there are thousands of others now in the Soviet Union-who are not  parties to this agreement. Who speaks  for them?  With these proposals, ""let my people  go""  is  a moot concept. How can  I  demand  on  behalf  of  constituents,  that  the  Soviets  release  a  family  member trapped in the Soviet Union?  What could I say? Let them go, but do  not send them here? My fear is that  for the first time, we've put a price tag  on people fleeing persecution.  We should be extending the October  1 deadline and use this additional time  to address the very vital human rights  concerns  these proposals  raise. The  United States must be accountable for  its actions. The destinies of thousands  of people and the victories born of the  last 15 years of U.S. foreign policy de serve at least that much.  Mr. President,  I  rise  to submit a  statement that I would have made, in  support of  the amendment Senator  HATCH considered offering to address  the problems caused by the adminis tration's changes  in Soviet  refugee  policy for fiscal year 1990.  My Senate colleague from Utah, and  I see very real problems in the admin istration's proposals as they represent  a  historic change  in United States'  policy concerning Soviet emigration. I  intended  to support his amendment  and I was hopeful that we could make  changes  in  those policies.  I am sure  that deciding not to offer the amend ment was a very tough decision for the  Senator from Utah to make. If he had  offered it, and I urged him to do so up  until  the  last minute,  I would have  spoken in favor of his amendment.  We are being very shortsighted in al lowing these policies to be implement ed. The reforms in the Soviet Union  have not been tested or proven; we do  not know how strong Gorbachev's po sition is as Soviet leader; we have no  evidence that these reforms will last.  Though we must continue to encour age  these  reforms, we must not be  hasty  in changes  that deeply affect  U.S. human rights policy. The doors of  Soviet emigation may be open, but  they could close overnight.  Mr. President, I do not know wheth er our Government took into account  the various nature of Soviet society  when  implementing  these  policy  changes. My  perception  from  the  annual  refugee consultation hearing  before the Committee on the Judici ary is that they did not.  New developments are taking place  in the Soviet Union. We can be very  thankful of  those and take pride in  knowing that we have played an inte gral role in influencing these new de velopments.  However, though this may be seen as  a new era of good feeling and a warm ing of relations with the Soviets, we  cannot be certain how  long this era  and  these  good  feelings will  last.  Therefore, we must not base long-term  policy on unknowns,  though  I  fear  that is precisely what we have done.

1288,784,16,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, yester day many Members of the Senate met  with President Carlos S. Menem of Ar gentina who was elected in an impor tant election last May, and sworn in  on July 8.  This election was important in two  ways. In the first place, it marked the  transition of power from one civilian  government to another through demo cratic elections. This was a very impor tant step for reestablishing Argentine  democracy. One election does not a de mocracy make. Rather, the succession  of such elections is necessary to the  firm establishing of the process. The  people of Argentina are  to be con gratulated for insisting on democratic  procedures in their political life.  In  the  second  place,  President  Menem's  government  has  restored  confidence to the people of Argentina.  At the time he was sworn in, the eco nomic  system of Argentina was  in  chaos. The country was suffering from  hyperinflation. People were rioting in  the  streets  for  food,  and property  owners were defending their property  with arms. I understand that in the  month of July alone inflation reached  200 percent-capping a year of infla tion at 2,000 percent. By August, infla tion had dropped to 37 percent.  The reason for this change was the  aggressive  action  that  President  Menem took to make major changes in  the economic system, including legisla tion and steps to privatize state indus tries,  the  increase of public utility  rates to realistic levels, the elimination  of subsidies and restrictions to foreign  investment, and currency devaluation.  These measures have not only  re stored vitality to the stock market and  stability to the exchange rate. It is not  surprising,  therefore,  that these and  other measures have  led to an IMF  commitment this week of $1.5 billion.  Moreover,  President Menem, who  was himself jailed by the military gov ernment for 5 years, has taken steps to  work for national reconciliation, par ticularly with the military. Most ob servers believe that these are construc tive steps which will strengthen the  foundation  for  the  enjoyment  of  human rights by all citizens of that  country.  In this regard, Mr. President, it is  timely to reconsider section 725 of the  ",1989
1289,797,16,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  urge  the Senate to support bringing  up  this  legislation. As  the majority  leader has indicated, a complete sub stitute will be offered for a commis sion to  investigate and make recom mendations regarding  the protracted  dispute at Eastern Airlines and the un derlying causes of that dispute.  The legislation should not be neces sary. If President Bush had followed  the unbroken precedent of naming an  emergency board-a precedent  that  even President Reagan honored-we  would have had recommendations for  the  settlement  of  this  dispute  4  months ago.  Instead, President Bush ignored this  time-honored procedure for obtaining  objective  recommendations.  In every  instance that the National Mediation  Board  has  recommended  a  neutral  emergency board  to  find  facts and  make  recommendations, every President has agreed to the recommenda tion-except President Bush.  Secretary of Transportation Skinner  has attempted to explain this decision  by the administration to abdicate its  responsibility. He claims there was no  national emergency. This is the same  Samuel Skinner who not 8 months  previously had called on Congress to  intervene in a commuter railroad dis pute in Chicago, saying it was Con gress' public responsibility.  In the wake of the administration's  irresponsible inactivity, the House of  Representatives enacted legislation to  mandate the creation of an emergency  board, and  to make  the findings of  fact and recommendations for the set tlement of  the dispute. When  the  Senate atempt to take up that bill, the  administration and  their allies here  were adamantly opposed to this meas ure of simple fairness. They  threat ened to filibuster against any such at tempt to establish just procedures to  end the strike. The House-passed bill  has  languished  in  the Senate  ever  since, while the strike has continued  to fester.  Six months later the strike contin ues,  the  employees of Eastern and  their  families  have  suffered  great  hardship, and we still have no neutral  findings  and  recommendations  for  ending the dispute.  What  facts  are  our Republican  friends so afraid of that they are will ing to engage in a filibuster to prevent  them from seeing the light of day?  What  recommendations  for  settle ment are they so afraid of, they do not  even want them to be proposed. Or are  they simply puppets on  the end of  Frank Lorenzo's  string,  dancing  to  whatever turn he calls?  We know enough of  the  facts  to  know that this situation smells to the  rafters of the Senate.  From the  time of his purchase of  Eastern  in 1986, Frank Lorenzo has  systematically plundered Eastern of  its valuable assets. He has saddled a  once-proud  airline  with  enormous  debt. His rape of Eastern triggered an  article in the respected publication Fi nancial World which observed ""East ern appears to be the victim of a cor porate version of  the battered-child  syndrome:  it is being mugged by  its  own parent.""  Frank Lorenzo bought Eastern Air lines for $640 million, but he put up  only $280 million of his own money.  Eastern actually put up $108 million  of the cash for its own aquisition.  That was only the beginning. From  day one, Frank Lorenzo has systemati cally siphoned cash and assets away  from Eastern. The reservation system  was  sold  for a  song-to Texas Air,  which is also owned by Frank Lorenzo.  Eleven gates were sold at Newark for a  pittance-to  Continental  Airlines,  which is also owned by Frank Lorenzo.  ",1989
1290,810,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  today, I  am introducing a  joint resolution-to  designate April 24, 1990, as a National  Day of Remembrance of the 75th An niversary of the Armenian Genocide.  During the August recess, I visited  Armenia,  primarily  to  evaluate  the  status of earthquake relief and recon struction  efforts.  The  devastation  wrought by that quake is appalling in  its own right; but it also serves as a  vivid reminder that the quake is not  the first tragedy which has fallen on  the Armenian people.  During the years 1915-23, under the  Ottoman Empire, a  terrible series of  events  transpired which  resulted  in  the death of enormous numbers of  people. Some historians estimate the  Armenian dead at 1.5 million persons.  Several hundred thousand Turks also  died.  Today, approaching 75 years after  the onset of those horrible events, it is  appropriate  that  we  mark  that  period-with  the  intent  that by  re membering, we can help  insure that  such  tragedies will  never  happen  again.  It is also appropriate to remember  the suffering of the Armenian people,  because of the longstanding and close  ties between the United States and Ar menia.  That special relationship was reflect ed so positively in the remarkable out pouring of private American support  for earthquake relief efforts. I have al ready spoken in the Senate about the  nearly $45 million in private American  aid for earthquake relief, and the ex traordinary efforts of scores of private  Americans working in Armenia.  The relationship was also reflected  in the virtually universal expressions  of respect and affection for our coun try and people  that  I  heard,  from  every Armenian  that  I met with  during my trip.  And finally, of course, our relation ship is manifest in the nearly 1 million  Americans of Armenian descent, who  have made such an important contri bution to our Nation and culture.  So-for those Armenian-Americans,  and for all Americans-! am proud to  introduce this resolution.  In doing so, too, let me stress my sin cere hope that this resolution will not  be misunderstood by anyone-either in  its purpose, or  its contents.  In my  view, Senate action on this resolution  should not, and need not, in any way  affect our strong security relationsp.ip  with the Republic of Turkey; nor dis rupt the close friendship between the  American and Turkish people.  The  events  of  1915-23  occurred  before  the founding of  the Turkish  Republic. The events occurred  long  before the overwhelming majority of  the Turkish population was even born.  Today's Turkey-nation or people bear no responsibility for what hap pened so many years ago.  I would also underscore my apprecia tion of the fact that our country also  encompasses hundreds of thousands of  Turkish-Americans. They may have a  different view on the events of 1915-23  than I, or others, do; and they deserve  to have their views reflected, and their  concerns addressed-just as much as  the members of the Armenian-Ameri can community, or any other Ameri can citizens.  So I hope no American will feel in  any way that this resolution is injuri ous to them, or to their proud herit age. That is not its intent, and I have  worked hard to try to insure that it  will not be its effect.  The bottom line is: A million Arme nian-Americans, and countless other  Armenians  around  the world,  still  suffer  from  the  events of 1915-23.  They deserve to have their grievance  noted; and they deserve  to have the  victims of those events-their ances tors-remembered.  I hope by doing that, by acting on  this resolution, the result will be that  all Americans can come even closer to gether-renewed  in  their determina tion to insure that such events as oc curred during that tragic period will  never reoccur.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the joint resolution be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.J. RES. 212  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled, That April 24, 1990,  is designated as ""National Day of Remebrance of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of  the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923"", and  the President is authorized and requested to  issue a proclamation calling upon the people  of the United States to observe this date as  a day of remembrance for the 1.5 million  people of Armenian ancestry who were vic tims of the genocide perpetrated by the gov ernments of the Ottoman empire from 1915  to 1923, prior to the establishment of the  Republic of Turkey, and in their memory  this date is commemorated by all Armeni ans and their friends throughout the world.  ",1989
1291,810,16,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, I am  pleased and honored to join the Re publican leader as the primary cospon sor of this resolution to establish a na tional day of remembrance for victims  of the Armenian genocide.  In addition to affirming our Nation's  longstanding tradition of opposing the  suppression of people on the basis of  their  religion or ethnic background,  the resolution also commemorates the  tragic sacrifice endured by the Arme nian community from 1915  to 1923.  Historians estimate that during World  War I, 1.5 million Armenians living in  the Ottoman Empire were  slaugh tered. Furthermore, I am pleased to  inform my colleagues that this effort  has  the  full  support  of President  Bush.  Although such a  resolution cannot  correct the wrongs of the past, it can  send a powerful message that the U.S.  Government will stand on the side of  those who, like the Armenian commu nity  under  the Ottoman  Empire,  might  face  the  terrifying  threat of  mass murder as a result of their eth nicity or creed. And so  this  tragedy  must continue to live in the memories  and writings of humankind so that it  does not become clouded or forgotten  with the advance of history.  If the Senate adopts  the genocide  resolution, we would actually deserve a  moment  of  celebration. We would  have  declared  that  these martyred  millions  of  yesteryear-these  brave  men  and women who were  felled  simply because of what they believed  or the cultures into which they were  born-did not die  in vain. With this  resolution, we could nobly keep alive  the hope that agony suffered by the  just may yet bring triumph.

1293,823,16,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, on Sep tember 27, President Bush opened an  education summit attended by Gover nors from 49 States, Puerto Rico, and  the U.S. Virgin  Islands.  I  commend  the President for initiating this prece dent-setting meeting. His actions dem onstrate a praiseworthy interest in a  national  education  policy.  Though  education is often a matter handled by  State and  local governments, recent,  disturbing national  trends-illiteracy,  internationally inferior math and sci ence scores among our students, drug  addiction and sales among our young  people-make it clear that the United  States has a vital national interest in a  strong educational system.  Unfortunately, the President marred  this important occasion with a serious  omission in his invitation list. Though  the Governors and the President used  the summit to discuss a national edu cation strategy-and  though part of  the proposed strategy was a program  of targeted funds to District of Colum bia  schools-no  representative  from  the Nation's Capital was  asked  to  attend.  I believe this is an inexcusable omis sion, and as chairman of the Govern mental Affairs Committee-the com mittee with jurisdiction over the Dis trict of Columbia-it disturbs me. The  D.C. Public Schools serve more than  88,000 students. The school system has  had some well-publicized problems and  has made some serious efforts to stem  those problems-see: ""5-Year Plan Un veiled for District Schools,"" the Wash ington Post, June 27, 1989 and ""Jen kins  Stakes  Reputation  on  D.C.  Schools'  Ambitious  Agenda,""  the  Washington Post, September 7, 1989.  Furthermore, the District of Colum bia has often been held up as an exam ple of a city marred by the plague of  illegal drugs. The President himself  used crack confiscated in the District  to illustrate his recent declaration of  war on drugs.  Yet, crack itself is not the tragedy of  D.C.'s drug crisis. The tragedy is the  children who are faced daily with the  indignity and horror of drug depend ency, crime, and violence. For many of  these  children,  the  public  school  system is their best chance to develop  into healthy, happy, productive citi zens.  This administration should under stand that the decision to exclude the  District of Columbia from the educa tion summit cannot be interpreted as  merely an institutional decision based  on the District's Governorless hierar chy. In fact, D.C. is considered a State  agency by  the U.S. Department of  Education. Nor can there be an excuse  on the basis of any political feelings  that might be harbored against  the  District's present administration. The  President himself stated that, in edu cation matters, ""too much is at stake  to let partisanship get in the way of  progress.''  In my opinion, the decision to ignore  88,000 children in the District of Co lumbia is a serious, serious mistake.e  A SHELL OF A GOVERNMENT  e ",1989
1294,823,16,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I rise to  day to draw the Senate's attention to  two articles which demonstrate all too  well  the way  in which our Govern ment has rushed to delegate its basic  responsibilities to private consultants  and contractors  to  the detriment of  our system of government.  A front page headline in the June 28  New York Times announced that the  ""Energy Chief Says Top Aides Lack  Skills  to Run U.S. Bomb Complex.''  Secretary Watkins  is  faced with the  enormous task of bringing under con trol our Nation's nuclear weapons pro ductions facilities whose disrepair,  it  has been suggested, may bring us close  to unilateral disarmament. The article  states:  His efforts had been slowed because of an  insufficient number of technically qualified  people on the department's staff.  In yesterday's New York Times is an  article entitled ""NASA's Reliance on  Contractors Is Seen as Eroding Its Ca pabilities."" The  article  discusses  a  letter from  the agency's deputy ad ministrator James R. Thompson, Jr.,  to the Director of the Office of Man agement and Budget [OMBJ outlining  NASA's concerns  regarding  the con tracting  out  of  the  agency. Mr.  Thompson is worried that OMB's push  ""to convert more and more critical  functions"" to contractors is taxing the  National Aeronautics and Space Ad",1989
1295,862,16,Mr.  SARBANES.,"  The  Senator  wanted to know the source. I would  like to insert into the RECORD immedi ately following that article an editorial  in the New York Times dated July 3.  1989, entitled ""Trivializing Ambassa dors,"" in which the New York Times  states, ""No one argues that the coun try would be better served if all am bassadors  were  professional  diplo mats.""  I have not argued that here  today, nor should campaign contribu tors be automatically excluded. They  can do a good job, depending on their  political instinct, stature, and experi ence.  I have also conceded that point here  today. This editorial does go on to call  for the rejection of Mr. Zappala, and it  states: ""It would be wise for the Presi dent to reconsider such nominees, and  if not, permissible, indeed salutary, for  the Senate to reject them."" I ask that  that editorial in full be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, July 3, 1989]  TRIVIALIZING AMBASSADORS  Presidents and Congress have a habit of  rewarding fat cats and cronies with foreign  embassies, of treating many ambassadorial  appointments as if they don't much matter  in  representing American  interests  and  values. But they do matter, sometimes criti cally.  President Bush has not improved on the  tradition.  to  judge by his nominations  to  Spain. Australia and New Zealand. The only  distinction visible in his proposed Ambassa dor to Madrid, Joseph Zappala, a Florida de veloper, is a distinctively large contribution  to  the  Republican  Party,  reportedly  $126,000. Ditto for another Florida business ma'!l, Melvin Sembler ($127,000), nominated  to Canberra. And the choice for Wellington  is Della Newman, a Seattle broker who man aged Mr. Bush's state campaign.  Dispatching  a  lightweight or  inexperi enced envoy sends a message of unconcern  verging on contempt. That's why a move by  Senator Paul Sarbanes deserves  support.  The Maryland Democrat has  forced  the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee to put  off  considering  this  trio until mid-July,  giving the Senate more time to weigh the  nominees' qualifications-and for all con cerned to think harder about the impor tance of ambassadors.  No one argues that the country would be  better served if all ambassadors were profes sional diplomats. That would have meant  losing such star noncareer performers as  Mike Mansfield, Averell Harriman, David  Bruce and Edwin Reischauer,  to name a  few. Nor should campaign contributors be  automatically excluded. They can do a good  job, depending on their political instincts,  stature and experience. Moreover, foreign  service officers can make feeble ambassa dors, given to inertia, caution and fixation  with form.  Presidents need considerable  latitude  in  selecting what are in part personal repre sentatives. The Constitution spells out their  right to do so, subject to senatorial consent.  It clearly stretches the legislative role  to  withhold or delay confirmation if a Senator  objects  to  a  nominee  on  ideological  grounds-an abuse repeatedly and indefensi bly indulged by Senator Jesse Helms.  Yet advice and consent does mean some thing: the Senate has an obligation to hold  Presidential  nominees  to  rudimentary  standards of competence. Senator Sarbanes  has  reasons  to  be  troubled when Mr.  Sembler,  the nominee for Australia, sup plies this written answer to a question about  his qualification: ""I have been known as a  coalition-builder, able to organize my peers  to action in support of worthy civic, charita ble and political causes.""  Nearly  identical  language was used by  whoever answered the same written ques tion  for Mr. Zappala,  the nominee  for  Spain, treating both the Senate and an im portant capital with the same manipulative  cynicism.  Those old European capitals, with large  embassy staffs and calm relations, have long  offered safe places to reward fat cats. That's  much less true today. Change now buffets  Western  and Eastern Europe. Consider  Italy, where only a year ago and at some po litical cost. a centrist coalition government  agreed to accept U.S. airbases soon to be  closed by a Socialist government in Spain.  Yet Mr. Bush's choice for Rome is Peter  Secchla, manager of his Michigan campaign,  whose innocence in diplomacy seems com plete.  Does  it repay Italy's fidelity, or soothe  Spain's nationalism, for the United States  to send  them envoys conspicuously une quipped by  experience or knowledge?  It  would be wise for the President to reconsid er such nominees; and if not, permiss!ble,  ",1989
1296,888,16,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased  to bring before  the Senate,  H.R. 838, legislation critical to the ad vancement of aviation and transporta tion  in  the States of Virginia and  Hawaii. It is a bill that was unani mously approved by  the Commerce  Committee before the August recess,  u.nd I hope that it will be approved by  the Senate today.  Very simply, the bill attempts to ad dress longstanding issues affecting two  airports. First, at Newport News, VA,  legislation is needed to allow the limit ed release of deed restrictions on prop erty originally conveyed to the Penin sula Airport Commission, which oper ates the Patrick Henry Airport. Legis lation  similar  to  this was  enacted  during the 99th Congress, but Public  Law 99-618 did not allow for the re lease of the 13 acres specified by thiS  bill, or the transfer of land to private  entities.  The Federal Aviation Administra tion has stated that it has no objection  to this provision, as the property in volved will not affect the operation or  development of the airport in Newport  News. Additionally, attorneys for the  Peninsula Airport Commission have  provided  their  assurances  that  the  proceeds from  the sale of this  land  have been used for the development,  improvement, operation, and mainte nance of the airport.  Mr. President, H.R. 838 will also ad dress  a  situation  in  the State  of  Hawaii to ensure the efficient use of  funds  generated  at  the  off-airport  duty-free facility in Honolulu for avia tion and other transportation needs.  The State of Hawaii has estimated  that the combined operation of  the  on-airport and off-airport duty-free fa cilities will generate $1.15 billion over  a  5-year period. Given  the  funding  needs for Hawaii's system of airports,  the revenues derived from the off-air port facility are therefore expected to  create a  substantial surplus  in  the  State's airport revenue fund. However,  under current law, funds derived from  such an off-airport duty-free facility  must be dedicated solely to air trans portation development and operations.  This  legislation would resolve  this  situation by permitting the use of cer tain revenues generated by the off-air port duty-free facility  in Hawaii for  any  transportation purpose, such as  airport  development,  highway  con struction, and harbor development. To  protect  funding  for  the Honolulu  International Airport, as well as the  other airports in Hawaii, the bill pro vides  that  only  those  revenues  in  excess of 150 percent of their funding  requirements be transferred for other  transportation purposes. Additionally,  this provision, which is limited to this  single facility in the State of Hawaii, is  designed to sunset at the end of 1995,  a further safeguard that will ensure  adequate review in the future.  Mr. President, I believe that this bill  is a balanced effort  to  resolve  two  problems very unique to two airports.  I urge its passage today and hope that  my colleagues will join me in support ing the bill.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are  there amendments to the committee  substitute?  If there be no further amendment to  be proposed, the question is on agree ing to the committee amendment.  The  committee  amendment  agreed to.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

1302,953,16,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speak er,  I rise  in strong support of this bill. Since  the steel import restraint program was first au thorized  in 1984, the domestic steel  industry  has done a remarkable job regaining profitabil ity  and market  share while making  great  strides  toward being  internationally competi tive. But, while the program has succeeded in  meeting challenges of the 1980's, our daunt ing  task this year has been to create a new  policy to meet those of the 1990's.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe  this bill  represents  that policy.  I am proud  to be an original co  sponsor of the bill before us today and want  to  thank  trade subcommittee chairman Mr.  GIBBONS for his leadership on this bill.  As  the economy has expanded  in  recent  years, I have spent a great deal of time work ing with my companies in Connecticut to help  them gain access  to adequate supplies of  steel. They are a diverse group, ranging from  metal stamping shops which may employ only  a few workers,  to  the Stanley Works which  manufactures a wide range of tools and other  products, and Theis Steel, a small high-quality  specialty steelmaker. While these firms gener ally have supported  the VRA program,  the  short supply process has at times forced them  to expend more time in Washington working  on short supply requests than in Connecticut  manufacturing.  The significance of this bill  is not that the  VRA's are being extended but  that  the pro gram is being  improved. A straight extension  of the VRA's would not have met the needs of  the economy and would not have gained the  wide support this bill has. Our bill, H.R. 3275,  will support the modernization of our steel in dustry, but it will also ensure that steel users  will have access  to as much steel as  they  need in an expanding economy.  In recent years, with the domestic industry  at near-capacity,  the domestic steel makers  have not always been able to supply the full  needs of our manufacturers. When domestic  steel makers cannot fill an order, we need to  ensure that steel users have prompt access to  steel from other sources.  Moreover, our bill also gets to the root of  the problem that led to the original VRA pro gram: unfair  trade practices. Mr. Speaker,  if  when  the VRA's expire 2% years  from now  subsidized steel is still reaching our shores we  will not have done our job. If, 2% years from  now, foreign steel makers can dump steel to  gain U.S. market share, we will have  failed.  The U.S. steel industry has done a remarkable  job regaining its competitiveness over the past  5 years, but  the job  is not finished. Our bill  puts the world on notice that we are serious  about ensuring  that our market will only be  open to fairly traded steel.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ways and  Means Committee which has jurisdiction over  this program, I am proud that this bill has the  support of interests who, at the beginning of  this debate, were on opposite sides of  the  issue. I urge my colleagues to support the bill  and hope the Senate acts quickly to approve  this important program.  Mr. AlTIER. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  urge my colleagues to support the extension  of  the Voluntary Restraint Agreements  for  steel imports included in H.R. 3275. However,  my support is only lukewarm.  As someone who was personally involved in  bringing VRA's into existence in 1984, I firmly  believe that while there has been significant  progress, there is still much to be done. This  is why I would rather see a 5-year extension,  rather than the 2 %-year extension as included  in  this  legislation.  I'm not sure 2% years  is  enough  to accomplish  the  intricate negotia tions needed to provide an  international con sensus to remove unfair trade practices and  to provide more time for the industry to adjust  and modernize.  But  I also understand  the  tough negotia tions which  took place between members of  the Congressional Steel Caucus, U.S. steel  producers, U.S. steel users and the adminis tration which went into producing this legisla tion.  This 2%-year extension  is a compromise,  balancing the interests of steel producers and  users.  I will abide with  this compromise and  not offer any amendments today. But, be as sured,  I and my colleagues who care about  the future of an American steel industry will be  closely monitoring the progress which the ad ministration  makes,  both  bilaterally  and  through  the Uruguay round of GA n, during  the next 2% years. If, in that time, insufficient  progress  is made  in negotiating  international  agreements  curbing  steel  subsidies which  have given  foreign producers an advantage  over U.S. steelmakers, Members of the Con gressional Steel Caucus will work  to have  Congress revisit this issue.  ",1989
1303,953,16,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  introduced  H.R. 3275 and am supporting  its enactment  with mixed feelings. I have never been a sup porter of  the steel voluntary restraint agree ment  [VRA] program and  I strongly believe  that the country would have been  far better  off if the program was allowed to expire this  year. But  this bill, and  the program  it imple ments do represent a reasonable compromise  to craft a steel trade policy which addresses  the  concerns of both  steel producers and  steel users.  The bill gives U.S. steel producers another  2% years-for a total of 7% years-of import  protection  through  the negotiation and en forcement of voluntary restraint agreements.  Moreover,  it must be  remembered  that  this  7%-year VRA program follows a long history  of various types of Government protection for  the domestic steel industry.  The bill gives U.S. steel users the prospect  of liberalized market access over the period of  transitional VRA's and  the certainty  that, at  the end of March 1992, the steel VRA pro gram will terminate permanently. It also sends  the clear message  that,  in 1992,  imports of  steel will be  regulated by  the same unfair  trade laws that govern trade in all other prod ucts.  Although a consensus has emerged for this  temporary extension of steel VRA's, I want to  emphasize  that  this consensus  is possible  only because of the clarity of President Bush's  commitment that the steel VRA program ter minate in March 1992. This  is a final exten sion, good onJy for 2¥2 years.  I applaud the President's intention to seek  stronger international rules and disciplines on  the use of subsidies and other unfair trade  practices, particularly those  that affect world  steel  trade. Any  international agreement  in  this area, however, must not sanction cartel ization of steel trade. International rules must  lead toward freer, more open steel trade.  Furthermore, I want to emphasize the need  to reinstate the application of U.S. trade laws  in the steel sector. I firmly believe that all in dustries must  learn  to compete under  the  same rules of trade. A fundamental flaw with  the VRA system is the protection we give to  foreign producers by waiving the rigorous en forcement of our unfair trade laws. By March  1992, U.S. trade laws will be fully enforced to  address all vestiges of unfair trading practices  by foreign steel exporters.  Let no one misinterpret the broad support  and  consensus behind  today's vote;  steel  import protection  is not a noncontroversial  subject. The Trade Subcommittee held 3 ex haustive days of public hearings receiving tes timony from many parties about the economic  costs and burdens  imposed on steel users  through VRA's. The record is clear: VRA's are  not good  for  the economy. And  the only  reason  I am supporting their extension today  is because of the President's commitment to  terminate the VRA's in March 1992.  . I want  to extend my  thanks  to all of the  people who worked so hard  to develop this  consensus  legislation-both Democratic and  Republican members of  the Trade Subcom mittee, members of the steel caucus, the ad ministration, as well as  representatives  from  the domestic steel producers,  steel users,  steelworkers' union, and steel service centers.  This legislation is a tribute to the cooperative  spirit of all those who are affected by it, and  their willingness to compromise. I urge the ex peditious enactment of H.R. 3275, so that the  President's program can be  implemented ef fectively and we can  turn our attention  to  other pressing matters of the day.

1309,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," Reclaim ing my time, the gentleman is abso lutely right. It clearly  is stacked in  favor of having the largest distance  between  the election, which people  know is set for February 25, 1990, and  the process of registration. There are  many in this country who have advo cated that we should have same-day  registration. I do not quite go that far.  I do believe that to have a period of  only 4 days in which a citizen of Nica ragua can register to vote and then  having that gap of November 1 all the  way to February 25 of the next year,  virtually 4 months away from the last  time that they are able to register, is  stacked against  those who are chal lenging the party in power.  ",1989
1310,979,16,Mr. GOSS.,"  I  appreciate  that, be cause  the gentleman  is  exactly on  point. I believe the international press  today attributed a statement from the  Arias government  indicating  that in  fact the campaign, the election, was  going to be over the end of October.  That clearly alluded to this registra tion  process,  because we were  in formed by both sides and, of course.  we saw the Sandinistas as well as the  opposition while we were  there be cause we were in a neutral observer  role;  they made it very clear that if  you have not registered exactly prop erly it does not matter what you think  or what else you do, that if you miss  your last chance to register when the  fourth Sunday of October is gone, you  are disenfranchised from the election,  and if there is a mistake in the elec tion process, you are also disenfran chised, as it is a little complicated for  the average campesino, or if there are  mistakes, and there are many people  aware of  the political  situation  in  Nicaragua who know the average cam pesino is displeased with the Nicara guan Government.  ",1989
1311,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," Reclaim ing my time briefly, I am notgoing to  share the name of our colleague, be cause I believe it is privileged, but the  gentleman  from Florida and  I had  lunch today with a group of people,  and frankly I think virtually every one  at the table with the exception of us  serve on the other side of the aisle,  and  I will say  that  this gentleman  serves on the other side of the aisle.  He is from the home State of the gen tleman from Florida [Mr. Gossl, and  he was in Panama during that elec tion. I do not know what it will take to  go and find that, but I do not want to  use his name at this point, because it  was a lunch discussion. But he did say,  after hearing of these experiences, and  if I am incorrect, I hope the gentle man will correct me, but he said, ""It  sounds to me as if it is another Pana manian election  in  the making.""  Is  that correct?  ",1989
1312,979,16,Mr. GOSS.," I would not wish to at tribute any words  to anyone, but I  think I did hear those comments. I am  sure that that gentleman, if he were  present  in  this Chamber  at  this  moment, would elaborate on that, and  I  think that he would come to that  conclusion. But he will  have  that  chance if he desires.  If I may finish this point, there is no  question that this whole system of reg istration, the way they have it set up,  requires poll watchers, and they have  provided  for poll watchers. Perhaps  the most disturbing things that we ran  into as we went around  to some of  them,  and  there  are 4,300  polling  places  throughout  the country, but  perhaps the most disturbing thing we  found was, and I guess we got to 12 or  so, because we split up into two teams,  and we got to 11 or 12.  ",1989
1313,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," Of the  seven spots which the Ballengers and I  visited, we found that there were only  two with poll watchers from UNO [the  United Nicaraguan Opposition] the 14party alliance which is challenging the  Government. On the other hand, in  every spot there was a poll watcher  overseeing  this  registration  process  from the FSLN, and I think that the  gentleman from Florida, in his delega tion, had about the same experience.  ",1989
1314,979,16,Mr. GOSS.," We had about the same  percentage. If the gentleman will yield  further, I think that we found in one  instance that one of the people there  had indicated to us  that the actual  UNO poll watcher had come and pre sented himself but had been told that  his identification was out of order.  ",1989
1315,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," That is a  very important point, and I wish the  gentleman would make it again. I did  not have an experience like that at the  seven polling or registration spots that  I went into, so while I saw FSLN poll  watchers at each registration spot and  found only two UNO watchers, I heard  nothing of attempts to keep them out.  In fact, at every spot I asked they said,  ""Anyone  is welcome here. They are  welcome to be here."" I think the gen tleman should underscore the report  he got in that particular polling spot.  ",1989
1316,979,16,Mr. GOSS., I appreciate the gentle man underscoring that.  ,1989
1317,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," I think  that point needs to be made again, be cause it is an important one.  ",1989
1318,979,16,Mr. GOSS.,"  I  think it is one that  needs followup. It turned out not to be  an isolated fact, that the identification  was being challenged of the UNO poll  watchers. Whether it was being prop erly challenged, I do not know. It was  too early to tell. But it is important to  underscore that.  ",1989
1319,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California., It obvi ously was being challenged if the UNO  poll watcher was not able to be in the  spot where  registration was  taking  place. Am I not correct?  ,1989
1320,979,16,Mr. GOSS.," That would seem to be  the conclusion. There were other re ports apparently that were made avail able to the press that this was happen ing elsewhere in the country, and I ob viously did not see those myself. But I  understand that that was the concern,  and that there was some talk about ir regularities and that that matter was  being discussed as we left the country.  I have not had a chance to pursue it  today obviously.  One other point that we might talk  about that we did raise and that is  very  important  to  this  registration  process which ends the fourth Sunday  in October is all of these people who  are on the borders who are political  refugees who want very much to go  back to their home country, to Nicara gua, and would love to vote in a demo cratic election there, are very scared  about going back. They do not wish to  go back unless they have some good  assurances  that  they can be reinte grated  into society safely and with  some opportunity for economic surviv al as well. There is no provision in the  registration as far as I can see to ac commodate the timeframe, the practi cal timeframe, of getting them from  where  they are now back  into  the  country in time to register in order  that they can participate in this elec tion in February.  Why we have to have the registra tion stop on the fourth Sunday in Oc tober, again, remains a bit of a mys tery, and I think a very troubling one.  ",1989
1321,979,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," The gen tleman is absolutely right. We did, in  our  conversation with  the  Interior  Minister, the head of the secret police,  Comandante Tomas Borge, ask  if it  could be extended, and  just like he  pardoned  those  prisoners,  as  our  friend,  the  gentleman  from North  Carolina  [Mr. CoBLE],  indicated, he  said,  ""Well, we may be able  to do  that."" It struck me as rather ironic  that  the head of  the secret police  could determine whether or not the  registration process itself could be ex tended.  I  think that as we go through the  hurdles which have been imposed on  the individual, I think there is a point  that we should make, too, about the  hurdles imposed on the United Nicara guan  Opposition  themselves.  One  thing that we should point to is that  one of the members who went at 8  o'clock yesterday morning in Managua  to register to vote was confronted by a  uniformed officer who said, ""What can  I do for you? Why are you here?"" She  pointed out  accurately,  ""This  is  a  ",1989
1322,992,16,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay  tribute  to St. Denis Church of Glen  Lyon, PA, on  the occasion of its centennial  celebration.  St. Denis Church was founded as a Slovak  Mission on October 8, 1889. For 37 years,  priests  from Nanticoke, PA, came by horse  and buggy to serve the members of the con gregation. In 1926 St. Denis' parish welcomed  its first pastor, the Rev. Frank McHugh.  For  the next 6 years, Reverend McHugh  and the parishioners worked diligently togeth er  to establish and  construct  the present  church. The foundation and walls were built by  the men of the parish, while the upper part of  the church was completed by a contractor.  Over the years, St. Denis' parish has gener ously offered  its  time and services  to help  those in need. For years before the Ruthenian  Rite congregation was able to build a church  of  their own,  they celebrated mass once a  month at St. Denis Church. The church added  Retreat State Hospital as a mission, and  Father McHugh hiked over Glen Lyon Moun tain  to attend  to  the patients needs. These  two acts are only two representations of the  consistent kindness and generosity exhibited  by St. Denis Church.  Over time, under the tenure of 11 different  pastors, St. Denis Church  has undergone  many changes and improvements. Under the  guidance of Rev. Leo V. Gilroy a new rectory  was built. The church basement was renovat ed  to make  it suitable  for social gatherings  during Rev. Leo A. Granahan's tenure. The  original pews built by the men of the parish  were replaced by Rev. Edward L Collins.  It was the generosity and industriousness of  its members and  the surrouding community  that made  it possible  to build St. Denis  Church. I hope that the next 1 00 years are as  rewarding  for St. Denis Church as  the  first  100.  ",1989
1323,1005,16,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to an outstanding individual in rec ognition of his service to my community. Octo ber 1, 1989, marks  the beginning of Fred  David's 58 years  in business and  it  is with  great honor that I share with my colleagues  the distinguished career of this stellar individ ual.  Not long after moving to Sacramento, Fred  David began what has become a  long and  successful career  in business. Fred's many  experiences as a salesman include selling the  Sacramento Star newspaper on street corners  and selling  fish and vegetables at a public  market. These experiences enabled Fred  to  open his first candystore in San Francisco in  1930.  It was  through  this venture  that Fred  was able to learn the basics of a successful  business, including the ever important role of  the customer and  the effects of supply and  demand economics.  Fred returned to Sacramento with his bride,  Isabelle Shikany, in 1932 and established the  David Candy Co. He merged his candystore  with David's Cafe in 1933, ventured  into ice  cream making and for the past half a century  has operated  this  thriving  company  in my  community. Throughout his career, Fred David  has been the helping hand,  the shoulder to  cry on and the sagacious mentor for many en tr&preneurs. The David Candy Co. at 1015 R  Street is an institution noted for its service, its  quality and the enjoyment it brings to all that  have had the opportunity to visit the company  and meet its owner,  the ""Sweet Guy,"" Fred  David.  Mr. Speaker, Fred David  and  the David  Candy Co. have brought enjoyment  to  the  entire Sacramento community. His dedication  and service have not gone unnoticed and on  behalf of the community,  I congratulate him  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  for a job well done. I know that my colleagues  join me in extending best wishes to Fred for  continued success in all his future endeavors.  THE WORK OF THE NORTH  WIND UNDERSEA INSTITUTE  HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 2, 1989  ",1989
1324,1005,16,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to the North Wind Undersea Institute  located in my congressional district.  The North Wind Undersea  Institute  is an  educational and environmental museum which  is dedicated to preserving and protecting the  environment and marine life. North Wind has  participated  in  the  dramatic  rescues  of  beached  marine mammals  and  has  re searched and developed new technologies to  aid wildlife and the environment.  North Wind  has  received many  honors  during  its existence and recently obtained a  patent for its Benjamin Box live trap for sea  lions. The Benjamin Box is a floating cage de signed to safely capture sea lions and other  mammals and transport them to more secure  habitats. Past devices for capturing sea lions  have  tended  to  injure or kill  these animals.  The Benjamin Box is truly a significant break through  in the humane treatment of animals.  Additionally, North Wind recently received a  $30,000 grant for a program to promote the  welfare of wild mustangs. This grant will allow  approximately 2,000 Bronx schoolchildren  to  learn about horses,  their history and  their  present environmental dilemma. This money  will permit North Wind  to expand  its already  successful message of environmental conser vation and awareness to even larger numbers  of young people.  I have been proud to work with North Wind  during its 1 0 year existence. The patent of the  Benjamin Box to help sea lions and the ob taining of a grant for the preservation of wild  mustangs shows this organization's continued  commitment toward the assistance of all ani mals.  I offer my sincere congratulations  to  North Wind for its achievements and look for ward to working with them  in their efforts to  educate people about protecting the environ ment and the rights of animals.  HONORING MARGARET ""PEG""  SWEZEY  HON. GARY L. ACKERMAN  OF NEW YORK  HON. FLOYD H. FLAKE  OF NEW YORK  HON.THO~J.~ON  OPNEWYORK  HON. JAMES H. SCHEUER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday October 2, 1989  ",1989
1325,1005,16,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, the Queens  delegation rises today to honor a woman re spected and beloved throughout our county of  22765  Queens by all who have had the pleasure to  meet her. That woman  is Margaret  ""Peg""  Swezey, a successful businesswoman, a com mitted community  leader, an avid patron of  the arts, and above all a wonderful person  without whom  the Queens community would  be much the poorer.  In appreciation of the many years of distin guished service Peg has given Queens, Citi bank's Queens Retail Bank and members of  the Queens community will hold a cocktail  party in Peg's honor on October 5 at the East  River Yacht Club.  It  is extremely difficult  for us  to describe  here  just  how much  Peg  has  done  for  Queens. Her contributions  to  the economic  and  cultural  improvement of Queens have  been  so  numerous  and  varied  that  they  cannot be summed up  in a  few sentences.  Her accomplishments literally speak for them selves.  Born and raised in Queens, Peg has devot ed herself to economic development, civic re sponsibility, and assisting others. She still lives  in Queens with her husband, Harold, a retired  electrical engineer with Western Electric. Their  one son, Mark, is now a high school teacher  in Kansas.  Peg has spent her whole career working in  Queens  for Citibank.  In a career spanning  three decades, she has diligently climbed the  corporate ladder, starting as a junior clerk and  working her way through the ranks to become  vice-president and director of community and  government relations. She will conclude her  career this year when she retires from her po sition as vice president to join her son, Mark,  in the Midwest.  At Citibank she has encouraged increased  coopreation between the borough of Queens  and many community organizations. She has  herself served on the board of directors of a  wide spectrum of Queens organizations,  in cluding  the Queens Outreach Corp.,  the  Flushing Council on the Arts, and the United  Cerebral Palsy of Queens. Peg also holds the  distinction of becoming  the  first woman  to  become president of the Queens Chamber of  Commerce in its 71-year history.  Peg's services  to Queens have extended  beyond  the  local  level, however. She has  worked strenuously on the national and inter national  levels  to promote development  in  Queens. In 1980 and 1986, she served as a  delegate to the White House Conference on  Small Business and  in 1982 she traveled to  China with  the Queens borough president to  encourage Chinese investment in Queens.  In recognition  for her services to Queens,  December 12, 1979 and April 18, 1983 were  proclaimed  to be  ""Peg Swezey""  days.  In  1980, Governor Cuomo cited her for her serv ice to Queens and in the same year she re ceived national recognition for her work with  the Small Business Administration when Presi dent Carter cited her as ""Banker Advocate of  the Year."" In recent years she has been cited  by the Queens borough president and hon ored by a resolution passed by the New York  City Council  recognizing her service  to  the  City of New York. Peg has also earned a  whole string of awards from local groups, In cluding  the Flushing Boys Club,  the United  Cerebral Palsy, the J.F.K. Rotary Club, the AI",1989
1326,1018,16,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Madam Speaker,  repeal, repeal, repeal. My constituents  have spoken. These  trays  represent  more than 20,000 responses from the  seniors in the Second District of Mary land who object to being taxed via the  existing  catastrophic  health  bill.  There are 58.9 percent of my constitu ents who want total repeal. Of the re maining 41.1  percent,  they want a  delay of 1 year while a blue-ribbon bi partisan commission studies  the Na tion's whole health picture. However,  if a delay is not possible with such a  commission, then that same 41 percent  want the bill repealed.  Fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent  have asked for one of the alternate  proposals.  I want to point out to my colleagues  that my seniors are  typical middle  class Americans who made provision  for their retirement while they were  employed. My constituents want an  ""aye"" vote on  the Archer /Donnelly  amendment.  OPPOSITION TO H.R. 3, THE  HAWKINS-DOWNEY BILL  <Mr. HOLLOWAY asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  ",1989
1327,1018,16,Mr. HOLLOWAY.," Madam Speaker,  the language in H.R. 3 governing title  II, title Ill, and title IV clearly states  that ""no child care provider receiving  financial  assistance under  this  sub chapter shall engage in any sectarian  activity,  including sectarian worship  and  instruction,  in  the program for  which such assistance is received.""  Churches  are  currently  providing  one-third of the center-based care in  the U.S. today and have been most in strumental in our inner cities. Many  inner city churches have chosen to re spond to the poor's need for child care  and have made a life-changing impres sion on disadvantaged youth  in our  Nation. Michael Novak of the Ameri can Enterprise Institute has reported  that black male  teenagers with reli gious values in the inner city today are  47 percent less likely to drop out of  school; 54 percent less  likely to use  drugs; and 50 percent less  likely  to  engage in criminal activity.  In theory if these religious providers  abandoned  their  religious  activities  they could receive funds through Hawkins-Downey, but ony if they abided  by a wide range of regulations includ ing State control of their choices for  program administrators and staff se lection. Obviously few, if any, religious  childcare providers are going to let the  State control tne choice of their staffs  and few will remove all religious traces  from their programs. Therefore, Haw kins-Downey will cut them out of the  process.  In addition to the religious discrimi nation in Hawkins-Downey there are  other provisions which are just as bad.  The bureaucracy created by this bill is  unbelievable.  It sets in motion 150 new regulations  on State governments receiving day care funds.  It also requires each State receiving  Federal daycare  funds  to  create  a  ""child development council"" for each  local government. If every State were  to accept Federal daycare funds under  the legislation, over 38,000 local child  development councils would need to be  created. Each council  is  required  to  submit reports  to  the State govern ment every 4 years. Which means by  the year 2000 over 120,000 Govern ment reports on daycare would be re quired.  H.R. 3 is such a bureaucratic mess.  Under this bill a grandmother caring  for her own grandchild has to comply  with  regulations  including  building  standards in her home, safety stand ards, nutrition standards, injury pre vention  and  treatment  regulations,  child  abuse  regulations  and health  regulations.  In addition,  the grand mother would be subject  to  inspec tions  by  the State government  to  make  sure  she was  caring  for her  grandchild in a manner that made the  State happy.  For these reasons,  I urge my col leagues to ""Just say no"" to Hawkins Downey.  Mr.  TOWNHALL MEETINGS IN OKLA HOMA AGAINST CATASTROPH IC HEALTH CARE PROGRAM  <Mr. INHOFE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  INHOFE. Madam Speaker, we  have heard a  lot  today about cata strophic health, and we are going to  hear a  lot more, but this is nothing  compared to what we have heard at  our townhall meetings back in Oklaho ma. I have over 5,000 names on peti tions of people saying, ""We don't want  the catastrophic health bill that was  passed.""  We have yet to have 1 person out of  over 20 meetings say that they like the  bill as it is, so I think we need to admit  that we have made a mistake. It was  wrong. The benefits are wrong. The  surtax is wrong.  The only decision  today  is do we  repeal it or do we amend it? I do not  believe you can Band-Aid this one. I  think the patient is dead.  I do not  think  there  is anything  more  refreshing  to  the  people  of  America than to have us stand up in  these hallowed halls and  say,  ""We  made a mistake. We're going to correct  it.""  A few minutes ago from this podium  one of my colleagues said that we do  not want to throw the baby out with  the bath water. Madam Speaker,  I  think it is time to throw out the bath  water, throw out the baby, and start  over again.  VOTE ""NO"" ON STARK GRADISON AMENDMENT  <Mr. KYL asked and was given per mission  to address  the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1989
1328,1018,16,Mr. KYL.," Madam Speaker,  if we  thought that the seniors of this coun try were upset over the Catastrophic  Health Care Act,  ""We  ain't  seen  nothin yet,"" if we are so foolish as to  pass  the Stark-Gradison amendment  later on today.  There is little doubt that the public  outcry from our seniors will result in  the repeal of the act. We will do that  today; but my colleagues, do not think  for a minute that you can vote for  repeal of the act and then do the sen iors a favor by voting for Stark-Gradi son. If we do  that, our seniors will  rightly come down on us like a ton of  bricks.  Stark-Gradison will become an epi thet as harsh as  the Catastrophic  Health Care Act. It takes the one non catastrophic provision from  the act,  drugs, and recodifies  it, but with a  catch. Now instead of the drug benefit  being paid for mostly by seniors of  more financial means, all seniors will  have to pay for it equally as part of  the part B premium. That is a $10.20  per month increase by the year 1993.  ""Don't do me any more of your  favors,"" our seniors are saying. Vote  ""no"" on Stark-Gradison.

1368,1096,16,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  one of the things that I have puzzled  about in my mind is  to answer the  question that I asked the proponents  of this motion to strike the fairness  doctrine  in  this  bill: How  do we  achieve an ability to respond to a con trary point of view without it?  In the debates that I have partici pated in on this issue in the Commit tee on Energy and Commerce and on  the  floor  of  the House, my  good  friend, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr.  TAUKE], to be honest with you, I have  never heard a  rational argument of  how we get a recalcitrant radio station  to give an opportunity  for another  point of view without this doctrine.  0 1700  To leave  to the tender mercies of  those who manage a radio station by  placing on  their  tender  conscience  whether or not they will respond in  time to give the other point of view is  a  test of one's credulity as  to  the  nature of human nature itself.  But the point I want to get across is  what is the harm of having this in our  law? What is the harm of having a law  which says that if  the owners of a  radio station want to give us a bias on  a particular point of view  that the  people on the other side have an op portunity of having their views heard?  I do not understand what is wrong  with that.  ",1989

That  is  indeed what the so-called  fairness doctrine in this bill would do.  Until its proper repeal 2 years ago,  the fairness doctrine required broad casters to air opposing views on issues  of public  importance. Proponents of  the fairness doctrine said the airwaves  were so scarce that we couldn't trust  our broadcasters to be fair.  Who could be against laws requiring  something called fairness?  What sounded so noble, though, had  nothing  in  common with  fairness.

1391,1135,16,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I have just addressed myself to the  pending Eastern Airlines strike, and I  alluded to the fact that since deregula tion 78 airlines have gone into bank ruptcy. I think it is time for us to re regulate the airline industry.  I am frank to admit on this floor  that when this whole push toward de regulation was in effect, when we were  talking about it, I was one of those  who was very much in favor of break ing up AT&T. I  thought that would  provide for free competition. I have to  admit publicly  that  is probably  the  worst decision I have made in my life.  It has been a  fiasco  since  then. It  worked well before. The prices were  lower. There was regulation, and the  American people were getting good  telephone service at reasonable rates.  We deregulated the airline industry.  I thought that was a great idea. But I  was wrong, and so were many others  in  this body-as well as many who  have left this body. We made a mis take. It is time to bring back some reg ulation  in  the airline  industry. You  would not have 78 airlines who have  gone bankrupt at this point,  if that  were  the case. You have  to provide  some help and assistance. What you  now have is a situation where an air line comes along, a  stronger airline  cuts its rates, gives better service, and  drives out  the  little company. The  little company closes its doors. Then  the bigger company cuts back on its  services,  raises  the  rates,  and  the  American people pay the price.  I believe that it is time now, not 6  months from now, not 2 years from  now,  for the U.S. Congress to enact  legislation providing for reregulation  of the airline industry.  I am frank to say that although I do  not have a bill drafted at this point, I  am confident there are others in this  body who will be prepared to join me  in urging the Commerce Committee to  conduct prompt hearings with respect  to  the  subject of  reregulation. We  cannot do  less. Ask any one of the  Members of this body who flies to his  or her home,  ""Are you getting  the  quality of service  that you used  to  get?"" Look at the rates you pay. You  can fly for a lesser amount all the way  across the country from New York to  Los Angeles, where there is some com petition, than you can from Washing ton to a place like Nashville or to a  place like Charleston, WV, or Colum bus, OH, because there is no competi tion there. You have to hope that you  can find an airline that will be going  at a convenient hour of the day.  If we had the temerity, if we had the  judgment in yesteryear to deregulate  this industry, then we ought to public ly admit our wrong, and we ought to  publicly come  forward and support  legislation to reregulate the industry.  I will be working, and hopefully, I  will be able to obtain the support and  assistance of such distinguished Sena tors as my colleague from West Virgin ia, who is in the presiding chair at the  moment, and possibly my friend from  Wisconsin, Senator KoHL.  I  believe  this is the kind of legislation we need.  I will work on it promptly, and I will  introduce legislation to that effect.  I have a hunch that I will find more  of my colleagues ready to support me  on this bill than maybe many of the  others that I have seen fit to intro duce in the past.  I yield the floor.

Every room has a paying tenant. A bank  can foreclose on an individual room, but not  on the whole house. The landlord has many  partners, but no one can challenge his man agement of the property.  This  is  the house  that Frank Lorenzo  built.  As the chairman of Texas Air Corp., Mr.  Lorenzo presides over some of the nation's  sickest airlines-Continental, Eastern,  the  corporate  remnants  of  People Express,  Frontier and New York Air. All are losing  money at some of the fastest rates in avia tion history and rank as the industry's big gest debtors. As such, they are blocked by  their  lenders  from paying profit  to  the  parent company for years.  Yet thanks to Mr. Lorenzo's masterly cor porate architecture, huge losses at subsidi aries don't stop cash from moving to the  top. While the airlines' public debt holders  anxiously watch the deficits close in on half  a billion dollars, the parent company keeps  raking in from the airlines an assortment of  management fees, airplane rents, airport gate rents, fuel-purchase commissions and  other payments.  ""Upstreaming"" of cash,  company officials call this, and it totaled  more than $150 million for the parent last  year.  Perhaps most  remarkable, Mr. Lorenzo  has built one of the most leveraged major  corporations in the nation while insulating  Texas Air-and himself-from most of the  cost and much of the risk. As a group, the  Texas Air companies have piled up $5.4 bil lion in debt. Last year they had to pay $623  million simply to service the long-term part  of that debt-an interest bill higher than  the annual revenue of each of nearly 100  companies at the bottom of the Fortune  500. Yet parent Texas Air paid creditors  barely one-tenth that amount.  REPORTS TO SEC  Now, reports filed with the Securities and  Exchange Commission show how far  the  airlines have  to go. The  reports, among  other things, list some $7 billion in lease-re lated liabilities that are invisible on the bal ance sheet, and they show that Texas Air's  once-huge cash reserves were dwindling last  year at a rate of more than $1 million a day.  The situation  is not without  irony;  the  entire Texas Air empire, after a year that  ",1989

1407,1174,16,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, I thank  Senator BIDEN,  the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, the manager of  this legislation, for his courtesy and  his  unanimous-consent  agreement  that has allowed me to present this  amendment.  In brief, Mr. President, the amend ment that I will send to the desk for  D' .AMATO,  myself,  Senators  BoND,  LoTT, and perhaps other Senators, per mits any public housing agency to ex clude from its grievance hearing proce dure any grievance concerning an evic tion  for criminal activity.  It would  permit the public housing authorities  to proceed directly to judicial eviction  in a State landlord-tenant court sub ject to the due process requirements,  of course, of the 14th amendment. It  permits more expeditious eviction of  criminals who prey on public housing  residents by the sale and use of drugs  and with the associated violence and  other criminal activities that too often  accompany the sale and use of drugs.  The other element of  the amend ment is that it also requires the public  housing authorities to inform the post  office when a tenant has been evicted.  The reason for that is simply to stop  the drug dealers  from  returning  to  their former places of criminal activity  in order to get their mail. Frequently,  that mail contains checks. Some of  them may be government issue. If that  part of  the amendment  is adopted,  they will, of course, have to go to the  post office,  not  to  a  place where  women are trying to raise children in  as secure an environment as possible.  Mr. President, I have had a number  of personal experiences visiting public  housing  communities  in my  home  State of Pennsylvania. One occasion  involved Secretary Kemp, who came  up  to Pennsylvania and visited  the  Richard  Alan  Homes  community.  When he was there, he noticed four  men seated around a barrel in which  there was a fire. He asked the tenant  management leader who those people  were. It was explained to him that the  four men were crack dealers and that  their presence was as common as cold  in February, which it then was.  I wish I could say that is an uncom mon occurrence, but to the contrary, it  is daily-daily, not  just at Richard  Alan Homes but virtually every public  housing community across this Nation.  The families who are trying to raise  children  in  that  federally  assisted  housing are particularly at risk. They  are at risk because having drug dealers  around is dangerous. At one housing  community I visited there is scarcely a  night where there is not shooting in  the street right next to the houses in  which people are trying to raise their  families.  It is an attraction for other criminal  activities and, worst of all,  it invites  young people to be tempted into the  high stakes, high risk, but sometimes  high return, game of drug dealing.  I do not know  if anybody remem bers, but in August there was a sensa tional  report out of Lebanon, PA,  where some children in a playground  were  found playing with grass clip pings and sugar in little plastics bags,  and somebody had  the presence of  mind to ask them what they are doing.  The answer was, ""We are playing drug  dealer."" These, Mr. President, were 6-,  7-, and 8-year-old kids. To have  the  real game of dealing in crack and co caine and marijuana played out  in  front of them in their front yards is  something we should do everything in  our power, our  legitimate power  to  stop.  I am a  realist. I know we are not  going to be able to clear the Nation's  streets of drug dealers overnight or  even as quickly as we would like, but  at the very least we ought to be able  to get them, with proper due process  protections, out of taxpayer-supported  housing just as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, the present law does  not permit us to get them out in many  cases any time soon, let alone in any  kind of reasonable time frame. What I  am producing, expedited eviction pro cedures, will make certain that drug  dealers cannot stick around because of  red tape.  Let me take a moment to describe  the problem. The problem  is  that  under current law,  if someone is ac cused of even criminal activity, drug related criminal activity-dealing  in  drugs-they have a  right to what is  called an administrative hearing. That  administrative hearing and the process  that is involved is very lengthy. It can  take 6 to 12 months, and it is also non binding in this respect.  You get to the end of the process 6  or 12 months later and one of  two  findings are made. One is that the de fendant is found in favor of. At that  point, the game is over and no further  action can be taken against the tenant  that was accused in spite of the fact  that  the procedures  for  appointing  what is in effect an arbitration panel  and choosing,  if you will,  the third  person who is supposed to be impartial  or just as random, if you will, as if you  chose that third person by lot.  If on the other hand the tenant is  found  against,  one might  conclude  that, all right, then the tenant is sub ject to eviction. But that is not the  case. What  is  the case  is  that  the  tenant now may be brought to a regu lar court with all the due process pro tections and then tried.  The question I simply submit to the  Senate is why go  through a process  that  is up  to 12 months  long  that  delays the inevitable day in court for  just that long? Why not let the public  housing authority go directly to court  in the first place?  Some people will say, well, public  housing authorities do not have to do  that. They can seek a waiver of that  administrative  hearing process. Mr.  President, to an extent that is  true.  There are certain tests that have to be  met in order for a public housing au thority  to  seek a waiver.  I believe  those waivers have to be sought on an  tort-by-tort basis. What is it that has  ",1989

1444,1213,16,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, this  is an amendment which deals with the  Secretary of Defense and  the oper ation of the military involved in the  war on drugs.  Mr. President,  I  am offering  this  amendment to ensure better coordina tion between the Department of De fense and State and local law enforce ment officials along  the Southwest  border when the DOD undertakes a  drug operation.  I have cleared  this with both the  ranking member,  Senator WARNER,  and the chairman of the Authorizing  Committee,  Senator  NuNN.  The  amendment I am sponsoring requires  the Secretary of Defense to consult and I underscore consult-with Oper ation Alliance, which is the civilian an tinarcotics  task  force  composed  of  Federal, State, and local law enforce ment officials  along  the Southwest  border charged with the coordinating  of drug  interdiction activities, when  the Secretary of Defense undertakes  any drug-enforcement operations  in  the Southwest.  The reason  this amendment is of fered is that most recently the mili tary under the direction apparently of  Secretary Cheney decided  to deploy  and involve a large number of forces  on the Southwest border. In doing so,  they failed  to even alert or consult  with the Southwest Border Alliance,  which is the umbrella organization op erated by the Federal Government, by  the Border Patrol, in particular, that  deals with local State, and Federal law  enforcement officials.  This amendment merely says  that  the Secretary shall consult before or  during  the  time  they are deploying  troops along the Southwest border.

1467,1330,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President,  it is with great honor that I introduce  this amendment to S. 13, the Veterans  Benefits and Health Care Act of 1989.  I am doubly honored  that my col league Senator DoLE is joining me as a  cosponsor. This amendment will desig nate  the  Veterans  Administration  Medical Center at Leavenworth, KS,  as the ""Dwight D. Eisenhower Depart ment  of Veterans Affairs Medical  Center:   First, President Eisenhower  had very close ties with the State of  Kansas. In the town of Abilene, KS,  can be found not only the Eisenhower  Museum and Library, but also his  fam.lly home and final resting place.  Second, next year wlll commemorate  the 100th anniversary of President Ei senhower's birth. As members of the  Eisenhower Centennial Commission,  Senator DoLE and I wlll be engaged in  a number of activities throughout the  country. In that regard, the renaming  of the Leavenworth hospital in ""Ike's ..  honor would certainly be appropriate.  As I mentioned before, President Ei senhower had very deep Kansas roots.  Raised and schooled  in Abilene, he  graduated from Abilene High school  and  began  his  celebrated military  career soon  thereafter by attending  West  Point Military Academy.  In  order to hone his military planning  and leadership skllls, Ike returned to  Kansas to attend the Command and  General Staff Course at Fort Leaven worth. From  there, one need only  refer  to basic U.S. history  texts  to  learn of General Eisenhower's achieve ments and contributions to a nation  he dearly loved. Assuming command  of the European theater during World  War II, he led the greatest amphibious  operation in battle history, the Nor mandy invasion.  His  achievements  as President of  the United States were equally histor ic, and he proved to be one of the most  popular Presidents of all  time. His  Midwestern roots can be found in the  legacy of his Presidency: a genuinely  bipartisan domestic and foreign policy;  a Federal Government living within its  means;  significant  international ex changes founded on the notion that  reasonable and sound negotiation can  be effective; and a national commit ment to education, science and tech nology. He was a decent and good-hu mored man, a strong leader, with a  vision both practical and far sighted.  For these reasons, I believe designat ing the Leavenworth VA Hospital in  President Eisenhower's honor would  be a fitting tribute.  ",1989
1468,1330,16,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  as  ranking minority member of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise  today in support of S. 13, as reported  by the committee. This bill, the Veter ans Benefits and Health Care Act of  1989 proposes to make significant im provements in veterans' benefits and  health-care programs administered by  the Department of Veterans Affairs  [V A1. I am pleased to support this bill  and I urge my colleagues to do to.  S. 13, as reported contains six titles:  compensation  and  pension,  health  care,  education  and  employement,  home loan, memorial affairs, minority  affairs, and miscellaneous.  I believe  this bill is one of the most comprehen sive veterans' bllls ever considered by  the Senate. I wlll not discuss each of  the over 100 provisions contained in S.  13.  I  refer my colleagues  to Senate  Report No. 101-126 for the details of  each provision. However, I wlll briefly  highlight a  few provisions of special  interest to me.  COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE  Mr. President, S. 13 would provide a  cost-of-living adjustment  [COLA1  to  be effective December 1, 1989, for the  2.19 million veterans  receiving com pensation for disabilities and illnesses  incurred or  aggravated while  they  were on active duty. The COLA would  be equal to the percentage that wlll be  provided for Social Security and VA  pension recipients. The COLA is cur rently estimated to be 5.2 percent. The  same COLA would be paid to depend ents and survivors of those who died  on active duty or as result of a service connected disability.  HEALTH CARE  Mr. President, the health care provi sions relate to several primary issues:  mental health, extension and expan sion of certain VA general health-care  programs, and health-care personnel  issues.  RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  Mr.  President,  this  bill  contains  many provisions which are designed to  improve V A's ability  to attract and  retain health-care personnel, particu larly  registered nurses. VA,  like  its  counterparts in the Department of De fense and the private sector, is feeling  the effects of the nursing shortage.  The real solution is  to increase the  pool of  individuals who want to be  nurses. In my view, this must begin at  the  junior and high  school  levels.  However, in the mean time the health care industry must address the short age in a variety of ways. This bill at tempts to address educational and pay  issues. Although  I  do not  support  every provision in this portion of the  bill, I am hopeful that my concerns  can be addressed  in  the conference  process.  TOBACCO AUTHORITY  Mr. President, S. 13 contains a provi sion which would repeal the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs authority to pro vide free tobacco products to veterans  receiving hospital or domiciliary care.  I believe the current VA authority au thorizing  the Secretary  to  furnish  such tobacco products to hospitalized  veterans to be inconsistent with cur rent VA practice. VA has not utilized  this authority in over 20 years. We are  living in a health conscious environ ment and in light of the information  regarding the health hazards associat ed with smoking, I believe this provi sion makes a lot of sense.  This repeal would not prohibit the  VA  from  selling  tobacco products that general authority wlll remain in  section 4201 of title 38. This provision  would, however, delete specific statu tory reference regarding the furnish ing of free tobacco to veterans in hos pitals and domiciliaries.  NONINSTITUTIONAL CARE  Mr. President, I am please that the  committee bill  includes  a  provision  which requires VA to conduct a 4-year  pilot program of  furnishing,  under  contract, health,  rehabilitative,  and  health-related services  in noninstitu tional settings. Health-related services  would  include such things as home maker,  transportation, and bathing/  dressing assistance. Specifically,  this  provision would authorize VA to fur nish such services to veterans who are  eligible for, and otherwise in need, of  nursing home care; and are either re ceiving or needing that care primarily  for the treatment of a service-connect ed disability, or have service-connected  disabilities  rated  at  50  percent or  more.  Let me describe a case of a veteran  who would be assisted by this provi sion. An Alaskan veteran is in need of,  and receives, community nursing home  care for  the treatment of a service connected disability. VA is paying for  his care and wlll do so indefinitely be cause he needs care for his service-con nected disability. His care costs VA  $8,000  per month.  This  veteran's  fam.lly wants him at home. They are  willing  to  take the responsibility of  caring for him but wlll need some  help. This fam.lly cannot understand  why VA  lacks the legal authority to  provide such services at home but wlll  pay $8,000 monthly to keep him insti",1989

1470,1343,16,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, the New York  Times lead editorial of September 30 correctly  points out the glaring need for a comprehen sive  child  development  policy  for  children  under 5.  Indeed, a  joint statement issued by  the President and the Governors at the edu cation summit last week recognized the need  to help poor children ""get off to a good start  in school."" We, as a nation, can ill afford to  ignore  the benefits derived  from  successful  early childhood programs. The Head Start ex pansion and early childhood education provi sions  included  in H.R.  3299,  the Omnibus  Reconciliation Act, would help us  fulfill  this  need.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I am in serting the Times editorial in the RECORD.  [From the New York Times, Sept. 30, 1989]  OVERLOOKED IN VIRGINIA: LITTLE KIDS  As he stood at the conference on Ameri can education this week, president Bush saw  only dimly the one need that stands out  most sharply on the horizon: the youngest  children.  Government programs to help preschool  children have proved successful. If children  aren't ready for school-in health, curiosity  or  self-esteem-they  will  likely  suffer  through their school years. But despite urg ings  from  the  assembled governors, Mr.  Bush only halfheartedly embraced the job  of helping to ensure that all children are  mentally  and  physically  prepared  for  school.  The  two-day meeting in Charlottesville,  Va., of the President and the nation's gover nors merits praise. It created a cooperative,  bipartisan spirit on a subject of great na tional importance. It yielded agreement to  develop national performance goals,  seek  more flexibility in the use of Federal funds,  restructure  the public school system and  strengthen accountability  through annual  report cards.  There  is  little question  that American  education needs  a  dramatic overhaul. A  series of articles in The Times this week  demonstrated  that  students  are  leaving schools without adequate  job skills. That  threatens  the nation's economic security  and its social fabric.  Mr. Bush pledged a new ""social compact""  for his Administration, parents, educators  and state politicians to improve the chances  of all youngsters. The participants in the  conference agreed to establish national edu cation goals  like  improving math and sci ence skills, and reducing the dropout rate.  And the White House and the governors  also agreed to try to find ways that would  give states and local school districts more  flexibility in using existing Federal funds.  But as Gov.

1471,1356,16,Mr. HUTIO.," Mr. Speaker,  I am very sup portive of this legislation to name the veter ans' outpatient clinic in Daytona Beach, FL, as  the William V. Chappell, Jr., Veterans' Outpa tient Clinic. As a member of the Florida dele gation I am well aware of the hard work of Bill  Chappell  in establishing the veterans' outpa tient clinic in Daytona Beach. I had the privi lege of visting with Bill in his district on sever al occasions and each time a number of his  constituents mentioned to me their deep ap preciation  for Congressman Chappell's work  in getting this facility so that the veterans of  that area could receive needed medical atten tion.  Bill Chappell, before his death on March 3  of this year, was a longtime statesman in our  Sunshine State of Florida. His record of public  service  is among  the most distinguished of  our political leaders. Bill, who was a veteran  of the Navy in which he was an aviator, was  always in the forefront of fighting for veterans'  benefits. He was active in this manner in both  the Florida Legislature, in which he served as  Speaker of the Florida House of Representa tives, as well as in the U.S. Congress. Bill was  a very active member of the Appropriations  Committee and served as the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations. He  was a true patriot who believed  in and sup ported a strong defense for our Nation. There fore,  it is altogether fitting that this facility in  Daytona Beach be named William. V. Chap pell,  Jr., Veterans' Outpatient Clinic.  I am  pleased  to be among  the supporters of the  legislation to accomplish this purpose.  TRIBUTE TO SYNTHIA SUZANNE  COCKRELL  HON. RICHARD A. GEPHARDT  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 3, 1989  ",1989
1472,1356,16,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to congratulate Ms. Synthia Cockrell, who  is  being  recognized by  the Department of De fense as an outstanding Federal employee  with a disability for 1989 in an awards cere mony today. The strength of America is rooted  in its workers, and Synthia's accomplishments  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  are a heartening example of the vigor of the  American spirit.  Synthia Suzanne Cockrell was born  totally  deaf, has no peripheral vision due  to para lyzed eye muscles, and suffers from amblyo pia, which means that she can only use one  eye at a time.  Synthia worked throughout high school as a  keypunch operator for Sample Brothers, and  she was  hired  by  the Defense Mapping  Agency Aerospace Center  in St. Louis, MO,  shortly after her high school graduation. She  has been promoted twice in the last 6 years,  and she has received several outstanding per formance ratings. These achievements are es pecially impressive considering  the nature of  her work; without peripheral vision and only  the use of one eye at a time, she must con stantly move her head to scan documents and  to check appropriate key-ins. Synthia has ex hibited superior performance, and she is still  improving.  Synthia's determination has proven her to  be an employee who is reliable, conscientious  and courageous. Because of  this, she has  been an  inspiration to her fellow employees.  Synthia has shown unusual fortitude and she  has  never  shunned  responsibility,  always  keeping a healthy outlook and accepting any  challenges that may come her way.  It is an honor to recognize and pay tribute  to Synthia Cockrell, who clearly personifies  the contributions and abilities of the physically  challenged in today's society, and I feel cer tain that I speak for the entire House of Rep resentatives when I wish Synthia all the best.  IN HONOR OF GEORGE HAGO PIAN,  CHAMPION OF VETER ANS  HON. DAN ROSTENKOWSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 3, 1989  ",1989
1473,1356,16,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Sp.eaker, I rise to  address the House on a matter of great sad ness  for me-the passing of the Honorable  George Hagopian, alderman of the city of Chi cago and champion of the veteran, at age 68,  on September 1, 1989.  George Hagopian was a man of the highest  principles and  the deepest commitment. He  was also one of the kindest men I have ever  met.  I must have had hundreds of conversations  and meetings with George. Yet,  there is one  incident which I will always think of first in re membering of him. One of my daughters was  suffering a grave  illness, and  I was worried  sick. George went out of his way to track me  down. He offered  the simple comfort of his  spirituality and he asked what he could do for  me.  The call had the most remarkable effect on  me.  It lifted me up when  I needed  it most.  That one phone call captures what George  Hagopian meant to me and I will never forget  him.  As a dedicated elected official, George dis tinguished himself  in many good causes on  behalf of the people and businesses of his  Northwest Side 30th Ward. However, George  October 3, 1989  reserved his most passionate work for a con stituency which stretched far beyond his ward  lines-the veteran.  It can truly be said that George yielded to  no one in the protection and promotion of the  interests of  those who served our country,  and their families.  He proposed the Chicago City Council Com mittee on Veterans Affairs, fought for its cre ation, and served with distinction as  its first  chairman. A veteran himself, he threw himself  into the championship of causes and positions  backed by his wartime peers. Sometimes this  embroiled him in raging controversies, such as  the question of the use of the American flag in  artistic and political expression. His devout pa triotism was never more forcefully displayed,  nor with greater effect.  George also had a deeply spiritual side. His  study of the Bible and biblical history was con tagious, resulting in a regular study group in volving a number of aldermen and other local  leaders. He was honored by his colleagues by  being asked  to deliver the  invocation at city  council meetings. George took that responsi bility very seriously, and did it beautifully.  His devotion to things spiritual was matched  by his pride in his ethnic heritage. Born of Ar menian  immigrants, George never  forgot his  roots. Nor would he let others forget the tragic  events which fell upon his people at the turn  of  the century. His  faithfulness  to  the  task  made him my chief adviser on  that  terrible  event. I am sure that he also helped a great  many others to guard against the horrors of  genocide  in any  form.  In  that way, George  was protecting the past and the future.  George's commitments to God and  to the  Armenian people found common ground in his  generous involvement in St. Gregory the Illu minator Armenian Apostolic Church, at Nor mandy and Diversey  in Chicago.  In  fact, he  donated the very land on which it was built, al though he was hardly a wealthy man. He kept  all of his friends fully aware of the doings at  the  church,  and many  visited  there with  George.  In sum, Mr. Speaker,  this was a fine man  and I am proud to have called him my friend.  He will be terribly missed by his family, his col leagues, his constituency, and his city. My  sympathy and  that of my entire  family goes  out to his children, his grandchildren, and all  who loved him.  I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to  put this tribute to Alderman George Hagopian  into the permanent RECORD of the House. He  deserved to be so remembered.

I  think there are  many problems that we face that we  can handle statutorily without trivial izing  the Constitution. That  is my  fear.  I hope we pass a statute. I would  sooner have it without the expedited  procedure in it. I think that is a mis take, frankly, but I do not feel strong ly enough on it that I want to intro duce an amendment. But I hope we re frain  from  passing a  constitutional  amendment.  I know there is the passion of the  moment. There is a feeling we ought  to stand up and have that constitu tional amendment.

1477,1382,16,Mr. BUMPERS.," Before the Senator  from Illinois leaves the floor, I want to  commend him for what I consider to  be a very eloquent and concise state ment, and what I have to say is largely  redundant because he has already said  it so well.  Now I have never been favorably dis posed  toward  television  evangelists,  but  I  have  sort of separated Billy  Graham out from that crowd because  he said something one time that was  very impressive to me in San Francis co. He said people are always coming  up to him and saying: ""What would  Jesus say if he came back today?"" He  held up the Bible, and he said, ""He  would say exactly what he said the  first time.""  If James Madison and John Jay and  Alexander Hamilton were alive today,  they would say exactly what they said  the first time.  I agree with Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.,  who said that in Philadelphia in 1787  the greatest assembly of minds ever in  the history of the world congregated.  And we  the people of  the United  States are the recipients of that tre mendous wisdom. The Constitution is  the thing that has given us the great est organic law in the world. It is the  thing that has made us the second oldest living democracy in the world  next to little Iceland, where inciden tally, the literacy rate is 99.9 percent.  But my point is this: I said on this  floor dozens of times, when you start  talking about amending the Constitu tion, I belong to the wait-just-a-minute  club. I intend to vote for this bill. I am  deeply troubled by the expedited pro cedures. And there may be even a con stitutional problem with that.

1481,1408,16,Mr. WILSON.," Thank you, Mr. Presi dent.  Mr. President, I think the answer to  my friend from Delaware is to go back  to the definition which he offered for  ""defaced"" that is to be found in most  conventional dictionaries. ""Deface: To  destroy or mar the face of or looks of;  to disfigure.""  Mr. President,  that is why  in my  opening remarks I went to some pains  to make the semantic distinction be tween defacement as defined with the  definition that he has quoted and I  have just used again, between that act  and the act of defilement, which is not  nearly so permanent nor so violent.  ",1989
1482,1421,16,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," There is, I believe  P.nd hope, a theme to both these ad dresses. It is Schumpeter's great thesis  of the conquest of the private sector  by the public sector. It is that which  he thought would transform modern  society, not some Marxist convulsion  or recidivist repression. On September  14,  I  spoke of  this subject  to  the  annual  leadership conference of the  National Association of Independent  Colleges and Universities. On this oc casion I brought up the most recent of  our troubles, the decision by the De partment of Justice  to commence a  civil investigative demand, a process of  documentary  subpoena,  concerning  the possibility  that various colleges  and universities are in violation of the  antitrust laws by virtue of collusion in  setting tuition rates.  Think back a century ago to 1890  when Senator John Sherman of Ohio  carried his  famous antitrust  legisla tion. Do you suppose that he could  even have imagined that this law, de signed to restrain unethical and unde sirable business practices, could ever  have conceived that the law might one  day be turned against institutions of  learning? He was concerned with cor porations that make and sell things,  not institutions that conserve and ad vance  the culture. Yet here we are.  Universities and colleges  reduced  to  the statutory condition of factories.  One university president wrote  to  me recently: ""I believe that the funda mental question is the constitutional  status of nonprofits."" He is right. For  does anyone  in the nonprofit sector  have any  idea how far can be  the  reach  of  government  investigation? 1  Item. A small liberal arts college in  Virginia has recently been asked-re quired-by the Justice Department to  produce 60,000 documents.

1483,1434,16,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, we are  hard at work here trying to resolve a  number of difficult problems: passing  all the appropriation bills, avoiding a  sequester, dealing with the changes in  the  Soviet  system,  responding  to  events in Poland-the list goes on. And  because we  are  involved  in  those  events, we may not have noticed that  quietly, almost secretly, an important  era  in the history of mind may be  coming to an end-an era in which  man was the unchallenged master of  the chessboard.  Now some might not think of this as  significant. But they would be wrong.  Chess, Mr. President, represents more  than a game that challenges the intel lect; it also represents a movement in  human history away  from physical  warfare to symbolic combat. When the  game of chess was invented in ancient  Hindustan,  conflict began  to move  from the battlefield to the chessboard.  Great leaders came to be acclaimed for  their ability  to move knights rather  than kill them; strategic geniuses were  praised for their ability to make pawns  of marble rather than men. Castles  could be protected, knights could cam paign recklessly, a queen's honor de fended, an enemy's king deposed-all  without the loss of life or the shedding  of blood.  The game has a complexity that has  challenged great minds for centuries.  It has been said that there are more  possible moves in a chess game than  there  are  individual  atoms  in  the  entire universe. Yet now this greatest  test of mental power has been chal lenged by the nonhuman intellect of  the computer. It was once  thought  that  no  computer  program  could  match  the  inituitive  judgment  of  human masters. But the march of our  own technical progress, at which we  all marvel, is pushing us backward in  the final moves of a tragic endgame.  According to the New York Times,  researchers at Carnegie Mellon Uni versity  have developed  a  computer  chess program that has defeated sev eral grandmasters. Mr. President, I ask  that the article from last week's New  York Times which describes this omi nous  turn of events appear  in  the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks.  But Mr. President,  there  is  still  hope. Next month, this chess program  will challenge world champion Gary  Kasparov. Now I want the record to  show that I approve of advancements  in computer technology, but I still like  the idea of humans defeating comput ers. I like even more the fact that in  this battle for supremacy against the  machine, it does not matter that Ka sparov is a Soviet citizen; what matters  is that he is a human being.  If we could adopt the same perspec tive when we react to other challenges  which we as human beings face-the  challenges of war, environmental de struction, poverty, and  the rest-we  might elevate the game of government  beyond  a  simple  struggle  between  Democrats  and  Republicans,  First  World and Third World, Communist  and  free. We might  recognize  the  value of an individual human being in  an  increasingly complex world. We  might begin  to find a new strategy  that would see us all working in con cert to force our common enemies to  resign.  Let us root for Kasparov, Mr. Presi dent. He is our mate.  The article follows:  [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 19891  CHEss-PLAYING COMPUTER CLOSING IN ON  CHAMPIONS  <By Robert Byrne>  The  time when a computer wrests  the  world chess championship from a human  being may be approaching. Last Thanksgiving, Deep Thought, which won the world  computer chess championship in May, de feated a grandmaster, Bent Larsen of Den mark, who is ranked 96th among all chess  players in the world. And just recently, this  same computer defeated another grandmas ter-me.  Deep Thought, developed by researchers  at Carnegie-Mellon University  in  Pitts burgh, beat Mr. Larsen  in  the Software  Toolworks  Open  Tournament  in  Beach, Calif., a competition featuring sever al grandmasters. Though  it  lost  its only  other  game with  a  grandmaster, Deep  Thought went on to tie for first place in the  event, the first time a computer had shared  the top prize in a mixed field of humans and  machines.  Deep Thought, combines enormous speed .  and computational power with sophisticated  analysis,  itself developed by computer, of  the relative values of the chess pieces de pending where they are and what stage the  game has reached. The computer has also  been trained to judge the relative merits of  differing lines of attack.  Long  COMPUTER VS. CONTENDER  The  accomplishment  is  extraordinary.  Last fall Hitech, another computer devel oped at Carnegie-Mellon, defeated the 74year-old grandmaster Arnold Denker in a  match. But Mr. Larsen, a regular champion ship contender in the 1960's and 1970's, is  still playing near his top strength. He has a  rating of 2580 from the International Chess  Federation, whose ratings are computed by  weighting  tournament  results  by  the  strength of their participants. Mr. Denker's  rating is 2295 and mine is 2465; the world  champion, Gary Kasparov of  the Soviet  Union, has a rating of 2775, 5 points below  the  all-time  high, Bobby Fischer's  last  rating of 2780.  After playing Deep Thought, I would say  it is not yet ready to mount a serious chal lenge  to Mr. Kasparov,  though  they are  scheduled to play two exhibition games Oct.  22 at the New York Academy of Art at 419  Lafayette St. in Greenwich Village.  Deep Thought was constructed by five  graduate students in the Computer Science  Department of Carnegie-Mellon who often  play against one of  the best commercial  chess programs, Mephisto. They win some  and lose some against Mephisto, but they  are unable to give their own creation any  kind of opposition at all.  Deep Thought  calculates  incomparably  faster than any human, speeding along to  view 720,000 possible arrays of chess pieces  on a board every second. The key to  its  speed are two custom processors, each with  a very large integrated chip. The chip was  invented by Feng-Hsiung Hsu of Taiwan,  who devised it as part of his work toward a  doctorate and who also designed the circuit  board, which has about 100 other standard  chips.  ""BRUTE FORCE"" AND OTHER VIRTUES  There is nothing special about the host  computer, a Sun 4, and Deep Thought can  be adapted to run on any powerful work sta tion or computer. But ""brute force"" calcula tion, as computer experts call it, is not Deep  Thought's only virtue. It can also evaluate  the signal features of chess positions, like  whether pawns are blocked by other pawns.  This was  the  contribution  of Andreas  Nowatzyk of West Germany.  Chess pieces move in different ways and  some are more powerful than others. Bish ops move only on diagonals;  rooks move  only horizontally or vertically. The queen,  ",1989

1486,1447,16,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to join my col league, BRIAN DoNNELLY, in sponsoring  this amendment to repeal the Medi care Catastrophic Act. I recognize that  it is unusual for Congress to enact a  major program one year and repeal it  the next-but regardless of the best  intentions  of my  colleagues  who  framed this law-I see no other alter native. The Congress should admit it  made a mistake and vote  today  to  repeal.  Every since  the Depression years,  Americans have been told to save for  their own retirement. Now-as a result  of the catastrophic surtax-senior citi zens who sacrificed during their work  lives to provide for their own retire ment needs have been singled out to  pay  the highest marginal  tax  rates  borne by any Americans.  Proponents of catastrophic contend  that those who receive new benefits  and can afford it should pay for the  benefits. That sounds fair-but in fact,  under the law senior citizens who have  saved must pay not only the cost of  their own benefits-but also the cost  of benefits for six other people-in cluding those who paid no premiums  for  the coverage, such as  those dis abled by AIDS.  That last point deserves special at tention. People under 65 who are dis abled are also eligible for catastrophic  benefits-and  this  flawed  law subsi dizes  the cost of  their benefits by  taxing our Nation's elderly.  This is just plain bad economic and  social policy. In effect, we've told the  American people-don't save any more  for your own  retirement needs-be cause if you do, your savings and pen sions will be penalized when you reach  65.  What seniors get in return is bene fits that few needed or wanted-and  which only a  few will ever  receive.  When  this program was enacted, 80  percent of all senior citizens already  had some form of catastrophic cover age. But the new law preempts both  private insurance-which cost an aver age of $420 a year-and Medicaid cov erage for the poor-which was paid for  by the general treasury. In their place,  it will  tax each senior citizen up  to  $1,500 a year by 1993.  And the surtax will only go up and  up  to pay  the mushrooming costs.  When Catastrophic was enacted, CBO  estimated it would cost $32 billion over  5 year. The most recent estimates are  now $48 billion. Estimates for drugs  alone have almost doubled. And given  our experience with Medicare cost es timates over the past 20 years, you can  be sure  that even  these  latest esti mates are still grossly low.  Mr. Chairman,  repealing Medicare  Catastrophic is the only way to assure  that we will  eliminate  the  unfair  surtax. Any  hastily  prepared  ap proach, such as  the Stark-Gradison  amendment would give the surtax an  opportunity to rise again-because a  vote for Stark-Gradison would leave it  up  to a House-Senate conference  to  bargain on Medicare Catastrophic and  the deal would be wrought by  those who still believe in the surtax.  If you want to see  the surtax re pealed, pure and simple, vote for Don nelly-Archer.  It's the only vote you  can be sure of.  The repeal of Medicare Catastrophic  is not the end, but the beginning of a  comprehensive effort by a wiser Con gress  to reform our Nation's health  and  long-term  care  system.  Only  repeal will let us work from a clean  slate.  I urge Members to vote for Donnel ly-Archer.  ",1989
1487,1447,16,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, it has been said here  by my  distinguished  friend  from  Texas, ""Repeal the surtax."" That is  going to happen anyway.  There was a problem with the fi nancing of catastrophic. The surtax  hit middle-income taxpayers and sen iors too heavily. The answer was to fix  that, not to fracture the whole pro gram.  What we  are  seeing here,  I  am  afraid,  is a paralysis in government.  Last week,  in  terms of  the capital  gains tax, we had paralysis by polar ization. This week on catastrophic we  have a different form of paralysis. It is  government by default, a government  by passiveness.  In  terms of Congress, we are  re sponding  to misinformation, and we  are responding to pressure. In terms of  the President, where is he? he is the  invisible executive. Instead of a bully  pulpit, we have an empty chair.  Some  are  saying,  and my distin guished colleague from Texas has said  so, ""Let us take another look,"" but I  do  not  think  that  is what  repeal  means. Repeal means a continuation  of the old problem. Repeal is not reex amination by Members of this body. It  is retreat.  0 1230  Is it likely that as the budget crisis  worsens and an election nears we are  going to act on thorny health issues?  Will failure to meet any part of a $10  billion need as in this program truly  enhance the chances to tackle a $50  billion program?  Full home and nursing care.  Is  it  likely  that  the  repeal of any  sem blance of relating benefits to income  will enhance the chances of a broad  attack on this problem? Not at all. Not  at all.  '  In a word, repeal is not reexamina tion, it is going to be retreat.  Let me add, what might seem like a  popular vote today is going to appear  less and less appealing as the popula tion ages and Washington equivocates.  ",1989
1488,1460,16,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 2% minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Russo), a  cosponsor  of  the  Russo-Donnelly Archer amendment.  ",1989
1489,1460,16,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Chairman, first I  would like to take this opportunity to  thank the chairman of the committee,  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ros TENKOWSKI]  for  doing  all  that he  could over the last several months to  reach a compromise on this piece of  legislation. He has given us opportuni ty in the committee, votes in the com mittee to deal with it, but there was  just no way to fix this bill. It is unfair  and it deserves to be repealed. It was  created with the best of  intentions,  but with an onerous funding mecha nism imposed on us by the President.  Health care coverage  is a problem  that faces not only senior citizens, but  every citizen in our country. We have  the most  sophisticated health  care  system in the world, but the accessibil ity to our great health care system is a  disgrace.  We spend more on health care than  any other industrialized nation, yet 37  million Americans  are uninsured, 7  million of whom are children. How can  it be that we spend 11.2 percent of our  GNP on health care and still have so  many Americans uninsured and under insured; when Canada, spending 8.6  percent of their GNP, and England,  spending  just  6.1  percent of  their  GNP, provide quality health care to  all of their citizens? It is because we  insist on dealing with health care in a  piecemeal  fashion. As a  result, our  health care system is needlessly com plex, incredibly expensive, and fails to  meet the needs of large numbers of  our citizens. A  recent  report shows  that 25 percent of the money we spend  on health care is wasted, thrown down  the drain. The health care system in  the United States needs  to be  re formed. This reform should have as its  goal universal access to health care for  every citizen.  We should make the same commit ment to health care that we made to  putting a man on the Moon and devel oping  a  national  highway  system.  Until we make universal health care a  national priority, we will continue to  have a health care system that the  young  cannot  afford,  that  the old  cannot  afford,  and  that  the  poor  cannot afford.  I appeal to every citizen in America,  both young and old,  to make a com mitment to urge our leaders to start  down the road  to establishing a na tional health care system. We should  demand that of our leaders. We should  send our postcards, send our letters,  call our Representatives, call our Sen ators and call the President, tell them  we want universal health care cover age and we deserve no less.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  today  to make  this  commitment.  Repeal the Catastrophic Health Care  Program.  Vote  for  the Donnelly Russo-Archer amendment and begin  today the debate to establish a univer sal health care system that delivers  the best quality health care to all citi zens at an affordable cost. To do less  would be a national disgrace.  ",1989
1490,1460,16,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr.  SAXTON].  ",1989
1491,1460,16,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  to ex press my  support  for  the  amendment  to  repeal  the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage  Act.  The time has come to wipe the slate clean,  and  to come  to grips with  the  fact  that this  program-despite its good  intentions-is fun damentally flawed.  Not to mince words, our older constituents  are vivid about the cost of this program, and  the prospect of paying a surtax up to $800 in  the first year.  But, Mr. Chairman,  it goes beyond  that.  They also see a future of uncontrolled, esca lating costs for a program that does not even  begin  to deal with  their most pressing con cern-long-term health care.  Earlier this year,  I wanted  to  find out just  how strong  the sentiment against  the Catastrophic Care Program was. I circulated an in formal survey in my congressional district.  Thousands of  responses poured  into my  office, and no less than 96 percent emphati cally said  this health care program was not  what they wanted.  Mind you, this was before the Congression al Budget Office issued  its report saying  the  program was bankrupt before  it has barely  begun.  It would be an exercise  in  futility  to  stand here today and try to justify a program  which will run $9 billion in the red in the first 5  years alone.  The decision at this point is clear. Seniors  say ""the cat must go,"" and they are right.  I  urge my colleagues  to support  this  repeal  amendment. And  I urge  them  to make  this  repeal measure stick by rejecting  the reform  amendment which will follow.  I can understand and appreciate the fine in tentions of my colleagues who wish to retain  the drug benefit, and  in doing so, salvage  some remnants of the Catastrophic Care Pro gram. But now is not the time to be jumping  for a quick fix.  Again, we must wipe  the slate clean, and  we  should  reopen  the whole  health  care  debate. We should be moving  toward  long term, nursing home-type care. That  is what  our seniors want, and that's what they need.  ",1989

However,  I  take  issue with argu ments made by some in this Chamber  that the public is only interested in  outright repeal. Repeal may appear at tractive today, but in the not too dis tant  future, Members may  regret  taking such unprecedented action.  Mr. Chairman, as one of the framers  of the Medicare catastrophic legisla tion, I thought we got it right the first  time. Two years of thoughtful delib eration and hard work went into devel oping the program.

1498,1473,16,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Chairman, over 1 year  ago I was visited by the lobbyist for one of our  Nation's most powerful senior citizens groups.  He demanded  I support the Medicare Cata strophic Coverage Act. I expressed to him my  serious concerns with the bill. He said he felt  it was  in  the best  interest of our Nation's  senior citizens and  likened  their bill  to be a  train coming down the track and that I could  either support them or be left at the station.  My reply was  I think  I'll just step aside and  listen for the crash.  Well, Mr. Chairman, the crash has occurred  and Congress is being called upon to clean up  the mess it created. Only 1 year ago, the Cat astrophic Coverage Act was hailed as a major  advancement for long-term health care for our  senior citizens.  I had serious problems with  the bill and was one of 72 Members who  voted against it.  Two overriding  factors guided my vote. At  town meetings  in my district senior citizens  called upon Congress to address their prime  concern of long-term care cost.  I heard their  voices and decided the present catastrophic  package did not meet  the criteria  they set  forth.  Now,  in a true catastrophic care package  the  long-term needs of our Nation's elderly  population would be directly addressed and  not simply swept over with a ""free-for-all ben efit expansion"" of the present system. Unfor tunately, the present catastrophic  law was a  generous benefit expansion which obviously  did not resolve the long-term care dilemma. In  fact, the package has actually harmed seniors  by way of prohibitive, duplicative costs and in  absence of true long-term care benefits.  The Stark-Waxman  revision of  the cata strophic law is not the answer. The amend ment may seem to retain some long-term ben efits, when,  in  fact,  there  is no meaningful  long  term  custodial  care  feature  in  this  amendment or under current law. The home  health coverage and hospice benefits  it re tains are associated with acute care, not long  term custodial care.  29-059 0-90-47 (Pt. 16)  Even the Ways and Means revision of the  Catastrophic Health Care Act bill does not ad dress  the problem.  It does not address  the  concerns of seniors who do not want to dupli cate catastrophic benefits  that are already  available through supplemental insurance poli cies. Further, the revision ties the catastrophic  benefits to part B of Medicare which amounts  to more of subliminal cohersion rather than a  true option.  Another factor in my decision not to support  the bill last year was that most of the senior  population who shoulder  the costs  for  this  massive Federal program are older Americans  who were already covered with some form of  private  insurance. The ""catastrophic""  financ ing provision is not only unfair but carries with  it costs that will spiral out of control. In addi tion, the costs that will be picked up by Medi care adds one more obligation  to a system  that is already stretched to its limit.  The public outcry over the Catastrophic Pro gram  is deafening, and the voices calling for  repeal are getting louder. Our ""window of op portunity"" to provide a straightforward, acces sible, and cost-effective catastrophic package  that meets the needs of our aging population  closes with each passing day.  The same people who gave me the direc tive to get me on  the train that crashed are  back. This time they have a plane.  It's called  the Stark proposal. It provides the wrong ben efits at the wrong price. Let's ground it now  before it too crashes.  The cure  for  this ailing program  is quite  simple: Congress should  just  ""do  the  right  thing"" -repeal the current defective plan and  begin more deliberate work on a system truly  responsive to needs of our elderly Americans.  ",1989
1499,1473,16,Mr. WELDON.," Mr. Chairman,  I am pleased  to rise today in strong and vocal support for  the  Donnelly-Archer  amendment.  Last  summer, Congress got itself in trouble by lis tening to the suggestions of Washington  lob byists claiming to represent the best interests  of the senior citizens.  Mr. Chairman,  I think you have heard  the  real voices of the senior citizens. I know that  the elderly don't approve of what their nation al organizations paraded as a  triumph  for  Medicare. The senior citizens  in my district  want  repeal. And  they want  it now.  I am  pleased that the House will have a chance to  act on those wishes,  in a clean, up or down  fashion.  Later today we will have an opportunity to  vote on a reform proposal offered by the gen tlemen  from California  [Mr. STARK and Mr.  WAXMAN].  Provided  the House  agrees  to  repeal  ""catastrophic health care,""  I will vote  against their amendment. While I applaud their  desire to see that some of the protections of fered to senior citizens be retained, I am sus picious of any modification package supported  by ""nearly every major senior citizen's group.""  Isn't that how we got into this mess in the first  place?  Isn't  that  the  reason  that  every  Member of this body has received thousands  of postcards, letters, and petitions from angry  senior citizens who complain that we did not  act with their best interests in mind? Isn't that  the reason that we are having this debate on  the floor today?  If we are to be truly effective Members of  Congress, then we must listen to the voices of  our constituents. Sometimes that can be diffi cult, as there is often confusion and disagree ment among them. In this case, our senior citi zens are speaking with one voice. If we fail to  vote for repeal today,  then we have slapped  democracy in the face. We will have acknowl edged  the complaints and concerns of  the  people, but listened to paid lobbyists. If we fail  to vote for repeal  today,  then Jefferson and  Madison and Washington and Adams will roll  over in their graves.  I urge my colleagues to listen to the people  and vote for repeal.  ",1989
1500,1473,16,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Chairman,  I would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to express my  strong support for the repeal of the Medicare  Catastrophic Coverage Act. Since  the pas sage of  this  truly catastrophic  legislation,  I  have received numerous letters, almost 2,000  of them, from elderly constitutents asking me  to change or even repeal this law. Senior citi zens complain that they are paying too much  for benefits they do not need, and  they are  paying for it through increased taxes and pre miums. I believe that today we finally have the  opportunity to give the people what they want.  By voting  for  the Donnelly-Archer substitute  we have the opportunity to repeal this law.  While  the Medicaid provisions are benefi cial, the rest of the act is a catastrophe. Origi nal estimates projected the cost of the legisla tion to be $30 billion over 5 years-1989-93.  However, new estimates put the cost at closer  to $45 billion. With estimated revenues of $39  billion, the Congressional Budget Office [CBO]  predicts  that  the program will be  running a  $6.2 billion deficit within the initial 5 years of  enactment. With the program gone bankrupt,  we will be  forced  to  repeal benefits or  in crease the surtax in order to maintain the pro gram.  Under  the Stark-Gradison-Waxman substi tute, the controversial surtax is repealed; how ever, the part B flat premium is increased for  all seniors. In addition, the expensive prescrip tion drug benefit would be maintained. This  particular benefit alone would boost the cost  of the entire program by 45 percent, and very  few seniors could take advantage of the cov erage. Proponents of this approach claim that  it solves the problems voiced by seniors be cause  it  repeals  the  surtax,  but maintains  needed benefits.  I question  this  reasoning.  While the surtax is repealed, part B premiums  increase, and it would retain the benefit most  likely to bankrupt the entire program.  I recognize the efforts of my colleagues to  revise the existing law; however, I believe the  only way  to effect any  real changes  is  to  repeal it, and to start over. Attempting to save  a  few of  the benefits will only cause new  problems for a new set of seniors. In addition,  it would still not provide the type of coverage  that most seniors need and want, such as  coverage of extended nursing home care.  I recognized this  legislation was a mistake  last year, and voted against  it.  It's  time  to  repeal the law, and craft a new program that  matches the needs of the majority of the sen iors. Passage of the Donnelly-Archer substi tute would allow us this opportunity.  ",1989

1503,1486,16,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, I am for  long-term care. I am a sponsor of long term-care  legislation. But  anybody  who tells seniors that they are likely  to get  it  if we  totally  repeal cata strophic is simply peddling baloney.  This President does not have  the  vision,  and this Congress  does not  have the guts, unfortunately, to pass  long-term care.  I found out what my seniors wanted,  because I asked them. I sent a ques tionnaire to senior citizens in my dis trict. One-third want  repeal,  two thirds do not. Two-thirds of the sen iors in my district said they want us to  salvage respite care. They want us to  salvage the protection against spousal  impoverishment. They want us to sal vage the drug benefit.  The Stark-Waxman amendment gets  rid of the surtax. It does not get rid of  needed benefits. I urge the Members  to support it.  I have only one other thing to say. I  am very angry about some of the misinformation being peddled by Mr. Roo sevelt and his group over the past year  and a half. I think that what that may  demonstrate is that Archie the cock roach was  right when he said  that,  ""Blood will tell, but it often tells too  much.""  ",1989

1505,1486,16,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Chairman, I  take  this time to explain why I plan to vote  for  the  Stark-Gradison-Waxman  amendment.  Last year I vote for an  insurance  program designed to protect our Na tion's elderly from catastrophic costs  related to health care. Most people in  my district support the belief that we  need  catastrophic health  insurance  protection-and have since I was first  elected to Congress. That must have  been true in most districts, since Con gress passed the largest expansion of  Medicare benefits  to  the elderly  in  more than two decades.  Since  then,  I,  like all of us, have  been swamped with thousands of let ters from seniors who object to paying  the surtax for a variety of reasons.  Some have adequate coverage in pri vate plans and others like employees  of the State of Ohio have catastroph ic-type  coverage under State plans.  They were asked  to pay a  tax  for  something  from which  they cannot  benefit.  I understand how they feel  and, Mr. Chairman,  I  voted  for  a  repeal of  the surtax a  few minutes  ago.  I will now vote  for  the Stark Gradison-Waxman  amendment,  be cause to me it retains the concept of  catastrophic health care benefits. As  has been mentioned, it retains the pre scription drug benefit.  I know from  personal experience that the cost of  prescription drugs can be catastrophic  in the case of  long-term painful  ill nesses. This amendment retains mam mography screening. I am told by my  good friend, Dr. Arthur James, a lead ing cancer specialist,  that thousands  of women's lives can be saved through  periodic mammograms. This is reason  enough for me to vote for this amend ment.  It retains the new home health care  coverage, hospice, and in-home respite  care.  For a lot of people this is a vote for  merciful treatment of our elderly. It  retains  the  spousal  impoverishment  provision.  Most people who have contacted me  do not seem  to object  to  the $4 a  month increase in monthly premiums  to pay for these benefits. I feel the eq uities weigh  in favor of a  favorable  vote on this amendment.  ",1989

1509,1499,16,Mr. VANDER JAGT.," Mr. Chairman, a ques tion has been raised concerning the effective  date provision of section 11202 of H.R. 3299,  a provision of the budget reconciliation legisla tion within the jurisdiction of the Committee on  Ways and Means. Specifically,  the question  relates  to  the  effective  date  provision  of  changes affecting certain original  issue dis count obligations. As  I understand it, that ef fective date provides a grandfather in  those  situations where  there was a written binding  contract in effect on July 1 0, 1989, and at all  times thereafter. I believe I am correct in con cluding that an assignability feature in such a  contract would not cause the grandfather rule  to be inapplicable. Specifically, if such a con tract was assigned to another party, I believe  that party could then enjoy the benefits of the  grandfather rule by being able to issue instru ments that would not be subject to the new  limitations contained in section 11202. I would  hope that the conference report language on  this provision will make this point clear and I  will ask that the professional tax staffs review  this issue to make sure this clarification raises  no  technical problems  inconsistent with  the  objective of the grandfather rule.

1512,1499,16,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Chair man, I make a point of order against  section 7001 on the grounds that it is a  tax measure which is in violation of  paragraph B, clause 5 of House Rule  21.  Mr. Chairman, section 7001 of the  bill imposes a fee of $20 per passenger  on vessels engaged in U.S. cruise trade  or which offer offshore gambling. The  proceeds of this fee are to be deposited  in both the harbor maintenance trust  fund and Treasury's general fund.  The  supporters  of  this  provision  argue that a significant portion of the  Coast Guard's  costs  of  providing  safety and navigational assistance are  attributable to these vessels.  Mr. Chairman, charging one class of  beneficiaries of governmental activity  does not transform a tax into a user  fee. The maintenance of our harbors  and the safety of our waters are con cerns to all of us and we are all the  beneficiaries of these activities.  Mr. Chairman, the Federal Govern ment has already decided to raise reve nue in a manner which is related to  these activities  through  the harbor  maintenance tax. However, such a pro vision of law is clearly a tax and not a  user fee.  User fees are paid by persons whose  voluntary  request  for a government  service causes the government to incur  costs which are defrayed through the  payment of a fee. Mandatory assess ments to finance the costs of govern ment are taxes. This provision is clear ly a tax and I urge the Chair to sus tain my point of order.  The CHAIRMAN <Mr. MAVROULES).  Does any other Member desire to be  heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair will respond to the  point of order of the gentleman from  Illinois, with  the committee's indul gence, by first making a general state ment.  ",1989
1513,1512,16,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from New  York [Mr. McHuGH], a member of the  subcommittee.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, frankly  I had hoped  that we would have a  third option available to us today, be cause I think the two options that we  are confronted with are not a reasona ble response to the circumstances in  Nicaragua.  The bill itself, which is one option,  would provide $9 million  to support  the electoral process, but it would be  spent in ways which are not very clear  from the language of the bill.  The Durbin amendment would pro vide  very  little  assistance:  Only  $400,000  for  the monitoring  group  chaired by former President Carter. I  have no objection to that, of course,  but even if one supports nothing more  than  election monitoring,  I  believe  that the Durbin amendment is too re strictive. For example, it would cut out  money for the Center for Democracy,  an organization that has been invited  to Nicaragua by both the Government  and the opposition. It is on the ground  now, and it seems to me unwise to ex clude $250,000  for  that monitoring  group.  Furthermore, I personally believe it  is reasonable to provide some addition al assistance  in Nicaragua. The Na tional  Endowment  for  Democracy  [NED] has been successful in promot ing the democratic process and institu tions in other parts of the world, in cluding Chile. It is well organized to  provide such assistance, and I  think  that is appropriate in Nicaragua.  Mr. Speaker, I would go even further  and support some modest campaign as sistance  to  the opposition parties  in  Nicaragua, preferably  through some  organizations unrelated to NED. Nica ragua is not the United States. Nicara gua does not have a tradition of demo cratic elections and strong party orga nizations. The Sandinistas have been  dominant and still control much of the  power, including the media.  If we want to help in providing an  even playing field, it is not unreason able to provide some modest assistance  to the opposition. Certainly we should  not  fully  fund  their campaign, but  some help openly provided is not un reasonable. It is also not in conflict  with Nicaraguan law. The law in Nica ragua contemplates outside campaign  assistance. One only has to provide 50  percent of that assistance to the Nica raguan  electoral  council. Thus, we  would not be offending Nicaraguan  law by providing some assistance.  It is also important to note that the  likely alternative to assistance openly  provided is covert assistance, which in  my judgment would be a serious mis take.  My problem with this bill is that it is  far too generous. To provide $9 million  in Nicaragua, a dirt poor country, is to  flood the country with money. I think  it will create a significant risk of abuse  and waste, and reports of that kind  will create a problem not just for us,  but for  the opposition  in Nicaragua  itself.  0 1810  The problem is further exacerbated  by the ambiguity of the bill on how  that money will be spent. The bill  would  deliver most  of  the money  through the National Endowment for  Democracy, consistent with that orga nization's charter, and  that charter  specifically provides that ""funds may  not be expended, either by the Endow ment or by any of its grantees, to fi nance the campaigns of candidates for  public office."" That is clear enough.  Unfortunately, when one  looks at  how  the  administration  intends  to  spend  the money,  one  finds  in  its  breakdown the following items:  ""Salaries, benefits and  related ex penses, $815,000; vehicles, $1,345,000;  travel allowances and per diem  for  20,000 poll watchers, $600,000."" These  items  raise  serious questions;  there  seems to be a conflict between what  the bill says and what the administra tion intends. If we are representing in  this legislation that funds will not be  spent  for  campaign  purposes,  we  should be sure that will be the case.  This is not at all clear.  Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, while  I  would be willing to support some as sistance in Nicaragua, I must oppose  this bill as being both too large and  too loosely drawn.  ",1989

The last time I was in Nicaragua the  gentleman  from Kansas  [Mr.  SLAT TERY] and I were down there at the  same time, and I appreciate his com ments and his statements.  Second, I want to thank the gentle man from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY]  for  allowing the bill to come out and to  move.  This is a good package. It is a good  package. All of the Members  in the  body want peace. We are not talking  about sending AK-47's down to Nica ragua. We  are  not  talking  about  bombs. We  are  not  talking  about  mining the harbors. We are not talk ing about any kind of mines  that  young people could step on. We are  talking about the opportunity to pro mote democracy.  We have an opportunity  for  free  elections. As one speaker said, when  we look at all the resources the Sandi nistas have, when we met several years  ago with Cardinal Obando y Bravo  and  later with Mrs. Chamorro and  went back again to see the resources  the Sandinistas had, this helps with  regard to changing the process.  It worked in Poland. We are pushing  in this body the President to put more  money in Poland because we, both Re publicans and Democrats, do not think  he has done enough.  Well,  the same  thing would hold  true here. It worked in Chile. In Chile  and Poland it worked. Let us give it a  chance down in Nicaragua.  I would hope that we would have a  big strong vote. This is a bipartisan  issue. This is not a Republican issue  and it is not a Democrat issue. Hope fully we can come together in a spirit  of reconciliation to bring about democ racy down in Nicaragua. So I rise in  strong, strong support.  I thank the gentleman from Wiscon sin [Mr. OBEY] for allowing the pack age to come out. I  think the gentle man is a real statesman.  I thank the gentleman from Kansas  [Mr. SLATTERY] for his position. Hope fully my colleagues on both sides will  come together to do what I  think is  appropriate,  to help bring about de mocracy in Nicaragua.  ",1989

As my  colleagues have  indicated who were  with me  this Sunday observing  the  registration process in Nicaragua, time  is running out and the process is not  leading  to full,  fair democratic elec tions as we have  envisaged  in  this  House.  There is no question that we found a  very strong unification among the po litical party that is flying the demo cratic flag, the democratic opposition.  We found morale high and we found a  commitment  to  democracy  in  the  country.  There  is also no question that we  found that the people who are run ning these elections in Nicaragua are  the same people, the same Sandinis tas,  that ran  the sham elections  in  1984  that by  international opinion  were labeled as a fraud.  Very clearly there is a challenge to  democratic-loving people to make sure  that this election provides the oppor tunity for fair play.  As we went about the country, as we  went about Managua and listened to  citizens and watched the polling proc ess work, we  discovered  that  the  people want to vote, they want to ex press their opinion. There is no ques tion about that.  ",1989

As a member of the Committee on Appropria tions,  I should report that our committee re ported this bill  favorably so as to afford  the  President an opportunity  to have a vote on  the floor on this issue. I thought that the Presi dent was dead wrong on this issue yesterday  and I think so just as strongly today.  It was  pointed  out  yesterday  that  the  volume of money under consideration here is  a huge sum in the context of the Nicaraguan  economy. On a proportional basis,  this pro posal  is the equivalent of a donation from a  single  foreign government  in  the amount of  $800 million  to either the Democratic or the  Republican Party. Never mind  that our  laws  prohibit  the acceptance of such donations.  We would be outraged at the suggestion that  you  can  promote  democracy  by  throwing  money at one group and excluding the others.  The State Department has  informed  the  leadership  that  this money will contribute  to  institution-building  in Nicaragua. The adminis tration assures us that even though funds are  to  be  provided  for  ""travel by UNO  lead ers * * *""  they will not be used  for cam paigning. This clearly is a distinction without a  difference. You give a politician money  to  travel around this district to spread his political  message and yet you deny that it is a cam paign contribution.  Why are we doing this? The voter registra tion underway this month in Nicaragua is re ported to be a great success. It is hard to see  how the introducing of a huge, corrupting sum  of money at this critical stage does anything  positive for the process. Never mind what the  implications of this are  for  the National En dowment  for Democracy,  and  organization  that until now has made grants on a competi tive basis. This bill will do virtually nothing to  convince Nicaraguans that their votes should  be cast as a matter of conscience. Just the  opposite,  it will  convince  each  voter  that  forces beyond his or her control will determine  the outcome of this election. This is a terrible  idea that has come up at just the wrong time  and it should be thoroughly rejected.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mr.  KANJORSKI).

1522,1551,16,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to draw the  attention of my colleagues to a very special  young person in my congressional district.  Frieda Dyson is a high school senior from  Harrisburg, PA, who was selected to represent  the State this week in Washington as a child  ambassador. Frieda, and other child ambassa dors from around the country are here to cele brate National Children's Day with a series of  events intended to call attention to the state  of our Nation's children. The ambassadors are  helping Congress  to  focus on  the positive  possibilities open to young Americans, as well  as to consider the pressing needs and prob lems facing our youth.  The ambassadors testified yesterday before  the Select Committee on Children, Youth, and  Families and  the Budget Committee Task  Force on Human Resources. Their unique in sight and experience was both moving and in spirational.  The testimony of my constituent, Frieda, fo cused on the importance of teens rising above  peer pressure to stay away from drugs. Frieda  knows a great deal about such inner strength.  She lived in foster homes for the first 8 years  of her life; yet Frieda has been able to over come  this difficult start. She  is president of  her senior class at the Harrisburg Academy,  she  tutors  disadvantaged  children  after  school, she aspires to be a writer, and is an  articulate  spokesperson  on  saying  no  to  drugs. Needless to say, I am extremely proud  to have this young lady in the 17th Congres sional District.  I would like to take this opportunity to share  with my colleagues a segment of Frieda's tes timony from yesterday's hearing:  Children are malleable and  impression able. We are open to a lot of stresses and are  vulnerable, but the reverse is true too. We  are open to positive influences if they are  made available to us; we need adult influ ences that are positive. More environmental  emphasis needs to be focused on strengthen ing family units, stable homes and contin ued support will, over time, decrease drug  usage rates among my peers. For further  significant positive changes to occur there  needs to be communication and cooperation  between the youth of America and the lead ers-the educators and the parents.  In conclusion, only through joint efforts  on all levels and spheres of influence will  the situation brighten. We,  the youth of  America, are looking  to you,  the present  leaders, not necessarily for the answers to  the drug crisis, but  for your continued  pledged commitment to us. As it has been  said many  times-we are  the future and  even more so, we are the present. We need  your help and your concentrated efforts  here and now.  Mr. Speaker, it is when I have the privilege  of meeting young people like Frieda Dyson, I  become more certain than ever that America  is in good hands.

1523,1551,16,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to turn our attention to  an issue which is close to all of our hearts our Nation's children.  I am  inserting  into  the RECORD here  the  lyrics to a song written and produced by two  constituents of mine in Ocala, FL, which says  beautifully that it is our duty and responsibility  to care for and care about the children of the  world. Their rights to a future that is safe, free,  and healthy should be a priority to all of us,  and  I applaud the efforts of Robin MacBiane  and Larry Whitler to bring attention to this im portant goal. Their song  ""Stand Up  for  the  Children"" is a wonderful tribute to their com mitment, and I am proud to share it with you  today.

JOHN D. DINGELL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 4, 1989  ",1989
1524,1551,16,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to the Service Station Dealers As sociation of Michigan. Established in 1929 as  the Retail Gasoline Dealers Association of  Michigan,  this organization  is currently cele brating its 60th anniversary.  For 60 years  the SSDA has been  in  the  business of promoting and protecting the  in terests of Michigan's gasoline retailers. It rep resents over 1 ,000 dealers and their families  in  the areas of oil company-dealer relation ships,  health and  liability  insurance,  credit  cards, and other dealer-related activities.  From its inception in 1929, the association  has been a leader for the dealers of Michigan.  From ""Gasoline Lil,"" a noted SSDA lobbyist,  23311  to Cash Hauley and Chuck Shipley, former ex ecutive directors of the association, the retail  gasoline dealers have been well served.  Currently, President Philip Bucalo, a Livonia  Shell dealer, Executive Director Daniel Loepp,  and the entire SSDA board are working hard  to represent dealers' interests on a number of  important  issues  including  franchises,  small  business, and the environment.  Once again, congratulations to the Service  Station Dealers Association of Michigan on  the 60th anniversary of this fine organization. I  am sure the next 60 years will see the SSDA  continuing  in  its fine  tradition of serving  the  gasoline dealers of the State of Michigan.  TIME TO FIGHT BACK IN OUR  NATION'S CITIES  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 4, 1989  ",1989
1525,1551,16,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  regardless of  how many national drug strategies and drug  bills we produce in the Congress and the ex ecutive branch, the war on drugs will not be  won without grassroots involvement and sup port from the American people.  The National League of Cities has been in volved in recent years in fighting the drug war  on our  local government front. The National  League of Cities has been  instrumental  in  forging  a  productive, working  relationship  among the chief executives who run our Na tion's communities; a relationship that has led  to a healthy exchange of ideas and strategies  to combat the drug crisis in America's major  cities. Consequently, we have witnessed are birth of grassroots warriors,  lending hope  to  the cause of a drug-free America.  In order  to help carry  forward with  this  noble effort and continue the work being done  by the National League of Cities,  I am  intro ducing today a House joint resolution to com memorate December 3-9, 1989, as ""National  Cities Fight Back Against Drugs Week.""  It is  during  this week, Mr. Speaker,  that  the Na tional League of Cities hopes  to shine  the  public spotlight on  the  important antidrug ef forts taking place within our cities. We hope to  inspire those who are working in the trenches  to continue  their work, and  those who are  standing on  the sidelines will be persuaded,  we hope, to join in on the action.  This special resolution  is more than just a  symbolic effort. The passage of  this House  resolution, Mr. Speaker, would bring about  direct action and noticeable results in the war  on drugs, through the scheduling of a variety  of events in communities throughout the coun try. Churches, civic groups,  law enforcement  agencies and educators, parents and young  people will be  joining  forces  to let the drug  traffickers know that we are not going to give  up the reins on our communities. We must let  them know  that we are united  in our stand  against the pervasiveness of these poisons in  our society.  Our cities have been devastated by the war  on drugs. Entire communities are being held  hostage by drug dealers and their agents who  conduct their heinous trade with no regard for  ",1989

1529,20,20,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, it is  said with more and more  frequency  that  the U.S.  sugar program  is de signed  to benefit . a  small group of  large-scale sugar beet and cane farm ers. Undoubtedly these growers bene fit from the program, but the aim of  the program is considerably broader:  It provides protection against heavily  subsidized foreign sugar exports, and  this benefits the U.S. corn industry in  addition to the domestic sugar indus try.  I have long supported efforts to find  new and alternative markets for our  basic agricultural products, and be lieve  that  the growth of  the corn  sweetner industry is one of the finest  success stories in this field. At a time  of increasingly low commodity prices,  the demand created by the sweetener  industry has raised corn prices to all  corn farmers by about 25 cents per  bushel.  This boost in corn prices has had a  major effect on  individual producers  and  those parts of  the agricultural  community heavily dependent on corn.  For example, a 400 acre corn farmer in  South Dakota with a 85 bushel yield  has seen gross income increase $8,500  because of sweetener demand. For my  State as a whole this represents an in crease in farm income of approximate ly $60 million annually. For some of  the larger corn-producing States the  impact is even larger.  Without the sugar program offering  protection, both U.S. sugar and corn  producers and processors would be un dermined by  the dumping of subsi dized sugar on the world market. Any  reduction that occurs in domestic beet  and cane acreage will put greater pres sure on the other crop programs, de pressing prices and increasing govern ment costs. One study has shown that  U.S. corn producers and the Treasury  would have lost $11.5 billion from 1982  to 1985  in  the absence of  the U.S.  sugar program.  Changing  the U.S.  sugar program  will only ever make sense if there is  universal ai~reement for international  reform of sugar policies around  the  world. Until that time, the U.S. sugar  program will continue to be critically  important to the 1.3 million corn pro ducers across this country, in addition  to beet and cane producers, and de serves Congress' support.

1534,33,20,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, in just a  little while, the Senate will be voting  on the leadership's compromise legis lation to increase the minimum wage  by 27 percent by 1991. I happen to be lieve those who will be hurt the most  by the increase of the minimum wage  are those unskilled and inexperienced  people in our society whose entry level  job opportunities are going to simply  disappear. They are the same people  who can least afford price increases at  the gas station or the supermarket.  This is the great irony. These are the  citizens this measure purports to help.  That is,  the underlying measure, the  increase in the minimum wage.  There is another group of Americans  who will also suffer as a result of this  legislation, and they are the hundreds  of thousands of small business people.  I myself will argue the natural reac tion to the automatic increase and the  cost of labor will be for small business es in particular to hire fewer skilled  workers and raise prices.  It is important to remember, howev er, that some small businesses do not  have these options. They will bear the  brunt of this significant mandatory in crease in wages. For these businesses,  the minimum wage bill is tantamount  to a tax increase and some will not be  able to absorb it .  Let us also understand the  impor tance of small business  to American  workers. America's job generating ma chine happens  to be small business.  Small business has been responsible  for between 70 and 90 percent of the  newly created jobs during the expan sion. American small business has cre ated more jobs over the past 5 years  than the total number of jobs created  in Japan and the Western European  countries  combined.  In  total, more  than 50 percent of the Nation's private  sector work  force  are  employed by  small business.  Additionally,  small  businesses  are  more likely than larger companies to  hire workers who have been unem ployed or out of  the workplace  for  long periods of time. Small businesses  are also more likely to hire older work ers, women,  teenagers or  low-skilled  entry level workers. All of these are   groups which  are  characterized  by  above average turnover and a weak at tachment to the labor force.  Small business, in addition to creat ing the most jobs, also serves as the  Nation's  training ground. Employees  of smaller firms seem to accumulate  general skills that make them more at tractive to other employers and permit  these employees  to progress up  the  ladder of success.  In contrast,  large  employers tend to provide very narrow  skills  that do not  transfer  to other  firms.  Mr. President,  it  is  time  that we  started to consider the impact that the  legislation we pass has on small busi ness. While the intent of legislation  may be to address the pressing nation al issues, we can no longer afford to  ignore  the  fact  that our efforts  to  solve  one  problem may  impose  a  myriad of new regulations and compli ance costs on small business. The an cillary effects of ""doing good"" can be  harmful.  Before we go patting ourselves on  the back for acting on our own good  intentions, we better start considering  who pays for  those good  intentions.  We  better  consider  the  long-range  ramifications for small business. For  example, many of us supported pas sage of Americans With Disabilities  Act. I managed the bill on our side and  voted for the bill because it provides  equal opportunity, employment, and  access  to public accommodations for  the disabled. That is an objective of  great importance to me as well as ev eryone else in this Chamber.  But, we  cannot kid  ourselves  by  thinking  that  the  legislation  is not  going to involve major costs for small  business owners. Today we are going  to pass a bill that will raise the mini mum wage 27 percent in 2 years. More over,  Congress  is  still  considering  other measures that would impose tre mendous costs on small business, and  clearly the cumulative impact of these  initiatives will strangle small business.  This amendment will  impose some  discipline on Congress. The amend ment says that for the balance of the  lOlst Congress, the Congress shall not  increase  the business costs  for any  ",1989

1562,46,20,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  I would  like  to  say  a  few words about  the  It  amendment  offered  by my  distin guished  colleague  from Texas  [Mr.  GRAMM].  I can think of no legitimate reason  why our farmers should be singled out  when it comes to the training wage.  There is no reason why every employ er  in  this country-except farmers will be allowed  to pay  the  training  wage. And there is simply no credible  evidence that our farmers will some how use the training wage as a tool to  abuse our Nation's agricultural  em ployees.  In fact, the training wage contained  in  the minimum wage  compromise  package has built-in protections.  has been crafted  in a way that will  limit  opportunities  for  abuse. The  training wage applies only  to  teen agers.  It can be paid only  for a  3month period. And the training wage  sunsets in 1993.  So  there  is no potential for abuse  here-a training wage will not-and  cannot-be used to keep our agricul tural workers ""down on the farm""-so  to speak.  Mr. President, a  training wage will  give our young people the opportunity  to learn the basic skills that are so  necessary to become productive mem bers of our Nation's work force. This is  true for our service  industries. It is  true for our manufacturing industries.  And it is  true for the teenager who  works on the farm.  So I commend President Bush for in sisting that a training wage be includ ed in this compromise package.  But the President has also urged the  passage of  the compromise package  without  amendments. At  a White  House meeting earlier  this morning,  the President's Chief of Staff, Gover nor Sununu, specifically requested my  help in ensuring that no amendments  are added to the package.  I intend to comply with this request.  And regretfully, I will have to support  a motion to table the Gramm amend ment-despite  the amendment's un derlying merits.

1571,59,20,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, shortly,  I will ask unanimous consent to place  in the RECORD what I think is a very  excellent story from yesterday's Wash ington Post. This  story  entitled  ""Electronic Warfare Project Seriously  Flawed,"" and it was written by staff  reporter Molly North. The article cites  a very troubled program that I have  been looking into for some time. It is  called  the  airborne  self-projection  jammer, or the ASPJ. Despite failed  test  after  failed  test,  unanimous  Senate action to slow the program, in vestigations by the inspector general  in the General Accounting Office re garding  the decision  to produce  the  ASPJ, the Pentagon recently awarded  almost one-half billion dollars to begin  immediate ASPJ production.  Mr. President, the Post article con tains even more damning information  on the ASPJ than had come to the  floor debate earlier on this program.  For example, during debate  earlier  this fall, I cited a conservative ASPJ  program cost estimate of $4.8 billion.  The Washington Post, however, says  the ASPJ will cost $9 billion-$4 bil lion more  than  I  had  previously  stated. I also said that each individual  ASPJ would cost roughly $2 million a  copy. The Post says that number  is  more like $3.5 million per copy. And,  finally,  the Post  indicates  that  the  ASPJ program is now expected to be  $1 billion over budget and  is still a  long way from working properly.  Nine billion dollars for this program,  Mr.  President. Nine  billion  . dollars  could  fund  the entire Federal drug  war this year. For $9 billion we could  fund all of the National Institutes of  Health and the Head Start Program.  With $9 billion, the Education Depart ment could fund  the entire Student  Aid  Program,  the Vocational  and  Adult Education Program,  and  the  Education for  the Handicapped Pro gram.  In the Pentagon we could use $9 bil lion to buy 9 new attack submarines or  500 F-16 fighters or over 3,200 M-1  Abrams tanks.  My point, Mr. President, is that this  country has many high spending pri orities,  domestic  and military. We  ought to keep that in mind before we  commit  to making  $9-billion  radar  jammers that do not yet work.  The Post article also states that at  Navy test facilities in California, the  ASPJ  had problems  detecting  and  jamming some enemy radars that have  already been around for two decades.  ""Moreover,"" the story says, ""the ASPJ  cannot meet many of the threats pro jected* * *for the coming decade.""  This was backed up by a memo by  then Defense  acquisition  chief, Mi chael P.W. Stone, who said, ""Despite a  program that now goes back almost 13  years, system progress has been ex tremely slow and many enemy threats  cannot be satisfactorily handled.""  Mr. President, the Secretary of De fense has spoken out on the need to  enforce so-called exit criteria. This is a  new  term meaning weapons  that do  not meet minimum standards have no  business going into production.  Not unlike the DIVAD antiairctraft  gun, the ASPJ has not passed tests, it  has not met the Secretary's exit crite ria, and yet, today it is going straight  into production.  When will fielding effective weapons  take precedent over political expedi ence? When will our military decision makers demonstrate  the courage of  their stated convictions? How can we  end this mentality of building now and  testing later?  Mr. President, I am disappointed in  the Pentagon's  leadership  and  ex pressed my concern in a  letter with  Senator GRASSLEY to the Secretary of  Defense a month ago.  We asked why $419 million had been  awarded  in October  to produce  the  ASPJ despite evidence that it was a  bad decision and that it had failed its  tests.  Mr. President, to date we have not  received a  response  to  that letter.  I  hope this is because our good Defense  Secretary  is  reconsidering  the  pro gram.  One  last comment, Mr. President.  The Post article made one slip when it  said I am opposed  to  the ASPJ.  In  fact, I am 100 percent behind develop ing a radar jammer that protects our  fighter  pilots  in  high-technology  combat. Clearly this is needed. I hope  we all agree to this.  However, I am 100 percent opposed  to  spending  tight budget dollars  to  build and field weapons that do not  work, and have not passed the tests.  The ASPJ has not proven itself and  should not be produced until it does.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con .sent that a copy of the Washington  ",1989
1572,72,20,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President,  I  am introducing in the Senate today a  bill which  extends  the  life of  the  Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National  Historical Park Commission  for  10  years. The current authority for the  Commission  expires  in  January  of  1991, and this bill, identical to one in troduced in the House of Representa tives  last month by Representative  BEVERLY BYRON of Maryland's Sixth  District, would extend that authority  for another 10 years. Joining me in in troducing  this  legislation  is my col league from Maryland, Senator BAR BARA MIKULSKI.  Mr. President, the C&O Canal Na tional Historical Park is one of  the  most unique in this Nation and one of  the most heavily visited. It begins in  this great city,  the Nation's Capital  and extends for 184 miles to its origi nal terminus in Cumberland, MD. As  you can imagine, the development of  plans for the preservation and use of  this park is a major undertaking. It is  no easy task to protect and preserve a  park which  averages  100  yards  in  width but is 184 miles long.  The work of the Commission is not  finished. The Commission is composed  of  representatives  of  the State  of  Maryland, the Commonwealth of Vir ginia, the State of West Virginia, the  District of Columbia, the counties in  Maryland  through which  the park  runs, and members at large. The pas sage of this bill will permit the Com mission to complete the rational proc ess begun so many years ago to ensure  that this unique part of America's nat ural and historical heritage is properly  preserved.  I would encourage those who are in terested in the C&O Canal to join in  sponsoring  this  legislation, and  it  is  my hope that it can be enacted in this  Congress.e  By Mr. CHAFEE <for himself,  Mr. MITCHELL, Mr. BURDICK,  Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. D'AMATO,  Mr. BAUCUS, Mr.  LIEBERMAN,  Mr. DURENBERGER, Mr. w ARNER,  and Mr. JEFFORDS):  S. 1853. A bill to award a congres sional gold medal  to Laurance Spel man Rockefeller; to the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.  AWARDING A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL  ",1989
1573,72,20,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, today  the distinguished majority leader, Sen ator MITCHELL, and I are introducing  legislation to award a gold medal to  Laurance Spelman Rockefeller in rec ognition of the tremendous efforts he  has made on behalf of natural  re source conservation in this country.  When one thinks of America's ma jestic wide-open spaces, outdoor recre ation, and historic preservation, one  cannot help but to think of Laurance  Rockefeller. His  lifelong  dedication  and  involvement  in  shaping public  policy on behalf of the environment  has left us a  legacy of programs and  projects that will benefit all Ameri cans for generations to come.  Although Laurance's contributions  are too numerous to cite here, I would  like to touch on several key Federal,  State, and  local efforts  in which he  has been or remains actively involved.  Serving four U.S. Presidents, Laur ance acted as chairman of the White  House Conference on Natural Beauty,  the National Park Foundation,  the  Public Land Law Review Commission,  and numerous Presidential  advisory  groups.  One of his greatest achievements is  the Land  and Water Conservation  Fund, which he developed as Chair man of President Eisenhower's Out door Recreation Resources  Review  Commission in the early 1960's. This  program, now  in  its 25th year, has  made available to the States and Fed eral agencies $6 billion for the acquisi tion of parks, wildlife refuges, recre ational facilities and other worthwhile  outdoor  projects. At  a  time when  greater and greater pressure is being  put on open space by development, the  Land and Water Conservation Fund  has proved to be the Federal Govern ment's primary program to set aside  parklands and scenic areas for the en joyment of the general public.  Anyone who has enjoyed the mag nificent beauty of the Virgin Islands  National Park on St. John's Island,  has much  to  thank  the Rockefeller  family for. Building on the efforts of  his father, John D. Rockefeller, Laur ance helped to expand that park by  donating 5,000 acres to it, thus assur ing its tropical forests and lush wild life habitat will be preserved forever.  Laurance was also deeply involved in  the  establishment  of  the  Grand  Tetons National Park  through  the  Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc.  ",1989

1592,124,20,Mr. MILLER  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, in the consideration of the  oilspill liability bill, we have come to a  crucial point where we are going to  have to make a decision about wheth er or not we are going to have tough  laws against oilspills and whether or  not we are going to protect the rights  of the States to devise systems and to  impose penalties and to extend liabil ities to those who would spill oils in  the waters off of their States.  The amendment that I am offering  on behalf of myself and the gentleman  from Massachusetts CMr. STunnsl  is  an amendment  to correct a glaring  flaw  in H.R. 1465, by preserving the  rights of States to set higher stand ards  for  oil  pollution  liability  and  more complete systems of compensa tion than are allowed under this bill or  under current  law.  In addition,  the  amendment  protects  the  rights  of  States to set higher levels of financial  responsibility and leaves State court  jurisdiction intact, makes State standards apply to cleanups, and gives the  Governors an equal say with Federal  authorities as to when the cleanup is  completed.  These are hardly radical proposals.  The Senate oilspill  legislation which  passed by a vote of 99 to O has virtual ly  identical provisions. The preemp tion of State  laws and  rights were  never challenged during  the Senate  consideration. Why? Because we have  a  long history in environmental pro tection in making sure that the States'  rights are protected.  Mr. Chairman,  in  fact,  the  only  group lobbying to get rid of the State  laws are those people seeking addition al rights to the polluters. It is the oil  companies and the shipping industry,  not the potential victims of the spill,  who support getting rid of this provi sion. The Studds-Miller amendment is  supported by the National Governors'  Association, which has  told us  that  Congress has traditionally passed envi ronmental  laws  that establish mini mum standards, that States are free to  exceed in order to meet the particular  needs of their State.  We see no  reason  to depart from  that successful practice. That is what  the Studds-Miller amendment does. It  allows the States to continue to deal  with oilspill liability as they deal with  clean  air,  as  they deal with  clean  water. The amendment gives States  the  rights  to protect  their environ ments, the needs of their citizens and  their particular situations.  This is a fundamental right of the  States to do that, and we should not  take that right away  in this legisla tion. In fact, that is what this legisla tion would do  if  the Studds-Miller  amendment is not accepted.  The National Association of Attor neys General is supporting the amend ment. They tell us that the States are  often the first line of defense in react ing to oilspills and often have an inter est, and this is important for Members  to  remember,  that  is different and  greater than that of the Federal Gov ernment in cleaning up and restoring  the environment.  We should not allow this legislation  to destroy  their ability  to deal with  that interest and to deal with those  concerns.  Let us think of what would be the  situation if the committee bill was law  when  the Exxon Valdez oilspill oc curred. First, under the bill as written,  Alaska State law, which provides for  unlimited liability and which extends  liability to the owner of the oil in addi tion  to the shipper, would be wiped  out by H.R. 1465.  Second, H.R. 1465 would eliminate  State court jurisdiction. The State of  Alaska has  filed suit  in Anchorage,  and yet H.R. 1465 would limit jurisdic tion to Federal courts, with no guaran tee that the suit would be heard in the  State of Alaska. I think it is important  to understand that. It is important to  understand that if we pass  this bill  without  the  Studds-Miller  amend ment, we are in fact lessening the li ability on Exxon and other potential  polluters than we are under current  law.  It cannot be the policy of this Con gress when we are done with the con sideration of this oilspill liability bill  to  provide  for  weaker  sanctions  against polluters than we have in cur rent law, and that is what will happen  if we pass the bill without the provi sions of the Studds-Miller amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",1989
1593,124,20,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong oppo sition  to  the amendment offered by  the gentleman from California CMr.  MILLER].  The compromise bill was developed  after careful discussions involving the  leadership of the committees of juris diction. During those discussions, we  realized that the preemption issue was  one that we would be unable to come  to agreement on and  that  it would  have to be decided ultimately by this  body. Therefore, it comes as no sur prise that we are going to be debating  the issue today.  However,  I had  thought  that  the  issue  of  concern  centered  around  whether State liability laws should be  preempted. That is not the only issue  presented by  this amendment. This  amendment  goes much  further.  would remove provisions in the bill ad dressing  the  need  for  a  uniform  system of financial responsibility.  The system of liability and compen sation in the bill is intended to be com prehensive and definitive. It is intend ed  to allow  for quick and complete  payment of reasonable claims without  resort to cumbersome litigation. A key  feature of the bill is Federal preemp tion of State laws on liability. Without  such preemption, we would return to a  patchwork of overlapping and conflict ing laws which may actually impede  prompt payment of justifiable claims.  It is important to keep in mind that  the bill provides for a strong State role  in dealing with oilspills. States would  participate in developing contingency  plans which establish the basic frame work for oilspill response. The States'  right  to establish safety or environ mental requirements that go beyond  the  Federal  requirements  are  pre served. States are entitled  to direct  access of up to $250,000 from the Fed eral  fund  to pay  for State cleanup  costs in the event of a spill. State au thority to legislate on personal injury,  wrongful death and workman's com pensation is preserved, as well as the  authority to impose civil and criminal  penalties in the event of a spill.

1596,137,20,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  sponsors and proponents of the Miller Studds  amendment will  try  to  tell  Members when they walk through the  doors next time that this is the same  amendment all over again. It is not the  same amendment all over again. This  is an entirely different amendment,  and it is an entirely appropriate one,  and a necessary one,  if you want to  protect the integrity of the measure  established in this act.  Mr. Chairman, I repeat when Mem bers walk through the doors the next  time a recorded vote is called on this  amendment, it is  likely someone will  suggest to them that this is the same  amendment over again. Vote no again,  it is the same Tauzin amendment we  just voted on.  That is not true. It is not even close  to being the same amendment. It is en tirely different.  It has  to do with  something entirely different than fi nancial responsibility and preemption.  It has to do with when, in fact, clean up  is  completed using  the Federal  fund.  ",1989
1597,150,20,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, you have heard Mr.  HUGHES, who was  in support of the  Miller-Studds amendment. I was one  who was opposed to it.  You heard Mr. HUGHES, sponsor of  this amendment,  tell you, correctly,  this is not a preemption amendment.  It is not.  The Senate bill by Mr. MITCHELL  does not contain preemption language.  Our House bill does no longer con tain preemption language as a result  of the Miller-Studds amendment. The  Senate bill, however,  like  the House  bill, has limits of liability. Rather than  think of limits of liability as relieving  shippers of responsibility, I would like  you to think along with me and Mr.  HUGHES  and other sponsors of  this  amendment about what  limits of  li ability is really all about.  Limits of  liability does not say  to  shippers that you are not going to pay  the full cost of cleanup. You will. You  are going to pay it in two ways.  You are going to pay it up front with  the deductible,  the limit of liability,  and you pay the rest of it in a tax that  goes into a fund. But you will pay all  of the cleanup costs. You will pay all  of the claims for damages brought in  either State or Federal  court now  under State  liability  laws or under  Federal liability law now since we no  longer have preemption.  You will pay all claims. Like  the  Fram oil filter, you will pay it now or  you will pay it later, but you will pay  them all. The issue is not whether oil  companies will pay. They will pay.  And they will pay under both systems  now, totally.  The only issue is whether or not oil  shipments will be  insurable. That is  the only issue.  The Senate bill and the House bill  now contain limits of liability before  the fund kicks in. Why? Because that  is the way insurance works. Just like a  regular insurance policy on your auto mobile at home. You pay the deducti ble for the damage you cause another  person, and then your insurance kicks  in for the rest.  Unlike your  automobile  insurance  policy, we go further. We say that if  you are grossly negligent or if you will fully injure someone by damaging oil spills, that you will be totally responsi ble. But if you are simply negligent as  an ordinary driver might be, the insur ance fund kicks in.  What insurance fund? An insurance  fund composed of tax dollars collected  from you. You pay either way.  Now why is it an issue of whether or  not we want responsible transporters?  In the Senate version of this bill the  Senate provided for $1,000 per gross  ton on tankers. We did it differently.  We said we are going to go $600 a  gross ton on tankers as a deductible,  but another $600 on the owher of the  oil.  What did we do? We said in effect  we are going to have a $1,200 deducti ble; higher than the Senate. But we  are going  to  impose  the deductible,  that first payment not only on  the  transporter but on the owner of the  oil as well.  Why? Because we want responsible  transporters out there. We want and  expect owners of oil who are moving  responsible  around America  to hire  parties to move that oil  Now if this amendment is not adopt ed, if States are allowed in the pres ence of this big insurance fund now to  maintain their own unlimited liability  limits, then who will be able to get in surance under this fund?  I  suggest  to  you  that what will  happen  is  oilowners,  knowing  they  have  a  responsibility  they  cannot  duck, will have trouble finding trans porters who can get insurance, and as  a result you will see more and more  sham corporations set up, more fly-by night transporters walking around, we  will see more calls on the fund, yes,  but we will see less responsible parties  with insurance.  Now,  look,  this  is not preemption,  this  is  not Halloween;  do  not  be  spooked. This is not preemption.  This is a simple issue of whether or  not you want responsible transporters  moving oil and oil products around  America.  I suggest you look: The right envi. ronmental vote is a vote to ensure that  responsible parties are out there with  insurance but  the State  laws mimic  the Federal law on those limits of li ability before the big fund kicks in.  Do not kid yourselves,  the spiller  will pay; they will pay up front or they  will pay  through  the nose  in  taxes  until the cleanup is accomplished.  That is what our bill does.  The Hughes amendment sponsored  by a Member who voted for and sup ported Miller-Studds  is  the  right  amendment and it ought to be passed.  ",1989

1605,163,20,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Chairman, as an original  cosponsor of H.R. 1465 and a member of the  Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee,  I  rise  in strong support of the Comprehensive  Oil Pollution Prevention, Response, Liability,  and Compensation Act of 1989. The enact ment of a comprehensive Federal oilspill pre vention and cleanup regime  is  long overdue,  and I encourage my colleagues to support this  worthwhile legislation.  This body has repeatedly worked for the en actment of such legislation during the past 15  years. The measure before us today is a cul mination of those efforts. As a result, this bill  has a stronger and more comprehensive ap proach  for addressing  the aftermath  of a  tragic oilspill. The bill also seeks to take those  actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of  such spills. The bill will put  in place  those  mechanisms which will help prevent oilspills  from occurring, train personnel and ensure the  proper equipment  is  in place  to  respond  to  any spills that do occur, provide for the clean up of oil spills, and compensate those parties  who are injured by spills.  Mr. Chairman,  this  is a good bill; a strong  bill. While we can never guarantee an oilspill  of  the devastating magnitude of  the Exxon  Valdez will not occur  in  the  future, we can  take those steps necessary to attempt to pre vent such spills and ensure  the  financing  is  available to pay for the cleanup and compen sate the victims of a major spill. The legisla tion we are considering will accomplish these  worthwhile goals.  Mr. Chairman, I congratulate  the chairman  and ranking member of the Merchant Marine  and Fisheries Committee, Mr. JONES of North  Carolina and Mr. DAVIS,  the chairman of the  Coast Guard Subcommittee, Mr. TAUZIN,  the  chairman and  ranking member of  the Public  Works and Transportation Committee, Mr. AN DERSON and Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT, and my  good friend and colleague from New York, Mr.  NOWAK, the chairman of the Water Resources  Subcommittee, and the ranking member of the  subcommittee, Mr. STANGELAND,  for their ef forts  in bringing  this measure  to  the  floor.  Again,  I urge my colleagues  to support  this  landmark piece of legislation.  ",1989

",1989
1607,163,20,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of the Miller-Studds amend ment to H.R. 1465, the Oil Pollution, Preven tion, Response, Liability, and Compensation  Act of 1989, to protect the rights of States to  maintain their own oilspill response standards.  Earlier this year, it was the damage to Alas ka's environment caused by the Exxon Valdez  that shocked our Nation and gave this body a  renewed  incentive  for action. Twenty years  ago  it was  the Delian Apo/Ion which  ran  aground  in Tampa Bay  leaving behind a 20square-mile oil slick  that spurred  the Florida  State Legislation  into adopting what remains  today our Nation's toughest oilspill standards.  The legislation we have under consideration  this week would  establish  important,  long  overdue,  new  Federal  standards  requiring  emergency  response plans  in  the event of  tragic oilspills such as the one we witnessed  in Alaska. It also would clarify the responsibil ities and liabilities of tanker owners and ship pers in the event of a spill.  As  reported by  the committee, however,  H.R. 1465 significantly undermines the author ity of States to maintain their own more strin gent Federal oilspill  response standards and  liability requirements. States such as Florida,  which has been a national leader in the enact ment  of  legislation  to  protect  our  fragile  marine environment and  resources  from oil spills and other accidents at sea, should not  be penalized for their efforts to establish em nergency response plans and funds.  As  a  former Florida State Senator and  author of our State's Oil Spill Prevention and  Containment Act, I strongly support the Miller Studds amendment to preserve these  impor tant States rights in this area. The 1970 legis lation which  I drafted was the first of its kind  in our Nation and became a model used by  other States  in establishing  their own oilspill  response programs and standards.  The Florida State Legislature's overwhelm ing support for my legislation was the result of  our experience  in February 1970 when  the  Delian Apo/Ion  ran aground  in Tampa Bay,  spilling more than 10,000 gallons of crude oil.  I remember  the helpless  feeling of standing  on  the shoreline as  the oil spead  into a 20square-mile slick. No containment or cleanup  equipment was available anywhere in the area  and there was no preplanned strategy to stop  the spread of oil. This  lack of preparedness  caused the death of thousands of birds, fish,  and other wildlife, damaged and destroyed  many boats, and covered our beautiful sandy  white beaches with tar balls.  Within 4 months of that accident, our State  did something to prevent future damage to our  environment by enacting tough oilspill legisla tion  that was eventually upheld unanimously  by .the U.S. Supreme Court. The  intent and  scope of this legislation included many of the  same provisions that we have under consider ation in H.R. 1465. As with this legislation, the  Florida law established an oilspill trust fund to  pay for cleanup costs associated with oilspills,  required  oilspill  containment  and  cleanup  equipment to be available in case of a spill,  and provided penalties for those responsible  for oil spills. We also established in Florida 11  district response teams to be ready and avail able  to assess damage and  initiate cleanup  activities  in  the event of a spill anywhere  in  the State. A similar response team program is  included in the legislation before us today.  The damage to Alaska's wildlife and envi ronment in Prince William Sound is a stark re minder of the destruction a major oilspill can  leave behind, especially when emergency re sponse efforts are  limited by a  lack of pre paredness. Just 2 weeks ago  in Florida, we  endured  two near cataclysmic shipping acci dents within a 5-day period. Although  there  was no major loss of oil or other cargo in the  water,  the grounding of  these  two  tankers  caused  irreparable  damage  to  the  unique  coral reefs in the Key West area. Thousands  of square  feet of coral  that  took more  than  100 years  to grow, was destroyed  in  these  two accidents. One can only wonder about  the magnitude of damage  that would have  ",1989
1608,202,20,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker,  the political  philosopher Niccolo Machievelli wrote  the  textbook on power politics  for dictators. Ac cording to Machievelli, when a dictator faces  internal opposition, he should create an exter nal threat to divert the people's attention from  the sorry state of domestic affairs. By crying  wolf, the dictator can arrest or eliminate oppo nents under  the guise of national security.  This  is a common ploy, used by  totalitarian  dictators throughout the ages.  The Daniel Ortega is a modern day master  practitioner of Machiavellian techniques. Only  2 weeks ago a poll revealed that Ortega and  the Sandinista party were  falling  far behind  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the UNO party ticket headed by Mrs. Violeta  Chamorro. The Sandinistas subtle efforts  to  undermine the Mrs. Chamorro and the political  opposition apparently have not succeeded as  they expected.  It has become clear that any thing approaching an open and  fair election  would  result  in  the Sandinistas being  turned  out of office.  Mr. Ortega, faced with an increasingly effec tive political opposition, suddenly discovered  that the peace process was threatened by the  Contra  forces. The Contras, composed of a  relatively  small  force  of  several  thousand  poorly armed or unarmed  fighters, was pre sented as a  threat  to  the 80,000 heavily  armed Nicaraguan army. According to Ortega,  the threat was such that Nicaragua had to re pudiate  the peace process,  that they had to  conduct massive military operations against  the Contras, and  that the February elections  have been jeopardized.  Mr. Speaker, the behavior of Daniel Ortega  has been outrageous. It is clear that he sees  the writing on the wall, and that he is trying to  retain power at all costs. The problem  for  Ortega is that he has relied on the excuse of  an external threat once too often. Most of the  Nicaraguan people are clearly disgusted and  disenchanted with the Sandinista regime, and  it seems that Ortega is having problems rally ing the Nicaraguan people to his cause.  As a  recent editorial  in  the Lincoln Star  noted, ""He has isolated himself as a military  dictator afraid of peace for fear it will threaten  his  leadership."" Daniel Ortega  is  finding out  what Machievelli discovered centuries ago-in  time the people will abandon the dictator and  demand peace.  Mr. Speaker, this Member would include in  the record and commend to his colleagues a  November 3, 1989 editorial in the Lincoln Star  entitled ""Give Ortega Enough Rope."" As this  insightful editorial notes,. ""Ortega's time is run ning out. He holds the key to his own future,  and he has just repudiated peace.""  GIVE ORTEGA ENOUGH ROPE  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has  hung one too many raps on the U.S. role in  supporting the Contras when he blames it  for the possibility he may cancel elections  scheduled in February.  Undoubtedly, there have been Contra vio lations of the cease-fire agreement; hostil ities are too high for this not to have oc curred. But it is U.S. policy to cut off hu manitarian aid  to  rebel groups  that have  broken the cease-fire. And Ortega himself  promotes no greater understanding by re fusing to talk directly with the Contras.  He chose Costa Rica's celebration of 100  years of democracy as his  forum  to an nounce he would not renew the 19-month old  truce with  the Contras. A chorus of  Latin disapproval greeted his ill-timed an nouncement.  He has isolated himself as a military dicta tor afraid of peace for fear it will threaten  his leadership.  Happily, President Bush will not play his  game. We will not resume military assist ance to the Contras. Along with the other  Latin leaders, we must insist that elections  be held, we must insist on remaining true to  the  peace  process  enunciated  by Costa  Rican President Oscar Arias.  Let Ortega hang himself.  In 1985, when Congress finally succeeded  in cutting off military aid  to  the Contra  November 8, 1989  rebel forces, Ortega's response was to march  off to Moscow, embarrassing the politicians  who had supported ending Contra aid at  great political cost.  Last year, Ortega cracked down heavily on  dissenters in Nicaragua after Congress again  defeated a military aid bill and just after  Ortega had signed the cease-fire agreement.  Ortega's time is running out. He holds the  key to his own future, and he has just repu diated peace.  ABORTION: A CLOSER LOOK AT  PUBLIC OPINION  HON. JOHN J. LaFALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESJ!:NTATIVES  Wednesday, November 8, 1989  ",1989
1609,202,20,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  share with my colleagues an  insightful article  by Everett Carll Ladd, the executive director of  the Roper Center  for Public Opinion Re search, which appeared  in  the Buffalo News  on October 29, 1989.  Mr.  Ladd's discerning article underscores  several often overlooked  facts  regarding  the  perception of public opinion following the Su preme Court's July 3 decision, Webster versus  Reproductive Health Services. Contrary  to  much explanation and . analysis  following  this  Supreme Court decisipn, Mr. Ladd argues that  there  is n9 substantial evidence of a major  shift in the general public's thinking on abor tion.  I commend  the  following article  to my  colleagues as a refreshing and realistic view  of post-Webster public opinion on abortion.  The article follows:  ABORTION: A CLOSER LoOK AT PUBLIC  OPINION  <By Everett Carll Ladd)  Politics trades heavily in perceptions. One  of  the controlling perceptions  in current  American politics has it that a sea change  has occurred  in  the public's thinking on  abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme  Court's July 3 ruling in the case of Webster  vs. Reproductive Health Services.  Pro-choice  activists-who generally  had  been satisfied with the expansive abortion  rights policy set down by the Court in Roe  vs. Wade <1973)-clearly were angered by  the Webster ruling and shocked by its signal  that the Supreme Court no longer has a ma jority committed to Roe. Re-energized, they  may well be a more potent lobbying force  today than they were prior to July 3.  But among  the general public, no  sea  change has occurred in opinion on abortion.  In fact,  the public's mix of views on the  issue is exactly what it has been for years.  Many commentators have badly misinter preted public opinion on abortion, it seems,  because  they  have  assumed  that most  people who have thought about the issue  and who have strong feelings on it must ul timately  come  down  either  ""for""  or  ""against."" Millions are wholly supportive of  the right to abortion, of course, or strongly  opposed to abortion in most if not all cir cumstances-but the vast preponderance of  Americans just aren't in either camp.  Part of the judgment reached by many  Americans in the ""great middle"" is that , on  abortion as on so many other questions, the  idea of letting individuals, choose deserves  great respect. When, for example, pollsters  ask whether, ""if a woman wants to have an  ",1989
1610,215,20,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  make the Members of the House aware of the  unique accomplishments of two Missourians Mrs. William H. Weldon of Jefferson City and  her horse Will Shriver. Recently,  they were  both inducted into the St. Louis National Char ity Horse Hall of Fame, and Will was the first  horse ever to receive this prestigious honor.  Mr. Speaker, this tribute was a fitting culmi nation to the storied career of Will Shriver, the  leading sire of American Saddlebreds and the  greatest gaited horse ever to enter the ring. It  was also a tribute to the patience and sound  judgment of Mrs. Weldon who saw champion ship potential in Will Shriver when others had  their doubts.  Will Shriver's career has been a story of  courage and perseverance because success  did not come quickly or easily to this horse. In  both 197 4 and 1975, he qualified to compete  in  the grand championship class at the Ken tucky State Fair-the ""Super Bowl"" of horse  show competitions. In both years, however, ill ness and injury robbed him of the chance to  contend for the title. To a lesser horse, these  would have been career-ending setbacks. But  not to Will Shriver. Under the guidance of Mrs.  Weldon, he fought back from his injuries and  claimed  the grand champion title  in 1976 at  the age of 10. He was the first Missouri horse  to claim top honors in 35 years. Mrs. Weldon  retired Will after his triumph and started him  on a second career  that  led  to his being  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  named the No. 1 sire in the country in 1985,  and in each succeeding year.  Mr. Speaker,  I know all of my colleagues  will  join me  in congratulating Mrs. William H.  Weldon and her horse Will Shriver on receiv ing his much deserved recognition.  THE PETER J.

1611,215,20,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Speaker, East Durham,  NY,  recently witnessed  the dedication of an  important memorial  library. Dedication cere monies were  c.onducted as  the community  opened the Peter J. O'Neill, Sr. Memorial Li brary in memory of Peter J. O'Neill.  Long a resident of Freehold, NY, Mr. O'Neill  was an active and admired member of  the  community. He had served as past president  of  the Greenville  Irish American Club,  a  member of the Knights of Columbus, and a  member of our Lady of Knock Council 6439.  This library is a fitting tribute to his memory.  It will be housed at  the  Irish Cultural and  Sports Center, where renovations are now un derway. The goal is to create a warm, pleas ant atmosphere where people may come and  browse  through materials on  Irish and  Irish American subjects. The reference center will  include not only books, but newspapers, mag azines, children's books and videotapes.  I know I join the family and many friends of  Peter O'Neill in congratulating the Irish Sports  and Cultural Center on  the establishment of  this memorial  library.  It will be a significant  part of the community, and I look forward to  its contributions  in  the preservation of  Irish  culture.  TRIBUTE TO EDUCATION  COMMISSIONER BETTY CASTOR  HON.

The first woman ever elect ed to the Florida Cabinet, Education Commis sioner Betty Castor  is widely  recognized as  the State's leading advocate for education.  She has earned that recognition. Ever since  she received a degree in education, Commis sioner Castor has worked  tirelessly  as  a  teacher,  civic  leader,  county commissioner,  State Senator and  top-level administrator  to  promote excellence  in Florida's educational  system.  Her  first  teaching  assignment  was  in  Uganda, East Africa. Then  she  taught at  Holmes Elementary School  in Dade County  and went on to get a master's degree in edu cation from the University of Miami. She later  28039  was elected to the Hillsborough County board  of commissioners and worked as director of  governmental  relations  for  the University of  South Florida. During  three terms as a State  Senator,  she  distinguished  herself  as  an  expert on the education budget, receiving nu merous awards for her innovation and leader ship.  In her first year  in office, she has reorga nized  the department of education,  trying  to  make it more responsive to the needs of dis tricts, teachers, communities and most of all,  the students. She emphasizes successful pro grams, business partnerships, professionalism  in teaching and preparing students for today's  competitive world marketplace.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to congratulate Com missioner Castor for her award and hope that  she continues  to promote good programs in  Florida.  A SALUTE TO ZONTA  INTERNATIONAL  HON. CONSTANCE A.

1636,293,20,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce today legislation  to bring badly needed development as sistance to the United States-Mexico  border  areas.  This  legislation,  the  United States-Mexico Border Regional  Development Act, has been introduced  in the House of Representatives by my  distinguished colleague Congressman  RON COLEMAN  of El Paso. This bill  would establish a southwest border re gional commission  to spur economic  development along the border and to  help meet the pressing health and in frastructure needs of that area of our  Nation.  Mr. President, there are few if any  areas of our country more in need of  economic assistance. This area has the  dubious  distinction  of  having  the  county with  the  lowest  per  capita  income  in  the United States-Starr  County, TX. In fact, 4 of the 10 lowest  per  capita  income  counties  in  the  Nation are along  the United States Mexico border.  The border areas have a large supply  of good labor, unfortunately, because  the unemployment rate  is extremely  high  these areas.  In addition  to  high  unemployment  and  low  per  capita income, the border also suffers  from a  severe  lack of  infrastructure  and poor health conditions. A  large  part of the health problems stem from  the  fact  that  tens of  thousands of  people along the border live in unin corporated communities known as co lonias. Many of  these colonias  lack  even basic water and sewer services. As  a result the disease problems in these  areas are severe.  In addition, along the border we are  less able to cope with these increased  health hazards since there is only one  doctor for every 1,150 patients-com pared to 600 patients per physician in  the rest of Texas.  The  border  between  the United  States and Mexico is the only place in  the world where a major industrialized  in  country shares a boundary with a de veloping nation.  That single fact compounds all the  problems confronting people who live  along the border in Texas.  Tens of millions of gallons of raw  sewage  are  pumped  into  the Rio  Grande every day by cities on  the  Mexican side of the border, compound ing the health problems that we have  in Texas, particularly in the colonias  which have no water or sewer systems.  Along the border unemployment is  higher and per capita  income  lower  than anywhere else in Texas, or most  of the rest of the United States.  The border is also the third fastest  growing region in America. The popu lation  is projected to double by  the  year 2000, compounding the difficulty  and magnitude of the problem.  This proposal  is a major, dramatic  initiative  to offer Texans who  live  along our border with Mexico a bigger  share in the American dream.  No one is suggesting that the United  States-Mexico Border Regional Com mission will have  the power or  re sources  to  bring prosperity  to  the  border, but I am convinced it can help  set  the stage  for economic develop ment. It can help us overcome inertia,  solve problems and realize the poten tial of the region.  . This proposal is a classic example of  how our public and private sectors can  work  together  to  solve problems  in  America. The way I see it, the Region al Commission would help direct re sources  toward infrastructure, educa tion and public health. The border  area is rich in opportunity, and with a  healthy, well-educated work force and  the infrastructure to support modern  industry the private sector will see to  it that the economic opportunity that  has so long bypassed this region is fi nally brought in. This Commission can  be the catalyst that sparks the private  sector  interest  and  investment  this  area so desperately needs.  The United States-Mexico  border  unites as well as divides two great na tions. It is a logical, attractive place to  site manufacturing facilities and start  up joint ventures to meet the growing  needs of American and Mexican mar kets. The Regional Commission can  get the ball rolling by building up the  infrastructure  and  developing  the  human capital along the border. Then  it will be up to the private sector to  move in, broaden the tax base, create  jobs, help train people to fill them and  seek markets on both  sides of  the  border.  I want to compliment RON COLEMAN  for his leadership on this issue in the  House.  I am pleased to work with him on  this issue. I was born on that border,  in  the Rio Grande Valley of south  Texas,  and many members  of my  family are still  there. My  roots run  deep there. The valley is my home.  But  the  issue here  is much more  than the old home ties. The issue is  whether tens of thousands of U.S. citi zens are going to have a share of the  hope and opportunity that we call the  American dream. The issue is whether  children will continue to walk through  ankle-deep sewage after a hard rain,  and whether we as a nation want to  endure the expense to taxpayers and  the suffering to sick children and their  families of the rampant disease prob lems resulting from  the  lack of  the  most basic amenities. Amenities that  most Americans  take  for granted-a  sink with running water, a flush toilet.  The issue  is whether the citizens of  these areas will continue  to be  the  poorest  of  the  poor,  consigned  to  third-world living and economic condi tions, or whether they will have an op portunity to be one of those thousand  points of light.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting passage of  this needed legislation.e  By Mr. DECONCINI:  S. 1871. A bill to amend the Food Se curity Act of 1985 to clarify the appli cation of certain payment limitations  to certain leases involving tribal land lords, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,  and Forestry.  CLARIFICATION OF THE FOOD SECURITY ACT OF  1985  e ",1989
1637,293,20,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr.  President,  today  I  am  introducing  legislation  which addresses some of the problems  that  Indian  tribes are  facing under  current agricultural restrictions on the  payment limitation to Indian farming  ventures.  In 1978, the Department of Agricul ture [USDA] exempted Indian tribes  from payment limitation requirements  for  the number and amount of pay ments which could be received under  USDA  programs.  This  exemption  placed an upper limit on the amount  of payments based upon tribal mem bers. From 1978 to 1988, Indian tribal  ventures participated  in USDA pro grams without regard to the payment  limitation provisions. Tribal  farming  operations were planned and conduct ed in reliance on the existence of this  exemption.  In 1987,  the Food Security Act of  1985 was amended in the Agricultural  Reconciliation Act. Nothing  in  the  1987 Act or in  its  legislative history  even suggested that it was intended to  alter the existing treatment of Indian  farming ventures. However, in 1988, as  a result of the act, USDA repealed the  Indian tribe exemption. This repeal re sulted in onerous restrictions on the  Indian farming operations particularly  with respect to the leasing of farmland  to or from nontribal farmers.  I  took great steps  to  resolve  the  problems  administratively.  Through  ",1989
1638,306,20,Mr.  VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR  SIMON.," Mr. President, in the  Septembe~ 20 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD,  I mentioned a phone call and a conver sation  I  had with Bishop Merardo  Gomez of El Salvador, the Lutheran  Bishop of El Salvador.  Unfortunately,  less  than a month  later,  there was  a  bombing of  .the  house next to the bishop's residence, a  house that was scheduled to become a  church school.  I hope that what happened was not  in  response  to  the bishop's  talking  candidly to an American Senator.  I have written  to  the El Salvador  Ambassador to the United States, and  I  ask  to  print  that  letter  in  the  RECORD.  The letter follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, November 3, 1989.  His Excellency MIGUEL SALA VERRIA,  I  Embassy of El Salvador, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR: On September 20,  in an exchange on the floor of the United  States Senate with Senator To.M HARKIN,  quoted Bishop Merardo Gomez, the Luther an Bishop, as saying: ""Stop sending down  these weapons that are killing us .. Let us  solve our problems down here.""  I hope that the bombing was not in repris al  to a  frank statement by  the Lutheran  Bishop to a United States Senator.  I would appreciate your notifying the gov ernment  of El Salvador  that protecting  Bishop Gomez, and others who may differ  with government policy, is extremely impor tant if a  reasonable relationship  is  to be  maintained between the United States and  El Salvador.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Cordially,  PAUL SIMON,  U.S. Senator.   THE IMPORTANCE OF CARRIERS  IN  AN  ERA  OF  CHANGING  STRATEGIC PRIORITIES  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on Vet erans Day, we will  commission  the  U.S.S. Lincoln, our fifth Nimitz-class  aircraft carrier. The Lincoln will be  the largest ship ever built for the U.S.  Navy. It will displace 100,000 tons. It is  1,040 feet long, and 134 feet wide, and  its flight deck has an area of 4112 acres.  It will be 244 feet from keel to mast  top, the height of a 24-story building.  The  U.S.S.  importance  does not, however, lie in its size. It lies  in the fact that the Lincoln symbol izes the kind of power projection capa bility we need  in an era of glasnost  and changing strategic priorities. The  Lincoln's  Lincoln symbolizes the kind of flexible  and global power projection we need  to deal with future contingencies,  it  symbolizes  the  kind  of  force  that  needs to be given priority in an era of  declining real defense resources, and it  symbolizes the kind of capability that  must be preserved in an era where we  must make major changes in the roles  and missions of our forces.  We often talk about scenarios and  contingencies, but we often ignore the  way in which we actually use our mili tary power. As  a  result,  I  recently  asked  the U.S. Navy  to prepare an  analysis of how we have used military  power since the end of World Warn. I  ask that the fun text of this analysis  be included in the record, but some of  the key  statistics  involved virtually  speak for themselves.  We have used military  force well  over 200 times since the end of World  War II. While some controversy. exists  over the precise number of incidents  that should be counted, and fully up to-date figures are not available, it is  clear that sea.power was used in over  80 percent of these incidents, and that  carrier forces were used in over half of  these cases.  If we look at the use of naval power  in the period between 1945 and 1989,  we have more precise figures. There  have been 187 times we have used sea power in the period between 1945 and  November 1989. The vast majority of  these uses have been to prevent war,  to  limit  its escalation, or to protect  American citizens or America's friends  and allies. There have, however, also  been many cases where sea.power has  had to play a critical role in combat.  These  cases  include  South Korea,  Vietnam, Grenada, and  the  raid on  Libya-just to name a few.  Mr. President, I ask that two tables  outlining these 187 incidents be print ed in the RECORD at the conclusion of  my statement.  Mr. President, we used our carriers  in 125 of these cases, or 67 percent.  What is equally important is that we  also  relied  on  the U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps team. We used amphibi ous ships in 101 cases, or 54 percent.  In virtually all of the cases where we  used Marine Corps forces, some 97 per cent, we used U.S. Navy forces as well.  The U.S. Navy  also worked closely  with the power projection elements of  the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army. U.S.  Navy and U.S. Air Force units were in volved in 54 of the 187 cases, or 29 per cent. U.S. Army forces were involved  in 34 cases, or 18 percent.  It seems almost certain that these  trends will  continue  in  the  future,  with the important change that there  will be fewer and fewer cases which in volve NATO, and particularly the cen tral region, and fewer cases that in volve  any element of confrontation  ",1989

1640,319,20,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, with  the death of Arthur Holland, New  Jersey has lost a great friend and a de voted public servant.  Arthur Holland was mayor of New  Jersey's capitol city for over a quarter  of a century. He was truly the dean of  our mayors. His life and work has left  an indelible mark on tne city. Under  Mayor Holland's leadership, Trenton  has been in the forefront of confront ing major urban problems  such  as  drugs and homelessness. Trenton is on  the upswing-due  in  large  part  to  Arthur Holland's hard work and devo tion.  Mayor  Holland  genuinely  cared  about our urban areas, not just in New  Jersey  but  throughout  the United  States. As  the president of  the U.S.  Conference of Mayors, he  reminded  the  country  of  the  needs  and  strengths of our cities. He was a force ful spokesman for their interests.  With the passing of Mayor Holland,  we have  lost a public servant whose  dedication, hard work, and unbending  pride in Trenton and in New Jersey  has made our State a better place to  live. I have also lost a friend. He will  be deeply missed.e  Mr.  WHO SPEAKS FOR THE  DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY?  e ",1989

1653,345,20,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, on  October 31, 1989, the House of Repre sentatives agreed to an amendment of  the Senate, and the fiscal year 1990  VA-HUD-independent agencies appro priations bill, H.R.. 2916, was cleared  for signature by the President. This  appropriations bill contains $12.4 bil lion for NASA in fiscal year 1990, in  addition to funding for other agencies.  Today, after several delays, the Senate  finally has before  it  the fiscal year  1990 NASA authorization bill, S. 916,  that also addresses the budget require ments of NASA. I regret that this bill  has not been considered by the Senate  before now, but this has been a diffi cult year for this bill in light of ques tions  surrounding  private  financing  mechanisms.  In light of the fact the appropria tions bill that funds NASA has already  passed the Senate, I  thought that it  made good sense to offer a series of  amendments  today  to  increase  the  levels of funding prescribed in the au thorization bill to those in the appro priations bill in those few cases where  the appropriations bill does or could  exceed the authorization bill. In par ticular,  this  includes physics and as tronomy, space applications, universi ty academic programs, space shuttle  production and operational capability,  and  research and program manage ment. As  the Members know, I have  worked closely with the Senator from  Maryland on the NASA and National  Science Foundations portions of the  VA-HUD-independent agencies appro priations bill, and I think that at this  point in the process, it makes sense to  make these adjustments.  Normally,  I would suggest that we  wait until the NASA bill was in confer ence and  then adjust  the  spending  levels in the bill to the NASA operat ing plan levels, except in those cases  where the Members feel NASA needs;  First,  increased  flexibility;  second,  more  funding  to meet program  re quirements; or  third, a  signal as  to  areas they should be funding. Howev er, this year, it appears that the Con gress could adjourn before the operat ing  plan  is  available. Therefore,  I  would like to make these minor adjust ments with the expectation that the  final authorization bill would not un derfund any of the already appropri ated programs.  Mr. President,  I  urge  that  amendments be accepted en bloc.  these  AMENDMENTS NOS. 1 104 THROUGH 110 6  ",1989
1654,345,20,Mr.  HOLLINGS.," Mr.  President,  there were  three other provisions  in  the  fiscal  year  1990 VA-HUD-inde-.  pendent agencies appropriations bill  that require a  change  in  the  fiscal  year 1990 authorization bill.  In  particular,  the  authorization  must include an authorization of ap propriations  for  three  facilities  that  were  included  in  the appropriations  bill. One of  these  facilities,  the ad vanced solid rocket motor facility, was  not  included  in  the fiscal year 1990  NASA authorization bill because the  committee thought that the private fi nancing scheme contained  in S. 663  would prove fruitful. However,  it did  not, and the Appropriations Commit tee was gracious enough  to  include  funding for this facility in their bill.  The other  two  facilities,  the wake  shield facility and the space station or bital debris radar facility, are both in cluded in the fiscal year 1990 .NASA  authorization bill in the research and  development portions of the bill. How ever,  the Appropriations Committee  was correct in including these facilities  as new line items in the construction  of facilities account.  The first amendment in this package  takes care of these three items.  Furthermore, the committee agrees  with  the Appropriations Committee  that $75 million of prior year unobli gated orbiter production funds should  be used to fund space shuttle structur al spares, an extended duration orbiter  and  additional  space  transportation  operational activities. The committee,  therefore, has authorized $25 million  for  each of  these  activities  in  the  second amendment.  Finally, the last amendment in this  package earmarks $35 million  in the  space  shuttle production  and  oper ational capability account for the tool",1989

Many people, unfortunately, cling to  the belief that veterans, a group of  which I am proud to be a member, are  only responsible for past actions, for  keeping our Government and our bor ders  intact. However,  I  think every  American should  take  the  time  this  Saturday to stop and think about the  tremendous impact that veterans have  had on our present American system  of government. Our right  to choose  our leaders in this democratic country  would not exist but for the fact that  millions were willing to give their lives  in the defense of our ability to vote  and for our freedom.  Those who have died for our Nation  can only fail to the extent that we fail  them. We must do nothing less than  to give them our best.

1656,358,20,Mr. DENNY SMITH.," Mr. Speaker, I  have introduced a bill, the POW /MIA  public accountability bill,  that would  require all Federal agencies to disclose  information concerning United States  personnel classified as prisoners of war  or missing in action from World War  II, Korea, and Vietnam. It would not  force  the  Government  to  reveal  sources and methods of  intelligence  collection, nor would it automatically  release sensitive personal information  without the express permission of the  family.  This  legislation also makes excep tions in the case of particularly prom ising, ongoing  investigations so  that  they will not be compromised.  A  constituent  of mine, Mr.  Al  Zeigler,  spent 34 days down  in  the  tiger cage at the Vietnam Memorial,  and it was through his courage and his  patience that it came to my attention  that we were not able to get this infor mation. I have long been one who felt  that we left people behind in Vietnam  and Laos, and I  think there are rea sons to have this bill passed through  the House.  Since wars are such public events,  their final accounting should be, as  well.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  3603.

1657,358,20,Mr.  SHAW.," Mr.  Speaker,  distin guished colleagues in the House, it is  with regret that I bring you the news  of  the death  of Edward Stack,  a  former Member of this body.  Representative Stack died last week  at a hospital in my home district of  Broward County-but  not without  leaving a mark on south Florida.  Representative Stack  completed  a  successful law career in New York and  a  4-year stint with  the U.S. Coast  Guard before he moved to south Flori da  to begin  an  impressive  political  career. He began on the charter review  board of Pompano Beach, and then  worked his way to the city commission  of that city, and later onto the county  sheriff's seat.  As Broward County Sheriff, Stack  made his mark by modernizing  the  sheriff's office. He created a crime lab,  improved pay and benefits for depu ties,  initiated  the  911  emergency  system, and established the county's  first drug rehabilitation program.  He is known for making some of the  greatest strides in the areas of mental  health  and  drug  dependency  as  anyone in the history of south Florida.  Fittingly, Representative Stack was  later appointed to the position of ad ministrator of  the Broward County  Commission on Alcoholism, now called  the Court Alcohol  and  Substance  Abuse Program. He held  that post  until he died.  During his  political  career, Stack  drew endorsements from Barry Gold water  and  later  served  as Richard  Nixon's State campaign chairman. He  came to this body as a Democrat.  Then in 1978, Mr. Stack landed in  this body at the age of 68, making him  the oldest freshman ever to serve  in  the U.S. House of Representatives.  Ed Stack was admired by Democrats  and Republicans alike, and he will be  sorely missed.  REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER  AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 2273  ",1989

Mr. Speaker, the conference report  on H.R. 2461 authorizes $302.8 billion  for  the Department of Defense  for  fiscal years 1990 and 1991.  These  funds will be used  for  the  whole range of our Nation's security  needs,  including  procurement,  re search and development, military per sonnel, construction, and housing.  Since this legislation was first con sidered last June, events have acceler ated dramatically within  the Soviet  Union and the Eastern bloc.  Poland has had  free  elections,  in  which  the  Solidarity-led  opposition  overwhelmingly defeated the Commu nist Party.  Hungary  has  opened  its  borders,  adopted  dramatic  internal  reforms,  and set the course for elections next  summer.  In East Germany, tens of thousands  have fled for democracy in the West,  and the ruling Cabinet has resigned in  the face of the mounting crisis.  We can scarcely keep up with the  pace of change and the significance of  these events. The world seems weary  of war  and hungry  for  democratic  reform.  By overwhelming margins, Ameri cans fear the threat of a drug war in  their streets far more  than nuclear  war with the Soviet Union.  We face a crisis in health care, de clining educational standards, an as sault by drug lords, and a crumbling  infrastructure.  We cannot continue to build redun dant nuclear systems, pay billions in  ",1989
1662,371,20,Mr. SYNAR.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, in July, I  joined with  the  distinguished  chairman  of  the  Armed Services Committee, Mr. AsPIN,  in offering a compromise amendment  to H.R. 2461 which placed certain re strictions on the obligation of funds  for procurement of B-2 production air craft. The  amendment  passed  the  House  overwhelmingly,  g1vmg  the  House conferees a strong position for  the conference in this area. Unfortu nately,  the  test-before-you-buy  lan guage in the conference report is not  as strong as it was in the House-passed  bill.  It is my understanding that the Air  Force may propose a 1-year shift in  the milestones included in the B-2 full  performance matrix. If the Secretary  of Defense agrees, and the delay goes  into effect, the Air Force would then  have no  testing and evaluation  re quirements to satisfy before it could  obligate funds for  the production of  B-2  aircraft  in  1991. Such  a  shift  would  thus create a 1-year break  in  the  annual  test-before-you-buy  re quirements endorsed by the House. I  would like to engage in a colloquy with  Chairman AsPIN at this time to see if  we can avoid this scenario.  If the Secretary of Defense does pro pose such a shift in the milestones in cluded  in  the B-2  full performance  matrix, will the chairman on behalf of  the Armed Services Committee, resist  this effort?

1676,371,20,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from Florida for  yielding time to me. He has been won derful in all of this.  Mr. Speaker, when I learned of the  contents of  the conference report,  I  asked myself three questions:  First,  in  its negotiations with  the  Senate, did the House get a good deal?  Second, does  the agreement repre sent sound defense policy?  Third, does  the agreement protect  the taxpayer, now and in the future?  And,  to each question,  the answer  came back ""no"". So, despite the fact  that I think Chairman ASPIN made a  credible effort and despite  the  fact  that there is much in this bill which I  like,  I must oppose  the conference  agreement.  In  dealing with  the Senate,  the  House was ransacked. When Secretary  Cheney said the F-14D was an expen sive plane, he did not know the half of  it. To continue procurement of the F14D, the Senate demanded and got the  House  to back down on  issue after  issue. The Senate insisted the House  recede on strategic programs, on con ventional programs, on personnel pro grams, and on readiness programs. It's  not that the Senate was so opposed to  18  additional F-14D's. Rather,  the  Senate sharpies knew what the House  needed  politically  and  bluffed  the  House into selling out everything else.  Similarly,  the Senate extracted  an other $150 million  in mobile missile  programs because the House  insisted  on capping MX's at 50.  Yet,  the House-Senate poker game  pales in importance to the other two  questions. This bill does not set an in telligent defense policy. It funds two  mobile  land-based missiles. There  is  real doubt as to whether we need one.  It fully funds the B-2 bomber. There  is, frankly no mission for a penetrat ing manned bomber in the future. We  might as well be  investing in spears  and coats of mail.  And, the bill makes no move toward  restructuring  forces  to  reflect  the  leaner, defense-oriented, more rear de ployed forces of the post-CFE, budget  austerity years ahead. The bill contin ues  the bellicose defense policies of  the Reagan years.  Do the taxpayers get a good deal?  Certainly not. The bill says no to no  weapons program. If its designed  to  shoot or fly or go boom, we'll buy it.  Program  terminations  proposed  by  Secretary Cheney were  delayed  or  eliminated. No additional program ter minations were added. If the drafters  of this bill were women, they would be  pregnant  all  the  time,  since  they  cannot say no. The B-2, Midgetman,  and the V-22 will all blossom into mas sive new entitlement programs. And  future deficit reduction efforts will be  undermined.  Over the next decade, defense budg ets will go down  in real terms. Yet,  these new procurement programs will  keep going up. Tqis means that the  share  for  personnel,  readiness,  and  military  construction will  plummet.  We will return to a hollow military.  We will have to cut troops and will end  up with toys, but no boys.  This year, the House of Representa tives stood up and said it was time to  change. A missile system was killed.  The B-2 was  slowed. Funding was  shifted to readiness programs, to the  war on drugs, to environmental resto ration. The Senate  blindly  rubber stamped the Cheney budget. In con ference, the restructuring voted on the  House floor was mated with the pro gram  terminations  of  the Cheney  budget and, lo and behold, a cold war  budget appeared: We got a defense bill  aimed at an evil empire that no longer  exists.  I  cannot  report.  ",1989

Mr. Speaker, as a conferee  to  the  fiscal year 1990 DOD authorization  bill, I plan on voting against the con ference report.  The conference report in front of us  is not based on simple fiscal  reality.  We cannot afford to build two mobile  missiles and  a  fleet of half billion  dollar stealth bombers considering the  urgency  of  the war on drugs,  the  cleanup of our Nation's nuclear weap ons production complex, and the size  of the savings and loan bailout. With  these multibillion  dollar  problems  facing us, there is no way that we can  still afford strategic weapons systems  that are redundant, costly, and in all  likelihood  unnecessary  due  to  the  progress we are making at the START  talks in Geneva.  The conference report is fiscally ir responsible and out of touch with cur rent realities. I urge my colleagues to  vote against it.  ",1989

1684,384,20,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I do rise  in support of the conference report,  and I especially would like to thank  the gentleman  from Wisconsin  [Mr.  AsPIN], chairman of  the committee,  and the gentleman from Alabama [Mr.  DICKINSON],  the ranking Republican,  for the fine cooperation extended to  the conferees from the Committee on  Science, Space and Technology on the  provisions  relating  to  technology  transfer.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  conference report for the bill H.R. 2461, and  would  like to particularly thank  the chairman  of  the conference committee, Mr. ASPIN of  Wisconsin, and  the ranking minority member,  Mr. DICKINSON of Alabama, for the fine cooperation the conferees from the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology received for  those sections of the Senate bill committed to  conference.  Section 801 , and sections 3131-3133 of the  Defense authorization bill of fiscal year 199091, H.R. 2461,  reflect  the agreement of  the  Senate and House conferees  regarding  the  Office of Science and Technology's critical  technologies report, and the transfer of tech nology  from Government-owned, contractor operated laboratories to the private sector.  Section 801 amends  the National Science  and Technology Policy, Organization, and Pri orities Act  of  1976  to  require OSTP  to  produce a  critical  technologies  report. No  changes were made by the conferees to the  Senate language concerning this new require ment for the OSTP. This new requirement is  consistent with  the overall mission of OSTP,  and is an important new task which can help  achieve better understanding of  the  role of  technology development in furthering our eco nomic and national security. Funding  for this  task will be provided by  the Department of  Defense for the first year.  Sections 3131-3133 are designed  to en courage and expedite  the  flow of new  ideas  and discoveries to American industry to make  our  industries better able  to compete  in do mestic and global markets.  These provisions have been used success fully for the past several years by those Gov ernment  laboratories  that are operated  by  Federal employees. The General Accounting  Office  recently  reported  that  hundreds  of  agreements have been signed by  these  lab oratories bringing new vigor to their missions.  The  legislation we are considering  today  prescribes a uniform set of rules under which  Government-owned,  contractor-operated  lab oratories may also enter into cooperative re search and development agreements with pri vate companies in a streamlined manner.  To accomplish  this goal,  these provisions  provide that:  First, to resolve any ambiguity regarding the  authority of a defense laboratory to enter into  a  cooperative  research  and  development  agreement,  technology  transfer is made part  of the mission of the national laboratories. In  addition, as many of  these  laboratories are  defense  laboratories,  it  is also provided  that  the implementation of an agreement promote  the program missions of a laboratory including  national security.  It  is  further provided  that  classified  information and unclassified sensi tive information be appropriately safeguarded.  Second, it allows for revenues from licenses  or royalties  to be used  to  further technology  transfer, to provide for scientific and technical  education, and to serve as incentives for new  inventions.  Third, a carefully crafted conflict-of-interest  provision was developed by the conferees be cause of the unique nature of the relationship  between the agency and the civilian employ ees carrying out a Federal activity. An employ ee of a Government-owned, contractor-oper ated  laboratory with a substantial role  in  the  preparation, negotiation, or approval of a co operative  research and development agree ment, may not have any financial or personal  interest in the company with which the labora",1989

1689,410,20,Mr. SIKORSKI.," Mr. Chairman, my  amendment H.R. 1465 will make: First,  oil tankers and facilities more account able in preparing, and second, the Fed eral Government more accountable in  approving oilspill contingency plans.  These plans are our first line of de fense against spills and  incompetent  cleanups. They are not academic, hy pothetical, dust  collectors. At  least  they should not be and that's why my  amendment is necessary.  On Friday, September 15, less than 6  months  after  the  Valdez  oilspill,  Exxon left Alaska very different from  how it found  it,  leaving tides, waves  and seagulls to finish Exxon's cleanup  job.  After  a C-130  transport, half an  hour in a Marine helicopter, ferrying  by  the U.S.S. Duluth, and a Zodiac  ride  to St. Helens Beach  to see for  myself,  I  can  tell you  that Exxon  hasn't cleaned up after  itself.  I can  also tell you that if Exxon had been  required to prepare an approved oil spill contingency plan Exxon would be  richer, Alaskans would be happier, and  America's resources would be safer.  Unbelievably,  a  bill  is  being put  before us on the floor of the House  that has provisions to make life easier  for the companies responsible for such  monumental  destruction  and  fewer  provisions  to decrease  the  likelihood  of another Exxon Valdez in the future.  H.R. 1465 says no vessel or facility  can handle,  store,  or  transport oil  without preparing a contingency plan  which ""has not been rejected"" by the  President. How's  that  for  a  double  negative?  ""Has not been  rejected.""  Passive  approval. Approval without  approval-especially without approval.  Under this bill as proposed, if Federal  experts charged with representing the  public  interest  and  protecting  the  public interest never look at the plans,  they're  approved.  And  unqualified  plans will undoubtedly be approved.  Automatically  and without  finger prints. Plans covering every nook and  cranny,  city  and  town  in America.  We're not talking just about the spe cial, beautiful, and biologically diverse  Prince William Sound. We're talking  about the Chesapeake, the gulf, Puget  Sound, Lake Superior, Huron, Michi gan, Erie, and Ontario, the Mississippi,  Missouri, Ohio, Colorado, Delaware,  Columbia, Hudson Rivers, San Fran cisco, Long Island, Baltimore, Miami,  Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago, De troit, and District of Columbia and ev eryone  and  everything  in  between.  We're talking about your district, your  constituents and oilspill contingency  plans protecting your district,  your  businesses, your citizens and their live lihoods and their lives.  They have the right to have these  very sensitive, these basic contingency  plans be worth more than the unrecy cled paper they're printed on. Contin gency plans for oilspills should be real,  rational, workable. And  the Govern ment experts should have to sign off  on them before they are approved. Not  automatic approval with the operator  carrying oil until someone in the Gov ernment says maybe not.  This is like the USDA saying to the  American consumer ""all new meat on  the market  is Grade A until  it has  been 'disapproved'; it takes too much  time, money, and effort to inspect it so  let's pretend it's all just fine.""  When  the Alaska oil pipeline was  first built 15 years ago, Exxon dis missed warnings of the dangers of an  oilspill with similar reassuring coos of  good  faith. This kind of  spill  just  couldn't happen they told us, and if it  did, Exxon had just the right contin gency plan to deal with it.  Unfortunately,  when  the  cracked open and dumped 72 million  pounds of crude oil directly into one of  the most biologically diverse and frag ile  ecosystems  in  this  hemisphere,  Exxon had no oilspill specialists on  hand. It had fired every single one of  them  as  a  profit-boosting measure.  And their vaunted emergency contin gency cleanup plan consisted of one  old broken down barge that was in the  dry docks and a bunch of oil execu tives who couldn't find  their behind  with a Cray Supercomputer.  We  should  learn  from history-a  paper plan, without benefit of serious  independent review, without standards  and public  review,  did not protect  Alaska or Alaskans. Maybe  this was  ""government off our backs."" Maybe it   was just a double negative: ""No good  plan? No problem!"" But it did not pro tect America. We cannot allow this to  happen  again. My  amendment will  strengthen  the current provision  in  the bill by substituting the word ""ap prove"" for ""has not been rejected"" requiring an active review of plans by  Federal experts.  Requiring  contingency  plans,  but  not requiring review and approval by  public experts, is baloney. I say: Either  Valdez  ",1989
1690,423,20,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Chairman, I con cede that point. No one has yet con cluded whether the ship would have  sunk or not, and  the Commandant  says that it very well might have. The  people who repaired it said that they  were not ready to conclude that.  The bottom line is that there is some  question about whether double bot toms are the best way  to go or not,  and the bottom line is that the Senate  came to the conclusion, as I hope we  do,  that we ought to mandate them  unless we find out that they are really  not safe or we find a better way to do  it.  D 1520  I want to give Members a little show and-tell that demonstrates that there  are some other means that are being  discussed  that may be of equal or  better  benefit  than  a  double-hull  bottom in protecting the Nation from  the kind of spills we saw in Alaska.  The concept I am going to discuss is  designed by OSG Bulk Ships, which is  the  largest  independent  U.S.-flag  tanker operating in America. It is an  interesting concept, one which  they  are just now promoting along with the  Swedes, who are promoting the nega tive pressure  theory  that may even  work as well or better than this one.  What I want to show first is the way  the 1970 tankers were constructed and  loaded with oil. They were basically  loaded  in different cargo  tanks,  all  with oil from one end to the other.  This  is  the  common way  pre-1970  tankers, with no ballasts or slop tanks,  were loaded. The oil was loaded to the  top of each tank, and every tank was  loaded.  The modern  tanker, and also  the  post-1973  tankers, are  loaded differ ently today. Most of them are loaded  now with four side-water ballast tanks  which appear in blue on the chart, so  that the oil is loaded in the tanks in  yellow. Water is loaded in the ballast  tanks on either side. They are loaded  this way  to provide some protection  against side collisions so  that  these  new tankers are much safer. In fact,  Warren Magnuson, in a recent editori al I read in Washington State before  he died, commented upon the better  condition  by  which  ballast  tanks  loaded, and afford some means of profor oil tection against side damage  spills.  OSG has taken this theory and has  gone a step further and suggested that  we could  improve upon  this  loading  technique if we did one thing further.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore <Mr.  LANCASTER). The time of  the gentle man from Louisiana [Mr. TAUZIN] has  expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. TAUZIN  was allowed to proceed for 3 additional  minutes.)  ",1989
1691,423,20,Mr.  TAUZIN.," What OSG  deter mined was that the amount of oil that  came out of the Exxon Valdez was ex actly equivalent to the amount of oil  that was loaded above the water line,  above the craft depth line of the ship,  and  it was equal  to  the amount be cause of  the hydrostatic balance be tween the oil  in the tanker and the  pressure of the seawater.  As Members know, oil is lighter than  water. Because  the  oil was  loaded  above the water line, that amount of  the oil came out of the tanker when it  was ripped at the bottom.  What OSG is exploring, and I think  with some validity,  is a concept that  would load oil at the water line by in creasing the number of water ballast  tanks along the side of a vessel to keep  it low in the water, and yet loading the  oil in the rest of the tank so that the  oil is loaded only at the waterline or  near it in hydrostatic balance with the  seawater. The effect is that if there is  a rip of the vessel on the bottom, very  little oil would come out of it on the  scientific basis of hydrostatic balance.  Second, the permanent water ballast  tanks on the side,  ionized to protect  against rust, permanent in nature so  that we do not have to keep unloading  that water every  time we  load and  unload oil, would provide  for both  safer  transit  for  side  injuries,  and  would provide  for  safer hull design  construction, because it would prevent  against the kind of rust that occurs  loading water in and out of these ballast tanks.    The bottom line is OSG Bulk Ships  is telling us that there may be a way  to load ships in a way to prevent what  happened with the Exxon Valdez with out the expense of a double bottom  and, in fact, even better than a double  bottom.  We are not sure this will work. We  are not sure double bottoms work. But  what the Coast Guard is requesting,  and that is what this amendment re quests, is that we mandate double bot toms if and only if they really are safe,  and if and only if a better system is  not devised to protect against oilspills.  That  is a  sensible way  to approach  this.  I urge Members to adopt the amend ment of  the gentleman from Michi gan.  His  amendment  is  identical  almost to the Senate amendment. It  says we mandate  double  bottoms  unless we  come  up with  a  better  system, or unless we  find out  that  double bottoms are really unsafe and  will cause us more  injury  from oil spills. That makes sense to me and I  hope it does to my colleagues.  I urge Members to adopt the substi tute amendment offered by the gentle man from Michigan.  ",1989
1692,423,20,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Chair man,  I move  to strike  the requisite  number of words and I rise in support  of the amendment.  First, I would like to compliment my  good chairman,  the gentleman from  Louisiana CMr. TAUZIN]. He made a  very good argument, and I hope Mem bers listened to the argument. I say to  the gentleman from Michigan that his  amendment makes  a  great deal  of  sense if we are looking for the safety  of our shores and the best navigation al equipment and vessels to deliver the  oil to our shores, not only domestically  but foreign, too.  But I do not think this body should  be setting the criteria, because there  are no experts in this field. I believe  other than the gentleman from North  Carolina [Mr. COBLE],  I am the only  maritime person serving in this body  that has some experience in the trans portation of cargo and oil, and I am  one who fought this battle in 1973 for  the building of the transportation line  with double bottoms because at that  time I thought it was the last word. It  is not. There are better systems.  The  system  the  gentleman  from  Louisiana  just explained  is probably  better. The bladder system, Members  ask what the bladder system is,  is a  system being studied today, and this is  what  the  amendment  says.  That  allows a membrane to be put inside of  the tanker within each compartment,  neoprene, fiberglass-backed. If there is  a breaking of the outer hull, it releases  that from the hull inside of the hull,  air vents let the oil go up, and then as  the pressure comes down the bladder  comes back out and seals the hole off.  What is wrong with double bottoms?  I will be very honest. The models I  have seen can pose a  threat. As the  Commandant said,  the possibility of  sinking  very  great.  I do not blame the steel companies  for saying what they are saying. They  want to build more ships. I do too. But  I think we can build them better.  When we put something in writing  that  is permanent,  it  is  the wrong  thing to do in this body until we know  for a fact what should be done correct ly. The amendment of the gentleman  from Michigan is very clear. We have  an ongoing study, and  if it is found  that double bottoms are  in fact  the  only and the best method to prevent a  spill, then we shall adopt that method.  But if there is a better method, a dif ferent ballasting, a different structure,  the Exxon Valdez wa.S  ",1989

(a) GENERAL RuLE.-Subsection (c) of sec tion 4611 of the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 is amended by adding at the end there of the following new paragraph:  ""(3) OIL SPILL RATE NOT TO APPLY TO CER TAIN  CRUDE OIL.-The Oil Spill Liability  Trust Fund financing rate shall not apply  for purposes of the tax imposed by subsec tion (a)(l) on any crude oil if such crude oil  had never been transported in a vessel on  water before receipt at the refinery."".  (b)  EFFECTIVE  DATE.-The  amendment  made by subsection (a) shall take effect on  the commencement date <as defined in sec tion  4611(f)(2)  of  the  Internal Revenue  Code of 1986).  Mr. BARTON of Texas (during the  reading). Mr. Chairman I ask unani mous consent the amendment be con sidered as  read and printed  in  the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore.  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?  There was no objection.  ",1989
1697,436,20,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Chair man, it is my intent to withdraw this  amendment because  if I  insist on it  being considered, it is my understand ing the parliamentarian would sustain  a point of order that it could not be  considered.  So it is for debating purposes only.  It was provided yesterday to all the  appropriate staffs. This is not an end  run.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1989
1698,436,20,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," I thank the  chairman.  Mr. Chairman,  this  amendment's  intent  is very simple. Under current  law  there  is a  tax of 1.3 cents per  barrel on imported and domestic oil to  go into a fund, a cleanup fund. This  tax has never been collected.  Under existing law it would expire in  1991. In budget reconciliation there is  a proposal  to  increase  the  tax  to 3  cents per barrel on domestic oil and  imported oil.  What my amendment would do is it  would restrict the collection of the tax  to  to oil that is transported by tanker or  in barges on our riverways.  We have a large number of small in dependent  producers  who  produce  small amounts of oil per well that are  going to be forced to pay, as the tax is  currently structured, into a fund that  they would  never  get  any  benefit  from.  What my  amendment would  do,  quite simply, it would not in any way  restrict the level of the tax, it would  not restrict for what reason the taxes  could be used. What it would do is to  say that you can only tax that oil that  is either  imported by ocean  tanker,  transported by ocean tanker, or trans ported on our riverways.  Mr. Chairman, this is supported by  the  Independent Petroleum Associa tion of America, it is supported by the  Texas  Independent  Producers  and  Royalty Owners.  I think it is a good idea. If we could  get a vote on it, I think we might could  win.  ",1989

1700,436,20,Mr. BARTON of Texas.,  I yield  the gentleman from Louisiana.  ,1989
1701,436,20,Mr. TAUZIN.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I  do  this only  to  point out that it is a tax amendment  and as such it violates clause 5 of rule  XXL The gentleman is aware of that.  Whatever the soundness of his rea soning, we have a problem with the  amendment for that reason.  ",1989
1702,436,20,Mr. BARTON of Texas.,"  I  under stand. I would like to submit for the  record some extraneous matter to go  into the RECORD.  In that material are three questions  that are asked:  Why should an independent be bur dened with a tax on crude oil produc tion  that  is  onshore  and piped or  trucked directly  to a  refinery, when  the tax is directed to assist the clean up of tanker or barge spills that often  are hundreds of miles away and the in dependent bears absolutely no respon sibility for the incident?  Why should domestic stripper well  production-often less than 5 barrels  per day-be forced to pay the cost of  cleaning up  imported oilspills  from  foreign owned tankers?  Why  should Congress enact addi tional disincentives  to domestic-on shore-production when the Nation is  importing 50 percent of its oil, adding  to the trade deficit?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  extraneous material to which the gen tleman ref erred, he must request per mission to insert that in the RECORD  when we are in the House. That which  the gentleman has read will be in the  RECORD at this point.  ",1989
1703,436,20,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," I thank the  Chairman.  I will finish up here by pointing out  that in several States over 70 percent  87  73  97  94  of the oil  that is produced  in  those  States is from small stripper wells, Illi nois, over 90 percent; Indiana, over 92  percent; Kansas,  percent; Ken tucky, 85 percent; Missouri, 92  per cent; New York, 77 percent; Ohio, 73  percent; Oklahoma, 88 percent; Penn sylvania,  percent; Tennessee,  percent, Virginia,  percent; West  Virginia, 100 percent. Oil producers in  all of  these States are going  to be  paying into the oilspill liability fund  and they will never cause an oilspill  and never get any benefit from  the  money that we are collecting.  So I would hope that in the confer ence on the Ways and Means Commit tee we could act on this amendment at  the appropriate time.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con sent that I be permitted to withdraw  the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore.  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?  There was no objection.  0 1650  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore <Mr.  LANCASTER). Are there further amend ments to title VI?  If not, the Clerk will designate title  VII.

Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that was  passed by the Senate that has. two or  three items related to basically techni cal  conections on  agricultural  pro grams. We have added on the House  side several technical corrections, also  including one that would extend the  disaster legislation that we passed to  include earthquake assistance for Cali fornia.  I might add for my colleagues that  the total of the bill, with one of the  items that we have in there, will allow  us a saving of $420 million.  If there is any cost, it would be less  than 6.  I would  appreciate my  colleagues  supporting the motion, and  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding.  ",1989

1710,449,20,Mr. PANETTA.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.  1793, as amended, and urge its passage  by the House.  This bill, as amended, includes a pro vision which would extend disaster as sistance benefits under  the Disaster  Assistance Act of 1989-Public Law  101-87-to agricultural producers and  related  businesses  affected  by  the  Loma Prieta earthquake.  Section 9 of the bill is identical to a  bill-H.R. 3589-which  I  introduced  late last week with a number of my  California colleagues  to provide  this  needed assistance.  In our efforts  to  provide relief to those who have been  stricken by  the  earthquake,  it has  become  apparent  that  one  group  29-059 0-90-15 (Pt. 20)  which does not qualify  for existing  Federal disaster assistance benefits is  farmers and farm-related businesses.  H.R. 3589 is intended to fill that void.  Mr. Speaker, the Loma Prieta earth quake made a direct hit on Santa Cruz  County in California, one of the rich est fruit and vegetable producing re gions in the world. Clear estimates of  the damage suffered are not yet avail able. However, it is already clear that  the  toll suffered by farmers  in  this  area will be significant, and the costs  of recovery will be substantial.  Section 9 of S. 1793 will help farmers  and  related businesses get back on  their feet. First, it will provide direct  financial assistance to those producers  of program and nonprogram crops-in cluding ornamentals like roses and cut  flowers-who suffered  losses  in pro duction due to the earthquake.  Second, the bill will provide loans to  those in need of funds  to begin the  process of rebuilding their businesses.  The bill would provide an additional  $100 million  in  loan guarantees  for  this purpose.  Mr. Speaker,  I  offer my  sincere  thanks to the chairman of the Com mittee  on Agriculture, Mr.  DE  LA  GARZA, and the ranking member, Mr.  MADIGAN, for their assistance in expe diting the consideration of the earth quake disaster assistance bill and for  incorporating  it  into  the bill before  the House this evening.  I urge my colleagues to support pas sage of S. 1793.  0 1800  ",1989

1713,462,20,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  introduce  legislation  that will  bring  further  relief  for  those who have suffered  from  the  recent natural disasters that have struck Cali fornia and South Carolina.  As we  all  know,  these  disasters  have  caused extensive damage to homes in these  two areas. In my area alone, hundreds of resi dences have either been partially or totally de stroyed by  the Loma Prieta earthquake. The  victims of this devastating earthquake are now  literally picking up  the pieces of what  their  lives once were and are  facing enormous fi nancial liabilities.  My  legislation would allow  individuals  to  make penalty-free withdrawals from  individual  retirement accounts for the repair of damages  to a principal residence caused by a federally  declared disaster. By waiving  the 10-percent  penalty for early withdrawal of individual retire ment accounts, victims of these catastrophic  disasters will be able to use their own  funds  without  incurring additional  liability.  I believe  that this type of exception to the law is entire ly appropriate. The waiver would only apply to  those who wish to repair a primary residence  and would not cover personal damages. This  bill  is designed solely to help rebuild homes  with one's own  resources. This  is not only  better for the Federal Government because it  frees up these resources for those who do not  have these funds, but  it also allows the vic tims of these disasters help themselves. I be lieve that both of these aspects of the bill are  important.  I strongly encourage my colleagues to join  me in supporting additional relief to these vic tims by letting them help themselves.  The text of the bill follows:  H.R. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION  1. EXEMPTION FROM EARLY DISTRIBU TION  PENAL TY  FOR WITHDRAWALS  FROM  INDIVIDUAL  RETIREMENT  PLANS FOR REPAIR OF RESIDENCES  DAMAGED BY FEDERALLY DECLARED  DISASTERS.  (a) IN GENERAL.-Paragraph (2) of section  72<0. of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  <relating to exceptions to 10-percent addi tional tax on early distributions) is amended  by adding at the end the following subpara graph:  ""(E) DISASTER REPAIR EXPENSES.-Any dis tribution out of an  individual  retirement  plan to pay expenses incurred by the dis tributee for the repair, rehabilitation. recon struction, or replacement of a principal resi dence damaged or destroyed by reason of a  federally declared disaster occurring after  September 1, 1989. For purposes of this sub paragraph, the term 'federally declared dis aster' means any disaster referred to in sec tion 165(i)<l ).""  (b)  EFFECTIVE  DATE.-The  amendment  made by this section shall apply to amounts  distributed  out  of  individual  retirement  plans after the date of the enactment of  this Act, in taxable years ending after such  date.  AN INVESTMENT IN THE  NATION'S FUTURE  ",1989
1714,462,20,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Illinois [Mr. ANNUNZIO] is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1989
1715,462,20,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, many years  ago, U.S. banks were,  in many places across  the country, the initial force in encouraging the  Nation's  school  children  to  save money.  Banks would set up small,  temporary offices  in grammer and junior high schools where the  children, each week, could bring their dimes,  nickels and pennies to be deposited  in  their  own savings account. They would have their  own bank book. Some children saved part of  their allowance; others their lunch money. In  the early grades, teachers would do  the pa perwork;  later, they would supervise the chil dren who did the work.  Mr. Speaker, these programs were a won derful and simple way for the children, espe cially those living in the inner city, to be able  to learn a phenomena they had never heard  of or seen. One must  remember  that  there  was no  television  in  those days.  If  it didn't  happen in a child's neighborhood or in school,  the pupil would be unlikely to experience such  an event.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another most likely the costs involved-such programs  went the way of the 5-cent trolley car ride, the  10-cent bottle of soda pop and  the 15-cent .  movie.  Recently, I read two newspaper stories that  reminded me of those earlier days.  First, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,  speaking  to some 600 bankers  in Towson,  MD, a Baltimore suburb, asked them for their  help  in getting Am~ricans to save more of  their money. He said the annual savings rate  has  been  declining  every  year  since  the  1970's thus  raising questions about  the Na tion;s ability to invest and grow.  Because Asians and Europeans save more  of their earnings, Brady said,  interest rates in  those countries are  lower and  foreign busi nesses find it cheaper to borrow for their ex pansions.  He  said  American  businesses  cannot pay more  than  their competition  for  capital, which is a basic input, and come out  ahead in the global marketplace.  Mr. Speaker, the second story was about a  program sponsored by Riggs National Bank of  Washington to teach 10-and 11-year-old stu dents at an  inner city school about banking.  The Washington Times reported that through  a partnership Riggs  has  formed with  the  Walker-Jones Elementary School, a special  ""bank""  has  been  set  up  on  the  school  grounds that will enable fifth and sixth grade  school students to open a regular savings ac count for 1 O cents. Students can earn 5 per cent  interest on any money deposited until  May 31.  Students, under the guidance of Riggs vol unteers, also will  learn  the  fundamentals of  running a bank by serving in such positions as  teller, accountant, president and chairman of  the board. Riggs will also train parents, many  of whom do not have bank accounts or basic  take  consumer  skills.  In addition,  they will  Walker-Jones students on field trips.  Mr. Speaker,  there  is an expression we  often hear: What goes around, comes around.  The Riggs program  is not new. Such bank  sponsorships were being held 50 years ago, if  not  longer. They were successful  then and  could be successful again. The Nation's econ omy will become strong and able  to grow  when citizens learn the discipline of saving as  young students and continue the regimen as  grown-ups.  The Riggs program, as one official said,  an investment in the future.  is  ABORTION AND ITS IMPACT ON  THE CURRENT AMERICAN PO LITICAL PROCESS  ",1989

1717,462,20,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, the tradition as we all know  in this House for a special order, par ticularly if it goes beyond 5 minutes, is  to take the well of the House and use  one of the lecturns down there. I have  so much material that I want to refer  to, I would like to opt for the privilege  to take that special order here from  the leadership desk.  Mr. Speaker, I hesitate using an oxy moron here, but it is the only way I  can  express  the  feelings  by  some  people in this House in trying to ana lyze  the  issue  of  abortion  and  its  impact on the current American politi cal process. But the oxymoron  is, a  mild panic seems to have set in. It in volves my side of the aisle, maybe a  few Members on the other side, who  prior to this fall or summer had been  proud to describe  themselves as pro life  candidates,  anti-abortion  candi dates. Now they seem to have hit a  panic button, and  there  is nothing  quite so shaky as a politician who feels  the ground beginning to move under  his feet.  When John F. Kennedy, our young est elected President, wrote his book  before he  came  to  the Presidency  called  Profiles  in  Courage, which  helped him get there and for which he  won  a Pulitzer Prize,  the  title was  simply to describe elected officials, not  just in the United States, that would  take a stand that was unpopular with  the constituency that elected them.  D 1820  Mr. Speaker, the example that sticks  in my mind is the distinguished gentle man  from  the other body, Senator  Robert Taft of Ohio, who  took  the  highly unpopular position after  the  Second World War that he thought  war crimes trials of Nazi killers was  wrong on its face because the law set ting up the trials were passed after the  crimes were committed.

1722,540,20,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  in  the past year we have witnessed monu mental  changes  in Eastern Europe,  events many did not believe possible.  Solidarity, only recently banned, was  voted  to  lead Poland toward greater  political  and  economic  freedom.  In  Hungary,  Communists  distanced  themselves  from  communism  in  an  effort to compete with the democratic  opposition in the upcoming elections.  Even  in Bulgaria,  the most  liberal  member of  the Politburo has  taken  charge, pledging to turn Bulgaria into  a modern  democratic  and  law-gov erned state.  But the enormity of the transf orma tion underway has never been more  clearly demonstrated than by the figu rative, and now the literal, destruction  of the Berlin Wall.  That wall, a symbol of division be tween East and West, has been dis solved by  the East German people's  for  freedom,  desire  for change,  for  control of their future.  The images flashed across the West  are almost unbelievable-young East  Berliners dancing atop the once for bidden wall; traffic immovable as hun dreds  of  thousands  flood  into  the  Western city to visit friends and rela tives; mayors of East and West Berlin  shaking hands in the midst of a jubi lant crowd.  These  images represent the fulfill ment of our deepest wishes, change we  have  demanded  for  over  25  years.  They are changes welcomed by people  throughout the world.  When President Gorbachev assures  us of his  support  for  the changes  taking place in East Germany, he ex presses his satisfaction and pride in an  event he has helped create.  When Americans voice their enthusi asm  about  the  dissolution  of  the  Berlin Wall, we  are  not,  as  some  appear to fear, gloating. We are rather  sharing in the same satisfaction felt  by others around the world.  We, Soviets and Americans together,  are celebrating East Germany's ex pression of freedom and steps toward  democracy.  That our two nations can praise this  event at the same time is itself cause  for celebration.  To acknowledge the tremendous sig nificance of the symbolic destruction  of the Berlin Wall and to give voice to  the exhilaration felt by all Americans,  I urge President Bush  to  travel  to  West Berlin.  It has been 40 years since the West  demonstrated its commitment to the  city's freedom by helping break  the  blockade strangling Berlin. It would be  fitting for the American President to  travel there to underscore the Ameri can commitment  to  the  freedom of  Berlin and our support for democratic  reform in East Germany.  In Berlin President Bush should ac knowledge personally the tremendous  significance of the past week's events  and the joy that all Americans feel at  the prospects of greater freedom and  democracy for the people of East Ger many.  I also urge  the President to begin  planning immediately with our Euro pean allies to hold a meeting in which  we can have a detailed and thorough  discussion about the proper Western  response  to changes within Eastern  Europe.

1723,553,20,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to cosponsor this with the mi nority leader. This does make it a bi partisan effort, and it has been a bi partisan effort all along. It takes the  idea of the enterprise funds, which is  incorporated in my original bill at the  suggestion of  the President, and we  have expanded on that. It reduces the  total authorized appropriations by $51  million, and frankly it does so in the  out years because there is pretty much  agreement on what we are going to be  doing in the first year.  I thank Senator DOLE. I thank Sena tor HELMS. The majority leader, Sena tor MITCHELL, has been very helpful.  Senator PELL, chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee, has been very  helpful; my colleagues on the Foreign  Relations Committee,  including  the  Presiding Officer, Senator ROBB, who  has been a cosponsor of this legisla tion from the start and made a  trip  over there.  There are a great many people who  have helped to produce this result. It  is a genuinely bipartisan bill. We have  a few hurdles yet, a few controversial  provisions, but I think we are clearly  moving  in  the direction of passing  something  tomorrow  of which  this  Nation can be proud.  ",1989

1736,566,20,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, last  Thursday,  the  Republican  leader  placed a list of pending nominations in  the RECORD.  While I was on the floor during the  Republican leader's statement, a letter  was delivered  to my office from the  President's Chief  of  Staff,  John  Sununu. This  letter states that  the  President would like all of his nomina tions  confirmed  by  the  time  the  Senate adjourns the 1st session of the  lOlst Congress. The letter goes on to  indicate  that  the  President would  retain  the right to make  recess ap pointments.  During the previous administration,  the Senate and the President reached  an accommodation in this regard. The  President refrained  from making  in trasession  recess  appointments.  In  those rare instances when it was nec essary to make a recess appointment,  either intra.session or during sine die  recesses,  the President notified  the  majority leader in advance of the an nouncement of  the  appointment.  I  have asked the President to continue  this practice, and I hope that he will  do so.  The right of the President to make  recess appointments during the period  of a  sine die adjournment is not in  question. However,  I do believe that  this should be a  rare occurrence  in  truly emergency situations.  The President and the Senate have  constitutional roles in the nomination  and confirmation process. There is no  time limit on how long the President  takes to decide whether to submit a  nomination, and there is no time limit  on how long the Senate takes to con firm  a nominee. Each sets  its own  standard in these matters. That is as it  should be under our Constitution.  The Senate has made good progress  in confirming the President's nomina tions  throughout  this  year.  The  Senate has confirmed 343 of the Presi dent's nominations  to date. Of  this  number,  132  have  been  confirmed  since September 6. Twelve nomina tions are on the Executive Calendar.  One hundred and five nominations  are pending before Senate committees.  According to the Senate's records, 88,  or  the  overwhelming majority,  of  these nominations have been received  since September 6; 41 have been pend ing since October 12, just a month ago.  The delay in submitting these nomi nations to the Senate is not the fault  of  the Senate. It  is  the administra tion's responsibility.  Senate committees are planning to  process  as many of  the  remaining  nominations as possible prior to the  ",1989

1752,657,20,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding. I want to  say I support this bill and hope it is  successful. Its aims and objectives are  very worthwhile.  I do want to say if the sanction lan guage  in  it  is not strong enough,  I  stand prepared  to  come back at a  future date and improve the sanction  language in it.  Mr. Speaker, I take this time to say  that many  times  the Committee on  Ways and Means is faced with impos ing trade sanctions on legislation. I do  not  like  to do  this, but I  realize  in  many cases it is the only reasonable  sanction we can get, short of war.  In using sanctions, Mr. Speaker,  I  like to use them sparingly. But when I  do use them, I like to use them very  effectively.  If a Member's bill contains sanction  language and is subject to the jurisdic tion of the Ways and Means Commit tee, I hope he will send it over to us  early and let us see how we can im prove it. If we agree with it, we will  give you a good bill on sanctions, one  that will do that job.  As the gentleman from Florida [Mr.  FASCELL] has said, unilateral sanctions  in this matter are not very productive.  They usually  end up harming  the  United States more than they help the  cause.  I would appreciate in the future all  Members who have sanction-type bills,  let us have a  look at them. We are  going to apply sanctions sparingly, but  when we do apply them, we are going  to apply them with the force  to get  the job done.  ",1989
1753,657,20,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the gentleman from Florida  [Mr. GIBBONS].  I agree with the re marks of  the gentleman, and  I can  assure him as far as our committee is  concerned, we want  to cooperate  in  every way.  If we  take  this step on  sanctions, the sanctions ought to be  effective.  Mr. Speaker,  let me add my com ment of appreciation to  the ranking  minority member of the full commit tee,  the  gentleman  from Michigan  [Mr. BROOMFIELD], and the majority  and minority staff on both sides. We  have worked for months on this bill,  almost a  year, and  it  represents a  great deal of hard work. To the credit  of  this Administration,  they  have  turned around their policy and agreed  to work with the Congress on a matter  of this importance. I am very grateful  for  that, because  it would not have  been possible in my judgment to have  agreed in a bipartisan fashion with a  bill as strong as this one.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased we  are able to bring this bill out with the  cooperation of  the gentleman  from  Michigan [Mr. BROOMFIELD].  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1989
1754,657,20,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to  join my good friend, Chairman FAs CELL,  in support of H.R. 3033,  the  Chemical  and  Biological Warfare  Elimination Act. The proliferation of  chemical  and  biological  weapons  worldwide is among the most disturb ing  and  dangerous  developments  I  have witnessed in recent years.  These weapons of mass destruction  are becoming increasingly available to  terrorist nations around the world. It  is  imperative that the United States  have an effective, coordinated policy  designed to stop this disturbing devel opment.  This  problem  is  truly  global  in  nature. In the long run it can only be  solved  if all nations work  together  multilaterally in a genuinely coopera tive manner. A unilateral approach  cannot by itself solve this dangerous  problem.  But if we are to create a truly work able global policy,  then each nation  must first develop a national policy of  its own. This policy must be based  upon a clear, consistent message that  a country is firmly united in its opposi tion to the proliferation of chemical  and biological weapons.  I believe that H.R. 3033 sends that  kind of clear message. H.R. 3033 dem onstrates that our country has a tough  and effective policy  to  combat  the  global proliferation of chemical and  biological weapons.  Through a great deal of hard work  which spanned well over a year, the  Committee  on Foreign Affairs  has  been  able  to  fashion  an  effective  chemical and biological weapons bill.  Yet, at the same time, H.R. 3033 pre serves the President's duties and re sponsibilities  in  the area of  foreign  policy.  As a result, I am very pleased that  the Administration has  indicated  to  me its support for H.R. 3033. I know  from my own personal meetings with  President Bush  that he  feels  very  strongly that chemical weapons must  be banned from  the globe.  I believe  this  legislation  is  a  positive  step  toward that goal.  Let me conclude by  thanking my  friend, the chairman, for his efforts on  this legislation. I do feel that we have  forged a strong consensus on a very  important policy  issue,  a  consensus  that  spans Republicans  and Demo crats as well as the executive and legis lative branches. This  is  in no small  way a result of his leadership and bi partisan spirit on this bill.  I would urge my colleagues to join  the President in supporting this bill.  0 1240  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  Minnesota [Mr. FRENZEL], the ranking  member on the Committee on Ways  and Means.  ",1989
1755,657,20,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to repeat statements made by every  speaker  in favor of  this bill so  far.  Those statements relate to the ineff ec tiveness of trade sanctions that are ap plied unilaterally.  I would invite the attention of the  membership of this House to the ma terial  in the second and third para graphs on page 6 of  the committee  report, which in a  little longer form  restates the proposition made earlier  by the gentleman from Florida [Mr.  GIBBONS].  I will, however,  read  the last sen tence. It says, ""If, in the course of con sultations seeking such sanctions, the  President determines that the major  producer countries are unwilling  to  impose substantially similar sanctions  within a  reasonable period of  time,  then he should give serious consider ation  to  terminating  the unilateral  U.S. sanctions.""  Fortunately, under this bill, which is  one of the reasons the President sup ports it and I do too, is that the Presi dent does have a waiver and he is able  under certain circumstances to avoid  the mandatory nature of the declara tion of the sanction. What happens,  Mr. Speaker, is that we get concerned  about human rights violations,  inva sions of sovereign territory, weapons  creation or even the rights of consum ers in the United States. All of them  are worthy  policy  goals. But  even  though the actions in other countries  vex us sorely, we cannot think of any  way to make them change their policy,  ",1989

1757,670,20,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield himself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, every Member that has  spoken has tal}ced sincerely about the  need that we have to really go beyond  where we are in terms of the fight  against drugs. There have been a lot  of people over the years in this fight,  at every level of government, Federal,  State,  local, municipal, down  to  the  smallest individual at the very lowest  level  of  enforcement,  through  the  might of the Federal Government, the  Coast Guard, the Air Force, the mili tary, yet people want to know why we  unfortunately  are not winning  the  fight?  Each  time we  pass one of  these  pieces to the puzzle, we think we are  going to make a giant step forward.  We seem not to be able to do  that.  That is a chronic problem that stems  from  the fact that we got into  this  fight very late.  There are still many, many things  which need to be done. One of the  major problems,  one of  the major  needs, is that we must come to grips  with a real foreign policy, that tries to  help the country where most of these  drugs are grown.  Mr. Speaker,  they have problems.  You have heard what is happening in  Columbia. You read about it in the  newspapers. We know about Peru and  Bolivia, the problems they have had,  the growth of  the coca bush,  the  growth of the traffickers' capabilities,  the growth of their money resources,  the growth of their capability in terms  of arms and security to protect them selves, the growth of money launder ing, and the growth of corruption.  Mr. Speaker, this has infected those  countries.  It has  infected Mexico,  where now more than 40 percent of all  the drugs that go into this country ac tually come through.  They  have  been  very  smart  at  moving around. It used to be Miami  was the main entry point. Now it is  coming through California, because we  got better in Florida about finding it.  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that  no matter what we do, unless we are  willing to stay with it, unless we are  willing to help those countries come to  grips, not only with their law enforce ment problems, but then with  their  economic problems, we are not going  to be able to get a major handle on  this.  As  [Mr. RANGEL]  the gentleman from New York  indicated, we are not  going  to win  this  fight  either by  knuckling under and making it legal.  We will just have more addicts. Yes, it  might be a little cheaper to buy, but  the corollary is more people will ulti mately buy it.  Mr. Speaker, we need to find better  answers. We are also looking to the ad ministration for answers. We are pro viding our piece of the puzzle. We are  providing the answers that Members  of Congress feel are important in the  area of foreign affairs, but we need to  do more.  I am sorry  that Mr. Bennett has  chosen over the last few weeks to start  criticizing again, but he feels somehow  hindered or hampered and does not  feel that other people share the com mitment that he has.  D 1330  Well,  I want  to  tell Mr. Bennett  from this floor that there are an awful  lot of people  in  this Congress who  were there before he became the head  of the drug policy in this country, who  had that commitment and that we are  still here and we are still intending to  do the right thing when it comes to  trying  to stamp out  the scourge of  drugs,  because  go  home  every  weekend. Out of the almost 700,000  constituents I have most of them will  tell you the No. 1 issue on their mind  is drugs and the crime in the commu nity that flows from that drug prob lem.  I have said it before and I will say it  again they are more concerned about a  crack attack in their neighborhood to morrow  than  they  are  a  nuclear  attack. And when we come up with all  the parts of the puzzle working  to gether, and that is what we created  that drug czar for, hopefully we will  be able to see the light at the end of  the tunnel.  In the meantime while the Commit tee on Foreign Affairs, and the task  force which I chair have provided this  piece of the puzzle, I believe it is going  to be a very  important piece.  It  is  something that we created, and frank ly has been to a large degree adopted  by Mr.  :Sennett's plan after we put  most of  this  in  the foreign aid bill  about 6 months ago. So we know it is  capable of being worked, we know that  people agree that it is good, solid, im portant legislation in the fight and we  \f e  urge our colleagues ultimately to vote  for it and to stand fast in this fight.  It is not going to be over that quick  and it will not be painless, but we will  win if we stick to it.  ",1989
1758,670,20,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, as a cochair man of the international narcotics control task  force,  I want to commend Chairman F ASCELL  and Representative LARRY SMITH, chairman of  the task force, for their leadership in bringing  this bill to fruition. I would reiterate that much  of the bill consists of the provisions we ap proved in the foreign aid bill. I would  like to  take a minute to highlight a few parts and to  add my observations on where we stand  in  the drug fight.  First,  the bill  responds  to Secretary Ben nett's  request.  It provides authorizing  lan guage  for  the $125 million Andean  initiative  along with  the  requested waivers.  I would  point out  that  the waiver on aid  to police  forces applies only to the three Andean coun tries, only for those units that are organized  for the specific purpose of narcotics enforce ment, and only for the next fiscal year.  Second, the bill contains human rights lan guage and other reporting  requirements  that  will ensure that Congress is notified about the  type and value of assistance provided; which  units will receive assistance; and an explana tion of how  this aid meets our antinarcotics  objectives.  While I support this bill, I must say that I am  disappointed by the absence of economic as sistance and  the failure of the administration  to come up and fight for more economic aid.  The administration's rationale is that first we  must assist these countries  in  reestablishing  control  of  those  areas  dominated  by  the  cartel-then we can provide economic assist ance.  But our efforts on the enforcement side will  be seriously hampered unless  these nations  see that the United States is able to provide  tangible economic assistance  to  their coun tries. Our experience tells us that cooca farm ers will continue growing coca, even  in  the  face  of  increased  enforcement actions,  if  there are no realistic alternatives to the drug  trade. We have received assurances from the  administration that a more detailed plan, out lining a multiyear, $2 billion effort will be sub mitted  in February and  I  look  forward  to  seeing that plan.  The  task  force and committee have been  the vanguard  in  the House  in giving the ad ministration the tools it needs to fight the drug  war. This committee has been  there  in  the  past and it is this committee that will be sup porting that effort in the future. Our first step  is passing H.R. 3611.  ",1989
1759,670,20,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  many of my colleagues came to the floor of  the House  to chastise the Congress for not  moving  fast enough on  the President's drug  war strategy. Many of them praised  the ad ministration for its efforts.  I would suggest that such praise is prema ture, if not  inappropriate. The Bush antidrug  plan with its very modest goals required a lot  of work when  it reached us. That  is the pri mary reason for its delay.  However, four measures now have worked  their way through the process and are before  ",1989
1760,683,20,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker and Members, I am one  of  those Members of Congress who  has spent much of his congressional  career trying to prevent further Feder-.  al directives on  the State and  local  governments' agencies, including local  education agencies or schools. But I  think today we have something called  a war on drugs, and, if we are serious  about a war on drugs, it is going to be  a Federal, State and local partnership.  The reality is, Mr. Speaker, that 39  percent of high school students have  used  illicit drugs over the last year.  That is some 5.3 million high school  students who have been using drugs of  some type. Thirty-five percent of our  high  school  students have  reported  that they have had five or more drinks  in a row during the past 2 weeks, ac cording to a recent survey.  Mr. Speaker, those statistics tell the  story of why, if we are going to win  the war on drugs, we need a war on  drugs, and that means that we change  the rules of the ball game.  I think we are all aware that in the  past we have passed legislation which  would require that as a condition of  receiving Federal study financial as sistance our colleges and universities  are going to have some kind of drug  abuse prevention program  in effect.  The legislation in front of us today,  H.R. 3614, goes beyond that. This leg islation would require that any school  which received any Federal funds, as a  condition of receiving those funds,  is  going to have to put in place a drug  and alcohol abuse prevention plan.  Mr. Speaker, as a condition and a  part of that plan we state five specific  standards: No. 1, that there be an edu cational component; No. 2, that there  be standards of conduct that prohibit  the unlawful possession of drugs and  alcohol; No. 3, that that school include  a  specific statement about sanctions  for  the  improper and  illegal use of  ",1989

1764,709,20,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself as much time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker,  today  I bring before  the House  the bill, H.R. 3046,  the  Copyright Royalty Tribunal and Mis cellaneous Pay Act of 1989.  At the outset, I would like to thank  the members of my subcommittee the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellec tual Property, and the Administration  of Justice-for helping to develop this  legislation. I would underline the ef forts of the ranking minority member  of the subcommittee,  the gentleman  from California CMr. MOORHEAD] and  the ranking minority member of the  full Committee,  the gentleman from  New York [Mr. FISH].  H.R. 3046, as amended, is a house keeping bill which,  in the  long run,  will  improve the functioning of four  important Government entities: Three  with  important  intellectual property  responsibilities and one in the criminal  justice arena. The proposed  legisla tion, the outgrowth of hearings held  by my subcommittee earlier this year,  seeks to assure that high level officials  at  the Copyright Royalty Tribunal,  the Copyright Office, the U.S. Parole  Commission, and the U.S. Patent and  Tradell)ark Office receive salaries con sistent with their counterparts in Gov ernment. H.R. 3046 also provides sev eral structural reforms for the Copy right Royalty Tribunal.  First. The Copyright Royalty Tribu nal: The Copyright Royalty Tribunal,  located  in  the  legislative branch of  Government, was created by the Copy right Revision Act of 1976. The pri mary functions of  the Tribunal are  first, the distribution of funds collect ed for cable and satellite transmitted  television signals and  for  jukeboxes  and second, the setting of rates for the  cable  and  jukebox  compulsory  li censes.  H.R. 3046  reduces  the number of  Commissioners on the Tribunal-from  five  to  three-provides  for  lapsed  terms so  that a Commissioner may  serve beyond the expiration of his or  her term, until a new Commissioner is  confirmed;  and  changes  the  salary  classification rates for members of the  Tribunal-from GS-18 of the General  Schedule to Executive Level V. In this  latter  regard, Executive Level V  is  equal to the entry level for Presiden tial  appointees  in  the  executive  branch.  When the Tribunal was created in  1976, GS-18 was the highest level for  Civil Service employees. Subsequently,  in 1978 Congress  revised  the super grade system, supplementing it with  the Senior Executive Service CSESl.  Since then almost all GS-18 positions  have been converted to SES. The GS18 position, which once numbered in  the thousands now number less than  80, mostly non-supervisory personnel  in the executive branch. Although the  pay levels for GS-18  is the same as  that of Executive Level V,  the Presi dent's Quadrennial Pay Commission  recommended revisions in the Execu tive Level salary schedule and not the  General Schedule. H.R. 3046 does not  therefore result in a pay increase for  the Commissioners of  the Tribunal  but it does pave the way if a pay raise  occurs for high-ranking individuals in  the congressional, executive and judi cial branches.  Second, the U.S. Copyright Office:  The U.S. Copyright Office, located in  the Library of Congress, is responsible  for administering  the copyright  law  and the semiconductor chip protection  law pursuant to title 17 of the United  States Code. The Copyright Office is  directed by the Register of Copyrights  and  several Associate Registers  of  Copyrights. The Office, being a part  of the Library, is located in the legisla tive branch and  is an excellent  re source for Members of Congress.  H.R. 3046 provides that the Register  is to be compensated at the rate of pay  in effect for Level IV of the Executive  Schedule,  treating the Register simi larly with the Commissioner of Pat ents and Trademarks. The bill also  provides  that the Librarian of Con gress shall appoint Associate Registers  of Copyrights in accordance with the  recommendations of  the Register of  Copyrights in accordance with the rec ommendations  of  the Register  of  Copyrights  to assist  in the perform ance of the Register's duties. The As sociate Registers shall be paid at a  rate  not  to  exceed  the maximum  annual rate of pay payable to GS-18  of the General Schedule. If the Li brary is reorganized at any time in the  future, the subcommittee will be con sulted and will,  in  turn, participate  constructively in the reorganization. A  reorganization might,  for  example,  convert General  Schedule  position  into SES positions, creating a situation  where  further  amendments  to  the  Copyright Office charter are neces sary.  Third,  the United  States Parole  Commission: The United States Parole  Commission is an independent agency  within the U.S. Department of Justice.  It currently is comprised of nine mem bers  appointed  by  the  President.  Among the Commissioners, the Presi dent designates one to serve as Chair.  Although the Parole Commission is  slated  for abolition  in 1992,  it still  serves a very important function for  inmates sentenced before 1987. There fore, H.R. 3046 transfers the Commis sioner positions from GS-18 to Execu tive Level V; it also makes the Chair of  the Parole Commission an Executive  Level IV.  The need to amend the Parole Com mission charter was originally brought  to my attention by  the gentleman  from Maryland CMr. HOYER], who de serves credit for this provision.  4.  U.S.  Patent  and  Trademark  Office: Finally, the Patent and Trade mark Office, within the U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, administers laws  relating to patents and trademarks to  promote the progress of science and  technology, to strengthen the national  economy, and to benefit the public in terest. H.R. 3046 upgrades three high ranking Presidential appointees-the  Deputy Commissioner,  the Assistant  Commissioner of Patents, and the As sistant Commissioner of Trademarks from the General Schedule to Execu tive Level V. Again, the rationale for  this change  is  the same as  for  the  Copyright  Royalty  Tribunal,  U.S.  Copyright Office and the Parole Com mission.  H.R. 3046 will not require additional  budgetary outlays. I am aware of no  opposition to the measure.  Given the current emphasis of this  country in a more effective criminal  justice system as well as improved in tellectual property laws, it makes emi nent good  sense  to  treat high-level  Government  employees-especially  those appointed by the President of  the United States-with  the  respect  that they deserve. As recently noted  by Paul Volcker,  in his capacity as  chairman of the National Commission  on  the Public Service:  the Federal  Government        is  increasingly  unable to attract, retain, and motivate  the kinds of people it will need to do  the essential work of the republic in  the years and decades ahead. H.R.  3046 is a short step in the right direc tion of solving this quiet crisis in Gov ernment. I am just thankful that the  four Government entities affected by  this legislation have, over the years,  been ably led by individuals devoted to  public service and have fulfilled their  legislative charters in a time of budg etary stress. The bill is in part a trib ute to their leadership, in part a mes sage to keep up the good work. The  Congress and this country need your  services.  I urge your support of this impor tant piece of legislation.  ",1989

1768,722,20,Mr.  ECKART.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  crisis for which we are here today on  the floor involving its demonstration  in our communities  in  the form of  drug abuse and substance abuse obvi ously needs the full attention of this  Nation and the Congress. There are a  few people for whom they do not have  any choice as to whether or not to ad dress it however. Among those are pre hospital emergency medical personnel  who find themselves, like many in the  counseling community and the medi cal community, on the front  line of  this war. Provisions in this legislation,  which  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  CMr. MADIGAN]  and  the  gentleman  from California CMr. WAXMAN] have so  graciously consented to include, pro vide for an appropriate training regi men for prehospital emergency medi cal professionals to obtain the kind of  training and curriculum that will help  them to come to grips with this power ful new force in our community. We  have discovered in several new major  communities across this Nation a new  phenomenon,  and  that  is  physical  abuse of emergency medical personnel  when they come to try to assist an in dividual who  is  involved in drugs or  substance  abuse. The provisions of  this legislation go a long way toward  helping  these  front-line  emergency  medical professionals deal with  this  new crisis in a meaningful and respon sible new way, and I am grateful for  this assistance to these individuals.  ",1989
1769,722,20,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  support of  the Emergency Drug Abuse  Treatment Expansion Act of 1989, particularly  its provision for model projects for reducing in cidence of alcohol and drug abuse among  pregnant and postpartum women and their in fants.  This  legislation responds  to  the desperate  lack of available drug  treatment  to all who  seek  it.  In particular,  the bill expands  treat ment opportunities for pregnant and postpartum women,  for whom the shortage of treat ment programs  is  exceptionally  severe.  In  fact,  the majority of pregnant women who  seek drug  treatment cannot obtain  it-either  because of long waiting  lists or hesitation by  the provider to treat pregnant women.  Beyond  increasing  treatment opportunities,  the bill attempts to remove the external bar riers which deny pregnant and  postpartum  women and their children services. To do so,  the legislation promotes a case management  system  in which  the providers help women  and their children  fight their way through  the  complicated  process of obtaining  services.  Not only must the providers offer drug treat ment, and medical and social services, but  they must  also  help  coordinate  services  beyond the program by determining the moth er's eligibility for other Federal, State, or local  services. Specifically, the bill requires that pro viders offer child care facilities, transportation,  prenatal, and postpartum health care, pediat ric care  for  the  infants  throughout  the  first  year, and parenting education,  to be eligible  for the grant.  Behind  today's legislation are endless sto ries of pregnant women who struggled to re ceive drug treatment but in the end could not.  Each was ultimately thwarted by any of the  mentioned barriers.  I am  reminded of the story of a pregnant  addict  in California who had  to  travel 130  miles every day to a drug treatment program,  which had no child care or even prenatal care.  Although she was on welfare, she was forced  to pay $200 a month  for  the care. Under standably,  it grew more difficult to find  rides  every day, a babysitter for her other child, and  the money for payments-so her visits grew  erratic. Eventually,  the treatment program re leased her, and there was no other program  to take her. She returned to using drugs, and  the baby was born drug exposed, although  healthy.  The  district  attorney  criminally  charged her for drug use.  This  story  flies  in  the  face of common  sense, common decency, and common  fair ness. Despite  the recent  trend  to prosecute  mothers for substance use during pregnancy,  the real criminal is clearly a Nation that fails to  provide  these women  treatment-particularly  when they seek it.  The Nation  is extremely concerned about  the distressing increase in the number of chil dren born exposed  to drugs, as  this bill  re flects. Earlier this year, the Select Committee  on Children, Youth and Families, which I chair,  released a survey which  found hospitals re porting three to four times the number of drug  exposed births as  in 1985, even with under counting. Similarly, a recent National Associa tion  of Perinatal Research  and Education  [NAPARE] study estimated  that as many as  375,000 drug-exposed infants will be born  in  1989 alone.  Largely  responsible  for  this  increase  is  crack-cocaine-a drug so potent that one in  six who are exposed  to it become addicted.  Since 1980 crack has in general become the  drug of choice, with 55 to 90 percent of preg nant substance abusers  reporting or  testing  positive  for cocaine use, according  to  the  Select Committee survey. In New York City,  1988 data shows  that cocaine use among  pregnant women is 20 times higher today than  in 1980. This is crack at work.  The key to preventing drug-exposed births,  as this bill suggests, is to attack the demand  for this drug by providing treatment. However,  our survey and hearing  found a desperate  lack  of  available  treatment  for  pregnant  women. Two-thirds of the hospitals surveyed  reported that they had no place to send their  pregnant  substance abusers  for  treatment.  Likewise, a study of  treatment programs  in  New York found that 54 percent refused treat ment to pregnant addicts, 67 percent would  not treat pregnant addicts on Medicaid, and  87 percent denied treatment to pregnant ad dicts on Medicaid addicted to crack.  The Nation should be giving addicted moth ers drug  treatment not arrest warrants. Ac cording to experts in the field, fear of prosecu tion and of losing their babies to the State in hibits  pregnant women  from  seeking  drug  treatment and, worse yet, prenatal care.  It is  the hope of this legislation that pregnant sub stance abusers will feel not only encouraged  to seek treatment, but safe to do so.  The  burden  to  provide  care  for  these  women does not rest solely on  the Govern ment. Community by community,  the entire  Nation must unite  in  the war against drugs  and in caring for this population in need. The  legislation  today,  through  requiring programs  to match Federal dollars, attempts to foster a  sense of community responsibility for its citi zens, which in the long run is how this war on  drugs will be won.  I am pleased  that Congress  is acting  to  remedy the costly problem of lack of available  drug  treatment  for pregnant and postpartum  women and  their children. The goal  is  treat ment on demand, and its attainment is imper ative. Our veritable future depends on it.  ADM BLOCK GRANT: MENTAL HEALTH PIECE  While I am pleased by the increased atten tion  to and support of programs  to prevent  and  treat substance abuse,  I must express  concern about continued underfunding of the  mental health portion of the block grant. By  authorizing  $252,000,000  for  fiscal  year  1990-the same as last year-this bill contin ues an unacceptably low authorization level.  As the Select Committee has documented,  as many as 9.5 million youth alone suffer from  serious emotional problems; yet  the majority  (80 percent) receive either inappropriate treat ment or none at all. Given  recent upward  trends in child abuse, homelessness. and drug  abuse-coupled with cuts  in basic programs  for'  children  and  families  over  the  past  decade-there is little indication the need for  mental health treatment (or prevention) efforts  will decrease. Rather, our Nation faces a gen eration of youth at tremendous risk of devel opmental and psychological problems, which  in turn threatens the very fabric of our society.  As an original sponsor of a 1 O percent set aside for children's mental health services ap proved by Congress last year, I do not want to  see  the block grant  further diminished.  In stead,  I encourage my colleagues to join me  in seeking opportunities to increase the avail ability  of community-based  prevention  and  treatment services for those who suffer or are  at risk for emotional problems.

1773,735,20,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday I  chaired an  important conference on alterna tive fuels and  the environment at Arkansas  State University in Jonesboro, AR.  This  important meeting  focused  on  how  farmers in Arkansas and across America can  play a role in the coming transition to alterna tive motor fuels, which will clean America's air  and reduce the Nation's dependence on for eign oil.  It brought agricultural and business leaders  from Northeast Arkansas together with energy  and environmental experts  from  around  the  Nation,  including former Secretary of Energy  James Schlesinger, to discuss the potential of  fuel from the farm.  The conference was  judged  to be a suc cess, and I will share more about it with my  colleagues at a future time.  Unfortunately, because of my attendance at  the conference I was absent from the House  for rollcalls 346 and 34 7.  Rollcall 346 was on passage on H.R. 3614,  the  drug-free  schools  and  communities  amendments, and rollcall 34 7 was on passage  of H.R.  the Drug Forfeiture Amend ments Act. Had I been present, I would have  voted for both measures.  H.R.  3614 would  direct  nearly  all  new  money above the fiscal year 1989 level for the  Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program  to local school districts.  It would also require  schools and  institutions of higher education  receiving Federal funds  to adopt a drug-free  school policy, and would create a program to  assist children of substance abusers.  H.R. 3550 would extend the  important au thority for transfer of up to $150 million a year  from  the asset forfeiture fund  in  the Depart ment Qf Justice to the special forfeiture fund  under control of  the drug czar.  In  return,  it  would require Secretary Bennett to designate  certain  high-intensity  drug  trafficking  areas  under the authority of the 1988 drug  law not  later than February 1, 1990. H.R. 3550 would  also clarify the relationship between Federal  and State forfeiture law.

SUMMARY OF REPORT BY AM NESTY  INTERNATIONAL  ON  HUMAN  RIGHTS  ABUSES  BY  SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT  IN  NICARAGUA  <Mr.  LAGOMARSINO  asked  and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ,1989
1782,735,20,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I am inserting into the RECORD today a  summary of  the most recent report  issued by Amnesty International about  human rights abuses in Nicaragua by  the Sandinista government.  While the report acknowledges some  ""notable  improvements""-largely due  to actions  taken  to support  the  re forms  leading  to elections  in Febru ary-Amnesty International expressed  concern about  reports  this year of  human rights abuses that include sum mary killings and ""disappearances.""  In one of its key finding, Amnesty  International reports that during the  cease-fire that was  in effect for the  past 19 months, until Daniel Ortega  announced its cancellation, there was  no sign of a decline in ""non-combat""  killings and ""disappearances"" of civil ians blamed on security forces. The  report also  refers  to dozens of un armed peasants being summarily exe cuted during operations by Sandinista  troops against Contra rebels.   This Amnesty International report  serves to support the contention that  Daniel Ortega's action to cancel the  cease-fire is motivated more by fear or  opposition to his government than by  alleged Contra attacks.

1783,774,20,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  in the realm of  the diplomatic machinations that make up the  Middle East peace process,  it  is  imperative  that our well-intentioned impatience for tangi ble progress not blind us to the complexities  of the situation.  We are a nation geared toward ""quick fix""  solutions, but unfortunately there are no quick  and easy answers to the current difficulties in  the Middle East. Each step may be painstak ingly slow, each movement necessarily cau tious. The peace process, however, is far from  stymied.  An  Israeli  initiative, backed by  the United  States and calling for elections in the territo ries,  remains under consideration.  Israel has  expressed a willingness to talk with any Pales tinian so  long as  they  reside  in  the West  Bank. The current pace reflects  the political  reality of years of rivalry, which has been pro longed by Arab belligerence and PLO terror ism.  With this in mind, Mr. Speaker,  it is impor tant  that we  repress any  inclination  to  lay  blame at Israel's doorstep. In actuality, Israel  is only asking  for the same guarantees  that  our Nation would insist upon were we facing  similar circumstances. And when all things are  considered,  these guarantees may pave  the  way  for eventual success  in peace negotia tions, should there be a willing and able Arab  partner.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to place  in  the  RECORD an excellent article by syndicated col umnist Charles Krauthammer, which appeared  November 13, 1989  in the Washington Post last week.  It reminds  us that Israeli attention to details, which may  seem trivial to some, is driven by the need for  national security and survival.    [From the Washington Post, Nov. 3, 1989)  WHY ISRAEL INSISTS ON ITS STRATEGY-PEACE  Is MORE  ATTRACTIVE  TO  PALESTINIANS  INSIDE THE TERRITORIES THAN TO THE PLO  IN TUNIS  <By Charles Krauthammer)  The Middle East peace process appears to  have gotten so bogged down in arcana that  only diplomats and specialists can follow its  twists and turns. The public has lost inter est. But the occasional reports and  leaks  that penetrate the public perplexity leave  one clear impression: that behind the obfus cation,  it  is Prime Minister Yitzhak Sha mir's niggling insistence on procedural de tails that is keeping us from the dawn of  Middle East peace-and keeping this adriiin istration  from a diplomatic  triumph,  the  first ever Israeli-Palestinian talks.  The impression is false. Shamir has made  a  large  issue of  two points. But they are  about as procedural as Churchill's refusal to  negotiate with Hitler.  Point 1. Israel has proposed a peace initia tive: free elections in the occupied territo ries  to produce Palestinian negotiators  to  work out some interim peace (""autonomy"")  that would end the Israeli military occupa tion. After three years of  living  together  this way, after having had time to reasses5  each other's worst assumptions about the  other's ultimate intentions, then and only  then do negotiations start on a final peace,  because only then can they have any chance  of success.  Elections, negotiation,  interim  solution,  final status. Everybody but the PLO has ac cepted this idea in principle. Nevertheless,  an Egyptian 10-point plan pointedly puts  the ultimate ""final status""  issue-Israel's  giving up  the West Bank-on  the  table  before the first words are exchanged or the  first ballot cast.  Shamir's ""wrangling""  is about demands  for an  ironclad American guarantee  that  the initial talks will be about elections and  not a Pandora's box of unresolvable ""final  status"" questions. Israel does not want to  start talks that are destined from day one to  fail and for which failure it is sure to be  blamed.  Point 2. The question of Palestinian repre sentation. Israel's other wrangle is to insist  that the Palestinian negotiators who will ar range th~ elections be insiders <West Bank ers> and not outsiders <Palestinians  living  abroad and representing the PLO establish ment in Tunis).  This is not a procedural point, because the  only  talks  that can possibly  succeed are  talks between Israel and the insiders. It is  true, of course, that insiders and outsiders  both swear allegiance to PLO. <Those who  refuse to have a way of getting shot: 125 of  those killed during the intifada are Palestin ians killed by other Palestinians>. But there  is a natural divergence of interests between  insiders and outsiders  in  the Palestinian  movement, just as there was a natural diver gence between insiders and outsiders in the  Algerian war and between  insiders <Viet  Cong) and outsiders <Hanoi> in South Viet nam.  On every major issue, the insiders' diver gent interest is more favorable to peace:  Occupation. It is the insiders, not the out siders, who suffer daily the dislocations and  casualties of the intifada. Their objective is  ",1989
1784,813,20,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join as a cosponsor of this  amendment to extend certain expiring  tax provisions. This amendment pro vides us with the opportunity to vote  for stability in our tax policy on issues  that are important to every segment  of this great Nation and its citizens.  Many of these provisions are impor tant to the continued growth of our  economy and the ability of our busi nesses to successfully compete in the  international market. Other provisions  are important to the accomplishment  of important social goals, such as pro viding  affordable  housing  for  all  Americans.  We are currently enjoying the bene fits of the longest peacetime economic  expansion in the history of the United  States. At the same time, however, it is  estimated that as many as 3 million  Americans are homeless. These  indi viduals are unable to find affordable  housing, much less realize the Ameri can dream of owning a home.  In an effort to address this problem,  we provided the States with authority  to issue tax-exempt mortgage revenue  bonds and, in 1986, created the low income housing tax credit. This credit  was for low-income Americans. It pro vides a valuable tax incentive to en courage developers  to produce  low income rental housing.  By extending this tax credit, we will  be continuing a program that directly  benefits less fortunate Americans. In  addition, we will be advancing a pro posal endorsed  in last year's Rouse Maxwell report, a study that is widely  considered  to be  the blueprint  for  future housing policy.  In my State, Rhode Island Housing  has used the tax credits to create over  low-income housing units during  the last 2 years. Without this valuable  resource, none of  these units would  have  been  constructed  in  Rhode  Island. In 1988, Rhode Island was one  of only nine States to use 100 percent  of its 1988 credit allocation, and the  demand for the 1989 credit allocation  far exceeded the available supply.  The loss of this tax credit would be a  devastating  blow  to  the  efforts of  Rhode Island Housing. Their program  combines an equity  investment fund  raised  through  the sale of  the  low450  income housing tax credits with bond  financing  and  zero  interest  second  mortgages to produce affordable hous ing in one of this country's most ex pensive housing markets.  Providing adequate housing for the  poor  is a  long-term  job, and Rhode  Island Housing is in the initial plan ning stages of a new equity investment  fund.  If the credit  is not extended  before the end of this year, these ef forts will have to be canceled, and all  new projects under consideration by  developers wil have to be put on hold.  Our failure  to extend  this program  prior to the end of the year will result  in a delay in the construction of new  low-income housing that could extend  for all of 1990 and into 1991.  Besides providing affordable rental  housing for all Americans, we must re member that homeownership is an im portant part of the American dream.  In many States, such as Rhode Island,  where housing is very expensive when  compared to median incomes, we must  provide  tax  incentives  for programs  that assist  low-income Americans  in  acquiring their first home. We must  reverse the declining homeownership  trend that exists in this country.  The  Mortgage  Revenue  Bond  CMRBl Program authorizes States to  issue  tax-exempt mortgage  revenue  bonds to provide below market-rate fi nancing for the purchase of homes by  citizens  in  those States. This below  market-rate  financing  allows many  Americans to purchase a home, when  they would not be able to buy a house  with any of the conventional financing  methods.  In 1986, we adopted a State volume  cap which placed a limit on the total  amount  of  private-purpose,  tax exempt bonds that could be issued by  a State. The MRB Program expands  the  types  of private-purpose bonds  that can be issued by a State within its  volume cap. I believe we should allow  each State to utilize the volume cap to  best meet the needs of its citizens.  The Mortgage Revenue Bond Pro gram is a vital part of my State's hous ing program and its efforts to address  the large affordability gap that exists  in Rhode Island. The experiences of  Rhode Island Housing, the manager of  the MRB Program in my State, illus trate the importance of this program  to  fulfilling  the  homeownership  dreams of low-income Americans.  In the 15 years that Rhode Island  Housing & Mortgage Finance Corp.  has  existed,  almost  families  have been able  to purchase a home  utilizing a mortgage from our MRB  Program. The managers of the MRB  Program have calculated that approxi mately  percent  of  the  families  served by  the MRB Program would  not have been able  to qualify for a  conventional mortgage. Rhode Island  Housing  utilizes State  resources  to  provide second mortgages and interest  35,000  80  rate  buydowns  combined with  the  MRB Program to assist citizens of my  State in the purchase of a home.  If the Mortgage Revenue Bond Pro gram is not extended, the State hous ing agencies will have to cancel any  existing plans  for new  issuances of  mortgage  revenue bonds. This could  create an extended period of time in  which the States do not have money  available to provide low-interest mort gages. The  leadtime required for  fi nancing new mortgages  through  the  issuance of new bonds would be ap proximately 5 to 6 months.  I believe it is  imperative for us to  extend the authority of the States to  issue  tax-exempt  bonds  to  provide  mortgage financing to our young fami lies, who would not otherwise be able  to fulfill the American dream by pur chasing a first home.  In addition to the problem with af fordable housing in this country, we  must  also  be  concerned  about  the  effect of our  international competi tiveness on the continued vitality of  our  economy. Government  policies  should  be  carefully  scrutinized  to  ensure  they enhance our ability  to  compete rather than hinder it. Our at tention should be focused on helping  American  businesses  succeed  in  today's worldwide market.  One area of tremendous importance  in today's competitive environment is  research and development which leads  to  technological  innovation. The na tions  that are winning  the competi tiveness race are those that recognize  the importance of advanced technolo gy-because it results in new, market able products and more efficient pro duction and manufacturing.  These countries work to attract com panies that will establish research and  development  facilities within  their  borders. To achieve greater economic  competitiveness we must  foster, not  impede, U.S.  investment  in research  and development. We must expand,  not export, our technological base.  Without stability, we cannot expect  our major investors in R&D to make  the long-range plans that are critical  to  some of our most promising  re search efforts. The provisions in this  amendment to extend the R&D  tax  credit and to renew the moratorium  on the application of the section 861-8  R&D allocation rules are necessary to  encourage the commitment of U.S. in dustries  to  long-term R&D  invest ment ..  We must provide these incentives to  American businesses  to  increase and  maintain higher levels of expenditures  for R&D. Increased levels of research  are necessary for America  to regain  the competitive edge that we have en joyed for years, but which we have  lost, in recent years, to other nations,  such as Japan.

1785,839,20,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr.  President,  as  chairman of the Select Committee on  Indian Affairs, I am most gratified and  pleased to rise  today to request the  Senate's final consideration of S. 978,  a  bill  to  establish  the  National  Museum  of  the American  Indian  within the Smithsonian Institution.  Mr. President, as you know, this leg islation was conceived 2 years and 7  months ago, when  the Secretary of  the Smithsonian Institution, and Hon orable Robert McCormick Adams, and  I visited the Museum of the American  Indian, Heye Foundation,  and met  with  the chairwoman of  the Heye  board of  trustees, Mrs. Wilmot H.  Kidd  III,  in New York. Since  that  time, many people have been involved  in the formulation, negotiation, and fi nally  the  realization  of  the  long  sought-after objective.  I have been inspired by the commit ment of many,  including officials of  the State and city of New York, the  Board of Regents of the Smithsonian  Institution,  the board of  trustees of  the Museum of the American Indian,  Heye Foundation, and most recently,  my colleagues in the House of Repre sentatives, for their expeditious action  on this historic measure.  When history records this event, the  names of illustrious Members of the  Congress will undoubtedly be honored,  in the manner that history customari ly treats events of this kind. All of us  know that a measure of this magni tude entails  the concerted effort of  many people, some of whom are major  contributors and some who are no less  important. And so while we are en gaged  in making  a  record  of  the  moment, I am going to take the dan gerous  step  of  singling out  a  few  people who deserve to be recognized, a  group  that  does  not  include  any  Member of the Congress.  First and  foremost are  the some times  forgotten  people-the  Indian  people. Without them, we would not  be celebrating this great event. It is  their extraordinary  talent and mag nificent works  that we will honor their art,  their music,  their culture,  their religion,  their scholarly works,  their beauty, and their sensitivity will  be forever memorialized in this great  museum. The names of Indian artists  known only to the creator will be com memorated in this memorial to Ameri can Indians.  Second,  I want  to  recognize  those  who collected and guarded this collec tion so carefully over the years, and  preserved it so well, that it will be ca pable of being enjoyed and appreciat ed by generations to come. Mrs. Julie  Kidd, and her foundation, and Chris tian A. Johnson Endeavor Foundation,  with no  fanfare and at  times even  abuse, kept  the collection alive  for  many years. The sometimes maligned  curator of the Museum of the Ameri can  Indian, Heye  Foundation, Dr.  Roland Force, whose care and concern  for the Heye collection was both per sonal and professional.

1788,852,20,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  want to take issue with some of the  statements of my good  friend  from  New  Jersey, Senator BRADLEY, who,  indeed, was one of the staunch sup porters of  tax  reform.  In my  judg ment, he attempted to give an impres sion when he cited the income catego ries  in this Nation that this capital  gains bill unfairly affects the rich, be cause he said a certain percentage are  below $10,000. I think he said only 1  percent of the income earners above  $100,000, $200,000, I cannot remember  which, were  the  ones  that would  unduly benefit.  As a matter of interest, a year ago, I  asked  the Joint Committee on Tax ation-that is the professional group  that advises the Ways and Means and  Finance Committees-to do an esti mate for me of how much money we  could raise if we confiscated all of the  income of all of those who made above  $200,000. They would be subject to a  100-percent tax rate. Well, the Joint  Committee sent me a  letter. Here  is  what they projected.  If you were to do it late in the year,  so it is too late for people who have al ready made  the money,  the  Joint  Committee said we would rasie $104  billion in 1989 if we imposed a 100-per cent tax on incomes over $200,000. In  1990, we would raise $204 billion. In  1991, $232 billion; in 1992, $263 billion;  and in 1993, $299 billion.  So  I called  the Joint Committee's  chief of staff back and I said, ""Wait a  minute. Do you mean to tell me that  even at a  100-percent  tax  rate you  think we will keep getting  these  in creased quantities of money?"" They  sent me another letter that has the  same revenue projections but with a  new footnote. The footnote says that  these estimated taxes do not account  ",1989

1791,865,20,Mr. DOLE., I will be happy to yield.  ,1989
1792,865,20,Mr. WILSON.," I ask my friend if it  does not strike him as somewhat ironic  that among  the many people who  have taken the floo.r  in opposing the  Packwood-Roth proposal,  there have  been included many who have repeat edly chastised those who would seek  foreign investment?  The ironic thing is they have been  among  some  of  the most  eloquent  Japan bashers, and yet here this after noon they are saying we do not need  capital gains because there is a flood  of capital. On other occasions I have  heard them be very eloquent, saying  we really cannot be dependent upon  foreign investment.  I think they ought not to be able to  have it both ways. The fact is, if they  do not  like Japanese  investment  in  Rockefeller Center, are they suggest ing that there will be adequate Japa nese or  foreign  investment  for  the  small businesses that are the startups,  the celebrated California garage, with  a good  idea? It strikes me as highly  ironic, and  I am  just curious as .to  whether or not my friend, the Repub lican  leader,  sees  that  in  the same  light.  ",1989
1793,865,20,Mr. DOLE.," I think all those who are  quick to criticize President Bush for  whatever he does and probably about  what we do with Japan ought to think  twice before they cast a vote against  cloture. If we want to be competitive,  we have to give our businessmen and  women in America the tools to be com petitive. We have to reduce the cost of  capital. We cannot just bash the Presi dent.  As I pointed out, when we had the  rate reduction, we raised more capital  than the Japanese by a big margin,  but not since that time. And so I agree  with the distinguished Senator from  ",1989

Helen was born and raised in Ellen dale, ND, and now resides with her  husband in Rapid City, SD.  Her book, ""The Making of the Two  Dakotas,"" is a superb centennial histo ry of our two States. It recounts the  frontier  foundation of States whose  values to this day underpin the very  best our Nation has to offer.  Helen's abilities and her perceptive  understanding of the Dakotas are un derscored both by publication of her  works in the New York Times, Read er's Digest, and elsewhere, and by her  selection of my State over its northern  neighbor as her adult residence.  I commend this fine book to my col leagues and congratulate Helen Re zatto on her achievement.  CORRECTING RUMOR  CONCERNING IRS ACTIVITY  ",1989
1802,878,20,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, many  of my colleagues in the Senate and in  the other body are receiving communi cations from their constituents assert ing that the Internal Revenue Service  is planning to impose income tax on  accrued, but unpaid, vacation pay and  sick leave benefits.  This  is  totally  incorrect. As chair man of the Finance Committee, I au thored legislation, which was enacted  into law last year as part of the Tech nical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act  of 1988, to ensure that these accrued,  but unpaid, benefits are not  taxed  before they are paid.  Somehow,  a  rumor  has  started  which has confused and upset a large  number of Federal, State, and  local  employees. I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the RECORD some in formation from the IRS which should  clear up this matter.  There being no objection, the infor mation was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE,  Washington, DC, October 13, 1989.  Mr. TERRY ROGERS,  Director, Legislative Affairs, American Fed eration  of  Government  Employees,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. RoGERs: This is in response to a  memorandum circulated by Chapter 495 of  the American Federation of Government  Employees  among  the  employees  of  a  number of governmental entities claiming  that the Internal Revenue Service intends  to tax governmental employees on vacation  and sick pay which has been earned but not  yet paid out. This memo, a copy of which is  attached, is totally incorrect. It has caused  unnecessary concern to many recipients and  has prompted numerous phone calls and let ters to us from members of Congress con cerning the federal income tax treatment of  accrued but unused sick and vacation pay  earned  by  governmental  employees. For  your information, we have enclosed a copy  of a fact sheet we have prepared in response  to this memo, explaining the basic rules re garding the taxation of vacation and sick  pay.  Although we cannot determine the source  of the incorrect information being circulat ed, the confusion regarding the taxation of  accrued but unpaid vacation and sick pay  apparently originated from a misreading of  a notice issued by the Service in 1987 re garding the tax treatment of nonelective de ferred compensation under section 457, as  amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Upon becoming aware of concerns expressed  by some governmental employees that they  would be taxed on these benefits when they  were earned rather than when they were re ceived or paid, the Service issued a revised  notice in June 1988, which was essentially  codified in the Technical and Miscellaneous  Revenue Act of 1988 <TAMRA>. This notice  and the TAMRA provision specify that cer tain bona fide benefit plans, including vaca tion leave and sick leave plans, are not de ferred compensation plans subject  to  the  section 457 requirements. Furthermore, we  should emphasize that section 457, by  its  terms,  is appljcable to employees of state  and local governmental units and of  tax exempt organizations, but not to employees  of the Federal government. Therefore, any  concern about the taxation, under section  457, of accrued but unpaid vacation and sick  pay <which was  resolved  in 1988  as ex plained in the fact sheet> is completely in applicable to Federal employees.  The memorandum also refers to an ""H.R.  4221"" which is said to be designed to over turn the <nonexistent> IRS decision to tax  unpaid vacation and sick pay. Our research  indicates  that this bill was  introduced  in  1988 during the second session of the lOOth  Congress and died without action at the end  of that Congressional session. As explained  above and in the attached fact sheet, this  bill was not necessary to prevent the tax ation of unpaid vacation and sick pay  in  light of the recently enacted TAMRA provi sion regarding bona fide vacation and sick  leave plans.  We hope that you will find the informa tion in the enclosed fact sheet helpful, and  we  request  that your office  immediately  inform  your  local  chapters,  particularly  Local 495, regarding the current state of the  law. This may help  to allay  the fears of  many employees about  taxation of  their  benefits. If you have further questions on  this matter, you may contact John Tolleris  of my staff at 566-3060.  Sincerely,  MARY E. OPPENHEIMER,  Acting Assistant Chief Counsel (Employee  Benefits and Exempt Organizations).  EXAMPLE OF ERRONEOUS FL YER  The  Internal Revenue Service has de clared that government <State and Federal>  employees benefits are  taxable. The  IRS  will begin taxing the cost of employer-paid  benefits such as Health, -Welfare, and dis ability payments. Also, the IRS will tax all  unused sick leave and vacation at the end of  each year at the appropriate value.  Example: If you earn $10.00 per hour and  work an 8 hour day, each work day is worth  $80.00. If you have 20 sick days and 20 vaca tion days accumulated at the end of the  year they would have a total value of $3200.  You would have to add this amount to your  total income before paying your taxes.  <Reprint  from Pennsylvania Postmaster  Newsletter>  All employees alert! The above article is  fact. The decision by the IRS to tax our  sick, annual, and disability, payments has  already been made  an will  affect  your  income taxes this year. Only you can stop  this outrage. H.R. 4221 <House of Repre sentatives Bill 4221>  is an attempt to over turn this unfair  treatment. It is strongly  urged that all public employees write their  Senators and Representatives to ask their  support  for H.R.  4221  to overturn  this  ruling by the IRS.   ",1989

I  think we know how the vote is going  to come out.  I understand people want to express  themselves, but I hope they do it very  briefly.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I would  urge  the Members who  voted yes on the last motion to vote no  now. Essentially this is the same issue  we considered just a few minutes ago.  The gentleman from New Jersey, in  effect, would restore current law if his  motion  is agreed  to. Under current  law, the President has refused to certi fy under the Kemp-Kasten provisions  that UNFP A is not involved in China  impermissibly,  and  therefore  no  money has been going to the UNFP A  for  its  programs  anywhere  in  the  world. It is for that very reason that  the legislative language was  included  in the Senate bill, and it is for that  very reason  that we  receded  to  the  Senate a few moments ago.  What we have done in light of the  President's refusal  to  certify under  current law is to earmark $15 million  for UNFPA with the express provisos  that  the  funds  cannot be used  in  China or for abortion.  What the gentleman's motion seeks  to do is to reverse what we have just  done, to put Members in the same po sition that we were before we adopted  the prior motion. Therefore,  if  the  gentleman's motion  is  accepted,  the  UNFPA will get absolutely no contri bution from the United States for the  programs  it now  funds  in countries  other than China, and for programs  which are voluntary programs, exclud ing abortion.  Therefore, I would urge the Mem bers who  voted  yes  on  the  prior  motion to vote no now. It is the very  same vote.  Mr. SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen tleman from Illinois [Mr. HYDE].  ",1989
1823,943,20,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, I think this  is very simple, and need not take a lot  of time on this issue.  It seems to me if Members want to  support the United Nations which sup ports a program, or manages a pro gram of coerced abortion or  forced  sterilization,  then vote no on  this.  Then Members will end up supporting  the U.N. population fund, which,  in  turn, supports the Chinese program.  On the other hand, if Members are  off ended by the Chinese program of  coercion, then do not help the United  Nations which  does  not  take  our  money and give it to China, but takes  some of its own money. Any agency  that supports or encourages or facili tates  coerced  sterilization,  coerced  abortion, ought to be anathema.  However,  if Members want to sup port that, go right ahead. This  is a  clear opportunity to say all this money  goes for family planning, but so long  as the Chinese program is supported  by  the United Nations, we  are not  going to support the United Nations.  It is that simple. Family planning is  supported all over the world, but not  through the United Nations, so long as  the United Nations supports the Chi nese program. It is that simple. Not  convoluted at all.  I hope Members will vote yes on this  amendment.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Wis consin [Mr. MOODY].  ",1989
1824,943,20,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Speaker, one has  to almost wonder if this amendment is  germane since it deals strictly with the  condition in China. Our last vote de cided  to help countries other  than  China.  I think the previous debate and vote  made  it very  clear  that  this body  chooses to help countries other than  China through the UNFPA and volun tary family planning activities in poor  countries.  This amendment by Representative  SMITH would suddenly reverse that. It  would restore the Kasten-Kemp  lan guage and therefore remove the abili ty to help those other countries, given  President Bush's current policies. So  the  amendment  almost  borders  on  being nongermane since it goes to con ditions in China. When the support we  just passed does not deal with China.  That measure was carefully crafted  to prevent any United States money  from going to China through UNFP A,  and that is exactly why many Mem bers  supported  it. This amendment  would simply wipe out what we  just  did, and say that because what is hap pening in China, which Congress does  not approve of, we do not want any  UNFP A money going to Bangladesh or  Mexico or Haiti or South America or  sub-Sahara Africa. We would be saying  we do not want any United States  family  planning money  going  to  UNFP A anywhere on Earth because of  what is happening in China.  We just made the decision that what  is happening in China is not going to  let Members punish other countries.  Do not let it punish other countries.  Do not let it punish poor women, poor  ",1989

We in this Congress feel very com fortable with the gentlemen in their  respective positions. We wish it was re versed.

We do urge the  Members to vote for this resolution. It  is an anomaly 1n  the  rules and  it  should be corrected.

1836,982,20,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 1602, the Trauma Care Systems Plan ning and Development Act. This bill should go  a  long way  toward addressing our serious  public health problem of injury.  I'm especially pleased  that during commit tee consideration of  this  legislation, several  changes were made that should improve the  effectiveness of this legislation in rural areas.  This  is especially important because 70 per cent of highway deaths occur in rural areas,  and studies show you're twice as likely to die  from a bad accident in a rural area than if you  had that same accident in the city.  These alarming statistics can be explained  in part by the great distances and sometimes  rugged terrain in rural areas. But it's not just  geography-it's the EMS  infrastructure  itself  that's causing the trouble.  When Federal funds dried up at the begin ning of this decade, many rural areas did not  have  the  resources  to  fill  in.  Instead,  they  depend on bake sales and  raffles  to  raise  funds.  In  the worst cases,  they don't even  have an ambulance. That's the case  in one  county in my district. If you're lucky, there'll be  a pickup truck to take you  to the hospital in  the next county. For  these  kinds of  rural  areas,  it's unrealistic to expect that on  their  own,  they could  implement  the  triage and  transport policies required by H.R. 1602.  Rural  trauma  care-like all  rural  health  care-needs help. The bill before us today in cludes an amendment I offered in the Energy  and Commerce Committee. It set aside $5 mil lion for rural EMS research and demonstration  projects in communications technology, model  curricula, making EMS courses more available  to folks in rural areas, and promoting the re gional pooling of resources, especially trans portation equipment.  This is a modsst but important first step in  addressing the serious problems of rural EMS.  It should help get us the information we need  to improve rural  trauma care.  I urge my col leagues to support H.R. 1602.  ",1989
1837,982,20,Mr. HA YES of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, as a co sponsor of H.R. 1602, the Trauma Care Sys tems Planning and Development Act of 1989,  I rise in strong support of its passage.  Mr. Speaker, given the daily accidents and  violence in major urban areas, the availability  of trauma care is of vital importance to inner  city residents. Today, in my home city of Chi cago, we are  facing a crisis with  respect to  the delivery of trauma care. No doubt, Chica go is not alone in this dilemma.  In Chicago, of  the 1 O hospitals originally  designated as  level  I  trauma centers,  there  are only 7 remaining in the network. Of those  remaining, one was close to leaving but has  since agreed to remain. The question is-for  how long?  To compound the situation, Chicago is also  facing a health care delivery crisis due to the  closure of community hospitals.  I am  sure  many of our colleagues share that dilemma as  well. This is an issue that Chairman WAXMAN  and  I have  talked about and  I want him  to  know that I appreciate his understanding on  this matter. As he  is well aware, across  the  country, 81 community hospitals closed  their  doors in 1988. In Chicago alone,  four closed  in 1988, and since 1986, six others closed as  well.  The closure of 1 O hospitals  in 3 years  is  nothing to take lightly. In my district, Provident  Hospital,  the  first  African-American-owned  hospital in the Nation, sits idle and unused be cause  its owners went  into bankruptcy. Al though  it is still  fully equipped and ready  to  serve the community,  its fate is caught up in  bureaucratic and political maneuvering. Mean while, my  constituents must  travel  across  town to have access to hospital care.  With 31 million Americans  in poverty, .and  37 million without health insurance, the ability  of our Nation's hospitals  to provide uncom pensated care is fast approaching the break ing point, if it hasn't passed that point already.  For the Nation's third largest city, the clos ing of 1 O hospitals, coupled with the loss of 6  or 7 trauma care centers, is clearly inadequate  for the needs of city residents.  H.R. 1602, whi:I:) not a cure all, will certainly  enhance efforts to provide necessary trauma  care expertis'1 and services so vitally needed  not only in cities such as Chicago, but also in  underserved rural areas as well.  In closing, I would like to commend our col league,  the gentleman  from California  BATES],  for his  leadership  in  introducing this  measure. I urge all Members of this Chamber  to vote in support of H.R. 1602  ",1989

1843,982,20,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, the main  purpose of S. 737  is to authorize the  addition of certain  lands  to Rocky  Mountain National Park. The legisla tion  was  initially  considered  and  passed by the Senate on September 15,  1989. The House passed S. 737 with  amendments on September 25, 1989.  Subsequently the Senate considered S.  737 on November 3, 1989, disagreed  with the House amendments and re turned the measure to the House.  While the House and Senate are in  agreement on the additions of land to  Rocky Mountain National Park that  are made by the bill, there have been  differences over a provision contained  in the Senate bill that deals with a pri vate  landowner  within  the  park  boundary. We are now very close to re solving  those differences. Action by  the House today to return S. 737  to  the Senate will keep open the parlia mentary process to that we can com plete action on the bill without having  to resort to more cumbersome legisla tive procedures.

1847,1008,20,Mr. WISE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  commend the chairman and the sub committee  for  their work  on  this  reform package, and having sat on the  Employment and Housing Subcommit tee for many hearings, I know what  they are up against.  I am hoping this will help redirect  housing funds to the people who des perately need them. Low-income citi zens should not have to depend upon  high-income  consultants  for  their  housing.  Mr. Speaker,  there  is  an  issue  I  would like to explore further with the  chairman as he works on the reauthor ization bill next session.  I  am con cerned, because there are rural areas  such as in West Virginia rural areas  with a population under 50,000  that  are not receiving adequate housing as sistance, particularly under the fair share formula. HUD does not target  these areas, and in many cases neither  does Farmers Home. Farmers Home  regulations allow them to target only  areas basically under  10,000,  some times between 10,000 and 20,000, but  there is a large crack that develops in  areas between 20,000 and 50,000.  There  are many  people  in  rural  areas, either homeless or living in sub standard conditions, caught  in  these  20,000 to 50,000 areas, and I look for ward to working with the chairman in  the next session to correct this.

The administration does have some  concerns about H.R. 1 which I men tioned a  little earlier during debate.  However, the administration feels that  this is a good, comprehensive package  and will  restore ethical  integrity  to  HUD's program.  H.R. 1 includes most of the ehtics re forms proposed by the administration.  Accordingly,  the  administration  strongly supports provisions  to  insti tute fair and open competition in the  allocation of housing funds, stringent  limitations on the use of discretionary  funds by HUD, public notification of  funding decisions, and strict disclosure  requirements  for  consultants  doing  business with the Department.  In addition, H.R.  1 contains  civil  money penalties requested by the ad ministration.  yield  We have an excellent bipartisan bill  which I urge all Members to support.  ",1989
1849,1008,20,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R.  1,  the Department of Housing and  Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 and I  thank  the distinguished Banking Committee  chairman,  the  gentleman  from Texas  [Mr.  GONZALEZ],  the Ranking Republican member  from Ohio [Mr. WYLIE], as well as the gentle lady  from New Jersey  [Mrs. ROUKEMA],  for  their diligent efforts  to bring  this  legislation  bet ore Congress.  Mr. Speaker,  it continues  to be my belief  that one of  the most pressing  issues  facing  our great Nation today is the matter of afford able housing.  If our Nation is to live up to its  potential  for greatness, all Americans must  believe  that  they are  shareholders  in  the  American dream of one day being able to own  a home.  However,  today  too many Americans  find  home  ownership  virtually  an  impossible  dream. The  lack of decent, safe, affordable  housing has become so pronounced in some  regions of the country, as in my own 22d Con gressional District,  that many people despair  that they will never have a home that they can  call their own.  For this reason, I am a strong supporter for  H.R. 1, which will provide reform initiatives to  govern the Department of Housing and Urban  Development.  This  legislation will provide many welcome  initiatives which Secretary Kemp has request ed in his attempt to clean up the special inter est  influence which  currently plagues HUD  and its programs.  Mr. Speaker,  throughout  the past year we  have heard much discussion with  regard  to  HUD's past mismanagement and  conduct.  However, today we have a chance to vote for  this reform legislation in order to enhance the  continuation of  the American dream and  I  would  like to commend the Secretary for his  continuing efforts  to win  the war  against  homelessness and affordable housing.  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Kemp and H.R. 1  provide the support needed  to have the ad ministration  to establish a policy enhancing  decent, affordable housing  for . the people of  the United States. We cannot afford to let an  essential ingredient to the American dream permanent  homeownership-remain  only  a  dream and not a reality. For  this  reason,  I  urge my collegues to support H.R. 1.  ",1989
1850,1008,20,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 1, and  I urge my colleagues to vote  in  favor of this important reform legislation.

I  am sure that his first 1 O months at HUD have  seen him focus on a different agenda than he  had planned. But  internal  reforms must be  made before new authorizations and reauthor izations take place. It would make no sense to  authorize more of the same without knowing  what works and what doesn't; where  fraud  and abuse is and where it isn't.  At the same  time, we must recognize  that  the goal of creating more affordable housing  alternatives for the American people is both a  challenge and a goal that must be addressed  upon completion of this reform package.  Mr. Speaker, over  the  last  two decades,  American  taxpayers  from  coast  to  coast,  border  to border, have paid  taxes  to help  house  families who could not afford decent  shelter otherwise; to help rebuild communities  and neighborhoods that were slowly crumbling  away; and to help expand homeownership op portunities  to all who were willing  to work  toward  that dream. But  instead. of helping  people at the end of the line, many of those  tax dollars went to pad the bottom lines of un scrupulous developers, investors, and consult ants.  Our job today, then, is to restore the confi dence of the public by closing  the doors of  unethical influence peddlers and opening the  door, again, for those who need our help.  The  legislative package before us contains  over 50 specific  legislative changes  that re place business as usual with good business  practices. Under  this  reform  package,  our  housing and community development dollars  will be allocated using formulas that determine  what people need  rather  than who people  know. The bill establishes strict standards of  conduct  for people working at HUD and  for  people outside the Government who want to  influence them. H.R. 1 enacts civil penalties and  in  some  cases  criminal  penalties-to  punish misconduct and to deter those who are  tempted to challenge these reforms. The bill  tightens evaluation and monitoring procedures  for all of HUD's programs and restores control  and accountability to the FHA insurance fund.  In  short,  the HUD  reform package barri cades the avenues to abuse that have been  traveled far too often by too many people in  past years, and lays the groundwork for a new  direction for housing in the years ahead.  There are one or two provisions in  the bill  that concern me, however, and  I would be  remiss  if  I did not mention one here-the  change in the Community Development Block  Grant Program. The CDBG Program has not  been  the subject of any scandal,  reports of  abuse, or any rumor of either.  Indeed, by al lowing the States and  local governments the  flexibility  to use  these  funds  in ways best  suited  to  their communities,  the CDBG Pro gram has been the source of some great suc cesses.  Mr. Speaker,  I  think we all want  to help  those who most need our assistance, but by  further  restricting  the  targetting provisions,  I  am concerned that many smaller entitlement  cities  and  nonentitlement  communities will  have difficulty qualifying for CDBG funds. As a  result, some extraordinarily good projects may  be  left at the wayside, and that troubles me.  I should also note  that Secretary Kemp  would like to refocus the CDBG Program into  strictly a poverty-fighting program. As I believe  this would be a significant change in thrust for  CDBG's, I .am pleased that the committee left  that question for next year when we consider  comprehensive housing  legislation. This will  give us the opportunity for hearings and more  analysis.  Mr. Speaker, a fine and dedicated group of  people were mobilized and motivated to bring  this  reform  package  to  fruition.  Secretary  Kemp and the honest, hardworking people at  HUD-at all  levels-deserve our  thanks  for  their candor, recommendations, and desire to  ",1989

1857,1125,20,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, we  have begun a crucial new debate in the Con gress and  in the Nation-a debate about the  future course of our national budget and our  national military policies.  These past few weeks have witnessed mi raculous and irreversible changes in the politi cal  and  economic  destinies  of  Eastern  Europe. The people of Poland, Hungary, East  Germany, and even Bulgaria have taken  the  first  important steps towards democracy. We  must  take comparable  steps  to encourage  and support those reforms, both in economic  and in defense policy in conjunction with our  own allies.  Last week, the House discussed a proposal  to reduce our military spending  in a planned  but steady manner in the early 1990's, focus ing on reduced overseas spending, elimination  of waste and duplication, paring back unnec essary weapons systems, and procurement  reform. Our savings-and  they could  reach  $100 billion-could then be devoted to a wide  range of unmet domestic policy needs, includ ing reduction in the deficit.  I want to share my completed prepared re marks with the House:  STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE MILLER  Mr. Speaker, today's debate on a ""Budget  for a Strong America"" inaugurates an over due re-examination of our budgetary prior ities as we enter a new decade, and prepare  for a new century.  More than a decade ago, the adequacy of  our national security was called into serious  question. Our weapons systems were inad equate; our  troops underpaid and under skilled; our research and development lag ging. A determination was made, on a bipar tisan basis, to increase military spending to  meet the security dangers that confronted  America.  As a result of that decision, we more than  doubled our annual military spending, and  we committed hundreds of billions of dollars  in public resources to the Pentagon. We si multaneously made substantial  reductions  in  domestic  spending,  although  poverty  rates were climbing, while serious deficien cies in health care and education persisted,  and while homelessness and drugs were be coming national  scourges. We  continued  both that military build-up and a policy of  opposition to tax increases-a deadly fiscal  combination that has tripled the national  debt in a decade.  Today, we revisit the debate over the allo cation of our national resources under dras tically different circumstances.  The past year has recorded one of  the  greatest political revolutions in history. For  reasons we  can only  speculate-glasnost,  economic dissatisfaction, emerging national ism-the men and women of Eastern Europe  have risen up to proclaim the rebirth of de mocracy.  Within the Soviet Union  itself, political  evolution, economic innovation and military  reform  that was unthinkable  just a  few  short years are now the stories of nightly  news broadcasts. And it is not just talk.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  President Gorbachev has achieved half of  the manpower and weapons reductions  in  Eastern Europe that he promised last De cember would occur by 1991.  Since  late 1987, according  to  the Rand  Corporation, 200 Soviet design bureaus and  several hundred manufacturing plants have  been converted  from military  to defense  production.  The American people are natu!""ally enthu siastic for these long-overdue changes. But  we must be more than pleased. And we must  offer something more tangible than encour agement.  Just as we made dramatic fiscal, budget ary and policy changes in the 1970s to meet  our national security needs, so must we in  the 1990s confront the urgent, unmet, and  ominous dangers that face us here at home.  Th~.t requires a re-examination of military  spending.  A generation ago, General Dwight D. Ei senhower observed  that, ""The problem in  defense is how far you can go without de stroying from within what you are trying to  defend from without.""  Only a few years later, as President, Ei senhower warned of the power of the mili tary-industrial  complex  to  consume  vast  quantities  of  our national  treasure  and  dominate our national economy.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to spend  hundreds of billions of dollars every year an additional $1.7 trillion by 1994 according  to  the Pentagon's projections, more  than  $800 million every day of the year-without  allowing severe crises to destroy the Nation  from within:  A doubling of  the national debt  in the  eight years of the Reagan Administration,  despite massive cutbacks in domestic spend ing programs;  An increase in interests costs on the debt  of more than $100 billion a year, every year;  Thirty-one million Americans without  health care;  Fewer than 4 percent of Superfund toxic  waste sites cleaned up;  A shortage of 3.7 million housing units for  those earning less than $10,000 a year;  One million dropping out of school each  year, and millions more undereducated and  unable to qualify even for minimal jobs.  Haven't the American people had enough  of sending billions of dollars  in America's  hard earned tax dollars overseas and into  wasteful military hardware?  Today, we are issuing a call for no less  than the redeployment of America's fiscal,  creative and investment resources.  As Fortune Magazine noted  last  July,  ""With the cold war cooling,  the Pentagon  budget could be cut by a  third without  weakening defense. Think what America  could do with the extra $100 billion a year.""  We agree.  We need a strong defense; but the needs  of the military cannot render America weak  in every other value, every other measure of  greatness and wealth.  We believe America can be strong only if  we are well-educated, well-housed, and well trained; if we treat our infants and children  as irreplaceable investments in our future; if  we apply our unlimited research and intel lectual capacities  to  innovative  scientific,  commercial and consumer development.  And we can afford both forms of national  security.  Spending levels alone are not an accurate  indicator of a commitment to national secu rity. Our failure to recognize that fact was  the great fallacy in the military build-up of  the past decade.  28949  As Pentagon analyst Franklin Spinney de tailed in the Wall Street Journal last week,  Pentagon spending has not been driven by  what is needed to protect American securi ty, but by number manipulation, inadequate  cost control, system duplication, and waste  that would never be tolerated in the private  sector.  Nearly half a century after  the end of  World War II, when military experts tell us  the Soviets  could not  launch  a  ground  attack on NATO, can the United States con tinue  to shoulder the $100 billion a year  burden of maintaining more than one-third  of a million active troops in Europe, with  nearly double that number of support per sonnel and dependents?  Given our other urgent needs, can we  spend $80 billion, and probably much more,  on the B-2 Stealth bomber, an airplane that  literally costs more than its weight in solid  gold; a weapon whose chief proponent has  testified was designed to mop up after the  ""virtual nuclear annihilation"" of U.S. and  U.S.S.R.?  Do we really need to be spending over $3  billion a year, and consuming the careers of  tens of thousands of our best scientists and  physicists, to develop the Star Wars system,  the most expensive bargaining chip in the  history of arms negotiations, and one which  its  skeptical  developers  overwhelmingly  doubt will work?  Americans need not  reach a  consensus  about how to apply the savings we hope to  achieve  from military  reform before we  agree that reform, itself, is overdue. We all  know  how many  legitimate  alternatives  exist.  The recent hurricane and earthquake de struction highlighted the serious problems  of our infrastructure. Over 132,000 bridges23 percent of our total-are structurally un sound. Two thirds of the interstate highway  system, our domestic transportation lifeline,  is  in su.bstandard condition, and there are  3,000 unsafe dams in populated areas.  Nation-wide, we must spend $65 billion an nually on infrastructure just to stay even,  and ""even"" isn't good enough.  But we are not only overlooking our phys ical investments. As even a cursory reading  of business  journals demonstrates, major  American employers are rightly alarmed by  the educational deficiencies of young work ers.  David Kearns,  the chairman of Xerox,  says the mismatch between our employment  needs to remain competitive and the quality  of  young workers  industry must  choose  from, has all of the ""the makings of a na tional disaster class work  force,  and we  cannot have a world class work force with out world class schools.""  Mr. Kearns and his fellow corporate lead ers know that the average 21-25 year old  reads significantly below the level required  by  the average  job available  in 1984,  let  alone the job of 2000, when he or she will  only be in the mid-forties!  Half of those future workers will be mi norities, half of whom are growing up poor,  25-percent of whom leave school early, and  another 25  percent of whom  lack basic  skills.  That  is one  reason why  the corporate  leaders who comprise  the Committee on  Economic Development predict that we will  have 20 million undereducated, undersocia lized people added to our population by the  year  2000:  dependent,  unproductive,  and  raising millions of children in homes of du bious quality.

1858,1138,20,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I, along  with  Mr.  RINALDO,  the  ranking  minority  member of  the Subcommittee on Telecom munications and Finance, which  I chair; and  my  subcommittee  colleague  from  New  Mexico, Mr. RICHARDSON, am  introducing the  Securities Markets Stabilization Act of 1989  and  the Coordinated Clearance and Settle ment Act of 1989, both of which were unani mously approved this morning by the subcom mittee.  The Securities Markets Stabilization Act of  1989  represents  the  first  legislative  step  toward reform of the stock market in the after math of  the  frightening crashes of October  1987 and October 1989, events  that have  shaken  investor confidence  to  its very core.  This long-awaited and much-needed first step  comes after nearly 2 years of extensive con sideration of all the issues surrounding market  reform, a process that has included 12 hear ings by  this  subcommittee, 4  in  this year  alone;  in-depth expert analyses by the Brady  Commission, the Katzenbach Commission, the  Securities and Exchange Commission, and the  working group on financial markets; as well as  a further series of 6 SEC investigations of pro gram trading and other related issues initiated  in response to requests of this subcommittee.  November 14, 1989  first  introduced  comprehensive  market  reform legislation in the 1 OOth Congress, with  H.R. 4997. And earlier  this year, at  the  re quest of the Securities and Exchange Com mission, Chairman JOHN DINGELL and  I intro duced  similar  legislation, H.R.  1609,  the  ""Stock Market Reform Act of 1989.""  The Stabilization Act contains  four provi sions necessary to market reform: (1) a grant  to the SEC of authority to halt all trading in a  market emergency, (2) a directive to the SEC  to require large traders to report their transac tions, (3) a directive to the SEC to assess the  financial health of parents and affiliates of  broker/dealers, and (4) a grant of authority to  the SEC to constrain program trading. A fifth  provision would direct the Commission to fa cilitate coordinated clearing and  settlement  with other Government agencies. This provi sion stands alone  in  the coordinated clear ance and settlement committee print.  All these provisions have been the subject  of extensive negotiation with  the SEC and  Treasury, who strongly support moving  for ward on market  reform. The provisions we  have negotiated with the SEC and the securi ties industry on large trader reporting, risk as sessment and others are extremely valuable  from a market surveillance standpoint. In addi tion, the section concerning powers to prohibit  certain  trading practices addresses  the one  issue at  the  top of every  investors  list-the  habitual, excessive, and violent market volatili ty that has driven the individual investor out of  the stock market. This manufactured volatility  has turned Wall Street into the mean streets  of investing. It's as if we turned off all the Na tion's stop lights, made all speed limits volun tary, stopped filling the pot holes, or repairing  the bridges-and told the American public to  go  it alone. Such a  retreat  from common  sense would not be  tolerated  in any of our  hometowns, yet we are  treating Wall Street  with  the kind of appalling disregard that can  only  result  in  financial  disrepair.  For  this  reason,  the Securities Markets Stabilization  Act committee print includes a provision that  would authorize the SEC to suspend or con strain manipulative,  abusive,  or  disruptive  practices that feed volatility-such as program  trading-during times of excessive market vol atility.  Right now, we are faced with the tyranny of  our own ingenuity. Somewhere along the way  our regulators and our Government forgot the  fundamental notion that technology must exist  to serve, not suppress, human needs. Tech nology must continue to serve as an  instru ment to nurture our financial markets, markets  which were first established to serve the cap ital  raising needs of Amercia's corporations.  And technology must serve to allow individual  Americans  to  invest  in a piece of corporate  America. But since October 1987, I have re ceived numerous calls and letters from angry  investors who have withdrawn  their money  from the market because they find no security  in a stock market that behaves more like a yo yo than an orderly mechanism for buying and  selling shares in corporate America.  I do not believe  that Congress can  or  should  legislate up markets or down mar kets-what we should do is legislate fair mar kets. Right now we have unfair markets-mar",1989

1864,1151,20,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, as you know, this is  the second bill which I have presented  to the House this year making appro priations for fiscal year 1990 for the  Departments of Labor, Health  and  Human Services, and Education and  related agencies. This is necessary be cause of the veto of H.R. 2990 which  the House did not override.  In this bill we have $156,700,000,000,  the exact amount, Mr. Chairman, that  was in the vetoed bill.  For  the Department of Labor we  for  the Depart ment of Health and Human Services  we have the sum of $124,803,000,000;  for the Department of Education we  have $6, 728,000,000;  I  have the sum of $24,151,000,000.  This bill is the best bill that has ever  been presented to the Congress for the  Department of Labor, for the Depart ment of Health and Human Services,  and for the Department of Education.  Mr. Chairman, we believe on  this  subcommittee and full committee that  if you educate your children and take  care of the health of your people, you  continue living in the strongest coun try in the world.  As Members will recall, when we pre sented the bill H.R. 2990 to the House,  we said to the Members at that time  that this is the best Labor-HHS appro priations bill that has ever been pre sented to the Congress. That bill was  passed  in  the House,  sent  to  the  Senate, the Senate passed the bill, and  then we went to conference. Unf ortu nately  the bill which went  to  the  President was vetoed on October 21.  Mr. Chairman, we now present a  new bill to the House. Following the  veto of H.R. 2990 I introduced a new  bill, H.R. 3566. We reported it out yes terday  to  the House. There are no  changes in any of the numbers in the  bill for the amounts agreed to in H.R.  2990. The only matter in the bill that  is different is the matter pertaining to  abortion funding.  ",1989
1865,1164,20,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I regret the turn of  events here. I  think we are going to  start getting pejorative, and I do not  intend  to do  so. However,  if  those  Members who support the unborn, the  innocent  unborn,  are  going  to  be  called  ""the antichoice  crowd,""  that  opens the gate, and one who opens the  gate, I guess, should not complain if  strange cattle wander through.  The  prokiller  crowd,  the  ""death  squads of the left,"" we can play that  game, too, and if the gentleman wants  his group to be called the prochoice  crowd-which is an interesting euphe mism, because there is no choice given  to the unborn, he should be less pejo rative about us. The choice, we are  told is whether or not to have a baby.  However, the woman, if she becomes  pregnant, already has a baby, and the  question is will she let him or her live  or die?  If the gentleman wants to talk about  fraud, interestingly enough, he omits  Wedtech. There is a litany of fraud. I  do not want to polarize this Chamber,  but the gentleman is very selective in  his speaking of fraud. He is dismayed  by a veto. The gentleman  is unac quainted with principle, evidently, be cause the President would have found  it the easiest thing to sign that bill.  The President is committed to saving  the babies of poor women. The gentle man  says  ""poor women""  trippingly  from the tongue, but he forgets there  are children involved too. It is the chil dren of the poor that deserve  to be  saved. The children of  the rich are  lost. If a wealthy woman wants to kill,  to exterminate her unborn child, that  is too bad. We cannot save that child  yet. But the poor, their children are  salvagable, and we, the party you lib erals call the economic royalists, the  malefactors  of  great wealth,  care  about the children of  the poor. We  care about them. The liberals who are  supposed to defend the powerless, why  the most powerless in the world is an  unborn child whose mother finds that  child  inconvenient, unwanted,  to be  exterminated. Why  is  their defense  left to us and abandoned by you liber als?  Report to a cop? Well, I should not  be surprised by that choice of words.  Police officers who risk their lives so  citizens can get to their car at night  and get home. ""Report to a cop,"" well,  I think Members would want to catch  the rapist. I should think the brutal  crime  about which  the  gentleman  waxed  lyrically, would  lead him  to  want to catch the rapist. The sooner  we report it to the police, the sooner  we get the rapist. Or does that not fit  into the gentleman's scenario?  We should not impose on people, be cause there is no amendment going to  be offered. We have heard this issue  again and again. I am simply respond ing to my friend, the gentleman from  Oregon. However, I suggest to the gen tleman, unborn children have got to  be considered. We can describe rape in  all of its horrible details, and I agree  with Members, and I want the victiw  protected as much as possible. Howev er, a second destruction does not solve  anything, but kill an innocent human  life.  Your moral imagination, your com passion, your defense of the powerless  ought  to be big enough and strong  enough to reach the little, tiny inno cent child in the womb. But of course,  some Members deny  that  is human  life. Members say that is a randomly  multiplying bunch of cells.  It is  a  tumor to be extricated, like abcessed  tonsils, a bad tooth. But it is a child. It  is  an unborn  child.  It  is  a  little  member of the human family. That is  what we are def ending. That is what  the President is defending. Do not call  the  President  unprincipled.  He  is  doing a very difficult thing for princi ple.  ",1989
1866,1164,20,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, since I have been a  Member of the Congress, I have had  the pleasure and the opportunity to  serve with eight Presidents. I have en joyed serving with all eight of them. I  say to the chairman and to the Mem bers of the House that I personally  like President Bush.  I am hoping, Mr. Chairman,  that  when this bill is passed in the House  and it goes over on the other side, that  we will bring back a bill that can be ac cepted. We will send it down  to the  White House and it will be signed.  I have had the opportunity and the  pleasure of serving on the subcommit tee and on the full Committee on Ap propriations  for a number of years  with my friend, the distinguished gen tleman  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.  CONTE].

Mr.  Chairman, as Members well know, in  this bill we have the money for the  Summer Youth Program. We have the  Job Corps. The feeding program for  the elderly. We have all the programs  concerning elementary and secondary  education and higher education. We  have  the  National  Institutes  of  Health, over $7 billion.

Every year there are just tremen dous problems accompanying the allo cation of those funds, and I just have  not  seen  the process  ever work as  smoothly as it did this time.

1897,1216,20,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the conference report on  the State Department authorization.  I understand that the one remaining  controversial issue in this conference  report, the so-called Moynihan amend ment,  is  in the process of being re solved. This will allow all Members, as  well as the administration, to support  strongly this legislation.  Before describing  the major provi sions  of  this  conference  report,  I  would like to express my gratitude to  the chairman and ranking Republican  of the full committee, Mr. FASCELL and  Mr. BROOMFIELD, as well as the chair man of the Subcommittee on Interna tional Operations, ",1989
1898,1216,20,Mr. DYMALLY.,"  While the Democrats and Republi cans have not always agreed on every  issue  relating  to  this  legislation,  in stances of disagreement  have been  rare and we have tried to work them  out in a spirit of cooperation. This is  the third time I have served as Repub lican manager of  the State Depart ment authorization bill, and Republi cans and Democrats have consistently  worked together in bipartisan coopera tion.  First and foremost, this conference  report is fiscally responsible. This was  a major priority of mine throughout  the entire authorization process. This  conference report holds the budget of  the foreign affairs agencies at or below  current services.  There are only two notable excep tions where authorizations exceed cur rent services. The first is full funding  for the United Nations, which was re quested  by  both  former  President  Reagan and President Bush. In past  years  the  Congress  has  restricted  funding for the United Nations until  the United Nations adopted substan tive reforms in its budget process.  Now  that the United Nations has  adopted and  implemented  those  re forms, the United States has no obli gations to provide our full contribu tion in accordance with our treaty ob ligations.  The second area is in the one time  increase to construct the joint Voice of  America/Board  for  International  Broadcasting  transmitter  in  Israel.  This will allow the radios to broadcast  for the first time into the fast-growing  areas of Soviet Central Asia.  Overall,  the conference report au thorizes $4. 7 billion for the budgets of  the  State Department, USIA, . the  United  Nations,  and  Radio  Free  Europe and Radio Liberty. This level,  only $45 million above the fiscal year  1990 appropriation, conforms  to  the  bipartisan  budget  agreement,  and  holds to the levels contained in the  Senate and House bills.  This bill contains important legisla tive  initiatives as well.  It prohibits  United States negotiation with PLO  members who have been involved in  past terrorist acts against Americans,  and  imposes  economic  sanctions on  China. The two bodies passed nearly  identical China sanctions provisions,  and  the  conference  adopted  the  Senate version to ensure presidential  support.  It also establishes the TV Marti Pro gram to broadcast uncensored news to  Cuba. Last year, during the 30th anni versary of the Communist revolution  in Cuba, Castro announced, ""Glasnost  has no place in Cuba."" To emphasize  the  point, Castro  recently  banned  Soviet newspapers from Cuba, accus ing them of advocating Western cap italism.  TV Marti will  bring  the  visual  impact of such events as the opening  of the Berlin Wall and free elections  in Hungary to the people of Cuba. It  will make it more difficult for Castro  to continue to swim against the tide of  dramatic  changes  elsewhere  in  the  Communist world.  In another important action, House  conferees for the first time succeeded  in eliminating virtually all of the Sen ate's extraneous, nongermane amend ments. We took this action while de f ending virtually all of the provisions  contained in the House bill.  In  recent  years,  the Senate had  begun weighting down this bill to such  an extent as to tum it into an alter nate foreign aid bill because of their  unwillingness for the past 5 years to  bring up their foreign aid bill for con sideration. In one motion, the confer ence removed more than 60 extrane ous Senate provisions while def ending  virtually all House provisions.  For all these reasons, I urge my col leagues support passage of the confer ence report.  D 1800  In addition, Mr. Speaker, all but two  of  the House amendments were  re tained  in  this conference  report as  well, and I think, given the fact that  the Senate had more than 60 unrelat ed, nongermane issues to this legisla tion, we were able  to extract  those  amendment in the conference report.  So, I am pleased that we are able to  reach this point with this legislation  because I think it represents the will  of this House and all of the Members.  ",1989

1902,1229,20,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker,  later  this week, the House will take up the  conference report on budget reconcili ation. While  I  cannot speak  for or  against the report as a whole, there is  a portion of  it  that,  in its current  form, will destroy a vital and neces sary segment of the higher education  community.  Within  the  budget  reconciliation  conference report,  there is a section  that purports to save almost $40 mil lion in budget outlays for fiscal year  1990, but which  really  is  a  thinly  veiled attempt  to reduce access and  choice for young people who want to  attend career training schools rather  than more traditional academic 2-and  4-year education programs by making  it more difficult for them to get stu dent aid.  The subconference committee deal ing with that issue is on the verge of  offering a  laundry list of items that  are less directed toward those savings  as required by the Budget Committee  than they are at radically changing  current policies on student aid.  I have attached the full list of items  with the potential savings of each, as  calculated  by  the  Congressional  Budget Office. As you can see, overall,  there is little to commend them as sav ings. Some do make sense as manage ment tools to improve the flow of dol lars to students and schools while pro viding better controls over those dol lars, but three items are out-and-out  threats to the futures of thousands of  ",1989

Mr. President, I am pleased to lay  before  the  Senate  the  conference  report on H.R. 2461, the National De fense Authorization Act  for  fiscal  years 1990 and 1991.  This  conference  report authorizes  programs for the Department of De fense, the national security programs  of the Department of Energy, and the  civil defense functions for fiscal years  1990 and 1991.  The conferees of  the House  and  Senate have worked very hard for the  last 8 weeks to resolve the hundreds of  funding and major policy differences  between  the Senate and House ver sions of this bill.  It was in a spirit of compromise and  cooperation between  the House and  Senate conferees, as well as the Secre tary of Defense, Dick Cheney, and his  deputy, Don Atwood, which allowed  the conference to complete its work at  this stage.  I want  to  thank Chairman AsPIN  and Congressman DICKINSON for their  leadership  in  this conference.  I also  want  to  thank my  friend  and col league, Senator WARNER,  the ranking  member of our committee,  for  his  splendid  leadership, his cooperation,  his support, and his superb efforts in  this bill from the very beginning of  this year through this date.  Without that kind of cooperation,  without  the kind of cooperation we  have had between his staff and the  staff on the majority side, we would  not be here today with this report. I  thank him for that continued superb  leadership.  Mr. President, I want to thank every  member of the committee, particularly  the chairman and the ranking mem bers, for all  their work  this year.  I  want to take a few moments to high light some of the major features of  the  conference  report  for  our  col leagues.  The  conference  bill  authorizes  $305.5 billion in budget authority and  $299.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year  1990, which fully funds the adminis tration's amended budget request.  I think it should be said here that a  good bit of this money is not going to  defense; however, it is going to other  causes  that have very high priority  that have been agreed  to,  including  several hundred million dollars  for  drugs  and $140 million  for  aid  to  Poland. All of these total a little over  $2 billion.  In addition, the bill meets both the  budget authority and outlay  targets  ",1989

1912,1281,20,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I  thank  my distinguished colleague, the Sena tor from Oregon.  I commend my good friend, the Sen ator from Colorado, for his eloquent  statement. I,  too, came over here to  speak about the absolute unfairness of  the current system of taxing phantom  gains as regular income.  The proposal before us today has a  very modest relief from this phantom  tax by providing a 5-percent reduction  for up to 7 years in the gain to com pensate for inflation.  People of modest means in my State  are very upset. They are outraged that  they now have to pay a tax on gains  they never realized.  The Senator from Colorado gave a  good example.  Let me give you a simpler example.  A $100  investment held for 2 years.  Say over 2 years  that  inflation has  now put a marketplace value of $110  on it. Under the current system the  holder of that asset, if he or she turns  around and sells it, would be taxed at  an income tax rate perhaps as high as  33 percent on that $10 of gain. This re duction in the gain only reduces 10  percent of that $10. So they would still  have to pay a tax on the $8 of phan tom gain. But at least it is better than  paying tax on the full $10.  In many instances this will not even  compensate  for  the  losses  that  the  phantom gains of inflation  taxes as  income will generate.  I have had small farmers, husbands  and wives, who want to retire and sell  their farm who have told me if they  sell it for twice what they paid for it  they will be getting  less  in actual  spending money,  less  in actual pur chasing power than they put in.  And yet  they have  to pay  taxes,  higher in some instances than the tax,  the marginal  tax,  that multimillion29-059 0-90-41 (Pt. 20)    I  President,  aires who buy junk bonds have to pay  on their income. It is not fair.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues,  in the interest of fairness, to recognize  that when inflation devalues our cur rency, it artificially inflates the value  of property, and unless we do some thing  to  recognize  that  inflationary  gain or element, we will be imposing  an unfair tax.  I thank my colleague. I urge my col leagues to support the motion for cloture.  I yield the floor.  ",1989

1914,1281,20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.  ,1989
1915,1281,20,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, this is  an interesting proposal and I have lis tened to the debate with a great deal  of interest.  I hear my distinguished friend from  Colorado talking about illusory prof its, and inflationary gain. Absolutely. I  could not agree with him more on  that. I am one of those who fought  long and hard . to  lower  the capital  gains tax. I thought it was something  we should do to have more mobility of  capital.  But the problem you run into is that  in 1986  the Reagan  administration  said that we ought to bring the top  rate down. And we brought it down to  the  lowest  top  rate of  any major  nation  in  the world. We brought  it  down to 28 percent.  Can you imagine a person of wealth  thinking 10 years ago that they would  ever have a top rate of 28 percent in  this country? Incredible. But that is  what we have. And that is the kind of  a deal we struck.  The argument was that if we would  bring that top rate down-it had been  70, then 50 percent-we would pay for  it by increasing the capital gains rate  to 28 percent. The administration con tended that if we did that, we would  pick up $22 billion over 5 years. That  is  the plan we designed  to pay for  bringing the ordinary income tax rates  down. That was our deal.. But now we  are talking going the other way.  Let's look at how they pay for their  proposal. I admire the creativity of my  friends. They have proposed a back ended IRA. Under this proposal you  could  shift  existing  savings  into  a  back-ended IRA. You could pay the  tax on this transfer over 4 years. Four  years-how  convenient. That's  just  long enough to pay for capital gains  over the budget period. Very creative.  But after 5 years, the bottom falls  out. You are looking at instant gratifi cation here.  ""Now-nowism,'' as Mr.  Darman says.  When the Secretary of the Treasury  testified before us we asked him about  the back-loaded IRA's. He said, ""It is  simply passing it on to the next gen eration."" That  is where  the cost  is  ",1989

1917,1294,20,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, we  are  duplicating  each  other's work,  there is no question about that. The  problem with this conference report is  it goes into detail with details, getting  down to individual line items instead  of accounts, getting into budget details  that normally have been the mission  of the Appropriations Committee.  What it means is if we perform our  mission, part of it cannot be accom plished because of the constraints con tained in this authorization bill.  We have tried to pledge our efforts  to settle the differences between the  two committees  in each House  that  handled  defense  affairs,  and God  knows, I have been part of those diffi culties. But it is because we feel, those  of us who handle the accounts, feel  we,  too, understand the systems and  particularly understand the complica tions of trying to finance one as op posed to another.  I hope that the Senators from Geor gia and Virginia and their colleagues  on the Armed Services Committee will  dedicate  themselves  to  compliance  next year with this new found feeling  of cooperation you will find is repre sented by the appropriations bill as we  bring it out.  The unfortunate part of it, again, I  call to the attention of the Senate, is  the fact there is no way to disagree  with this report. Many of the things  that are before the Senate right now  were not before  the Senate  in  the  Senate bill. They were in the House  bill. The House bill was stripped out.  We put in the Senate bill in the au thorization process.  Now we  find  that we  are dealing  with systems and an array of priorities  that were not  the priorities of  the  Senate. Those of us on the Senate Ap propriations Committee  attempt  to  live up  to  those priorities as we go  through  the  appropriation  process.  Now we  are  frustrated as we come  back and we find we cannot have any  impact on the total functioning of the  systems. There are some that I  feel  very strongly about.  For instance. I made that statement  rationally at  the beginning of  the  process I would not vote for a bill that  did not authorize the initiation of pro curement in the V-22.  I still believe  that is one of the most revolutionary  systems we ever found.  It is new technology. We ought to be  pursuing it with a vengeance. Instead,  we are putting .a cap on it. The cap is  on R&D. We cannot exceed that cap  because of provisions in this bill, al though we could have fund money in  this last minute we could have used.  We  used  that  for  unauthorized  projects the committee is going to find  fault with along the line. The reason  we did, the authorized project had the  cap on it and we could not put the  money where it should have been this  year. That system should change.  I thank the ranking member for his  time.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem pore. Who yields time?  ",1989

Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  I  thank the distinguished Senator from  Wyoming.  Mr. President,  there are a  lot of  things I could speak to in this bill, but  I choose in this short time to speak  specifically about science and technol ogy transfer.  Let me acquaint the Senate with a  few facts that I think are rather star tling. If one were to ask what organi zation or institution in the free world  has  the most  scientists,  engineers,  physicists, and supporting personnel  under their jurisdiction, I do not think  very many Senators, and certainly not  very many Americans, would get the  right answer. The answer is the De partment of Energy.  About 23,000  scientists, physicists,  engineers, and supporting personnel  make  up  the  national  laboratory  system that is under the jurisdiction  of the Department of Energy.  Of those, three of their biggest lab oratories are so-called nuclear deter rent  laboratories;  Sandia National  Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM; Los  Alamos in New Mexico; and Lawrence  Livermore in California. Each of those  laboratories and the others within the  ",1989
1919,1307,20,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. President, I would  like  to  commend  the distinguished  chairman of the Senate Armed Serv ices Committee, SAM NUNN, and the  ranking Republican member,  JOHN  WARNER, for their hard work and dedi cation  in  bringing  this  conference  report before the Senate. The confer ence was  long and arduous, and the  committee leaders pulled us through it  with their customary skill and grace.  This legislation represents the first  defense budget of the 1990's-a decade  which, in my view, will be shaped by  fundamental changes in international  relations and budget politics in Amer ica. We are already seeing these trends  emerge  in 1989. We debate  this de fense legislation on the very day on  which Lech Walesa addressed a  joint  session  of  Congress.  The  defense  budget contained in this report is sub ject to a Gramm-Rudman-Hollings se quester of as much as $8 billion  in  budget authority.  As evidenced by the recent and ex traordinary  events  in Berlin,  it  is  abundantly clear that we are  living  through  a  remarkable  period  of  change. The most poignant image of  this change could be seen in the faces  of East and West Germans celebrating  the effective fall of the Berlin Wall,  the defining symbol of post-war East West conflict.  Beyond the drama in Berlin, Hunga ry rejects  the nomenclature of com munism, and Poland elects a demo cratic  non-Communist  government.  Change is underway in Bulgaria and  Czechoslovakia. Members of the newly  elected Supreme Soviet visit Kansas,  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff meets with his counterpart in  the Soviet Union. Modem nuclear  weapons are being burned and crushed  under the terms of the INF Treaty  and Soviet tank regiments are unilat erally being withdrawn from Eastern  Europe. History is being made at an  exhilarating pace.  A change in the politics of the Ger manies goes right to the heart of the  postwar order  in Europe and  raises  fundamental  questions  about  the  future of the two military alliances. As  political  revolution  sweeps Eastern  Europe and as the cold war levels of  confrontation are drawn down, a new  European system will inevitably evolve  to replace the old security order. The  shape of that order, be it defined by  the  ""common European  house,""  a  ""Europe whole and free,"" or another  metaphor, has been moved to centerAs  stage as a result of the recent drama tic events in Germany.  Certainly a Germany that is coming  together cannot do so under NATO this would be unacceptable from the  Soviet perspective. If Germany were  to opt out of NATO, a central purpose  and focus of the alliance would disap pear. What is the meaning of ""forward  defense"" when  the  face of Europe  changes to reflect a democratic Poland  and open trade and flow of people be tween East and West Germany? A new  order will emerge, and we had better  get prepared for it. The impact of such  changes on American defense plan ning, policy,  and budgeting will be  enormous.  these  remarkable  changes  in  global politics take place, we in Amer ica are facing a very serious budget  crisis which will continue to impact de fense planning. The recent Gramm Rudman-Hollings  budget  sequester  would slash th~ fiscal year 1990 de fense budget baseline by approximate ly $8 billion. According to the Penta gon, this would result in a manpower  cut of 170,000; the Army slice of that  cut would be  three division equiva lents. This  sequester  comes  several  months after the Comptroller General  of  the United States, Mr. Bowsher,  told the Senate Armed Services Com mittee that the Cheney 5-year defense  plan will likely have to be cut by $150  billion. If the East-West political cli mate continues to improve, these dire  budget predictions may well prove to  be benign.  Barring an unforeseen  turnaround  in global politics,  the American de fense budget will continue to decline,  in my view. The issue is whether we  can responsibly manage that decline  through  a  negotiated multilateral  framework-or whether defense cuts  will come willy-nilly through annual,  incremental, unilateral actions by our selves and our NATO allies. Perhaps  arms control cannot step up to  this  challenge, perhaps we will experience  ""apes on the treadmill"" running in re verse. A more rational course, howev er, would be to seek mutual and con trolled reduction of defense efforts on  both sides.  A clear objective of the Soviet Union  in Vienna is to reduce the burden of  defense  expenditures on  the Soviet  economy. We should view Vienna simi larly. The CFE negotiations can play a  significant role in reducing defense ex penditures, but cost savings as an arms  control objective have been derided by  the defense community traditionally. I  do not think that will continue to be  the case as we make further real cuts  in the defense budget. We are now in  the  fifth  consecutive  year  of  real  annual decreases in defense spending.  It  is  virtually  inevitable  that  that  trend will continue. It is time that the  strategic community  join the dismal  world of budgeters.  It is certainly true that East-West  arms control historically has not yield ed cost savings. But since the dawn of  the Cold War, the strategic communi ty has not sought a reduction of the  defense burden as an explicit goal of  arms control, focusing instead on the  goal of military stability-reducing the  risk of war. The barren MBFR talks  consumed 15 years without agreement.  SALT  placed  ceilings  on  strategic  launchers  in  the  context  of ABM  Treaty  constraints on  strategic de fenses.  Today, for the first time since demo bilization after the Second World War,  we  have an opportunity  to achieve  sharp force  reductions. The START  talks seek cuts of 30 to 50 percent of  strategic nuclear weapons, depending  on whether you use truth-in-account ing for the bomber-delivered weapons.  The CFE  negotiations will  reduce  Soviet forces well below the deep cuts  outlined by Mr. Gorbachev at  the  United Nations  last year  and now  being  implemented,  while  NATO  forces will be cut to 10 to 15 percent  below current levels in the agreed cat egories.  Will the relatively modest Western  cuts foreseen in the NATO proposal  yield  savings? An  editorial  in  last  week's  Economist  suggested  that  ""though the Soviet Union will save a  lot  from  an arms-cutting deal,  the  West will get virtually no 'peace divi dend' at all."" This would certainly  have been true before President Bush  last May successfully proposed  that  the Western position at Vienna  in clude  a  cap of 275,000  for United  States  and Soviet  air  and  ground  forces deployed in Central Europe.  Under  this  proposal,  the United  States would withdraw and presum ably  disband  approximately  30,000  troops from Western Europe. A recent  Congressional Budget Office  study  found  that  this proposal,  if  imple mented, would save about $2.1 billion  annually  in manpower and  training  costs and several hundred million per  year in acquisition savings. Even after  discounting  the additional costs  for  monitoring compliance with  a CFE  accord (INF costs about $150 million  annually), the current Western draft  treaty would save the United States  about  $2  billion  annually-""real  money""  even  by Senator Dirksen's  standards, but still only a fraction of  the reductions in annual defense ex penditures we  are  likely  to experi enced in the years ahead.  President Bush was  right  to urge  manpower cuts  in the Vienna  talks.  But we need to go further. Defense  budgets consist of three major catego ries: manpower; equipment; and train ing. The largest single account is man power, and it is here that significant  savings can most effectively be real ized. By cutting military manpower,  ",1989

Let me make it clear, Mr. President,  that my objection has nothing to do  with  the abortion  issue  that caused  this bill to be vetoed by the President.  My position has consistently been that  I support Federal funding of abortion  in case of rape, incest, or when the life  of the mother is in danger.  . I am continuing to oppose this bill  because I think we need to send the  government of the District of Colum bia a message-they must do better to  provide basic services to their citizens.  It is inconceivable the amount of time  one must spend in lines simply to reg ister their vehicle or obtain a driver's  license. As a farmer secretary of state  in Illinois, I can attest that we are able  to provide our citizens with both of  these  basic  services  in  a  prompt,  timely manner. There  is no  reason  that this city cannot do the same.  I sometimes wonder what the Dis trict government's priorities are. At a  time when many basic services are de teriorating, the District is using scarce  Federal  funds  to nearly double  the  budget of the Office of Cable Televi sion.

This was a difficult conference and  the chairman and the ranking member  of the subcommittee, Senators LEAHY  and KASTEN, are to be congratulated  for their final product. I would also  like to thank their staffs for the hard  work they have put into this achieve ment. In particular, Eric Newsom and  Jim Bond have put in long hours to  help us fashion a constructive compro mise with our colleagues in the House.  The report before us today meets the  country's foreign policy and security  interests, while avoiding budget-bust ing spending levels that would add to  the problems of the deficit.  The compromise. legislation provides  spending of $14.6 billion for the cur rent fiscal year. Frankly, I would have  pref erred to see a lower level of spend ing on foreign aid this year. A lower  level would have been consistent with  the cuts we have had to make in re sources available for many impor.tant  domestic programs. Still, we were able  to trim the initial administration re quest of nearly $15.2 billion, and come  in below the total budget ceiling for  the foreign aid program. In meeting  these  stringent budget  ceilings, we  managed to provide for a new, high  priority assistance program for Poland  and Hungary, at funding  levels well  above the President Bush's timid ini tial proposal.  In appropriating money for foreign  aid programs, it is also important to  ensure that the taxpayer's dollars are  spent wisely and in a manner that en sures the greatest contribution to our  foreign policy, security interests, and  humanitarian concerns. I believe that  the compromise now before us meets  that test.  One of the most significant events of  the post war period is the assumption  of power of a Solidarity-led govern ment in Poland.

1941,1359,20,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, in the last  5 years, apartheid in South Africa has  become one of the major issues on the  American  foreign  policy  agenda.  During this time, the American people  and Congress have not only become  more educated about  the  injustices  and inhumanity of apartheid, but also  better acquainted with  those South  Africans-black and white-who have  fought courageously and persistently  to bring apartheid to an end. One of  these is the Honorable Helen Suzman,  a member of the opposition Progres sive Federal Party who  recently  re tired after 36 years in Parliament.  Mrs. Suzman is well known here and  in South Africa for her steadfast oppo sition to apartheid and her deep per sonal commitment to freedom and jus tice for all South Africans, regardless  of race. During the course of her long  and distinguished  career  in Parlia ment, Mrs. Suzman consistently spoke  out against the apartheid policies and  the repressive actions of the ruling Na tional Party and  its  leaders. Often,  hers was a sole voice. Now retired from  Parliament, she continues to speak out  forcefully,  at  home  and  abroad,  against apartheid and  in favor of a  nonracial, democratic South Africa in  which all South Africans can exercise  basic  fundamental  freedoms  and  human rights.  Last month, during a visit to Wash ington, Mrs. Suzman did an interview  with  the  ""MacNeil/Lehrer  News Hour."" In the course of this interview,  she offered some very interesting in sights into the present South African  situation and particularly the new ad ministration of President de Klerk.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the interview be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the inter view was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MACNEIL: One woman who has spent her  life fighting for a dialogue is Helen Suzman.  As leader of the Liberal Party for more than  30 years, she was often the only voice  in  Parliament speaking out against apartheid.  But she's been criticized recently by some  people in the anti-apartheid movement for  her opposition  to sanctions. Mrs. Suzman  retired from Parliament this year at the age  of 71.  I spoke with her on Friday in New York.  Mrs. Suzman, thank you for joining us.  How important do you think how signficant are the changes President De Klerk  has instituted so far?  HELEN SUZMAN: Well, I think they're quite  significant,  in that I  think they mean to  show a real change of direction, away from  police toughness to an understanding that  people want to protest and protest peaceful ly, particularly if they. don't have the vote.  The important thing, too, is that he has al lowed  the  Johannesburg  City  Council,  which is National Party-controlled, to deseg regate all public  facilities.  I'm sure  they  couldn't have done that without asking his  permission.  And then, too, he has signified that he's  prepared to speak to the leaders that the  people themselves have chosen, rather than  the leaders that have been elected through  the system. And I think, therefore, his talks  with Archbishop Tutu and  the Reverend  Chikane and the Reverend Boesak are quite  significant, as well.  MAcNEIL. Do you regard these as sort of  tactical maneuvers, or as demonstrating the  first steps in a real change of strategy and  direction?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, I think he's trying to  win confidence. He's trying to win the confi dence of black people in South Africa who  feel they have been frustrated, they have  been ignored in the party political and parliamentary political system. And that's one  thing he's trying to do, is to create a climate  for negotiation.  I think the fact that he's released Walter  Sisulu and several other leading African Na tional Congress people who were sentenced  to imprisonment together with Nelson Man dela, I think that's important as well.  MACNEIL. Why not Mandela at this stage?  What do you read into that?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, I would think the re lease of Walter Sisulu and the others is a  tryout to see just what the result will be,  what the effect will be, what the reaction  will be among  the mass of  the people.  There's a very large Mass Democratic Move ment  in South Africa, and I've no doubt  that they will organize huge rallies to wel come the people who've been released, and   no doubt they want to see if they can con trol that, that there'll be no violence. Be cause Nelson Mandela is, of course, the folk  hero who will, I'm sure, result in much more  of a public demonstration even then Walter  Sisulu and the other members of the ANC.  MACNEIL. Some observers of the South Af rican scene are suggesting that De Klerk  may be making some of these moves now in  order to head off the pressure for tougher  sanctions against South Africa which some  countries want to raise at the British Com monwealth  Prime Ministers meeting  in  Kuala Lumpur later this month.  Do you believe that it is-that he is-that  De Klerk is doing that?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, I think he probably re alizes that Mrs. Thatcher, who's been a lone  voice against sanctions at Commonwealth  conferences, needed something to take with  her to Kuala Lumpur when she goes later  this month. And this is probably something  that he is at least providing. It's not enor mously significant, but it certainly, as I say,  shows a change of direction. And it is some thing which Mrs. Thatcher can say, ""Look, this man is different. It's a new policy a new  direction. Give him a chance. Let's wait and  see. Let's not impose further sanctions.""  MACNEIL. You have, for all your years in  Parliament, been an opponent of apartheid,  the system of segregating the races. Do you  believe this new man, De Klerk, is serious  about dismantling it?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, he  is a Nationalist.  He's a politician. He's a pragmatist. He's not  a starry-eyed liberal, as some people have  called me. But he, I think, realizes change  has got to come. I think he also, however,  has got his own particular bottom line, and  he does represent a party which is intent on  maintaining group identity.  So, I don't think he's going to go as far as  my party, for instance, would like him to go,  or as far as the Mass Democratic Movement  would like him to go. But he's going to go  further than his predecessor, and he's going  to try and create a climate for negotiation.  MACNEIL. So, when he says that he wants  to create a new constitutional democracy in  which no race can dominate the other,. that  is still qualified by having each separate  group governing  itself separately, but the  whites fundamentally governing the coun try. Is that ...  Mrs. SUZMAN: Well, I think he will stick to  the present system, whereby there are sepa rate group identities protected by law, by  the separate voters rolls; and probably some  different constitutional mechanism, where by he can see that the three groups that are  not white are not able to vote together in  order to out-vote the wishes of the white  minority.

1955,1411,20,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  ask that an article from the Baltimore  Sun, November 1, 1989, be included in  the RECORD.  This article deals with a problem we  have long struggled with in the Con gress-quality day care  for our Na tion's children. We are not attracting  and retaining the people we need in  the field  to take proper care of our  kids, and this article discusses the rea sons why. I urge my colleagues to join  me in thinking long and hard about  the issues raised in this piece.  The article follows:  THEY CAN'T AFFORD To CARE  <By Abby Karp)  Once upon a time, Richetta Fields had vi sions of becoming a school teacher. So after  she graduated from high school, she studied  early childhood education at the Communi ty College of Baltimore. A few months later,  she took a job caring for other people's chil dren at the Midtown Children's Center.  Her starting pay as a day-care aide was  $3.75 an hour. Two and a half years later,  she'd gotten a raise-10 cents more an hour.  She had no health insurance for herself or  her 5-month-old son. She had no car. And,  she figured out, when her son turned 2, she  wouldn't be able to afford to place him in  the day-care center at St. Paul Street and  North Avenue where she worked.  Yesterday the 21-year-old said goodbye to  her class of 2and 3-year-olds. Today she  begins a new job, photographing children at  a Sears portrait studio. Although she knows  nothing about taking pictures, her starting  pay is $5.50 an hour. She will have health  insurance, life insurance, paid leave.  Much as she loves working with children,  Ms. Fields has no plans to return to a pro fession where Play-Doh's a given but real  dough's rarely found.  ""I had to leave,"" she says, after living as a  single parent on $500 a month. ""I said, 'it's  time to find a job with more money.'""  Like Ms. Fields, four out of 10 day-care  workers abandoned the profession last year,  mostly because of low salaries. The paltry  pay extends up  the day-care  ladder: Ms.  Fields' boss, director Carolyn Iwata, makes  only $13,000, 17 years after she began work ing at the non-profit center.  Kathy Chapman, director of Red Balloon  Day Care Center in Waverly, still lives at  home with her parents.  ""I've never felt I could live someplace nice  on my own,"" says Ms. Chapman, 31, who  has worked  in day-care  since graduating  third in her class from Coppin State Univer  sity in 1981.  Low pay leads to turnover in day-care cen ters and that, in turn, diminishes the qual  ity of care and education children receive,  according to a national study of such cen ters released last month.  Children in centers with frequent turnov er are slower to develop language and social  skills  than  those  in more stable environ ments,  the National Child Care Staffing  Study found. Researcher Carollee Howes,  an education professor at University of Cali fornia  in Los Angeles,  said. ""Children  in  America are L'l jeopardy because their child care teachers are poorly paid.""  Most day-care workers find it easy to im prove on their pay-a national average of  $5.35 an hour-when they leave, becoming  public school teachers, store clerks, recep tionists, real estate agents.  Ironically,  the job so many leave is the  only one they love.  They bristle at comparisons with baby sit ters,  likening  their work  to  teaching and  parenting. More  than half have  studied  early childhood education or development  and one in five has a bachelor's degree, ac cording to the national study.  What they like best, day-care workers say,  is the informality, the lack of bureaucracy,  the feeling of making a difference, the read ily offered affection.  ""What other job do you go to where some one says every day, 'I love you,'"" asks Mary  Dickson, a teacher of 2-year olds at Down town Baltimore Children's Center.  ""You  feel very special to be here.""  The center's director tries to retain staff  like Ms. Dickson by paying far more than  the national average, as much as $20,000 to  senior teachers with bachelor's degrees.  ""I can't stand to see people with four-year  degrees having to go out and waitress at  night to make car payments. That really  burns people out very quickly,"" says the di rector, Nancy L. Kramer. ""I hate to think  this is a field where someone can work a few  years and then she has to go out and get a  'real' job.""  Yet, she adds, ""I just don't know the solu tion to it all: You get so caught between the  needs of the parents and the needs of the  staff.""  The only route to change, daycare opera tors agree, is for governments and employ ers to begin contributing to the day care's  tuition costs, which average $317 a month in  Maryland.  ""I'm confronted over and over with people  saying, 'Can't you do [day carel cheaper?'""  says Anita Prentice, president of the DBCC  board of directors. ""Early childhood educa  tion hasn't been understood as a separate  profession because a lot of women do it for  free as mothers.""  Ms. Prentice hopes  the  federal govern ment may soon put more money in child  care. The House of Representatives recently  approved a $22. 7 billion child-care package,  which includes income tax credits for poor  families and subsidies for those who provide  day care to children of lowor moderate income families. House and Senate members  are meeting to match efforts.  ""So far, the cost of day care is being paid  by  parents  and  by  staff  accepting  low  wages,"" agrees Barbara Willer, public affairs  director for the National Association for the  Education of Young Children, an advocacy  group for educators. ""We've got to under stand that good early education benefits all  society, and the cost should be shared by all  aspects of society.''  Day-care directors see an urgent need for  government and private-sector intervention:  Not only is it becoming harder to hire quali fied staff, but they see children in day care  suffering because of the high teacher turn",1989
1956,1424,20,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, this  legislation initiates a major new public  and private effort to conserve North  American wetlands and waterfowl and  the other migratory birds and fish and  wildlife that depend on these habitats.  The wetlands of this continent are  libraries of nature which contain vol umes of priceless genetic information.  They are North America's most bio logically productive areas, and roughly  a third of the continent's endangered  species of animals are dependent on  them.  And like the tropical forests of Cen tral and South America,  they have  been subjected to much destruction.  From 1955 to 1975, 9 million acres of  wetlands in the 48 contiguous States  were drained, filled, and cleared. Less  than half of the original 200 million  acres remain, and the destruction con tinues today at a rate of half a million  acres per year-an area 12  times the  size of the District of Columbia.  Total wetlands loss in the Canadian  prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatch ewan, and Manitoba is estimated to be  40 percent of  the original wetlands  acreage.  The  destruction  of wetlands  in  North America, where many migrato ry bird species breed, spells disaster  for these species just as surely as the  destruction of forests in Central and  tropical South America, where  they  winter.  The average number of North Amer ican ducks  in recent years has been  lower than any comparable period on  record.  There have been fewer black ducks,  a species prized by people  in Maine  and elsewhere in the Eastern United  States and Canada, than at any time  during the previous three decades.  Of the 30 species of migratory non game birds that are currently of man agement concern to the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service because of their un certain status, nearly one half are de pendent upon coastal and freshwater  wetlands.  Thirteen of some of our most abun dant and widespread songbirds,  like  the American goldfinch and the east ern meadowlark, have declined at an  average rate of nearly 3 percent per  year over the past 20 years.  Wetlands provide essential and sig nificant habitat for fish, shellfish, and  other wildlife of commercial,  recre ational, scientific, and aesthetic value.  Wetlands provide substantial flood  and storm control values and can obvi ate the need for expensive man-made  control measures. They make a signifi cant contribution to water quality by  recharging ground water, filtering sur face runoff, and treating waste, and  they provide natural areas important  for  recreational  and  aesthetic  pur poses.  In 1936, at a time of severe crisis in  the Nation's natural  resources,  the  great  conservationist Ding Darling  bluntly warned  that  ""whatever we  may have been doing  is not wildlife  conservation,  since we  continue  to  have less instead of more.""  Unfortunately,  the same could be  said today with respect to the job we  have been doing in conserving the con tinent's wetlands and migratory birds.  We have got to do better.  Enactment of the North American  Wetlands Conservation Act will help  us reverse this steady downward trend  in wetlands area and migratory bird  numbers.  The legislation encourages partner ships among public agencies and pri vate interests to protect, enhance, re store, and manage wetlands  ecosys tems and other habitats for migratory  birds and other fish and wildlife  in  North America and to maintain or in crease migratory bird populations con sistent with  the goals of the North  American waterfowl management plan  and  the  international obligations of  the migratory bird treaties and other  agreements with Canada, Mexico, and  other countries.  One of the principal goals of this  legislation will be to begin a long-term  commitment to work with Canada and  Mexico  in  implementation  of  the  North American waterfowl manage ment plan.  According to the U.S. Secretary of  the Interior and the Canadian Minis ter of the Environment,  the plan is  ""the best opportunity we will  ever  have"" to halt the decline of many spe cies of ducks, geese, and other migra tory birds.  The goal, which it is hoped will be  achieved within 15 years, is to restore  the continent's waterfowl not to the  numbers that existed in the 1950's but  only to the lower levels of a decade  ago.  The extent of habitat destruction  has been so great that even achieving  this modest target will require an un precedented  cooperative  strategy  to  conserve nearly 2 million acres of wet land ecosystems in the United States  and almost 4 million acres of  these  habitats in Canada.  The key to the success of this under standing will be the participation not  only of the national governments of  our countries, but also  the  involve ment of State, provincial,  territorial,  and local governments, and private in dividuals, conservation organizations,  and businesses.  The North American wetlands Con servation Act will  provide  Federal  funding to encourage these public and  private partnerships for wetlands con servation  projects  in Canada  and  Mexico as well as in the United States.  To achieve this objective, the bill es tablishes a structure to carry out the  ",1989

1962,1437,20,Mr. LOTT.,"  I move  to  lay  motion on the table.   The motion to lay on the table was  agreed to.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, the  amendment I am offering proposes to  strike section 4 of S. 388, the Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  Member Term Act of 1989. Section 4  would statutorily give Commissioners  full  access  to FERC  staff and  re sources, and it would statutorily pro vide for their full participation in the  formulation of policy and the schedul ing of Commission actions.  Section 4 was added to S. 388 by an  amendment  I  offered  in committee,  which was adopted unanimously by  the committee.  Mr. President, until just recently in  the Commission's long history,  that  which my amendment requires statu torily was, in fact, the normal course  of business; FERC Commissioners had  full and unfettered access to all Com mission staff, and they were full part ners in the formulation and implemen tation of Commission policy.  However, at the time I offered my  amendment in committee, it was clear  that there were serious and worsening  collegiality problems at the Commis sion, problems which were preventing  the Commissioners from fully execut ing  their duties and  responsibilities.  This was confirmed to me by several  of the FERC Commissioners both at- open committee hearings and in pri vate.  Mr. President,  the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission may be little  known outside of Washington, but it  routinely acts on matters which touch  on the lives, fortunes, and well-being  of citizens  and businesses  in every  State of the Nation. It is essential that  each and every Commissioner have at  his or her disposal all of the inf orma tion and assistance necessary for them  to make decisions which are  in the  overall public interest. Failure to do so  adversely  affects  the Nation's well being. That  is why  I  believed my  amendment was important, and that is  why the committee adopted it.  Subsequent to the committee's adop tion  of my  amendment,  however,  changes  have  taken  place  which  assure me that the problems that my  amendment sought to remedy will no  longer occur. We now have a  new  Commission  Chairman  who  has  pledged in private and in public that  he will do everything in his power to  restore the collegiality that had previ ously been the norm at the Commis",1989
