0,,101,-0.267,15,3,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr. Speaker,  today I join several colleagues from the House  and from the other body in sponsoring a reso lution  that addresses the acute humanitarian  crisis affecting  the people of the Sudan. My  colleagues and I are joined not by politics but  by a common and a deepening concern  for  the plight of many thousands of Sudanese ci vilians who  are  suffering  an  unimaginable  horror as a result of the political dissent and  civil war which divides their country. Hundreds  of thousands of Sudanese  face an  imminent  peril of starvation-a fate which has already  claimed  the  lives of great numbers of Suda nese people.  I urge all Members of this body  to sponsor the resolution and more important ly,  I urge my colleagues  to  reflect on  the  nature and  the extent of  this  tragedy which  has no origin  in drought or disaster but, in stead, stems from political division.  Additional evidence surfaces almost daily  documenting the harsh reality that the parties  to  the political and military conflict  in  the  Sudan-the Government,  the militias allied  with the Government, the rebels of the SPLA  [Sudanese People's Liberation Army]  locked  in a  long-term struggle against  the Govern ment-are all only too willing to use food as a  weapon in that conflict. Consequently, several  million  residents of  the southern  regions of  the country have been displaced  from  their  homes, their farms, their livelihoods.  As many  as  1 million  Sudanese  have  starved to death since the struggle began  in  1983. The toll in 1988 alone exceeded a quar ter of million people. This is a remarkable sta tistic: 250,000 or more noncombatants died  last year in the southern regions of the Sudan  from starvation or from the infectious diseases  which preyed upon  the malnourished victims  of  the warfare. A large percentage of  those  who died were children.  In several displaced  persons camps  in  the Sudan,  there are no  children under age 3 present-the infants and  young children have all died from starvation or  epidemic.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAMINE  There  is no shortage of those who share  the blame  for this outrage. The rebel  forces  have blown up relief convoys and shot down  planes sent by donor organizations and com mitted  additional  utterly  indefensible  acts  which have effectively precluded relief agen cies  from  reaching  those  in desperate need.  The Government of  the Sudan has erected  barrier upon barrier to deny food and medical  relief  to  those of questionable political affili ation. Relief agencies have been expelled by  the Government, permission  to  launch  relief  operations  denied,  resources  available  for  hungry civilians have been diverted to the mili tary.  Indicative of this callous indifference to the  plight of hungry southerners is the condition of  the million plus displaced who have sought  refuge  in and around Khartoum,  the capital  city.  In Khartoum,  the Government cannot  claim  that the SPLA  interferes with  relief ef forts or that the displaced are otherwise inac cessible. But in Khartoum the displaced live in  the most wretched  existence  conceivable,  many encamped on garbage dumps, most  without adequate water, all without sufficient  food, medicine, and shelter. The Government  does little for these people and limits what the  international community is allowed to do.  The  independent militias  of  the Sudan,  armed by the Government supposedly to fight  the rebel forces, maraud the countryside, rob bing, stealing, and burning villages. The mili tias capture children who are systematically  sold into slavery. Based on  tribal or religious  affiliation, civilians, sometimes the entire popu lation of villages, are summarily executed.  It is also important to note that the interna tional community's stance  in  face of this ex panding tragedy in the Sudan has been  less  than courageous at  times. The Sudan  tradi tionally  has  been  the  largest  recipient  of  United States foreign assistance in sub-Saha ran Africa but only recently, and only  in  the  face of strong congressional and media criti cism, has the State Department felt compelled  to speak out against  the Government's ac tions which preclude effective relief. Our Euro pean allies, all with considerable  influence in  the Sudan, have been similarly silent.  AN END TO SILENCE  But we can be silent no longer. It is impera tive  that  there be no doubt concerning  the  policies of  the United States Government  in  regards  to  the horrible  famine  stalking  the  Sudan. We cannot accept the use of food as  a political weapon by any party. We cannot  remain silent when innocent children are dying  as a result of conflict not of their making or  comprehension. We cannot accept the notion  that some people are beyond  reach or  that  the situation is too complicated. We must re-  double efforts to honor longstanding American  humanitarian  traditions which  require  that no  options are overlooked, no avenues left unex plored, as we strive to guarantee that no more  of these children starve to death.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this res olution.  COSTLY S&L ACCOUNTING  HON. WILLIS D. GRADISON, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 27, 1989  ",1989
1,,101,0.233,15,3,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Speaker, last Wednes day in this space I criticized the proposed fi nancing scheme for the S&L bailout. I also in serted a timely article  from yesterday's Wall  Street Journal.  I take this opportunity to bring a second arti cle on  the  topic  to  the attention of my col leagues.  It  is  from Thursday's Washington  Post and is by Kathleen Day. The message is  much the same;  if we hide the bailout by re sorting  to off-budget  financing, we  raise  the  cost of the bailout significantly, and I think un necessarily.  And  the  taxpayer will pay  this added cost  because, under the administration's proposal,  the Treasury pays the  interest on  the bonds  ",1989
2,House,101,-0.28,41,3,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise in support of title I of House  Resolution 84, which  establishes  in  this Congress the Select Committee on  Hunger. This title of the resolution in corporates House Resolution 20,  of  which I am pleased to be an original  cosponsor.  I have been a longtime supporter of  the Select Committee on Hunger, and  I have enjoyed the privilege of chair ing its  international task force since  the Select Committee's inception  in  1984.  Before  the creation of  the Select  Committee  on Hunger,  jurisdiction  over hunger issues was divided among  8 of the 22 standing committees and  numerous subcommittees. Creation of  the Select Committee on Hunger has  provided a single, unified forum for  the consideration of the diverse issues  related to hunger-both domestic and  international.  There  is no question  that hunger  continues to be a critical  issue  that  merits  the special focus of the U.S.  Congress. Each day, 40,000 people die  of hunger and complications related to  severe malnutrition. An estimated 14.6  million people die  from hunger and  malnutrition each year. More than 20  million  people  here  in  the United  States, including 4 million children, go  hungry at some point during  each  month.  Since 1984, the Select Committee on  Hunger has made important contribu tions to the work of the Congress on  issues relating  to both domestic and  international hunger. The record dem onstrates that the Select Committee's  work has complemented that of the  standing committees with jurisdiction  over hunger. As  the Select Commit tee's progress report on its activities in  the  lOOth Congress  indicates,  it has  succeeded  in  directing  attention  to  issues  that might not have  received  such congressional consideration with out its work. There are many exam ples of  this that I could cite, but I  would like to take a moment to high light just a few that were of special in terest to me in the 1 OOth Congress.  Domestically, the Select Committee  made several contributions  to provi sions of the Emergency Hunger Pre vention Act of 1988-Public Law 100435. Hearings by the Select Committee  on Hunger led to legislation which was  incorporated into this law to encour age greater use of farmers markets to  bring nutritious commodities to  low income women, infants, and children.  The Hunger Committee also partici pated in the crafting of provisions of  Public Law 100-435 designed to simpli fy  application  procedures  for  food  stamps, Medicaid, and aid to families  with dependent children CAFDCJ.  I was  especially pleased  that  the  Emergency Hunger Prevention Act in cluded provisions based on my bill to  establish a national gleaning clearing house within the Department of Agri culture. The Select Committee had  been working with me since the 99th  Congress on hearings and legislation  to promote  the gleaning of surplus  farm crops for use in private emergen cy  food  distribution  programs.  signed  into  law,  the gleaning provi sions authorize the Secretary of Agri culture  to provide  technical  aid  to  State and local agencies for encourag ing  public  and  private  nonprofit  agency  involvement  in gleaning pro grams, and for collecting and sharing  information  relating  to gleaning ef forts.  As  chairman of  the  International  Task Force, I am especially pleased by  the contributions made by the Select  Committee to numerous international  hunger issues. In the lOOth Congress, I  had introduced H.R. 1693, the Global  Basic Education Enhancement Act.  Funding provisions of the Foreign Aid  Appropriations Act <P.L. 100-461> re flected the thrust of this bill and of  other basic education activities of the  Select Committee. For  fiscal  1989,  As  there is an earmark of $64. 7 million  for basic primary and secondary edu cation spending by AID. This fallows  an earmark of $42 million  in  fiscal  1988. It is my hope that this type of  funding commitment demonstrates a  growing consensus about the vital role  of basic education in efforts to sustain  development in Third World nations.  Since fiscal 1985, the Select Commit tee has made prominent contributions  to securing increased support for the  Child Survival Fund. Last year,  the  Select Committee called attention to a  disturbing trend in AID's support for  child survival activities: a decline of 20  percent in funding for these activities,  including a 30 percent decline in child  survival spending for African children,  from  fiscal 1987  to  fiscal 1988. The  Select Committee worked with  the  Foreign Operations Subcommittee on  language  in the Foreign Aid Appro priations Act to encourage AID to in crease funding for child survival activi ties-and especially those for African  children-in fiscal 1989  to a  level at  least as high as that of fiscal 1987.  In  the  lOOth Congress,  the Select  Committee on Hunger continued  its  strong support for programs to combat  both  blindness  and  malnutrition  through the increased use of vitamin  A. An earmark of $8 million for AID's  Vitamin A Deficiency Program was in cluded in the fiscal 1989 foreign aid  appropriation.  The Select Committee also support ed initiatives to achieve the worldwide  eradication of Guinea worm disease  and to increase the U.S. commitment  to fight river blindness.  Further, the Select Committee advo cated an earmark of $75 million for  micro-enterprise credit  in  the  fiscal  1989 foreign aid appropriations legisla tion-an amount which ultimately was  approved.  I was pleased to work with Select  Committee  on  Hunger  Chairman  MICKEY LELAND on  legislative  initia tives, such as H.R. 4049,  to promote  the role of women in development. I  also worked with Chairman LELAND on  measures to address food emergencies  in Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia,  Mozambique, Angola, and other Afri can nations.  With  respect  to Ethiopia,  I was  grateful  that 232  of my colleagues  joined as cosponsors of House Concur rent Resolution 237, a resolution I in troduced to encourage early action to  prevent the loss of life in Ethiopia and  other drought-stricken nations in sub Saharan Africa. I also appreciated the  opportunity to work with the gentle woman from New Jersey <Mrs. RouKE MA) on an initiative to urge the Soviet  Union  to use  its  influence with  the  Ethiopian Government to help secure  the delivery of food relief to the needy  in the embattled regions of Ethiopia.  ",1989
3,House,101,-0.023,54,3,Mr. CONTE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in sup port  of  the  resolution  to  reconstitute  the  Select Committee on Hunger. Since its estab lishment,  the select committee has brought  painful and often tragic issues into our nation al  debate.  In doing  so,  it has served  the  Nation and the world.  The  select  committee  has  accomplished  much, both at home and abroad. Its work  is  compassionate and effective. But hunger  in  any form has few easy solutions, and will not  be defeated without consistent effort.  If we  hope in the future to prevent disasters like the  famines  in Ethiopia, Mozambique, and  the  Sudan, and to end the malnutrition and scarci ty that shame our own country, we must rec ognize that the select committee's job is not  over.  The victims of hunger are  not powerful.  They depend on others to be their advocates  and  to help  them escape  their pain. The  select committee has been their advocate and  if it has not found  the solution, it has begun  the search. It gives a chance  for life  to mil lions of people around the world. It gives the  dream of a better future to families throughout  America. I hope every one of my colleagues  will join me in voting to reconstitute the Select  Committee on Hunger.  ",1989
4,House,101,0.043,54,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise in sup port of House Resolution 84, establishing the  Select Committee on Hunger; the Select Com mittee on Children, Youth, and Families; and  the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and  Control.  With respect to the Narcotics Select Com mittee,  it was created because the Congress  thought it appropriate for there to be a single  committee to address all aspects of the drug  problem.  Unlike  the  standing  committees,  which have fragmented, piecemeal jurisdiction  over drug trafficking and drug abuse, the Nar cotics Select Committee is the only committee  in the Congress that is mandated to devote its  entire efforts to monitoring and overseeing the  complex issues pertaining to the illicit produc tion, trafficking and consumption of drugs. The  committee's  resolution  requires  that  certain  standing committees be  represented on  the  select committee. Thus our Narcotics Commit tee works closely with  the standing commit tees regarding their legislative initiatives in this  area.  As a senior member of the Narcotics Select  Committee and of the Foreign Affairs Commit tee,  I can assure my colleagues that there is  perhaps even a greater need  for a narcotics  committee today than there was at its incep tion. This country is suffering from a drug epi demic. Our Nation is reeling under the impact  of crack, a smokable, highly addictive form of  cocaine, which has brought drug abuse and  drug-related crime and violence  to  terrifying  new  levels. Our  criminal  justice  system  is  overloaded  by  international  drug  criminals,  and our drug treatment centers are swamped  by more requests for help than they can pos sibly meet.  The Narcotics Committee played an  impor tant role  in  researching, developing, and en acting the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and  1988. The Narcotics Committee held exten sive hearings on all aspects of the drug prob lem which were addressed by  the omnibus  drug laws, including provisions relating to drug  abuse education, Federal assistance to State  and  local governments  for narcotics  law en forcement, interdiction, treatment and preven tion programs, and on  international narcotics  control efforts.  In  the  last Congress we made  some  progress in addressing this problem. The 1988  Anti-Drug Abuse Act provides  important new  tools and new resources  for  the war against  drugs. The Congress created  the position of  director of national drug control policy to for mulate and  implement a comprehensive, co ordinated national drug strategy. The antidrug  legislation  included  initiatives  to  combat  money laundering, to end the use of American  made chemicals  in drug production, to esca late our efforts to eradicate and interdict drugs  produced abroad, and to work harder at home  in antidrug education and treatment and reha bilitation. But  there  is still much more  to be  done.  During the last Congress our select commit tee held 25 hearings, including oversight hear ings  to assess  the  implementation of pro grams established under the Anti-Drug Abuse  Act of 1986. If we are reconstituted, the com mittee  intends  to hold a series of oversight  hearings on  the  recently passed 1988 Drug  Act, as well as on the Federal drug strategy to  be promulgated by the ""drug czar.""  Madam Speaker, narcotics  trafficking and  drug abuse have  reached epidemic propor tions, both here in the United States and over seas.  In our Nation alone  illicit drug dealing  represents an estimated $140 billion a year  untaxed activity. Our cities, towns, and school  districts  are  hemorrhaging  under  the  on slaught of drugs. The executive branch's anti drug  activities, with  17 Departments  and  Agencies involved, has resulted in a fragment ed effort. That  is why Congress created a  drug czar-to coordinate  the entire Federal  Antidrug Program. To prevent  the Congress  from being  itself  fragmented  in  the antidrug  effort, the select narcotics committee was cre ated.  No single standing committee has the time,  resources, or expertise to monitor all aspects  of the drug problem, but by working together  the standing committees and  the Narcotics  Select Committee can effectively prod the ex ecutive branch  in  implementing our antidrug  legislation and  in developing a comprehen sive, coordinated drug strategy.  Madam Speaker, as we know, the illicit pro duction, trafficking, and consumption of drugs  are diverse problems that require comprehen sive  full  time attention. Accordingly,  in  an  effort to provide that full time oversight of the  drug problem, I ask that my colleagues vote in  favor of House Resolution 84.  ",1989
5,House,101,0.231,54,3,Mr. BEREUTER.," Madam Speaker, I urge my  colleagues  to support  reauthorization of  the  Select Committee on Hunger  for  the next 2  years. There has never been more rapid tech nical progress against world hunger and nutri tionally draining  illnesses  such as diarrhea  than  in  the past 5 years since  the Select  Committee on Hunger was created. The rates  of death and disabling illness due to hunger,  malnutrition,  and  related  causes  like  inad equate health knowledge, disease, and unsafe  water supplies are  falling at record speed  in  many parts of the world.  Yet UNICEF's recent report on the State of  the World's Children reminds the world com munity,  including  those  countries  like  the  Soviet Union which have  traditionally done  almost nothing  to support positive develop ment in the Third World, that ""some fourteen  million children are still dying each year from  common illnesses and undernutrition, most of  which could be prevented by relatively simple,  relatively  low-cost methods."" The next  few  years provide an historic opportunity  to con solidate  the gains of  the  last decade and  spread them on a worldwide basis through the  kind of practical leadership and good manage ment that have always been the goal of U.S.  programs in the areas of emergency relief and  development assistance.  The work  of  the Select Committee  on  Hunger in recommending integrated and cost effective  solutions  to  international  hunger  problems has helped  the American people  become  the opinion  leaders of  the world  in  the amazing progress against hunger and dis ease worldwide  during  the  decade of  the  1980s. The creation of AID's Child Survival  Program and support for coordinated action in  food aid and measures to improve the health,  education,  and  productivity of  the  poorest  people in the world are some of the initiatives  the  select  committee  has  encouraged.  UNICEF estimates programs put in place just  since 1980 save the lives of an additional 21/z  million children each year who would have  died but  for  the programs  like  immunization,  oral rehydration  therapy, and growth monitor ing that have been put in place through these  initiatives.  This experience contributes  to a growing  consensus which  is emerging among  leaders  of nations, private voluntary groups, and inter national organizations  like UNICEF and  the  World Health Organization that there is a truly  historic opportunity  in  the decade ahead  to  achieve a minimal level of nutrition and health  for all the people in the world. The American  people and the U.S. Congress have been the  leaders in the fight against world hunger, and  we should continue  to  lead.  I urge my col leagues  to  support  reauthorization  of  the  Select Committee on Hunger so that the anal ysis and care  required  to promote the most  cost-effective approaches  to nutrition  for all  the world's people can continue be part of the  work of this body.  ",1989
6,House,101,-0.491,54,3,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today  in strong support of House Resolution 84,  to  reestablish the Select Committee on Narcotics  Abuse and Control, the Select Committee on  Hunger, and  the Select Committee on Chil dren, Youth, and Families.  It  is essential  for Congress  to act on  the  problems  these select committees  focus on  because it is unclear if the current administra tion will. These three select committees pro vide  important  information and  resources  to  this body, and to this Nation. Problems like il legal narcotics traffic and abuse, hunger, and  child welfare will not go away by themselves,  Congress must continue its efforts to find ef fective solutions.  Representatives  RANGEL,  LELAND,  and  MILLER have provided outstanding  leadership  to  their committees. The most difficult social  problems confronting us  today demand our  ",1989
7,House,101,-0.592,67,3,Mr. PAYNE of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is a privilege to join with my colleagues here  today  to  honor  the  contributions of  black  Americans throughout the course of history.  It  is especially appropriate  that  the  theme  for National Black History Month  this year is  the  role  of Afro-American  churches.  Like  threads of a fine, strong tapestry,  the history  of our churches is tightly interwoven with our  cultural and political history.  Churches have had a profound influence on  our lives, from the days of slavery throughout  the arduous civil rights struggle, and continu ing  in  the  face of today's challenges.  In our  houses of worship, we have  reaffirmed our  faith  in God, in the future, and in each other.  We have mourned senseless  losses, and we  have rejoiced in hard-fought victories.  It is fitting that we should pay tribute to our  religious  leaders, who provided moral back bone  in  our  fight  for  justice and equality.  Throughout times of great upheaval, ministrers  and  church  leaders  imparted  the  spiritual  strength, courage, and tenacity which brought  about social change.  I am proud of  the contributions made by  churches and religious leaders in my State of  New Jersey. Continuing in a long activist tradi tion, our churches are working  to meet  the  needs of local communities in today's rapidly  changing world.  Churches are making a tremendous differ ence in the everyday lives of so many of our  citizens, young and old. In my district, church es offer day care for children and adults. To  ease the plight of the homeless, they provide  shelter and food for those in need. Affordable  housing complexes have been developed by  church groups. Food pantries have been orga nized  for emergencies or  to  help  families  whose monthly resources run out. Through a  church-sponsored  program,  nutritious  fresh  food is brought from rural farms and sold eco nomically.  Our churches have been a strong, positive  force  throughout  our  history. Today,  they  remain in the forefront as we face new social  and moral issues.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the progressive  role of Afro-American churches, both  in New  Jersey and  throughout our country. As we  commemorate Black History Month,  let me  take this opportunity to commend our church es and  religous  leaders who continue  their  tireless work for a better future.  ",1989
8,House,101,-0.514,67,3,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, every year, this  time  the American public  is reminded of the  struggle of black Americans in this great coun try of ours. It is Black History Month again.  It seems that all we can recall in the history  of black Americans is the pain, the hardships,  and the constant uphill battle for respect and  acceptance in our own Nation. What is often  overlooked  is  the  fact  that black Americans  have made a solid contribution to the strength  and vitality of America. It has not been all pain  and suffering for us. Our many years of bond age and our clashes  in  the streets against  ",1989
9,House,101,-0.211,80,3,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker,  I want  to  thank  the gentleman  for  this opportunity  to  recognize Black History Month. As a former  history teacher  I'm acutely aware of  the nu merous contributions made by black Ameri cans throughout this Nation's history. I'm also  aware of  the need  to make  those contribu tions more well known and this is one way of  doing that.  My district in the most southern part of Illi nois experienced  the struggle  for civil  rights  like others did during the sixties and early sev enties. That effort of course continues today.  One  the  prominent  organizations  helping  make changes take place is the National As sociation  for  the Advancement of Colored  People, and I would like to thank the Carbon dale Chapter, which serves my entire district,  for its efforts.  Right alongside the more well known names  in black history, Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., Jackie Robinson, are hundreds of  less well-known names, perhaps more quiet in  their diligence, perhaps simply less recognized  for their contributions, great and small.  In my  area we can boast of  three men  from one  town, Centralia, who've made  their mark  for  their contributions and accomplishments.  I'm speaking of Donald McHenry, U.N. Am bassador in the Carter administration, William  Norwood, the first black pilot of United Airlines  who graduated from SIU and now serves on  its board of trustees, and Roland Burris, an other Centralia native and SIU graduate who  as comptroller for the State of Illinois was the  first black elected  to statewide office  in  Illi nois.  These are just a few of the people from my  district who've helped make a difference, and  there are many more on  the way. Not  long  ago  the Carbondale NAACP announced  its  Image Awards,  for contributions  to  the black  community. Dr. Nathaniel Felder,  the director  of planning for computing at SIU, is also local  president of the NAACP. Dr. Felder tells me  the association found  itself in the position of  pointing out areas where lack of effort and in attention were obvious, almost at the cost of  forgetting to recognize those in the community  making positive contributions. Out of this rec ognition sprang the Image Awards. If I might, I  woud  like  to make  the  record  for some of  those recognized.  The  top  Image Award went  to Dr.  John  Guyon, president of Southern Illinois Universi ty-Carbondale. Dr. Guyon was honored for his  courage and integrity, exemplified by his deci sion to place a number of black professionals  in  important positions on campus,  including  vice president for academic affairs, vice presi dent for student affairs, budget director, and a  special position of assistant to  the president  for affirmative action. These are high-profile  and demanding jobs within the university, the  NAACP thought that should not go unrecog nized.  Numerous awards also went to southern Illi nois community members who are  following  the examples of black leaders we're honoring  now and who are setting examples for others  to  follow and  learn about  in  the years  to  come.  The Public Service Award went to the No. 9  Community Development Corporation. No. 9 is  an  old mining  camp which  it would  seem  progress has  left in  its wake. The  leaders in  No. 9 are actively working to bring sewer and  water lines to the community,  fighting for pri mary services so many of us take for granted.  Their example is local, yet still historic.  Mr. Gajeef McNeil was honored for his ef forts in the area of social service. Mr. McNeil  helped organize and direct a number of com munity programs  for  the people of Carbon dale.  Dr. Seymour Bryson was the Image Award  winner  for education. Dr. Bryson  is  the  first  black dean at SIU, and  in  that capacity he's  made it possible for large numbers of minority  students to attend college by admitting them  to his college and assisting with financial sup port.  He also helped sponsor the Chico Vaughn  basketball camp, which I'll talk more about in  a moment.  In the area of religion, Rev. Dan Cross was  recognized for his efforts at bringing a church  to  the community of Colp. Reverend Cross  teaches at  the high  school  in Carbondale,  coaches basketball, and still finds time to start  a church  in an area where hope  is often a  scarce resource.  The Image Award for art went to Ms. Shir lene Holmes, who developed poems,  litera ture, and artistic works for young people in the  black community.  For business,  the  Image Award was given  to Ms. Jean Dorsett-Robinson, president of  Quality of Life Services,  for her work  in  the  local  business  community  providing  health  services for the homebound.  In medicine, the NAACP's Image Award re cipient was Dr. Wrophas Meeks,  the  only  black  radiologist  in  the area, and an active  supporter of numerous community projects, in cluding being president of  the High School  Booster Club.  In athletics, Stephen Bardo was honored for  his contributions on and off  the basketball  court. Stephen, one of the finest athletes ever  from my area,  is a starting guard on the Uni versity of Illinois Basketball Team, which has  been rated  in  the Top 20 all year  long. Ste phen  is a young man able  to negotiate  the  rigors of basketball and academics at one of  the Nation's most prestigious schools, and he  always comes back home to spend time with  impressionable youngsters who find a reliable  role model in his life.  Honorable mention in this category went to  Chico Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, a  recordsetting  high school player and  the all-time  leading  scorer at SIU, recently returned to the univer sity to finish his degree in physical education.  For that, the NAACP wanted to recognize him,  for his determination to overcome some of the  obstacles placed in his way and persevere is  certainly something worth emulating.  I would hope as we  remember  the great  and prominent names, Justice Thurgood Mar shall, James Meredith, James Baldwin, and  Shirley Chisolm, that we would also remember  our local heroes and heroines, who are side  by side with those more prominent names in  shaping our Nation's direction.  Every Member has residents of his or her  district who fit this example. I'm proud to say I  have many. I hope our efforts help us develop  hundreds and thousands more.  ",1989
10,House,101,-0.4,80,3,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  join our colleagues in the celebration of Black  History Month. Every February, America  re flects upon the achievements of its black citi zens and, each year, during  this month we  see how our Nation's character has become  richer and better. When  I entered  the U.S.  House of Representatives in 1955, few would  have envisioned  that a black man could run  for President or serve on the Supreme Court.  These are milestones which are a tribute  to  where we are  in  the  journey  to Dr. King's  ""promised  land."" However, we must remem ber how far we still must go.  America  has made great  strides  toward  racial equality during the 20th century, but we  must continue  to make  them. Eighty years  ago, a group of 60 black and white Americans  founded  the National Association  for the Ad vancement of Colored People.  In  the years  following the founding of the NAACP, America  endured the Great Depression, saw its emer gence as a world power, and witnessed  the  civil rights struggles of the 1950's and 1960's.  From the southern fields to the northern facto ries, day  in and day out, blacks gave  their  sweat, tears, and sometimes their lives to ad vance themselves and improve their lives. Yet,  during this time, the richness of the flourishing  black culture went largely unnoticed by a ma jority of Americans.  In a sense,  this  is what  Black History Month is about; we reflect upon  the black community's contributions to our na tional history and heritage, and look ahead to  the day when we reach  the end of the  long  journey against  racial  injustice and  intoler ance.  As  the NAACP  and  other  organizations  fought  for equality, Americans'  eyes were  opened to the scourge of racism. The sacrific es made by millions of Americans, both black  and white,  to end segregation  in  the United  States were unprecedented. While we do not  know all of their names, we must never forget  these brave men and women who  fought for  ",1989
11,Senate,101,-0.371,119,3,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President, I rise  to join my colleagues on the Environ ment and Public Works Committee to  stress the need for immediate action  on comprehensive amendments to the  Clean Air Act.  In  past  sessions,  our  committee  made several attempts to make needed  changes in the act. Our efforts were  greeted with outright opposition from  the Reagan administration.  Those years of denial and procrasti nation have made this task much more  difficult. The quality of the Nation's  air has deteriorated.  The costs associated with improving  our air quality have increased greatly  as a result of our inaction during the  1980's. Today, we begin the process of  enacting a comprehensive package of  Clean Air Act amendments.  Clean Air Act amendments are the  No. 1 priority of the committee during  the  lOlst Congress.  These  amend ments will constitute the major envi ronmental vote of this session.  There has been a great deal of dis cussion concerning global warming in  recent months. We can do more to di rectly  address  this problem,  in  the  near term, by enacting clean air legis lation in this Congress.  As the saying goes, ""it takes two to  tango."" For the first time in nearly a  decade, we  have  an  administration  which  is publicly committed  to sup porting enactment of a clean air bill.  We have a .new Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency who  has pledged to work with the Congress  in fashioning Clean Air Act amend ments. This is a positive starting place.  But there is a long road ahead of us.  If we are  to enact a comprehensive  clean air bill, every region of the coun try must be part of our deliberations.  Some of the issues concerning acid  rain are the most divisive of the clean  air debate. I am confident that a solu tion, which takes into account the circumstances of each region of the coun try, can be reached.  Any  compromise  concerning  acid  rain must be neutral with regard to  existing and future coal markets. If we  abandon the polluter pays principle to  assist the cleanup in the Midwest pow erplants,  then  full  credit must  be  given  to  those areas which have ex pended millions of dollars during the  past decade for air pollution controls.  The committee  is open  to sugges tions from all Members of the Senate.  We intended to complete action on the  Clean Air Act amendments during this  Congress.  I urge other Members  to  make their views known.  We  intend  to enact a  strong bill  which addresses this Nation's serious  air pollution problems. We intend to  enact a bill which will give the Envi ronmental  Protection Agency,  and  State and local governments a frame work  to effectively and aggressively  deal with this major threat to the Na tion's public health.  It is  time  for  action. Let us get on with the task.  I urge my colleagues to join with us  in this vital effort.  I thank the Chair.  CLEAN AIR AGENDA  ",1989
12,Senate,101,-0.347,119,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, the  quality of life and the quality of our  environment are inseparable. We have  made good progress on the quality of  the environment in many areas.  But our progress is being overtaken  by events. In 1970, when the first com prehensive Clean Air Act was signed  into law, Americans registered 108 mil lion cars and drove 900 billion miles.  In 1987, we registered 177 million cars  and drove more than 1. 7 trillion miles,  with no decline in sight.  The U.S. consumes more energy per  gross national product than any other  developed  nation.  This means we  produce large quantities of sulfur di oxide and oxides of nitrogen, even if  consumption were unchanged. Experts  now predict that without further man dated reductions, there will be a about  a 2-million-ton increase in sulfur diox ide emissions by 2000.  Americans felt the consequences of  more  cars  and  inefficient  uses  of  energy last summer.  Health alerts then told residents of  urban areas not  to exercise, warned  older people and those with asthmatic  or pulmonary conditions  to stay  in doors and suggested that small chil dren not play outside.  In the Washington, DC, metropoli tan area last summer, 34 days exceed ed  the occupational standard for air  quality. That means  it would have  been illegal to expose a factory worker  to  the  air Washington  residents  breathed, and children played in, for  over a month last summer.  Recently  released EPA data  indi cates that 15 million more people are  exposed to unhealthy levels of ozone  than they were before  last summer.  This means  that 150 million Ameri cans are  living  in areas where  it  is  often unhealthy just to breathe.  The increasing ozone levels affect all  areas, including so-called clean areas.  At Mount Desert Island on the coast  of Maine, where  nearly  5 million  people come  to escape  the summer  heat of the cities, monitoring stations  reported several violations of the Fed eral air quality standards.  Dr. Morton Lippman, professor of  environmental medicine at  the New  York  University  Medical  Center,  warned in July:  Until  recently we  had  the  impression  things were improving, but what we see this  summer shows us that we are back where  we started from.  Dr. Lippman is right and the EPA  data confirms  this. Despite consider able  progress  in  controlling  some  forms of air pollution, we must do  more.  Paradoxically,  there  is  reason  for  hope. For we have found that just as  neglect of pollution controls means  dirtier air, emphasis on those controls  can mean cleaner air.  Americans are suffering from a man made phenomenon that can be con trolled by man. We have developed the  technologies of control.  We  have  the  resources  to  apply  those  technologies. Until now, what  we have lacked is the political will to  do so. We must now develop that will.  We cannot, with one piece of legisla tion, reach all the factors that contrib ute to dirty air. Nor can we expect any  remedy to be cost free. We must keep  these fundamental facts in mind as we  consider legislation.  Air pollution is not just a  regional  problem, not just an industry problem,  not just something that affects people  in the Los Angeles basin or the North east alone. Air pollution is a national  problem. It affects all of America, and  all Americans.  Experts from every branch of medi cal science have told us that breathing  dirty air is simply not a matter of dis comfort. It impairs the ability of lungs  and blood to carry oxygen. It may per manently damage the lungs.  No one has control over the air he or  she breathes. No one can control the  direction in which pollutants move in  the atmosphere. No one can  isolate  himself from the quality of the air. It  is not a matter of choice, or a con scious assumption of risk.  It is an involuntarily imposed health  threat, affecting everyone. The univer sality of the threat dictates that solu tions must be broadly based.  A solution that penalized one part of  the country, or one segment of indus try, would be unfair and unrealistic.  We  have  an  integrated  national  economy. None of our  regions  can  ",1989
13,Senate,101,-0.301,132,3,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  to express my gravest concern  about the decision of the Government  of Japan on February 16  to extend  formal recognition to the military gov ernment of Burma, as well as my hope  that Japan will not abandon its com mitment  to  human  rights  in  that  country. I  trust that Japan will not  follow its off er of recognition with an  off er of financial assistance, nor of in creased  economic  ties.  Japan,  and,  indeed, the other nations of Asia and  of the world should continue to with hold assistance from Burma until the  Rangoon regime demonstrates a com mitment to free elections and national  reconciliation. The announcement of  elections in May 1990 is an encourag ing move, but much clearer commit ments are necessary-a cease-fire  in  the civil war so that all Burmese may  participate, freedom for political orga nization by opposition parties, a pre cise election timetable, and a mecha nism for international observation. A  premature offer of aid by Japan will  serve as a reward to the Burmese mili tary for failing to live up to its com mitments, and for brutally suppressing  prodemocratic dissent.  Burma  has  been  in  turmoil  for  nearly a year. A democratic uprising  drove  out  one  government  in  the  spring, and then another. When the  military  took  formal control of  the  government  in  September,  Japan  earned  the world's  admiration  for  withholding assistance from the new  government and demanding democra cy. Burma had clearly become ungov ernable. A civil war has left much of  its outlying provinces in the hands of  ethnic groups fighting for federalism  and democracy, and thousands of civil ians, many of  them university  stu dents, have fled  to border camps. As  many as 3,000 of  their compatriots  never made it, for they were shot by  the military.  I am certain the Japanese Govern ment will recognize that there can be  no profit in investing in Burma. Most  of its unexploited natural resources gems,  teak, oil, and minerals-lie  in  parts of the country where civil war  makes  development  impossible.  Burma's universities  are  closed and  their students are dying of malaria in  border camps, rather than training to  become engineers, doctors, and techni cians. Burmese currency is worthless,  and has been partially supplanted by  jade, precious stones, and opium  in  black market border trading.  I understand that some elements of  the Japanese Government continue to  resist moves  to strengthen  ties with  the Burmese military. Their position  is  commendable and  I  expect  their  voices will be heard. No aid should be  provided, nor should Burma's debt be  renegotiated or interest payments sus pended or forgiven, until democracy is  restored.  Similarly,  the Mitsubishi  group should not continue with  the  construction of  the airport  in Ran goon.  Japan's policy was until days ago a  guiding example of  the proper ap proach to the Burmese crisis. Despite  this  regrettable move,  I  hope  that  Japan's expectations of the Burmese  military regime will be more clearly  defined.  This is a most crucial moment in the  crisis, and a most inopportune moment  for a country as important as Japan to  make such an overture, for at this very  moment  the United Nations Human  Rights Commission is considering the  human rights violations of  the Bur mese regime. The American delegation  will make every effort to highlight the  Burmese tragedy. I trust the Japanese  delegation will join us, for silence on  the part of an Asian democracy would  be interpreted as tacit approval of the  Burmese regime.  Let us, Japan and the United States,  and all other democratic nations, with hold assistance until firm and verifia ble steps are taken to end the killings  in Burma, to restore democracy and to  hold free and fair elections. The val iant protesters of Burma are looking  toward us. We must not and cannot let  them down.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a copy of a letter several of  my colleagues and I sent to the State  Department regarding human  rights  in Burma, and a copy of the State De partment's response, be printed in the  RECORD at this time. I also ask unani mous consent that two recent articles  about human rights  in Burma from  the New York Times be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, January 26, 1989.  Hon. ARMANDO VALLADERES,  Chairman, United States Delegation  to  the  United Nations Human Rights Commis sion, Department of State, Washington,  DC.  DEAR AMBASSADOR v ALLADERES: we  trust  that you will find occasion to bring up the  repression of human rights in Burma when  the U.N. Human Rights Commission con venes in Geneva on January 30th. Specifi cally, we urge that you make every effort to  ensure that a resolution concerning Burma  be considered by  the Commission at  this  year's meeting. As you know, on August 11  of last year the Senate unanimously passed  a resolution <S. Res. 464) that condemned  the military government of Burma and that  called upon the Secretary of State and the  Permanent Representative  to  the United  Nations to encourage the restoration of de mocracy in Burma and to condemn the kill ings and mass arrests committed there.  Last summer, after 26 years of authoritar ian  rule  and  economic  stagnation,  the  people of Burma took to the streets in pro test. Their demands were elemental and  just.  They  sought  free  elections.  Free  speech. An accounting of  the victims of  police  violence. For  a  brief moment  it  seemed they would carry the day. But then  the army cracked down. The military took  formal control of  the state apparatus on  September 18,  and made clear  it would  never share power, nor permit opposition.  Soldiers  fired  into crowds with machine  guns, mortars, and  recoiless  rifles. Thou sands  of  unarmed  demonstrators  were  killed. Over 6,000 civilians, fearing for their  lives, have fled to the Burmese-Thai border.  What is more, the extraordinary display  of brutality in Rangoon and in other cities  last summer has for many years been a com monplace  feature of  the Burmese army's  treatment of ethnic minority peoples living  within Burma's borders. In an August, 1988  report, Amnesty  International  found evi dence of ""a consistent pattern of unlawful  killing  and  ill-treatment of members of  Burma's  ethnic minorities  by  security  forces."" Countless villagers belonging to the  Shan, Kachin, Karen, Palaung, Wa and the  many other minority groups of Burma have  been beaten,  tortured, or killed for  their  suspected allegiance  to government oppo nents. The army has forcibly conscripted  many of them to carry heavy loads down  jungle  trails,  and  to  sweep minefields.  Young Burmans in Rangoon are now being  similarly conscripted, destined to die anony mously in the mud of a rain forest.  All  this has happened  to a people that  have demonstrated a  remarkable faith  in  America and in our capacity for moral be havior. After the passage of S. Res. 464, our  embassy in Rangoon became the focal point  of pro-democracy demonstrations, such that  ",1989

I am not the rank ing member, and I am not the chair man. The distinguished Senator from  Alaska is absolutely right, that there  is a Joint Committee on Taxation, but  I think it is also fair to point out that  that committee deals with trade, Medi care, Medicaid, Social Security, cata strophic  illness-all  of  those mam moth problems.  The thing that bothers me is that  what happens  is  that by giving an  across-the-board percentage  increase  of 10 percent, basically what you have  done, and I know it shades a little bit,  is to compound inequities.  In other words, if a committee is get ting what you might say is too much,  by giving it 10 percent, you are giving  it 10 percent of $5 million, a lot more  than 10 percent of $2.7 million. I am  not saying the other committees are  starved. I do not think there is a single  committee here than cannot get along  with the amount that the Rules Com mittee has given them. I am not here  to plead for more. I am here to say  that it just appears that we are being  extravagant.  If indeed you are going to so-called  zero budgeting, starting at the begin ning and examining, now, why does  the Labor Committee have to have 124  employees and more money-twice as  much as  the Agriculture Committee  and the Banking Committee?

17,Senate,101,-0.387,184,3,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  designate the Juan Bautista de Anza  Trail as a component of the National  Trails System. The bill is identical to  legislation  being  introduced  in  the  House  by  Congressman  GEORGE  MILLER.  In 1775, Juan Bautista de Anza, a  second-generation frontier soldier, set  forth from Horcasitas, Mexico to open  up the first overland route to upper  California. Crossing the border near  the city of Nogales, the expedition fol lowed a route north along the Santa  Cruz River past Tucson,  then west ward along the Gila River to Yuma,  and across  the Colorado River back  into Mexico. Reentering  the United  States near El Centro, the expedition  continued northward through Imperi al, San Diego, Riverside, Los Angeles,  Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis  Obispo, Monterey, San Benito, Santa  Clara, and San Mateo Counties, finally  reaching San Francisco in June 1776.  The de Anza expedition proved that  overland travel between the Mexican  province of Sonora and upper Califor nia was possible and resulted in the  initial settlement of San Francisco and  the founding of the presidio and mis sion there.  Pursuant to legislation I sponsored  in  the 98th Congress,  the National  Park Service conducted a  feasibility  study of including the Juan Bautista  de Anza Trail in the National Trails  System. I'm pleased to report that this  feasibility study /environmental assess ment concluded that the de Anza Trail  meets the criteria for designation as a  national historic trail. The study fur . ther found  that there  is substantial  public support for the designation and  that State and local agencies and pri vate organizations are prepared to con tribute their resources to the endeav or.  The bill I am introducing today im plements the recommendations of the  National Park Service study. It desig nates the Juan Bautista de Anza Na tional Historic Trail, comprising ap proximately 1,200 miles from Nogales,  AZ, to San Francisco, CA, and provides  that the trail be administered by the  Secretary of the Interior. The bill also  calls for the Secretary to encourage  the participation of volunteer trail or ganizations  in  the development and  maintenance of the trail.  Mr. President, enactment of this leg islation will give national recognition  to an  important pioneer  route and  commemorate an event significant to  the course of American history and  the settlement of California.  I  ask  unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed at this point in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 465  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

18,Senate,101,-0.314,184,3,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, Today I  am introducing a bill to address what  has become  a major public health  problem in America-the abuse of ana bolic steroids. And  I  am pleased  to  have the Senator from South Carolina  join me in this effort. Senator THUR MOND  and  I have been working  for  many years  to deal with  the drug  abuse problem, particularly among our  young people.  Young people use steroids not only  because they want to be better ath letes, but also because they want to  look better. What they do not under stand is that steroids have proven ad verse medical consequences. The medi cal problems associated with steroids  include  coronary  artery disease-in cluding  heart  attack  and  stroke,  cancer,  liver  disease,  sterility,  in creased  cholesterol  levels,  stunted  growth  in adolescents, and-in some  rare cases-death. There is also some  limited evidence that steroids can be  psychologically addictive.  Unfortunately, while most  people  think that steroids are only a problem  among the elite circle of world-class  Olympic athletes, steroid abuse perme ates every level of amateur and prof es sional sports. In a recent survey, 7 per cent of the male high school athletes  said they had or were continuing to  use steroids. And it's almost unbeliev able  that 40 percent of  these users  began before the age of 16. Applied  nationwide, it could mean that 250,000  to 500,000 male high school students  are using steroids.  Not  surprisingly,  this  incredible  demand for illicit steroids fuels an un derground  black market  that  has  become a $400  to $500 million indus try. And in an ominous trend, profes sional drug traffickers have been lured  by these profits and are beginning to  push a new set of poisons upon our  children.  Last year, I added an amendment to  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 that  increased the penalty for illegal distri bution of steroids from a misdemeanor  to a  felony, punishable by up  to 3  years imprisonment. And the penalty  doubles for selling steroids to children.  When I introduced that amendment,  I said that it was only the first step in  what should be a nationwide crack down on steroid trafficking and abuse.  The bill that I am introducing today  ",1989
19,Senate,101,-0.205,223,3,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President,  acts of terrorism appear to be on the  rise  throughout  the world. Far  too  often in the news we learn of new ter rorist actions taking the lives of inno cent and unsuspecting people. While  most of these incidents occur abroad,  often their impact is felt thousands of  miles away from the crime itself, and  we are reminded that no one is com pletely isolated or insulated from ter rorism. The  recent bombing of Pan  Am flight 103 clearly shows us  just  how far-reaching the effects of terror ism can be.  Unfortunately, a number of my con stituents  in  Connecticut  recently  learned about the power and potency  which terrorism has, even to those not  directly involved in the incident.  A few weeks ago, Patrick Finucane  was killed in his home in Belfast. Ac cording  to  reports,  three Protestant  paramilitaries broke  into his home,  shot him  twice  in  the stomach and  once in the head, and then proceeded  to shoot his wife in the leg. Tragically,  this whole incident was witnessed by  their three young children.  Patrick Finucane was an attorney in  Northern  Ireland who  represented  people of all religious affiliations. Al though he was a Catholic, he showed  no  preference  to  Catholics  over  Protestants. In fact, Patrick had a rep utation for being apolitical. His recent  decision to represent a member of the  IRA appears to have precipitated his  death. Even  though Patrick  treated  this case like so many he had taken up  before, apparently others did not ap prove of his work.  Patrick Finucane was killed for pur suing the duties and responsibilities of  his profession. The right of an attor ney to represent a client is fundamen tal right in modern day democratic so cieties. Those who decided  that Mr.  Finucane must die for his professional  pursuits not only infringed upon his  civil  rights, but also needlessly  took  the life of a good and decent man.  This  deplorable  incident  brings  home  the  senseless violence  taking  place between Protestants and Catho lics in Northern Ireland today. Cases  of human rights abuses and killings  are pervasive in this war-torn country.  Needless killings and injuries occur to  the innocent citizens of Northern Ire",1989
20,,101,-0.06,249,3,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Speaker, once again, a  national publication has declared what  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  people I represent have known all along, the  city of Birmingham. symbolizes  the best of  what  the New South has  to offer. With  its  ever-growing economy and cultural diversity,  Birmingham  combines  that  bustling  energy  and driving heartbeat of a big city with  the  warmth,  friendliness, and easy-going manner  of small-city life.  The February 6, 1989,  issue of Newsweek  spotlights Birmingham as  the ""perfect"" place  to  live.  It describes ""The Magic City"" as ""a  friendly, prosperous city  feeding on a high tech blend of biomedical research, engineer ing, and telecommunications."" It notes particu larly the vital  importance of the University of  Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center  to  employment and economic growth, as well as  the  ""fast-growing"" Southern Research  Insti tute, a $40 million nonprofit laboratory.  The article cites  the diversity of  the city,  saying,  ""In all,  some 67,000 service-sector  jobs have been created  in  the Birmingham  area over the past decade-a 27-percent in crease."" Yet,  ""while economic development  has brought excitement to the town, residents  still praise Birmingham as a great place  to  relax.""  So, whether its ""good jobs or good fishing,""  as  the  article  concludes,  Birmingham  has  something  for  just about everyone. With  its  southern hospitality economic base, Birming ham  is  the kind of city  that attracts exactly  what it has to offer, the best and the brightest,  and all of its residents are mighty proud.  TRIBUTE TO AL LARAMORE  HON. C. THOMAS McMILLEN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 1989  ",1989
21,,101,-0.49,288,3,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, it is always inspiring  to watch the outstanding achievements of our  next generation. One such inspiration is a 22year-old St. Louis native named Erik McMillan.  Erik  is earning a  reputation as an up-and coming National Football League star. After  an explosive year as a rookie defensive back  for the New York Jets, the Associated Press  named him  the National Football League's  Defensive Rookie of the Year.  Erik McMillan  follows a  family  tradition of  excellence in sports. His father, Ernie McMil lan  is a  former  standout Cardinal  football  player and his uncle Shellie achieved national  acclaim as Sweet Charlie Brown, a snappy  dribbler for the Harlem Globetrotters.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to con gratulate Erik McMillan on his  fine perform ance and  to wish him every continued suc cess.  I am also happy to share with my col leagues a sampling of press reports about the  triumphs of Erik McMillan.  [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch]  JETS' McMILLAN MAKES HIS MARK IN NFL  DEBUT  (By Dan Caesar>  Whether he's playing  in  the defensive  backfield for the New York Jets or roaming  the streets of the nation's largest city, Erik  McMillan suddenly finds himself thrust into  a new and unfamiliar situation.  Last year, McMillan was the top defensive  player at the University of Missouri, where  he had more unassisted tackles < 203 > than  anyone  else  in  the  team's history. This  season, he is one of two rookies starting in  the Jets' defensive backfield. And he has  discovered it is a  long way from Columbia,  Mo., to New York City-both on and off the  field.  ""This city has  tons of people, and half  don't even know what  they're doing or  where  they are,"" McMillan said. ""I don't  like New York. It's not my style of living.  I'm just here to play ball. At least I don't  have to live here after the season.""  But this fall, he's a New York City area  resident. And McMillan, son of former Car dinals tackle Ernie McMillan, has taken ad vantage of the Jets' desire to revamp what  was a porous defense. He started at free  safety Sunday in the Jets' 28-3, opening-day  loss at New England, and  received high  marks  for his performance. The Patriots  threw two touchdown passes, both to Irving  Fryar-who beat veteran cornerback Bobby  Humphrey each time.  ""Erik played  real well,"" Jets secondary  coach Mike Faulkiner said. ""The only knock  was that he dropped one ball that was right  in his hands that he should have intercept ed.  It hit him  right  in  the  chest and  bounced off.  I  told him  that  if  it was a  bullet, he would have been shot dead.""  But Faulkiner said  that was about  the  only thing he could say negative about Mc Millan's debut  in  the National Football  League.  ""We had him doing a lot of things,"" Faul kiner said. ""We play a 4-3, and we had him  at linebacker some of the time, where he  came up and played the run. He never had  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to cover a receiver one on one, but he did  cover the running backs that way sometimes  and did a fine job. We even sent him in on a  blitz a time or two.""  That is an unusually diversified role for a  rookie, especially one playing  in his  first  regular-season game.  ""We asked him to do things other defen sive backs don't do,"" Faulkiner said. ""He  does a lot more than a rookie is expected to  do. But I don't really consider him a rookie  anymore. He's played  in  four  preseason  games, one  regular-season game and  two  scrimmages. That's seven games, almost as  much as a full college season.""  The Jets have big hopes for McMillan,  who Faulkiner said was in for all 71 of the  Jets' defensive plays Sunday. They like his  speed, versatility and perhaps most of all,  his aggressiveness.  ""I don't want this to sound wrong, but  he's an intimidating hitter and he's the kind  of hitter that it could be another Darryl  Stingley  situation with  him,""  Faulkiner  said. Stingley was a New England receiver  who was left paralyzed by a hit from Oak land's Jack Tatum in 1978.  ""Erik's leverage when he hits somebody is  something else,"" Faulkiner said. ""I don't  mean to sound bad, but he could be deadly.  He's a weapon.""  But after one pro game, McMillan hasn't  developed  that  reputation  yet. And  he  knows the workload will increase as oppos ing quarterbacks zero in on seeing if he and  fellow rookie James Hastey, who plays right  cornerback, can handle their jobs.  ""We'll get all the work we'll need,"" McMil lan said. ""They'll be testing us a  lot. I'm  ready for that. I enjoy the aggressive part  of the game. And we'll be getting lots of on the-job training.""  At Mizzou, McMillan played cornerback,  weak safety, and strong safety. But he said  he never had the responsibility he does now.  For the Jets, McMillan runs the defensive  backfield. He  calls plays,  and barks out  alignment assignments.  When told of what his son did Sunday,  Ernie McMillan was not happy. Erik made  four unassisted tackles and was in on three  other tackles. The seven tackles in which he  was involved was the most for anyone in the  defensive backfield.  ""I hate to hear that,"" Ernie said. ""That's  way too many for someone in the backfield  to be in on. That doesn't speak too well of  what's up front <on the defensive line>.""  Erik is following in this father's path in  more ways than one. Besides both being in  the NFL, Ernie also started his first game  when he was a rookie in 1961 and then went  on to become an All-Pro during his 14-year  playing tenure with the Cardinals.  ""Everything fell into place for me,"" Ernie  said. ""<Kenneth> Panfil got hurt and I got  the job right off the bat. Then Erik gets to  start right away, too-that's nice.""  But not too nice.  ""I really hope everything works out for  him, because that's an awesome responsibil ity he has there,"" the elder McMillan said.  ""To  jump  right out  there,  especially at  safety, is a big load for somebody still learn ing.""  And McMillan knows his son will receive  plenty of early tests.  ""He's playing in a passing division, with  <Miami's Dan) Marino and <Buffalo's Jim)  Kelly,"" Ernie said. ""He's going to have to  learn to be careful not to settle back at free  safety and get lulled when they do a run ning play or two and then not protect the  guy coming across the middle. It's a tough  assignment.""  February 28, 1989  But both father and son are excited about  Erik's situation.  ""I talked to him right before the game,  and I had a hard time settling him down,""  Ernie  said.  ""He was  talking  so  fast,  I  couldn't slow him down.  I knew he was  pretty pumped up.""  And Erik said he knows his dad is exhila rated about the situation.  ""He's really  fired up,"" Erik said. ""He's  given me a lot of advice over the years, and  it's nice to be able to attain this level. We're  proud of each other.""  Missouri coach Wood Widenhofer thinks  McMillan can end up as a star in the NFL.  ""Erik has all  the  tools  to be a  great  player,"" Widenhofer said. ""He is, as far as  athletic ability, right up there with the big  time. He's the kind of guy you build a de fense around. He was our big-play man all  last year.""  McMillan was  ecstatic when  the  Jets  drafted him, in the third round. He quickly  discovered that he had a legitimate shot at  starting as a rookie, because the Jets were  searching for a way  to  tighten a defense  that ranked 20th in the league in pass de fense last year.  ""I didn't want to ride the bench,"" McMil lan said. 'Tm just fortunate enough that  the Lord has been behind me and put me in  a good situation. It's really a learning expe rience. I'm trying to pick up what I can.  ""I just have a lot more calls to make than  I did in school. The players are about the  same size, but the  tempo  is  taken up an other notch. It's more intense.""  McMillan also will be keeping one eye on  the fortunes of Mizzou's football team this  fall. It seems that he is blind to Mizzou in  the other eye.  ""I think they'll do better because  they  have a lot of returning players on defense,  but I don't know anything about  the of fense,"" he said. ""Never did. I didn't pay any  attention to the offense when I was there,  so  I  really don't know anything about  it  now.""  McMillan knows  plenty  about defense,  however. He was burned his share of times  at Mizzou, but he also returned three inter ceptions for touchdowns last season, tying a  National  Collegiate Athletic Association  record.  ""I  really  think he can be a  good pro  player,"" his father said. ""I know he has the  athletic ability. If he can put everything  else together, he'll go far.  ""It's a tough thing, though. Believe me, I  know. But he has the ability to be some thing special.""

There was no objection.  The Clerk read the joint resolution,  as follows:  H.J.

23,House,101,-0.631,301,3,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 33  other Members from both parties, including 18  from California,  I am  introducing  today a bill  which  treats semiautomatic assault weapons  in exactly the same manner as current law for  full automatic machineguns.  Assault weapons are not traditional hunting  weapons. Assault weapons have no practical  value to a civilized society.  If anyone can  tell me why the AK-47, the  Uzi,  the MAC-10,  the TEC-9 shouldn't be  treated  in  the same way  that  full automatic  machineguns, please come forward.  Our pragmatic approach bans the future im portation and domestic manufacture of a spe cific list of semiautomatic assault weapons, in cluding the AK-47, the Uzi,  the MAC-10, the  TEC-9 and  several other assault weapons  recommended as  the weapons of choice of  drug dealers, violent criminals, and  terrorists.  Current  ownership  is  grandfathered,  with  future purchasers required  to go through the  same steps as  those  for  fully automatic ma chineguns: a background check and approval  from  local police, registration of the weapon,  and payment of a $200 transfer tax.  These assault weapons are  found  in  the  cities of Beirut, Tripoli,  and  Johannesburg.  They shouldn't be the drug dealer's weapons  of choice the cities of Los Angeles, Oakland,  or even Des Moines, IA.  Assault weapons are weapons of war; as sault weapons are the weapons of drug deal ers and violent criminals,  they are the weap ons of terrorists and psychopaths.  Enough  is enough. It  is  time  to close  the  loophole in the law and stand by the side of  law enforcement, before more psychos mow  down the next schoolyard.  THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET  ",1989
24,House,101,-0.499,301,3,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  talk  today about  the budget  submitted by the President. My talk  will be incomplete because the budget  is incomplete.  The  first  thing  that ought  to be  noted is that George Bush began his  term with the most extraordinary re fusal  to exercise  the powers of  the  Presidency that we have seen in a long  time. Many of us became, in 8 years,  accustomed to Ronald Reagan insist ing on his right as President to exer cise  the prerogatives of  that office.  Indeed, many conservatives who were  once critics of the excessively powerful  Presidency that they thought began  with  Franklin Roosevelt, many  of  these conservatives during the 1980's  were critical of what they argued were  congressional intrusions on legitimate  Presidential prerogatives.  It was very surprising, the ref ore, to  have George Bush begin his govern ance by submitting to us a budget in  which he resolutely refused to tell us  how he thinks a substantial amount of  the Federal money ought to be spent.  He is clear in some things. President  Bush is clear that we should increase  military spending this year in dollars  sufficient to meet inflation, which is a  far larger increase than he grants to  almost any other part of the Federal  budget.  President Bush was also clear that  we should cut  the Medicare budget  which provides funds for the sick el derly by $5 billion, a cut which I be lieve unwise, which will clearly, in my  judgment, have adverse consequences  on the elderly who are sick, and on  those who try to care for them.  But when it comes to the great bulk  of programs that the Federal Govern ment deals with, education, the envi ronment,  housing,  transportation,  a  number of programs in that general  Government area, many of which are  quite important in carrying out social  purposes, purposes to which the Presi dent  pays  allegiance, George Bush  sent us the unbudget. What the Presi dent said was here is the amount that  I think we have to cut, and it is a very  substantial cut, and here are some pro grams. Now Congress, I am not going  to tell you how much I think should  be spent on any of them. I am only  going to tell you in general that they  ought to be cut.  Mr. Speaker, it is a  failure of the  most egregious sort on the part of the  President to exercise his constitutional  and statutory responsibilities, and  it  ",1989

Sullivan as Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health  and Human  Services, and I am pleased to express  my support and vote for his confirma tion today.  Dr. Sullivan is well-qualified for the  position of Secretary of Health and  Human Services, as reflected in his im pressive  list of accomplishments and  experiences. In July 1975, the 41-year old physician became  the  founding  dean and director of the Medical Edu cation Program at Morehouse College  in Atlanta, GA. He was named  the  first president and dean of the More house School of Medicine when  it  became independent from the college  in 1981.  Before  joining the Morehouse Col lege faculty, he held diverse teaching  and administrative positions. Dr. Sulli van began his academic career as an  instructor of medicine at the Harvard  Medical School from 1963 until 1964.  He later served at the National Insti tutes of Health and as an attending  physician  in Jersey City, NJ. From  1966 through 1975, Dr. Sullivan held  various positions at Boston University  School of Medicine and Hospital  in cluding those of professor of medicine  and physiology and professor of nutri tion. Certainly this wide range of ex perience will serve him well as Secre tary for Health and Human Services.  In addition, Dr. Sullivan belongs to a  number of medical and scientific soci eties, including the American College  of Physicians, where he is a member  of the Health Care Financing Subcom mittee. He also holds many advisory  and  consulting  positions,  including  membership  on  the Robert Wood  Johnson Health  Policy  Fellowship  Board of the National Academy of Sci ences and membership on the Adviso ry Committee  to the Harvard-Massa chusetts Institute of Technology Divi sion of Health and Technology, Dr.  Sullivan has conducted numerous re search projects that include studies on  vitamins and the effects of alcohol on  certain health conditions.

40,Senate,101,-0.443,366,3,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with my colleague from  the Appropriations Committee, Sena tor KASTEN, as well as many other Sen ators, in introducing this bill to deal  with the refugee crisis that has devel oped in our program for Soviet refu gees.  An emergency situation has now de veloped in the flow of Jewish refugees  and others from the Soviet Union. The  number  suddenly  being  allowed  to  leave  the Soviet Union will nearly  double the total last year, and will be  50 percent more than was budgeted or  planned for this fiscal year.  During the President's consultations  with  the Judiciary Committees  last  September,  on  refugee  admissions  under the terms of the Refugee Act,  the administration proposed a ceiling  for the Soviet Union of 18,000 which  was increased to 25,000  in December,  after emergency consultations. But, at  the rate of the current flow of Soviet  refugees,  those numbers will be ex hausted by the end of this month. No  funding will be available, and the pro gram will come to a halt.  Clearly, we have a humanitarian as  well as a foreign policy interest in re sponding to this emergency. As chair man of the Subcommittee on Immigra tion and Refugee Affairs of the Judici ary Committee, we are prepared to use  the emergency provisions of the Refu gee Act to provide the additional ad mission numbers, but this is only half  the problem. The equally  important  other half  is  adequate  funding  for  their processing and resettlement. If  additional  funding  is not  found by  next month, refugees will be  turned  back, left to languish in Rome at great  cost in care and maintenance, and the  voluntary agencies involved in the pro gram will be forced to close down.  We are introducing a bill to deal with  this crisis by drawing on already ap propriated funds that tl}e administra tion proposes to rescind. The fund is  the State  legalization  impact assist ance grants created and funded by the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  of 1986. The administration proposes  to rescind $300 million of this fund in  fiscal year 1990 and again  in  fiscal  year 1991. Furthermore, for fiscal year  1989,  of  the $665 million  available  under the SLIAG Program, CBO re ports that less than $70 million will  probably be actually spent.  We propose to shift $150 million of  these available funds  to support the  processing and resettlement of an ad ditional 25,000 Soviet Jews and other  refugees-the number estimated that  will be moving through the end of this  fiscal year. This will cover the costs of  their processing and resettlement by  the voluntary  agencies,  as well  as  State and local costs.  Clearly, longer term solutions must  be found  to deal with Soviet migra tion. But if we do not respond now to  this emergency, we will be turning our  backs  to  our  longstanding  commit ment to assist Soviet refugees.  Mr. President,  in  introducing  this  legislation,  it  is  not my  intent  to  hamper the efforts of States to assist  beneficiaries of  the recent  immigra tion amnesty through the State Legal ization Impact Assistance Grant Pro gram. State expenses reimbursed by  the program to date have been so low  that the President has proposed a $300  million rescission in each of the next 2  years.  It is my intent to make it easier-not  harder-for States to have access  to  the SLIAG Program for the legitimate  expenses. And  I  am  committed  to  making the adjustments  to the pro gram which many States are currently  seeking, as well as to pursuing for the  future  any  additional  funding  to  States as a result of our emergency re sponse to Soviet emigration.  To this end, I am introducing today  separate legislation as a starting point  for  discussions  regarding  needed  changes in the SLIAG Program.  Let me also note that this emergen cy response is the result of a healthy  partnership between the Federal Gov ernment and the private sector. Orga nizations involved in the resettlement  of refugees  from  the Soviet Union  have launched tremendous fund-rais ing efforts of their own to match the  funds we propose to appropriate to the  program.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of  the bill be printed at this point in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.489  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That (a) of  the unobligated funds appropriated by sec tion 204(a)(l) of the Immigration Reform  and Control Act of 1986 <relating to State  Legalization Impact Assistance Grants)< 1) $50,000,000 are hereby transferred to  the Director of the Office of Refugee Reset tlement of the Department of Health and  Human Services  for use only  for grants  under  the ""Voluntary Agency Programs""  and for grants to States authorized by sec tion 412 of the Immigration and Nationality  Act <relating  to domestic resettlement of  and assistance  to  refugees) and for such  other assistance authorized by such section  as the Director may deem necessary; and  (2) $150,000,000 are hereby transferred to  the account under the Department of State  entitled ""United States Emergency Refugee  and Migration Assistance Fund"".  <b> Amounts transferred under subsection  (a)< 1 > shall be administered  in accordance  with all the laws, rules, and regulations ap plicable to the accounts to which the funds  were transferred, except that the dollar lim itation on appropriated funds contained in  ",1989
41,,101,-0.351,392,3,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, today I call my  colleagues' attention to a cultural exchange of  a different sort. Seventh  to ninth graders at  John Wilson Junior High School  in Brooklyn  will venture to Emerson Junior High School in  Pomona, CA.  This trip is the rewarding culmination of a 2year  correspondence  between  these  two  schools,  a period  in which  letters,  photo graphs,  reports, and even videos were ex changed. Nine students and their teacher, Ro berta Weiss, will  spend  10  days at  their  ""buddy school""  in California attending class es,  living with host  families, and  recording  their trip on video.  It is a long way from Brooklyn to Pomona  and  it is a tribute to the imagination of John  Wilson Junior High School and the concern it  has for its students, that it is providing them  with the opportunity to spend 10 days in a dif ferent environment.  John Wilson Junior High School  is a 950student school  in  the Canarsie  section of  Brooklyn.  Its student body reflects  the com munity's  diverse  ethnic  and  economic  makeup. The school offers a full range of edu cational programs including programs for the  physically  handicapped  and  for gifted  stu dents. John Wilson Junior High School  is a  magnet school  for  telecommunications. The  school possesses a studio  in which  it pro duces a weekly  television show,  ""Next Stop  Canarsie.""  The  video  the  students of  the  school will film during their trip to Pomona will  subsequently be aired on  the school's televi sion show.  I am pleased  to have  this opportunity  to  extend a warm Brooklyn greeting  to  the ex change  students  from Pomona when  they  arrive in Brooklyn. Although New York is dif ferent  from California,  I am certain  that  the  sights  like  Seaview  Park  and  Flatlands  Avenue that Brooklyn has to offer will not be  lost on these young Californians.  Mr. Speaker, while I appreciate that this ex change is not an extraordinary occurrence, in  a  time when  the  rhetoric of education and  ",1989
42,,101,-0.372,405,3,Mr. JOHNSTON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  today I ask for your support of a private bill I  am  introducing  for  relief of Sgt.  James B.  Stanley. While I am aware that the vast major ity of private bills do not gain passage,  I sin cerely believe this case warrants congression al action.  Sergeant Stanley was one of  the military  men unknowingly involved in LSD experiments  during the 1950's. He had volunteered to test  gas masks  for  the Army and was  instead  slipped LSD  repeatedly  in his drinking water  without his consent. He began to hallucinate,  lost his career  in  the Army, was at intervals  violent toward  family members, and his mar riage eventually failed.  It was not until 1975  that the Army finally informed him of his expo sure to LSD, and that the origin of his mental  illness and bizarre behavior became evident to  him.  Sergeant Stanley's case has been heard by  the Supreme Court, and although  the Court  decided against him by a 5-to-4 vote, all  the  judges agreed  that  the  facts of  the  case  proved that Stanley suffered irreparable injury.  The Court cited  the Feres Doctrine as  the  basis for their unfavorable ruling, which grants  the U.S. Government immunity from liability in  the civil courts for servicemen ""where injury  arises out of or are in the course of activity in cident to service.""  Congress has become Sergeant Stanley's  court of  last  resort. As  you  are probably  aware, precedent exists for an award of this  kind. Public Law 96-77 provided for the relief  of James R. Thornwell, who was similarly a  victim of  the Army's LSD  experiments.  In  1976, Congress also granted  relief  for  the  family of Frank R. Olson, a civilian biochemist,  who was given LSD without his consent by  the Army and  subsequently  jumped  to his  death while under the influence.  3193  Supreme Court Justice Brennan,  in his dis senting  opinion,  concluded  that  ""soldiers  ought not be asked to defend a Constitution  indifferent  to  their essential human dignity.""  No action on  the part of  the military could  more deeply offend our national conscience  than  the  involuntary human experimentation  reflected  in  the Stanley case.  I ask my col leagues  to help  redress  in some small way  this extreme miscarriage of justice.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert a copy of  the bill in the RECORD.  H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION I. APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS.

It is a privilege to say that I served in the  U.S. House  of Representatives with  BILL  NICHOLS. He set a standard of representation  of  the people which we should  follow. The  people of the Third District of Alabama were  served well on  this floor and  in  these Halls.  He looked after his local people from the Tus kegee  Institute and Auburn University to the  bedroom counties bordering Montgomery and  Birmingham, and they showed their approval  by continuing to reelect him for the 12th time  shortly before he died.  He served those of us in this institution well  by paying close attention  to his committee  duties. He was a solid rock in the foundation  of the Armed Services Committee, not failing  to question when the need arose, but a strong  supporter of the military. He voiced his con cerns about the defenses of the Marine bar racks near Beirut before the truck loaded with  explosives crashed  the gates and killed 241  servicemen.  As a veteran and staunch defense ally, he  took the helm of the Subcommittee on Investi gations and reformed  the procurement proc ess.  As we  look back  today over his distin guished career of public service, we all can  say that BILL NICHOLS could be a formidable  foe, a committed ally, but always a gentleman  in Alabamian and southern sense of the word.  Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Speaker, we have  lost a colleague whose record of service to  this Chamber is long and distinguished.  Representative BILL NICHOLS  is gone and  today  this Congressman proudly  remembers  the great  friendship we developed over  the  many years. Such  friendship makes our loss  hard to bear, but the memories are great and  everlasting.  Both of us were artillery officers during our  Army careers. We shared a  love of country  and patriotism. We had  jointly attended  the  1 OOth anniversary of  the Army post at Fort  Sill, OK, and we both felt very strongly about  service to the Nation.  In his capacity as a high ranking member of  the Armed Services Committee and chairman  of  its Subcommittee on  Investigations, BILL  NICHOLS worked tirelessly in the Congress to  make military policy work  for America in  the  best possible way.  He put his  talents and energy to work on  behalf of the enlisted men and women who  made  the military work. The everyday men  and women who provide the fuel for the great  engine of our armed services. These people  were the focus of BILL N1CHOLS's great com passion and efforts.  ",1989

50,Senate,101,0.271,483,3,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, under  normal circumstances, a Senator in my  position, newly returned to this body,  and as a  junior member of the Com mittee  on Armed  Services,  would  almost certainly not speak in this body  on the President's nomination for a  Secretary of Defense.  If one in my position felt particular ly strongly or wished to curry a little  bit of favor, he might, however, write  up a short statement and have it in cluded in the RECORD. Under those cir cumstances,  that  statement would  cover the background and experience  of the nominee. It would point out, in  this case, that John Tower served for  four  terms,  some  24  years,  as  a  Member of the U.S. Senate, and all or  almost  all  of  that  time was  as  a  member of the Senate Committee on  Armed Services.  I would probably include the obser vation,  common  to  all  of  his  col leagues, that the work of that commit tee was the work which John Tower  considered to be most important in the  U.S. Senate, on which he spent the  greater part of his great abilities, his  time, and his effort.  Such a statement would point out  his interests in some of the most ar chaic  elements of arms  control, of  weapons systems, of the relationships  among our armed  services,  and,  of  course,  of  the ultimate purpose of  those armed services,  the security of  the United States of America.  Certainly, any such statement would  point  to  the undoubted  intelligence  and thoughtfulness of John Tower. It  would speak admiringly of his dedica tion to his position and to his duties as  a Member of the U.S. Senate, which,  even  in a body of hard-working and  dedicated people, was clearly outstand ing.  If one wanted  to add, perhaps, a  little bit of humor or levity, as one  went on in such a statement to discuss  the strength of character which was  exhibited from  the beginning of his  Senate  career  to  the  end  of  that  career, one might even use the three word  phrase  which  appeared  in  Charles Krauthammer's column in the  Washington Post yesterday, describing  John  Tower  as-and  I  quote-""A  tough little bastard.""  One might finish by pointing out  that after 24 years of service with his  colleagues here in the U.S. Senate and  the people of Texas, whom he repre sented, John Tower went on to repre sent all of the people  in the United  States in a distinguished capacity as  an arms negotiator in Geneva; and, of  course, that he had been selected by a  newly-elected President for the vitally  important post of Secretary of De fense.  It then would have concluded with  an expression of delight at the wisdom  of the President of the United States  for picking such a qualified person for  that position, and a pledge, along with  99 other Members of the Senate, to  vote in favor of that nomination.  That, of course, is not the case here  today. We seem almost to assume all  of those charactistics on the part of  John Tower. As was the case with the  distinguished  junior  Senator  from  Texas, who spoke not long ago, each  of us,  to quote  the praises heaped  upon John Tower, as he retired from  this body and went on  to another  career, praising without exception the  qualities which I have just outlined.  We might even point to a slightly  later episode  in  this body,  in which  early  in 1985 John Tower was con firmed by voice vote, after a unani mous vote of a committee, to be U.S.  Ambassador to the strategic arms re duction talks. That appointment, inci dentally, must also have been accom panied by an FBI  report,  to which  every element of character, which is  relevant here today, must have then  been relevant.  But that is not the way in which this  nomination has  proceeded. We  are  faced here with a report of the majori ty of the members of the Armed Serv ices Committee, which questions or as serts, I might say, more properly, in  spite of  this  long and distinguished  career, a lack of ability to lead the De fense Department on the part of John  Tower. In supporting that conclusion  of  the negative  recommendation of  the majority report, there are four dis tinct, but connected, threads, to that  opposition. First, assertions with  re spect to the nominee's use of alcoholic  beverages.  Second,  his  relationship  with women, the one word character ization of which is womanizing. Third,  his representation of certain defense  interests in the period of time after he  ceased to be an arms control negotia tor in Geneva and before he was se lected for this position by the Presi dent of the United States. Fourth, and  I think it is safe to say, most signifi cantly, a set of objections or reasons  which goes under the title of, and I  have  to  quote  this word,  ""percep tions.""  I would like,  if I may  just briefly,  since  each of  them has previously  been discussed, mention each of those  four objections, and then make a few  independent observations of my own.  We have just heard and seen a debate  over the FBI report. Most particularly,  with  respect  to  allegations  levied  against John Tower connected with  the consumption of alcohol. Since this  is already a part of the public record,  we do know that some of those allega tions are anonymous, some of  them  ",1989

Air Force records, as read to me telephoni cally this afternoon, reveal the following:  One ""Bob"" Jackson, DOB 6 May 1934, was  assigned to Bergstrom Air Force Base from  February 1976 until April 1978.  Sergeant Jackson's first duty day at Berg strom was 21 February 1976. His last duty  day was 16 March 1977.

The Physical Evaluation Board which  evaluated Sergeant Jackson concluded, inter  alia, that Sergeant Jackson exhibited symp toms of a mixed personality disorder with  anti-social  themes and hysterical features.  Air Force records indicate that following 21  March 1977 Sergeant Jackson was unable to  perform his duties as an information spe cialist.

I  am  pleased  that  Senators  PRYOR,  DOLE,  WALLOP,  DANFORTH,  BOREN,  BAUCUS, D' AMATO,  BOSCHWITZ,  BUR DICK, SIMON, and SANFORD have joined  in cosponsoring this legislation which  brings a degree of equity to the farm ers  and  small  business  owners  of  America.

While Congress  has allowed large corporations a 100percent  deduction  for  the  cost  of  health  insurance  for employees and  retired employees, it was not until the  Tax Reform Act of 1986 that Congress  adopted; the provision temporarily al lowing the modest 25-percent tax de duction for the self-employed. And as  a  condition for  taking advantage of  this modest  deduction,  small  firms  must provide health insurance to their  employees  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis.

I hope we will have the courage to  ban these weapons.  They are becoming an  threat to our society.  I urge my colleagues to read this edi torial, which I ask to have printed in  the RECORD.  The editorial follows:  increasing  [From the Chicago Defender, Feb. 11, 19891  BAN HIGH-POWERED ASSAULT WEAPONS  The Defender  sincerely  commends  the  Chicago and Maywood police departments  for working  together  recently  to seize  a  cache of high-powered assault weapons and  explosives in the suburbs of Maywood and  Westchester. Such  incisive  teamwork may  have  saved  countless people  from  being  wounded, maimed or killed  in future vio lence. If ever an ounce of prevention was  worth a pound of cure, this was that time.  A  review  of  the  list of armaments  is  enough to send chills down the spine of any  decent-minded individual. At the Maywood  address, there were a total of 38 weapons,  including eight automatic machine guns,  seven  sawed-off shotguns, one semi-auto matic Uzi machine gun, 20 handguns, 23 live  hand grenades and numerous rounds of am munition. At  the Westchester home, sus pected cocaine, $4,300 in cash, 13 guns and  an undisclosed quantity of ammunition were  confiscated.  Authorities reportedly said the two homes  where the weapons were being kept were so called ""safe houses"" used by gangs. It was  also reported that officials felt the weapons  were destined  for delivery  to a Chicago  street gang. The Defender wants to stress  that  the weapons  reportedly were  fully loaded.  Just think of the damage to society that  could have been done if the 51 weapons and  grenades had been delivered to and used by  the street gangs. Bullets have no eyes. They  do immeasurable damage when fired from a  high-powered  assault weapon held by  a  person who is so  intent on killing a  rival  that the weapon-wielding fool doesn't care  how many innocent bystanders will be hurt  or killed in the process. The media have re ported  innumerable cases of  infants, pre school children, senior citizens, and  inno cent adults being caught in such senseless  shootings. Who is to explain to innocent vic tim's loved ones why his/her precious life  was so heartlessly and unnecessarily extin guished?  There are other horror stories of high powered weapons use such as the time when  mentally unbalanced persons walk  into a  school, shopping center,  fast-food  restau rant or the like and opens fire helter-skel ter.  Chicago  Police  Superintendent  LeRoy  Martin reportedly made a statement which  the Defender  thinks authorities and  law makers should take  into serious consider ation: ""All <the weapons> were created by  the military as war weapons. They have  only one purpose and that is to kill . . . they  were never  intended for civilian use. And  here such weapons are,  in  the hands of  people involved in criminal activity.""  Martin's statement is so on target and in  agreement with the Defender views of the  matter that we at the Defender are strongly  recommending that legislation pass appro priate  laws  to ban high-powered assault  weapons  and any ammunition made  for  them. Let's take a page from the Los Ange les' and Stockton, California book of wisdom  on this issue. The city council of the two  municipalities recently passed legislation to  ban such weapons.  Readers may recall that a man recently  used such a weapon to wound 30 children  and a teacher and kill five youngsters on a  school playground  in  the L.A., Stockton  area. Let's not wait for such a  tragedy to  occur in Illinois. We don't need school chil dren, police officers, or any other decent  citizens  ruthlessly slaughtered because of  someone's indiscriminant use of such arma ments. Ban  the weapons  throughout  the  state and, most  importantly, enforce  the  ban. The Defender wants each citizen  to  support a ban because, as  the old saying  goes, ""The life you save may be your own.""e  THE 72d ANNIVERSARY OF U.S.  CITIZENSHIP  FOR  PUERTO  RICANS   ",1989

Close to 300  people from 28 States were in attendence.  Benjamin Meed, president of the American  Gathering/Federation  of  Jewish  Holocaust  Survivors, spoke at  the National Leadership  Board Meeting to Holocaust survivors on Feb ruary 19.  I wanted to share his remarks with  my colleagues:  AN ADDRESS BY BENJAMIN MEED  We are together again and as always when  survivors get  together,  there  is  a  spark  which ignites our responsibility to remem ber the past and our destiny-in the words  of Elie Wiesel for the dead and the living we  must bear witness. No matter from where in  the nation we come, we have the feeling of  familiarity, bonds that were fused by suffer ing and by a common memory. We know  each other deeply and we also know how  difficult  it  is  for others,  even our best  friends who did not share our experience, to  understand us or  to enter into our inner  soul.  I feel something rather special this after noon for  I  see before me  three different  parts of my life, three ranges of activities  that have consumed my time, my energy,  my  imagination, and my emotions  for so  many years and they have all come together  in one weekend, in one occasion.  First and foremost,  there are the survi vors-you and me. We have traveled a long  journey together, far from the world of our  parents, far from  the world  in which we  began our lives, the world in which values  were shared and endured from one genera tion to another.  Instantly, that world was shattered and  we were thrown into a world of darkness.  We  are  the  fortunate, we  survived,  just  bodies and souls, no homes and no families,  We were displaced people. Then we came to  America. At first we were isolated; and then  we were joined by others. It took time and  hard work, but finally we survivors have as sumed our rightful place in Jewish life and  in American society. We have been together  at commemorations and at Gatherings, at  events  large and  small, all on behalf of  Jewish life and our beloved State of Israel.  We all love America. America did a lot for  us. But America has not changed us, howev er. By our collective  testimony we  have  helped  to change America and especially  American Jewry.  It is for survivors and for our collective  legacy  that  the American Gathering was  born and it is to survivors and to our legacy  have devoted every ounce of my  that  I  energy.  Our  second major  activity  is  now our  teachers program of Holocaust and Resist ance. As you heard from Vladka, who said it  better that I ever could,  the teachers are  our connection  to  the  future. They and  others  like  them will  carry part of our  legacy to the American people, to an entire  generation that was born after Auschwitz  and Treblinka. You have seen  them, our  alumni, their devotion-and how much they  want to learn from us the survivors. Here in  America,  these  teachers  recapture  our  memory and transmit it to the younger gen eration. You have seen their incredible qual ity as human beings and their enthusiasm  to learn and to teach others.  In many European cities, every vestige of  the Second World War and of Nazi tyranny  has been erased. Cities have been rebuilt.  The past has been covered over and  the  memory of Jews forgotten.  So let me thank Vladka. After all, she cre ated the program and she has worked on it  so tirelessly for the past five years.  Another most  important activity of my  life is the United States Holocaust Memori al Museum, located in the heart of our na tion's capital-the national memorial that  will transmit our experience to future gen erations of Americans. It is a Museum, but  not only a Museum. I am personally grate ful that Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff point ed this out in his remarks yesterday. It is an  educational institution that will include ar chives and an International Center for Hol ocaust Studies, a Learning Center and edu cational programs  for an anticipated one  million American visitors each year.  Imagine if someone had suggested in 1946,  the year we came to the shores of America,  that this would be possible-we would have  taken him for mad. Imagine if someone had  told you in 1976 that a national memorial  would be built under government auspices  on  the National Mall  in Washington, we  would have taken him for a lunatic. Maybe  we were meshugge-because while others  told us to forget, we insisted on remember ing and we will reap the fruits of our collec tive commitment. A national memorial will  be  built  in  our  lifetime-within  three  years-and it will convey  the Jewish and  human tragedy  in a manner authentic to  history.  So my friends, this weekend we meet as  one: survivors, teachers and Museum build ers. For it is our common task that brings us  together. We still must learn from one an other. But above all, we must respect each  other. We  are  interdependent-we  need  each other. Each one of these groups must  appreciate what the other groups can give  to our common task.  Yet at this hour, we survivors meet alone  as we should, to take stock of the past and  to ask some questions about  the  future.  Where do we go as an organization? What is  our task as survivors for  the next several  years? This question must concern us today.  This should be our main agenda item.  Let us begin with an honest-and pain ful-assessment  of our greatest enemy time. Within a quarter of a century, there  will be no survivors  left  to bear witness.  Each day our numbers diminish and each  year our energy wanes. So first and fore most our concern must be to finish what we  alone can  inspire others  to complete be cause we are the eyewitnesses-because we  were there in the pit of hell.  Not only in Washington, but also in New  York, Los Angeles, Miami and other cities,  they are building major memorials to the  Holocaust. Survivors are involved with each  of these important institutions as we should  be. We have contributed to each of these in stitutions as we should and we have served  as a conscience for each of them, demanding  that they tell a  truthful story, that it be  told with dignity and in a manner equal to  the magnitude of the event.  We  have  additional  contributions  to  make-not only monetary, but material as  well. Many of us have artifacts-uniforms,  photographs  and  documents-that  have  been stored away in our homes. These arti facts will be of interest to our children, but  they may have a greater power to instruct  the generations, to provide a compelling and  enduring documentation of our experience.  It is time to clean out our attics and base ments, to contribute the physical remains of  our memory so that the story that will be  told in the museums can reflect our experi ence.  I was disturbed last fall-as I am sure you  were-to read in the press that two letters  written by Anne Frank were sold in a public  auction for $160,000. We now see that unless  we  take a stand, unless we protest, Holo caust artifacts will become a business and  the material  remains will be sold  to  the  highest bidder. We cannot allow  that  to  happen, and, frankly, if we permit this, then  ultimately, it will be the enemy who prof its-Nazis will  sell  their memorabilia,  the  Polish government will be sitting on a gold  mine and the Czechs will make a fortune off  the Precious Legacy. Only the moral voice  of the survivor can put an end to this vul garity.  Secondly, we must  individually  tell our  stories, record our memories for posterity.  In many communities there are oral history  programs designed to record the experiences  of survivors. They are being conducted in a  sensitive and considerate manner. We great ly appreciate their work. Oh yes, survivor  testimony must be given, gathered, and con served, but it must be shared by all reputa ble institutions.  My fellow survivors, it is time to tell what  can be told so that none of us will leave this  earth without sharing our tragic and heroic  story. I know it is painful and difficult-but  it is so necessary. And these oral testimonies  cannot be the property of any one institu tion. We must insist that they be shared  among Washington, New York, Detroit, Los  Angeles and others, so that all can learn.  Finally, for the past decade the American  Gathering has been compiling a registry of  Jewish Holocaust Survivors, the names and  experiences and families of  tens of  thou sands of survivors who came to the United  States. We have the single most important  archives on the survivors in the world. The  American Gathering has the largest collece This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

57,,101,-0.279,613,3,Mr. BATES.," Mr. Speaker, today I introduce  the Rural Electrification Administration Lend ing Assistance Improvements Act of 1989. Not  only  is my proposal bipartisan, covering  the  full  spectrum  of  congressional  political  thought,  it  is also supported by  the National  Taxpayers Union,  the National Tax Equality  Association, the National Propane Gas Asso ciation, the Alliance for Fair Competition, and  other worthwhile associations of public  inter est.  This  legislation would bring REA  lending  programs  in  line with changes  in  the condi tions of rural electric and  telephone service.  When  the program was begun  in 1936,  few  farms had electricity or  telephones. Today,  these services are available from  the Florida  Keys  to  remote Alaskan villages above  the  Arctic Circle. Quality rural utilities are available  in every corner of rural America.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  But with REA's original  task seemingly all  but completed, the REA  is still going strong,  pumping taxpayer money-about $1 billion an nually-into areas of the country far removed  from  the little house on  the prairie. And,  this  money is highly subsidized.  Over the  last 15 years,  the value of REA  subsidies amounts to over $50 billion. Some  of  these moneys subsidize  the power  from  REA-backed nontaxpaying cooperatives to re charge golf carts at Hilton Head  Island, the  spa where 18 holes can  run $97.50. Other  subsidized  loans provide power to Kuwait In vestment Co.'s pleasure island of Kiawah, SC,  as well as other sunshine resorts.  Mr.  Speaker,  Federal  below-market-rate  loans don't end with  the sunshine  resorts.  Tax-free  REA  cooperatives  also  provide  power  to  the burgeoning  leisure economies  and condominium complexes of Vail, Aspen,  and Snowmass.  Simply stated,  these ski playgrounds and  the sunshine  tanning centers of  the wealthy  don't  require  high-subsidy  loan  assistance.  This legislation would reform  these unneces sary subsidies.  Mr. Speaker, a good question is: Why have  such extravagant subsidies so  long been  tol erated when the country cries for cost cutting  budget reform? Well,  that's a good question.  Simply put, with apologies  to Will Rogers,  ""Some Congressmen never met a spending  bill they didn't like.""  Today,  without  question,  this  legislation  makes a clear call for reform. And it does so  on a sound base. Today, unlike 1936, nearly  all REA borrowers are financially healthy and  profitable. Some REA electric power supply  borrowers and their affiliated distribution mem bers have assets that exceed companies on  the Fortune 100  list of  largest U.S. enter prises. Our bill  recognizes  this change and  would make  the appropriate  reform-by  re placing high-subsidy REA direct  loans with  loan  guarantees when  assisting  legitimate  rural borrowers.  Under current law, areas that were rural  in  former times but are no  longer rural continue  to  receive high subsidy assistance. About 5  percent of REA borrowers serve largely met ropolitan areas, not  rural areas. During  the  period 1980 to 1985, these urban and subur ban borrowers received nearly 20 percent of  all electric loans aimed at rural communities.  Our bill says ""once a borrower, always a bor rower"" is bad policy. We would stop this prac tice and assist only legitimate rural borrowers.  The  telephone program  is no different. A  number of REA borrowers are subsidiaries of  major, multimillion dollar  telecommunications  holding companies. One of these outfits, with  sales and assets of $2.6 billion and $5.1 bil lion respectively, took nearly 10 percent of all  telephone  loans during  the  1980  to  1985  period. As a group, these holding companies,  representing 7.5 percent of all telephone bor rowers  took 25.5 percent of  the money be tween 1980 and 1985. These holding compa nies are playing  in  the Euro and Wall Street  bond markets. Multimillion dollar companies  have no place taking high-subsidy assistance  from hard-working  taxpayers. Our bill would  stop this practice.  Does  this  legislation cause serious prob lems in providing affordable, quality utilities to  3401  rural America? The answer is no; a resound ing no. There would be no drastic increase in  farmers' utility bills under our proposal. The  Congressional Budget Office and the Office of  Management and Budget agree on  that. The  Congressional Budget Office previously report ed  that moving  to a more market oriented  loan  rate above  the highly subsidized REA  rate ""* * * would have little effect on most co operative's rates as  interest charges account  for only a small percentage of  the average  ratepayer's bill."" The Office of Management  and Budget  in conjunction with  the Depart ment of Agriculture and  the Rural Electrifica tion Administration report that the  impact on  the typical ratepayer would be ""only 7 4 cents  per month.""  Now Mr. Speaker, does the package save  any money? Yes. Projected savings from cur rent  services  and  countable  savings  for  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings purposes  result  in  nearly $5 billion over the next 5 years. This  legislation produces savings that are dramatic  and real. At the same time, our legislation re mains sensitive to rural America. It does not  abolish REA nor does  it cause a drastic  in crease in farmer's utility bills. It is a reform bill  that provides continued generous Federal as sistance to those who need it while eliminat ing assistance to those who don't.  In those few cases where a borrower is ex periencing  financial hardship, our  legislation  provides a wholly reliable safety net. This leg islation ensures that a borrower in  true need  gets direct, high-subsidy assistance. The pro posal does not threaten quality, reliable, and  affordable service to rural America.  Americans  have  long been  generous  to  those who truly need help. This attribute is the  cornerstone of our  country's strength. We  help one another. However, unless we open  our eyes to changes and make the appropri ate  reforms  in Federal spending, we simply  won't have enough resources to meet the crit ical needs of today. Frankly, no one has to be  an expert in rural utility service to know that  conditions have changed since REA was cre ated in 1936. The help that was once needed  has been largely satisfied.  This legislation can reform the program, and  reduce our costs without harming rural Amer ica or abolishing REA.  It allows us,  in a sub stantial way,  to  find  the  resources  to meet  other urgent needs of today's America.  In essence, our bill  follows  the advice of  Mark Twain, which was, ""Do what's right and  you'll please some of the people and astound  the rest."" We have an opportunity here to do  what's right and astound  those who believe  Congress never met a spending bill  it didn't  like.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting  this  legislation which strikes  the proper bal ance between the legitimate interest of all par ties.  Mr. Speaker, the bill follows:  H.R. 1232  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the  United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as the ""Rural Electrifica tion Administration Lending Assistance Im provements Act of 1989"".

60,Senate,101,0.275,704,3,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  March is recognized as National Nutri tion Month. In addition, the American  School Food Service Association has  designated the week of March 5-11 as  National School Breakfast Week.  I have assumed the position of rank ing Republican on the Nutrition Sub committee during this Congress. As a  member of the subcommittee, I have  been  a  long-time  supporter of  the  school lunch and school breakfast pro grams. I've visited and eaten at several  schools in Minnesota during my time  in the Senate.  Over the past couple yea.rs we have  seen  increasing attention focused on  the School Breakfast Pro~~ram. Many  school teachers have told me how dif ficult it is to teach a hungry student  who has not had breakfast. A provi sion I authored to increase reimburse ment for school breakfast was includ ed in the Hunger Prevention Act en acted last year.  The federally funded School Break fast Program has been an excellent in vestment in preparing today's children  to be tomorrow's strong, healthy, and  well-educated leaders. However, many  school  districts  have been  slow  to  adopt  the  program. Objections  to  starting up a breakfast program, how ever  well-intentioned,  affect  those  least able to bear it-children.  Recently the National Education As sociation  [NEAJ  released  a  report  about the effects of hunger on chil dren's ability to learn. ""The Relation ship Between Nutrition and Learning:  A School Employee's Guide to Inf or mation and Action"" is the title of the  report that the NEA developed along  with the Food Research and Action  Center. This report highlights the im portance of food and good nutrition to  growing children.  The  study  provides  information  about  the  breakfast  program  and  other children nutrition programs and  provides suggestions for educators and  school employees about how to get a  breakfast program  started at  their  school.  I ask that articles about the  report and the School Breakfast Pro gram from the Washington Post and  the New York Times be printed in the  RECORD.  The future of our country's children  are at stake. As any parent or teacher  can attest, we cannot feed a child's  mind without first feeding his or her  stomach. I would hope that educators  or interested parents would ask their  schools to look at the breakfast pro gram and consider participation. This  is  a  very  important  initiative  that  meets a critical need for our Nation's  children.  The articles follow:  [From the New York Times, Feb. 8, 1989]  EATING WELL  EDUCATORS SOUND THE ALARM AS EVIDENCE  SHOWS THAT HUNGER CAN IMPEDE LEARNING.  <By Marian Burros>  WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-Increasing poverty  among children  in the United States has  generated such concern among educators  that the National Education Association has  released a report documenting the deleteri ous effects of hunger on a child's ability to  learn.  The report, ""The Relationship Between  Nutrition and Learning: A School Employ ee's Guide to Information and Action,"" also  provides practical suggestions  for parents  and school employees interested in attract ing more children to the free and reduced price school lunch and breakfast programs  and for improving the quality of the meals.  The report comes at a time when the final  Reagan Administration budget recommend ed a $614.4 million cut in the 1990 school  lunch program. Research published in the  American Journal of Agricultural Econom ics in 1975 indicated that for every 10 cents  cut from the lunch program there was a 10  percent decline in participation.  Spokesmen for  the Bush Administration  said  there would be no comment on  the  status of  the school  lunch program until  after  the President's budget  speech  on  Thursday evening.  At a news conference here last week, Mary  Hatwood Futrell, president of the education  association, said the report deserved imme diate action. ""Today one out of every five  American children is poor,"" she said. ""If the  trend continues, by 1990, 40 percent of our  children will be living in poverty.""  For some children, she continued, ""school  breakfast or lunch may be not only the best  meal they get, it may be their only meal,  and hungry or undernourished children find  it harder to learn.""  According to the report, a 1986 survey of  emergency food centers in Minnesota, for  example,  found  that 21 percent of 13,176  households with  children  reported  that  their children missed meals on a  regular  basis because there was not enough money  to buy food.  The report also mentioned another survey  conducted in 1987 by the United States Con ference of Mayors. It docume:p.ted an 18 per cent increase in the number of families with  children who were seeking emergency food  in major cities nationwide.  The  education  association  report  also  cited  recent  studies  that  examined  the  impact of hunger on learning. The findings  indicated that hunger leads to nervousness,  irritability and disinterest;  that skipping  breakfast often  causes  nausea,  dizziness,  headache and fatigue in the morning, and  that the hungry child is passive, apathetic  and timid.  In  1987,  for  example,  researchers  at  Boston and Tufts Universities investigated  the impact of the school breakfast program  on children in Lawrence, Mass. They looked  at achievement test results of children in  the third through sixth grades for the year  before and the year after the breakfast pro gram  began.  They  concluded  that  the  school breakfasts were responsible for sig nificant improvements in attendance and in  standardized achievement test scores.  The education association's report, pre pared by  the Food Research and Action  Center, a Washington-based nonprofit orga nization that works on behalf of the disad vantaged, was commissioned because educa tors were concerned that increasing num bers of children were unable  to do  their  school work because  they are hungry or  malnourished.  Teachers  said  they  had  heard more and more children complaining  that they hadn't had much to eat or had  stomach aches; some teachers reported that  students actually fainted in class.  Buttressing their observations was a 1987  report from  the Carnegie Foundation for  the Advancement of Teaching, which found  that more  than  two-thirds of  the 22,000  teachers surveyed nationwide in kindergar ten through high school said undernouris ment was a problem in their schools.  The school lunch program served 24 mil lion children in 1987 and 1988, half of whom  received meals  free-of-charge, while  the  school breakfast program reached 2.7 mil lion. Before  budget  cuts made  by  the  Reagan Administration in 1981, the school lunch program served 26 million children,  the school breakfast program, 3.8 million.  The National Education Association plans  to join other groups in lobbying Congress to  block the proposed cuts in the 1990 school lunch program.  Mrs. Futrell said the Federal Government  was not likely to spend as much money on  social services,  including school lunch and  breakfast, as it has in the past. ""I think we  will be relying more on volunteers, private  organizations and the business community  to support the programs,"" she said.  SCHOOL LUNCHES NEED NOT BE FEARED  The  National  Education  Association  report recommends that teachers, school of ficials and other school employees work in  their schools  to  improve participation  in  lunch and breakfast programs.

61,Senate,101,-0.214,717,3,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my friend and colleague from Virginia  for the explanation that has just been  offered.  I would simply caution my  good friend and colleague from Wyo ming. If you do not believe everything  that you read in the FBI report, do  not necessarily believe that report is  any more authoritative on some mat ters than the Evans-Novak story in the  paper today.  I believe that the Senator from Vir ginia has highlighted what I was going  to say in rebuttal to that charge.  I  just say I  think it is sad indeed  that we feel it necessary to come on to  the floor of the U.S. Senate and di rectly or indirectly impugn the motive  of our colleagues. We all know this has  been a very, very difficult task for all  of us-the majority and the minority.  I just want to make it very clear that  the facts of the matter are money was  saved from taxpayers' expense in the  way this was handled by the chairman  of the committee which is customary  because on that airplane that went out  it was not just SAM NuNN's chief of  staff for the committee, but there was  the majority staff director, the minori ty staff director, and the White House  lawyer that my friend from Virginia  has already referred to who had to go  along because it should be understood  by now that the White House report is  never given  to a courier other than  someone who has authority to handle  the  report. That  is why  the White  House lawyer went along. In addition,  there was a military escort that has  been properly outlined by my  col league from Virginia.  So I  think we can have our differ ences of opinion but how the report  was carried out there and whether or  not it was a good idea to take a mili tary aircraft is not a valid point con cerned. In fact, from that perspective,  it has been brought out that was the  cheapest way for this to be handled.  Also, as Senator WARNER has very  well outlined, time was of the essence.  This was on January 7. I remember it  very well because I talked on the tele phone with Senator NUNN that day in  Phoenix or wherever he was. I do not  remember where he was. He told me  that Senator WARNER was there. I had  received  some  information  that  I  thought that it was critically impor tant that I relate to the chairman. I  did so over the telephone. He told me  that the report was on its way out at  that time, and that they were doing  this so we could speed up the process  because  the  record should show we  were not scheduled to come back into  session until January 20. I know Sena tor NUNN, and I suspect also that Sen ator WARNER, felt that the sooner they  had the opportunity as the leaders of  the committee to address this subject  and study the report, get the process  going, we would be better prepared  when we finally did get back to call  the full committee into session to dis cuss the nomination which we did.  Just one other point. I heard early  about the charge of an Eastern-bloc  woman and his relationship. I did not  believe  it at  the  time.  I  also heard  some time before it broke in the press  the episode about the drunken balleri na-supposedly-Soviet, and on top of  the piano dancing.  I did not believe  that either. As it turned out, I think  that  the FBI  report  among other  things closed an awful lot of loopholes  with regard to allegations that were  simply not accurate.  If I were the opposition to my posi tion on the Tower nomination, I, too,  would use  these  reports which are  unfair, unfair to John Tower, unfair  to the process. I too would use them in  an attempt to imply that everything  that we know about John Tower that  possibly would not be shed in the best  light  follows  the  irresponsibility of  those who made those accusations.  As I have said on many occasions, 90  percent of what I have heard and seen  and studied on  this matter  is sheer  garbage. Ten  percent  at  least has  given me grave pause for concern. And  therefore I  think it not accurate  to  assume that because there were unfor tunate stories released  to  the press.  This Senator can say that I have never  released one shred of evidence to the  press. And  I have  talked  to  lots of  them.  It is unfortunate  that  these  come out. I feel sorry about that. But  nevertheless the process has to go for ward, and there are other things that  cause me enough pause for concern  that I am opposed to the nomination.  I yield the door.  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.  ",1989
62,Senate,101,-0.095,730,3,Mr. HEFLIN.,"  I  thank my distin guished friend from Arizona for yield ing time. We all have time problems,  and my statement is short.  Mr. President, I wish I had been able  to enjoy the privilege of reading the  FBI reports at one or two sittings, but  other duties have  required  that my  review of these reports occur over a  number of days. Today I finished that  task.  I  also have spent considerable  time  talking with  and  listening  to  members of the Armed Services Com mittee, reading and rereading the com mittee report, reading commentaries,  and  listening to  the debates on the  confirmation of former Senator John  Tower to be Secretary of Defense.  I do not believe I have heard anyone  question his qualifications for the po sition of Secretary of Defense. Univer sally, it has been proclaimed that he is  qualified from the standpoint of expe rience, knowledge, and intelligence to  be an outstanding head of our Defense  Department.  This is not like a  judicial appoint ment. Judicial nominees are with us  for life and serve in a coequal branch  of Government. Cabinet members are  usually with us during the term of the  President or  for  a  period of  time  which the President determines, and  serve  in his branch of Government.  We hold the President accountable for  the conduct of  the members of his  Cabinet. It is the President's Cabinet,  not Congress' Cabinet.  However,  the position of Secretary  of Defense  is  different  from other  Cabinet positions because the security  of this Nation rests on his shoulders  more  so  than  any  other Cabinet  member.  In reviewing all of  the charges,  I  have concluded  that his conduct  in  many areas is not applaudable and not  without justifiable criticisms, but, on  the other hand, not disqualifying. Be cause of the sensitivity of the position  as Chief Deputy Commander in Chief  of the Armed Services of the United  States,  I  do  have  concerns  about  whether such a position should be en trusted to a person who has a drinking  problem.  I have served in the U.S. Senate with  John Tower for 6 years. If he had a  drinking problem during the period of  1979-84, I did not know it. I never saw  him under the influence of alcoholic  beverages; and, frankly, do not remem ber ever hearing any gossip that he  had such a problem. Service  in  the  U.S.  Senate  is  extremely  stressful.  Long hours, sometimes all night ses sions, periods of elation and periods of  depression-moments of victory  and  moments of defeat. Such stressful life  is conducive to drinking, and overin dulgence. While he, like all of us, has  faults, I never heard that John Tower  had a drinking problem or never saw  anything to give me concern during  the  time  I  served with him  in  the  Senate. I might say in passing that my  observation convinces me that the vast  majority-and I mean almost unani mously-of the Members of the Senate  do not have a drinking problem.  I have reviewed the FBI reports very  carefully. Such reports are not conclu sive as to whether he had a drinking  problem in the 1980's  that impaired  his judgment on issues in his official  governmental  capacities. Reasonable  people can read the reports and come  to different views as to the correctness  of the charges. Even if convinced that  he exhibited a drinking problem on oc casions, reasonable persons can differ  on the effect that it might have had  on his duties or the potential that it  might have on his responsibilities as  Secretary of Defense.  He has made a pledge that he will  not drink any alcoholic beverage of  any kind during his tenure as Secre tary of Defense, if confirmed. He said  that if he breaks that pledge he will  immediately resign. Should the Senate  accept such a pledge? Some say his  past conduct is such that his pledge  should not be accepted. But on  the  other hand, he says his pledge is tan tamount  to his oath  to def end and  support  the  Constitution  of  the  United States.  I believe  the  issue comes down  two questions. First,  if he were  to  to  ",1989
63,,101,-0.631,756,3,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, during the Ways  and Means Committee's February hearings on  the budget,  I was most  impressed by  the  statement of Dr. Rudolph Penner of the Urban  Institute.  He has done an exceptional job of broadly  explaining how we got into this mess, what it  means for our children, and some of the ways  we can get back on course so that our chil dren have a better  life. And he says,  the  debate on the budget trends,  All boils down to the question of what sort  of country we wish to leave to our descend ents and  fundamentally,  this  is  a moral  question. I find it very difficult to come up  with a moral rationale for doing much less  for our descendents than our ancestors did  for us.  The full text of his statement follows:  ECONOMIC AND BUDGET ISSUES  <Statement of Rudolph G. Penner,* Senior  Fellow, The Urban Institute)  Mr. Chairman and members of the com mittee, I would like to thank you for this  opportunity  to  testify  on  economic  and  budget issues.  THE ECONOMY  Since reaching its deepest post-World War  II  trough  in 1982,  the economy has per formed admirably. We are beginning  the  seventh year of an extremely healthy recov ery, manifested by the fact that inflationary  pressures are still moderate. There are no  obvious imbalances that signal that a reces sion is imminent, although it must be admit ted that recessions are seldom recognized  until after they begin.  The economy is, however, operating near,  if not at, full capacity, and demand is ex panding too rapidly by a very small margin.  Chairman Greenspan has emphasized his  concern about present rates of inflation and  the Federal Reserve System  is gradually  tightening monetary policy. It is an environ ment that leaves little room for error. Too  little tightness and inflation could acceler ate to the point that it will be very painful  to cure. Too much, and an economy that is  not extremely strong could sink into reces sion. Under  the circumstances,  I  believe  that the Federal Reserve is doing as skillful  a job as is possible.  I would like to see the Fed aim for about 6  percent nominal GNP growth over the next  two  years. That would maintain  slight  downward pressure on inflation. The Fed is   The views expressed are those of the author and  do not necessarily reflect the views of the trustees,  executives, or staff of the Urban Institute.  not explicit about its goals, but it seems to  me  that current policy  is,  in very  rough  terms, consistent with  this nominal GNP  goal. If I am right, that is likely to allow  much less real growth than is assumed by  the administration in its budget projections  and a bit less growth than is assumed by  CBO. That would put actual attainment of  the Gramm-Rudman targets beyond reach  politically, but  it will be much easier  to  reach them on paper using administration  assumptions. With any good luck economi cally, that should still be true next August.  Any deficit reduction that can be enacted  would be very helpful to the Federal Re serve. The same target for demand growth  could then be achieved with lower short term interest rates.  THE BUDGET DEFICIT  It has suddenly become stylish to argue  that budget deficits do not matter much. I  believe that that is far from the truth, but  it is easy to understand how such a belief  could arise.  Those who warned that some sort of eco nomic catastrophe would result from  the  deficit are said to have been proved wrong,  because the economy has behaved so well. I  would  provide  another  interpretation.  Those previously crying doom and gloom  may or may not have been wrong analytical ly, but I would argue that we shall never  know. Partly in response to worries about  the budget policies of the early 1980s, policy  was changed significantly. A steady series of  tax increases since the middle of 1982 is pro viding extra revenue equivalent to almost 3  percent of the GNP. Spending restraint has  been impressive both in the entitlement and  discretionary civilian budget categories. And  most important quantitatively for spending,  budget authority for defense began to be  cut in real terms by roughly 2 percent per  year starting in fiscal 1986.  As a result of such actions and the pro longed,  healthy  economic  recovery,  the  budget deficit has fallen, relative to GNP,  for a high of 6.3 percent in fiscal 1983 to 3.2  percent in fiscal 1988.  I, for one, am not  nearly as concerned as I was in the mid1980s after the interest bill on the debt rose  24 percent between 1983 and 1984, and the  problem  threatened  to explode. More  re cently, the interest bill has been rising at  less  than half that rate and has a good  chance of now stabilizing relative to GNP.  The probability that an exploding interest  bill will eventually force us to monetize the  debt and cause a hyper-inflation has become  miniscule.  Another fear of many is that the depend ence on foreign capital inflows engendered  by the budget deficit creates inherent insta bility  in  foreign  exchange markets  that  could lead to a foreign exchange crisis. This  possibility still exists, but my own worries  about  it  have waned  considerably  since  early 1988 when it became clear that we had  satisfactorily weathered the storm caused  by the October 1987 crash. I was also reas sured when private foreign investors, who  had greatly reduced lending to the United  States during 1987, returned in 1988. More over, the trade and current account deficits  improved considerably in 1988.  We are still, however, expecting foreign  investors to add significantly to their bal ances of dollar assets in percentage terms  this year and there are some signs that the  improvement  in our external balances  in  ending. Consequently, the probability of a  foreign exchange crisis is greater than zero,  but I believe that it is considerably lower  than it was only one year ago.  However, saying that the budget deficit is  unlikely to cause an economic crisis is far  from saying that it is not harmful. It is, in  fact, having highly undesirable effects, but  they are occurring slowly rather than all at  once. In fiscal 1988, the Federal deficit ab sorbed more than 60 percent of the nation's  net private saving. This extraordinary ratio  is a reflection both of the large relative size  of the Federal deficit compared to those of  past  history  and  the  unusually  small  amount of net private saving.  The low level of net private saving com bined with the high level of the Federal def icit implies that the nation's stock of net  wealth is growing very slowly and that our  generation is leaving our descendants with  much less capacity to improve their stand ard of living than our predecessors left us.  Moreover, our descendants will face the  burden that we  largely escaped. After the  first decade of the 21st century, the ratio of  the retired to working population will rise  rapidly. Therefore, if the United States re mains a  low saving, high deficit society,  income growth will be lower than it would  be otherwise and a greater portion of the  income growth will have to be transferred  from the working to the retired population.  Nevertheless, with any luck at all, future  workers should still be better off than cur rent workers. It is just that the rate of im provement from generation  to generation  will be much lower than the United States  has been accustomed to in past history. The  size of the American economy will decline  more rapidly relative to the size of other  economies and this is likely to weaken our  long-run military influence and our interna tional bargaining power in trade policy and  other matters.  It all boils down to the question of what  sort of country we wish to leave to our de scendants  and  fundamentally,  this  is  a  moral question.  I  find  it very difficult to  come up with a moral rationale for doing  much less for our descendants than our an cestors did for us.  THINKING ABOUT THE BUDGET STRATEGICALLY  Deficit reduction has been very difficult  for two reasons. First, the pain involved is  immediate in the form of program cuts or  higher taxes while  the gains  take a very  long time to accrue and are fairly nebulous.  Second, the issues are extraordinarily com plex and difficult to explain. That is be cause we are not only debating the effects  of the deficit per se, but we are simulta neously debating the proper role of the Fed eral government in our society. Those who  wish to solve the bulk of the deficit problem  through spending cuts clearly want a small er government that both provides few bene fits and interferes with our lives very little.  Those who want to solve the problem prie This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

65,Senate,101,0.301,808,3,Mr. RUDMAN.," Let me just conclude  by  stating  that  the Senator  from  Washington  and  the Senator  from  Maine hit on very key points. The  Senator  from Arizona mentioned  a  while ago that he would like to have  the FBI  report  sanitized and made  public. I do not have a problem with  that except I know that the chairman  of the Armed Services Committee him self, in conversations we have had, has  agonized over  the  fact  that we  are  dealing with anonymous sources and  uncorroborated testimony. That is not  his fault. That is the system, and that  is the way it came here.  But this is so extraordinary. It just  seems  to me  that  to vote  this man  down  based  on  evidence  that well  could be furnished by people who are  lying, who are fabricating, who are uncorroborated,  and  uncross-examined,  sets a very troubling precedent.  I do not know what the solution is. I  see my good friend from South Caroli na is on the floor. I have worked with  Senator HOLLINGS  for  a  long,  long  time. I would have great confidence if  Senator HOLLINGS  and  the Senator  from New Mexico and  the Senator  from  the State of Washington,  just  three Senators I know have a  lot of  legal experience, could sit down with  some of these witnesses and examine  them  even  without  John  Tower  present.  I  think we would  find out  whether they were reliable or not.  I am talking about reliability, about  basic decency  to a human being so  that he can at least have his accusers  called to account for themselves.

If Mr. Pickering can improve any of  the aspects of anti-Americanism and  pro-Communist bias within the United  Nations, he would have performed his  job well.  Mr. President, the challenges faced  by the United States at the United Na tions are obviously significant. Indeed,  the United  States  remains  under  almost constant assault in that body.

68,Senate,101,-0.212,847,3,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing the Sole Community  Hospital Preservation Act of 1989, a  bill that guarantees adequate access to  health care to rural Americans.  We cannot wait to provide this guar antee.  The  financial  pressures  on  access critical hospitals are building,  and corrective action is needed during  the lOlst Congress to avert a human  and economic disaster in rural Amer ica.  To understand how we have come to  this precipice,  it  is  important to re member that the Medicare Prospective  Payment System [PPS] was designed  to  increase  hospital  efficiency  and  reduce costs, not improve, or maintain,  access  to health care. With  this  in  mind, let's examine the consequences,  both good and bad, that have taken  place as a  result of the move  from  Medicare cost-based reimbursement to  prospective payment.  Considering its goals, PPS has been  exceedingly  successful.  Indeed,  a  recent  report  in  the New England  Journal  of Medicine  by Dr. Alice  Rivlin of Rutgers University, estimates  that in 1990 PPS will reduce hospital  insurance trust fund payments by $18  billion. This represents a  significant  contribution to our important job of  cutting the Federal budget deficit.  PPS has accomplished this efficien cy by careful peer review  to reduce  hospital admissions, and by providing  an averaged per-case payment  that  allows Congress  to  establish Medi care's annual expenditure for hospi tals in advance. However, for this aver aged payment to be equitable, for ex ample,  to  average  reimbursement  losers and winners, a hospital must  maintain an adequate patient volume.  When volume is  low a  few high-cost  cases make hospitals lose money. They  are inefficient.  In a competitive health care environ ment, particularly when 50 percent or  more of a hospital's discharges are  paid  for  by Medicare,  the  conse quences of inefficiency can be harsh.  These consequences  include progressive reduction of capital reserves,  in ability  to  acquire  new  technology,  physician dissatisfaction with services  leading to a further reduction of ad missions, and ultimately, bankruptcy  and closure.  Over the past 4 years 233 hospitals  have  closed  nationwide, more  than  half in rural areas.  When we are told that there may be  300,000  excess hospital beds  in  this  country, is the closure of a hospital a  bad  thing? Well, we need  to define  what we mean by bad.  Let's say the hospital is in Chicago, a  city with  a  population  of  about  3,010,000 and a metropolitan area of  228 square miles. Chicago has 47 hos pitals or about one hospital for every 5  square miles. If a hospital closes  in  Chicago, patients can just go down the  street to another facility. Their staff  will be hired by other hospitals. The  biggest transportation block to access  is the crosstown traffic.  Now if this is an inner city hospital,  and the patients are without health  insurance, there could be problems; or,  if the hospital is investor-owned, the  investors will lose money. In general,  however, access  to care will not be  jeopardized.  But let's say the hospital is in Mon tana. My State has about 809,000 resi dents spread out over 145,392 square  miles. There are 60 acute care hospi tals  or  1  hospital  for  every  2,423  square miles.  Of these 60 hospitals, 54 are the sole  provider in the town. The average bed  size for these 54 hospitals is 36. If the  41-bed  hospital  in Lewistown, MT  closed, folks in Fergus County might  have to go upwards of 100 miles to the  next nearest hospital. The staff can't  be  reemployed, so  they move away.  When people move away, the economy  of the town atrophies.  Access  critical  hospitals  are  not  unique to Montana. Most States have  at least one. It's just that most hospi tals in Montana qualify as access criti cal or  frontier hospitals. Mr. Presi dent, Congress needs to recognize the  price of efficiency to the people who  live  in  towns  like Circle, MT. When  these hospitals close,  the problem is  not  that  investors  lose money. The  problem is that people lose access to  care, and, perhaps, people die.  Now the folks living in rural Amer ica  are  good people who generally  don't like  to complain. Many would  just as soon be left alone by govern ment to work out their own problems.  As  long as  they're getting an even  shake. But they aren't.  I have looked long and hard at the  Medicare laws. Nowhere can I find any  suggestion  in the  law that a  senior,  who diligently contributes to the Med icare trust fund but who happens to  live in rural America, is to be penalized  by less adequate access to health care  ",1989

I would  also like to commend the fine staff of Balboa  Naval Hospital, and their commanding officer,  Capt. Carl Wesolowski. Given  the status of  military health care, Balboa stands as a role  model  for  the  entire military  health  care  system.  I would  like  to share with my col leagues excerpts  from  this article which de scribes in further detail the first anniversary of  the new Balboa Naval Hospital. This article by  Mr. Robert Dietrich,  app,eared  in  the San  Diego Tribune on January 31, 1989.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  NEW NAVAL HOSPITAL CELEBRATES FIRST  ANNIVERSARY, PATIENT ""BOOM""  <By Robert Dietrich>  Capt. Carl Wesolowski, who commands  the nation's largest naval medical center,  served hamburgers  to some of  the 3,000member staff of San Diego Naval Hospital  yesterday as they celebrated the first anni versary of the institution's new $260 million  facility.  ""It wouldn't have worked without them,""  the captain said, ""and we are doing things  we weren't doing a year ago-we're increas ing access to medical care.""  The new hospital, in Balboa Park's Flori da Canyon, has  a  daily patient  load of  2,000-twice the number that were treated  at  the  facility  it  replaced. The original  Naval Hospital in Balboa Park was begun in  the 1920s and most of its buildings are now  being razed. The site was transferred to the  city in a land-swap negotiation.  Wesolowski acknowledged that the hospi tal could not begin  to meet  the medical  needs of all the estimated 400,000 San Diego  County military personnel, retired person nel and dependents entitled to care there.  But he said breakthroughs in medical ad ministration have allowed him  to expand  patient loads  ""We expanded our <in-hospital) primary care clinic by adding civilian doctors to the  staff,"" he  said.  ""In June 1987, we were  seeing 50 primary-care patients a day. Now  we are seeing 200-and that is seven days a  week.""  Primary-care clinics  in Tierrasanta and  the South Bay each see an additional 200 to  300 patients a day, he added.  ""Our  specialty  clinics  have  raised  the  daily patient  load  from  1,000  a  day  to  2,000,"" he said. ""We recently reached an in patient population of 427-and that includes  retirees and their dependents.""  Wesolowski also gave the Navy's civilian  physician partnership program-authorized  in 1987-high marks in expanding care for  military beneficiaries.  THANKS TO GREGORY M. GILL  HON. STENY H.

Greg joined my staff more than 5 years ago,  after working  for the Maryland State Senate  for 3 years. He has served in all his time with  me as an associate staff member for the Ap propriations Committee, with special concen tration on  two Subcommittees: Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education and District  of Columbia.  Every one who has met Greg and worked  with him has been impressed with his commit ment,  his  humor and with  the breadth of  knowledge he has developed about Govern ment programs ranging from AIDS research to  Head Start. He has made an important contri bution to our country's domestic agenda. Like  3661  most staff members, however,  that contribu tion is known only to a few. Greg has been an  invaluable advisor, right arm and friend to me.  Now he faces even greater challenges. The  drug epidemic is the most serious problem af fecting our region. Greg has been asked by  our country executive to coordinate all phases  of our local fight against drugs. The future of  so many young people depend on his efforts.  I know he is up to this new challenge, and I  hope all my colleagues will join me in thanking  Greg Gill for his contributions and wishing him  Godspeed.  END OF COMMUNISM IN  EUROPE?  HON.

It is coincidental that just after the end of  World War II in 1945, I visited these very  same nations at a  time when I concluded  that it was inevitable that the Soviet occu pation forces would bring lasting commu nism to five of these nations-Hungary, Ru mania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Bul garia-thereby slamming shut an Iron Cur tain.  Our trip  just happened to be at a  time  when, as a possible consequence of Mikhail  Gorbachev's  perestroika,  the  troubled  economies  of Yugoslavia, Hungary  and  Czechoslovakia were in ferment, leading to  turmoil among the communist leaders that  in time could undermine communism in the  Eastern Bloc, especially since despotic Ru mania and Bulgaria also are ripe for similar  turmoil.  When World War II ended, the major ob stacle to a  lasting peace was the question  whether  the  six nations  in  the Danube  basin would lose their independence by be coming communist satellites of the Soviet  Union. <Austria slipped out of  the Soviet  noose in 1955 and today is a thriving show place of capitalistic democracy.)

76,House,101,-0.644,899,3,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  the life and accomplishments of a good friend  and a pioneer  in  the arts, Ms. Didi Daniels  Peters, well-known producer,  publicist, and  community  activist,  and wife  of world-re nowned  actor I singer  and  producer Brock  Peters, died in Los Angeles on Saturday, Feb ruary 25, 1989, after an extended illness. She  was 59 years old.  The Philadelphia, PA, native was cofounder,  with her husband Brock, of Maga Link,  Inc.,  which created Communications Bridge  Insti tute, the first institution  in the Nation for the  professional career training in videotape tech nology of low-incomed minorities, and women.  Maga Link,  Inc., was recently named by  the  Corporation  for Public Broadcasting as  the  CPB Consortium for Blad' Programming to the  Public Broadcasting System  for the develop ment, production, and distribution of program ming to stations nationally and to PBS educa tional and cultural institutions.  Ms. Peters was  one  of  the  first  black  women  television producers  in  the country.  One of her productions, ""Jazz Party,"" the first  regular  television series on  jazz, earned her  an Emmy Award  nomination. As  assistant  publicity director  for United Artists Records,  she became one of the first female executives  within the record industry.  She was founder of the Dance Theater of  Harlem Advisory Board and Guild and found ing board member of the Museum of African  American Art. Ms. Peters was also one of the  founders of the Media Forum, an organization  consisting of a group of eminent media per sonalities who produce seminars, forums, and  concerts designed to inform the public about  media  imagemaking. This group's  television  special,  ""Voices of our People,"" won  ten  Emmy awards in 1984. She also served as a  trustee of the Bella Lewitzky Dance Founda tion and of the Dance Gallery, a group which  constructed  the  first  theater ever built  for  dance in the history of the art form. This facili ty is located in downtown Los Angeles.  The jazz lover was once the owner/produc er of WNCN  in New York,  the  first all-jazz  radio station in the United States. This station,  which  set  the precedent  for such stations  which folJowed, featured major musicians and  critics as regular disc jockeys. Included were  ""Cannonball"" Adderly, Duke Ellington, Horace  Silver,  Leonard Feather, Nat Hentoff,  and  others. She later became the national funding  director of the NAACP for which she created  the national ""Bank of Stars,"" a year of con cert tours in major cities which featured stars  of music, poetry, and literature. As a tribute to  this project, Max Roach wrote his ground breaking ""Freedom Now Suite.""  Having become highly discontent with  the  quality of black-oriented  films  of  the  late  1960's and the early 1970's, Ms. Peters and  her husband started a production company,  Delbro Enterprises. This company produced  such award-winning projects as  the PBS-TV  special  ""This Far by Faith"" and  the  feature  film, ""Five on the Black Hand Side,"" a family  comedy which broke the ""blaxploitation"" trend  of this period.  This uniquely creative husband and wife  team also produced numerous internationally  acclaimed benefit events  for the  issues and  organizations to which they were both commit ted.  Included are the ""Harlem Homecoming""  series for the Dance Theater of Harlem; ""Hal lelujah"" at the Forum; ""Soul Food at the Wal dorf""  for  the Free Southern Theater;  ""The  American Tap Show"" for the Dance Gallery,  and the Olympics Arts Festival.  Ms. Peters earned here M.A. degree in po litical science and administration with honors  under a fellowship at Howard University. She  later studied at the University in Copenhagen,  as a  fellow of  the Scandinavian American  Foundation. Her works have also been cited  into  the U.S. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on  three  occasions. Her  awards  include  the  NAACP National Humanitarian  Image Award;  the Delta Sigma Theta Fortitude Award; was  named as one of the 1 O most distinguished  black women  in 1984 by  the NAACP Legal  Defense Fund;  the Rosa Parks Award of the  U.S.C. Black Woman's Caucus  in 1982. She  has also been the recipient of many citations  from mayors, Governors, State, and national  legislators, and  leaders  for her outstanding  professional and community activities.  During a  recent  interview,  the  legendary  achiever was asked about that in her career  of which she was most proud. ""That's an easy  one,"" she readily responded. ""I am proudest  of my part in creating Maga Link,  Inc., which  now trains over 35 percent women for 'behind  the camera'  jobs and  the Dance Theater of  Harlem which destroyed the stereotypical view  that blacks didn't have the  'arch' for ballet.""  She continued, ""But I am filled with both pride  and joy as I look back over the 27-year 'Brock  and Didi' partnership. There have been a lot  of  liberal and  sensitive men who  opened  those 'first' doors for me. I was lucky enough  to marry one who has understood what  the  word 'partner' really means.""  ",1989

She  stated, ""when the door of opportunity opens  be ready to put your foot in.""  Venturing into a field that was heavily domi nated by men and equally nonminorities, Didi  Daniels Peters premiered in the television in dustry as one of the first black women televi sion producers in the country. Turning to the  recording  industry, she  is acknowledged,  in  her capacity as an assistant publicity director  for United Artists Records, as one of the first  female executives in the record business.  The Dance Theater of Harlem, which many  of us in the Congress have enjoyed over the  years, could not have realized its importance  or diversified potential without the  insight of  Didi who recognized  the need to set up  the  Dance Theater of Harlem advisory board. And  the  list of her many achievements goes on  and on.  But Mr. Speaker, there is one important ele ment  in her memoirs  that captures  the es sence of Didi Daniels Peters. ts it not a beauti ful  testimony of life when a man and woman  can come  together  in a  ""partnership."" Re sponding  to  the question of  the most proud  moment in her career she stated, ""But I am  filled with both pride and  joy as  I look back  over the 27-years 'Brock and Didi' partnership.  There have been a lot of liberal and sensitive  men who opened those 'first' doors for me. I  was lucky enough to marry one who has un derstood  what  the  word  'partner'  really  means.""  Mr. Speaker, it is always a moment of sad ness to learn of the passing of one who has  contributed so greatly to  the social, political,  and cultural development of this Nation. So as  we speak about Didi Daniels Peters today reflect in silence on her today-let us remem ber her as a gift of love which we were given  to learn from and to enjoy.  ",1989
78,House,101,-0.458,899,3,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with deep  sadness that I rise today to pay my respects  to a dedicated and motivated woman, Mrs.  Didi Daniels Peters. Didi, a long-time, personal  friend passed away on Saturday, February 25,  1989, after struggling with an extended illness.  Didi will be remembered not only as a won derfully caring individual, but also as a shining  star of the black community who contributed  to the enlightenment of our society. Didi was a  well  respected producer, publicist, and com munity activist and will  truly be missed by  those of us who were privileged enough  to  know her. She was a true inspiration to us all.  Together with her husband, Brock Peters, a  world-renowned actor, singer, and producer,  they worked to improve miniority participation  and portrayal in film and television, as well as  greatly enhanced our cultural  involvement in  the arts.

81,Senate,101,-0.192,951,3,Mr. JOHNSTON.," We have all ob served wide ranges of people using al cohol  in  this  town.  I will  say, Mr.  President, that I think Senators are as  careful and controlled and responsible  in their use of alcohol as any group I  have seen. If there  is abuse  in  this  body, I do not know about it. But that  does not mean  it does not exist be cause, frankly, I did not know about  the abuse by Senator Tower.  Nevertheless,  there  is  the question  of a double standard. I do not believe  there is a double standard involved be cause it is not a question of a double  standard. It is a question of a different  standard. We Senators have shared re sponsibility. The Secretary of Defense  has sole responsibility. I heard former  Secretary McNamara on television the  other night talking about the Cuban  missile crisis and he was talking about  the troops under ""my"" command. He  was  describing  the  whole  Armed  Forces of the United States. He then  corrected himself and said ""under the  President's command."" But the fact is  under the national command author ity  it goes from  the Commander  in  Chief, the President, to the Secretary  of Defense, who is really the operative  commander  in  the  field  of all  the  forces. He is the sole commander. We  in the Senate share authority.  But the second difference between  Senators and the Secretary of Defense  is that we are a group who bears re sponsibility on only a part-time basis  and he  is always on call. By ""some times"" I mean when the Senate is in  session, or when we are in committees,  when we  are on official duties. At  those times our judgment is to be ex ercised for the United States. But if  we are at home with our families, basi cally our time is our own. No one is  going  to call us at 3 a.m. and say  ""come make a decision about whether  to respond to the firing of a Libyan  rocket."" But the Secretary of Defense  is subject to that call. It is a different  standard. Even if there was clear evi dence of abuse of alcohol in this body,  which I deny, we could not escape our  responsibility for making a  judgment  about  the nominee for Secretary of  Defense. We must  determine  the  qualifications of a person who must be  consistently and unerringly responsi ble in his judgment.  Mr. President, finally,  there is  this  question of the no-drink pledge. That,  too, is troubling. On a moral level I be lieve in the right of redemption. I be lieve Senator Tower is a man of integ rity. So when he makes a pledge, it is  important evidence. But the fact is he  has not yet demonstrated his ability to  exercise that unerring judgment; that  is  to say, he has not demonstrated  that he can be alcohol free.  We know enough about the abuse of  alcohol that if abusers have one drink  they frequently cannot control their  appetite for others. Does that mean I  think Senator Tower is an alcoholic? I  do not mean to use that word because  I do not know. I know he is an abuser.  I  think he speaks of  it in  terms of  being an excessive user at one time.  But, Mr. President, they tell me it is  characteristic of the problem that you  do not solve an alcohol problem until  you admit that you have an alcohol  problem-facing up squarely  to  that  problem, not by deflecting it, not by  saying I am a disciplined man, I can  use  it or take it or leave  it, but by  saying  I  have  a  problem. Senator  Tower has not done that. Am I certain  that he has to do that? Nothing is cer tain in this record. As I say, there are  dull hues of gray all over this record.  But I come finally to the conclusion  that we have a burden of proof prob lem here. If this were a criminal trial,  I would be the first to say not guilty.  If this were a civil trial, I would be the  first  to  say  judgment  for Senator  Tower because  the plaintiff has not  proven his case by a preponderance of  the evidence. But  this  is neither of  those, neither a criminal nor a civil  trial, Mr. President.  It is a judgment of the most serious  position or one of the most serious po sitions in this whole land; the person  who can determine the very future of  the world, whose unerringly consistent  judgment  is  of more  vital  concern  than that of the pilot of the airplane  we will next catch. It is not only our  future, but the future of the whole  world which  is  at  str ke. And  the  burden of proof, when t_ iere is a prob lem unquestionably presented, ought  to be on the nominee or on the admin istration. They must prove  that the  man is able, without question and at  all times, to adequately discharge the  duties of his office.  Does this mean that John Tower is  not a good man? Not at all; that he is  not a loyal American? Not at all; that  his service for 24 years in this body  was not of a very high standard? Not  at all. Does it mean that he is not a  very able man on defense, able to give  great advice, great  judgments, be a  great administrator? It does not even  mean that. It does not even mean that  his character  is not of  the highest  level. All it means, and this is the vital,  important and crucial test to me,  is  that  in  the m.:.clear  age we cannot  afford to take a chance on the man  who holds in his hand the future of  the world.  Several  Chair.  ",1989
82,Senate,101,0.287,951,3,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, we  go through phases in our national pol itics.  I  can  remember when  it was  usual  to  ask, How will  it play  in  Peoria? I suppose if you are the Presi dent now, it is nice to know, Will they  like  it  in Lubbock?  In my personal  case, I like to test it in Tupelo, and all  across the State of Mississippi, to see  what the reaction of the people is to a  particular problem or issue.  In that connection, I had a call from  someone  in Mississipppi who  asked  me, ""Thad, what in the world is going  on up  there?"" And  I  said,  ""Well,  I  think it is a lot like mud wrestling."" I  have never seen mud wrestling but I  have heard about  it.  Inevitably,  the  people involved on both sides end up  getting dirtied up or muddy. When it  is over, it is hard to tell who has won  and who has lost.  As a matter of fact, sometimes it is  hard to find a place to stop. It just  keeps going until the participants are  worn out.

83,Senate,101,-0.492,990,3,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I rise to introduce a bill to amend the  Bankruptcy Code. This bill clarifies  that an airline in bankruptcy should  be treated the same way as a railroad  in bankruptcy.  Under current section 1167 of  the  Bankruptcy Code, the trustee in a rail road reorganization may not alter em ployee wages or working conditions  except in accordance with section 6 of  the Railway Labor Act. It makes no  sense to single out railroads for special  treatment. The Railway Labor Act  controls resolution of disputes involv ing wages and working conditions for  employees  in both  the  railroad and  airlines industries. My bill amends sec tion 1167 of the Bankruptcy Code to  cover air carriers in bankruptcy in the  same way that railroads in bankruptcy  are now covered.  My bill also amends section 109 of  the Bankruptcy Code to allow credi tors to reach the assets of a bankrupt cy air carrier's parent holding compa nies  or  related  entities.  Creditors  should not be  left holding  the bag  when an air carrier files for bankrupt cy after its assets and cash reserves  have been drained by holding compa nies and other related entities. Under  my bill, if the air carrier files for bank ruptcy,  then  the air carrier's ""con trolled group,"" including parent hold ing companies and related subsidiaries  also must enter bankruptcy.  Controlled  groups  are  recognized  under ERISA for pension liability pur poses. Relying on  controlled group  assets furthers the reorganization of  troubled, complex entities and ensures  fair treatment for creditors. This bill  recognizes the realities of modern air line corporate structure and protects  creditors from being abused by that  structure.  It is important to note that this bill  becomes effective as of the date of in troduction-March 8, 1989. Making a  bill effective as of the date of intro duction is a common practice in the  tax area. This is done to prevent par ties involved in or considering transac tions from changing their behavior in  contemplation of pending  legislation  being enacted.  We are all aware that Eastern Air lines is contemplating a filing in bank ruptcy. This bill will affect Eastern  Airlines, its parent holding companies  and related entities, the creditors of  Eastern and Eastern's employees. All  those parties and all other air carriers  contemplating bankruptcy are hereby  put on notice that the bankruptcy law  changes proposed in this bill will,  if  enacted, be effective March 8, 1989.e  By Mr. PRESSLER:  S. 545. A bill to amend the Agricul tural Act of 1949 to permit producers  to produce alfalfa on permitted acres  for the 1990 crop, and for other pur poses;  to the Committee on Agricul ture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  PERMITTING PRODUCERS TO PRODUCE ALFALFA  ON CERTAIN ACRES  e ",1989
84,Senate,101,0.213,990,3,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation that  would allow alfalfa to be considered as  a farm program crop for base history  compliance purposes.  I recently completed a 16-town tour  of public listening meetings where I  received valuable  input on  the 1990  farm bill and other agricultural issues  from my  fellow  South Dakotans.  During that tour, I was able to gather  many  valuable  ideas  regarding  the  future direction of farm policy. One of  those ideas was the basis for the legis lation I am introducing today.  Perhaps the most frequent sugges tion  for  farm program changes ex pressed by South Dakotans concerns  alfalfa. The current farm program re quires a farmer to plant a farm pro gram crop in 2 of the last 3 years to  maintain a production base. This re quirement discourages the planting of  alfalfa, which  is  an expensive crop  that usually remains in the ground 3  or more years in a row. Because alfalfa  adds nitrogen  to  the soil and helps  mitigate wind erosion, many farmers  like to alternate their program crops  with alfalfa. This is wise stewardship  of the soil and should be encouraged.  In South Dakota, as in other areas  of the United States, the wind severely  damages  the precious  few  inches of  topsoil available to our food producers.  Farm program changes that help pre vent the destruction of this natural re source, which is so vital to our future,  are appropriate and necessary. I hope  my distinguished colleagues will view  this bill as an effort to assist farmers  ",1989
85,,101,0.494,1029,3,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. Speaker, Pocatello and  Chubbuck,  ID, are neighboring communities.  Actually, neighboring probably doesn't accu rately describe their relationship. You see, the  two cities are separated by about 100 feet of  road. Although they contract with each other  to provide various services-fire, trash collec tion, and so forth, each has its own city gov ernment and is fiercely autonomous.  When working  in  tandem,  they  resemble  any midsize urban community-they have the  same conveniences and the same problems.  Their combined population is roughly 54,000well over the census requirement for designa tion  as  a  standard metropolitan  statistical  area.  However,  the Federal Government refuses  to recognize the proximity of these two cities.  On paper, Pocatello and Chubbuck might as  well be on opposite sides of the country. But,  in reality, they are both part of one metropoli tan area and deserve to be treated as such.  These two communities ought to be entitled  to the same benefits available to other urban  centers-increased  hospital  reimbursement,  indigent care and the whole range of Federal  3817  required  urban assistance-without being  surrender their autonomy.  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping  Pocatello and Chubbuck secure that which is  rightfully theirs by cosponsoring the legislation  I am introducing today.  to  THE DRUG DEALERS SEND  ANOTHER HORRIBLE MESSAGE  HON. CHARLES 8. RANGEL  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 1989  ",1989
86,,101,-0.514,1029,3,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  it seems  that  every few months or so  I find myself in  the  unfortunate position of having to bring to the  attention of my colleagues some brutal news  from  the drug  jungles  in our cities.  In  this  case, it again comes from New York.  About  this  time  last year,  I remember  the  deep sense of loss and  the sadness felt by  the family,  friends, and  law enforcement col leagues  of  rookie  New  York  Policeman  Edward Byrne, who was gunned down while  protecting an  important witness  in  a drug  case. The drug dealers sent a message, and  Edward Byrne was  the unfortunate messen ger.  Today,  it  is Everett Hatcher. Mr. Hatcher  was a 16-year veteran of the Drug Enforce ment Administration. He was a husband and  the father of two children. He had laid his life  on  the  line every hour of every day  for our  drug-infested communities for nearly two dec ades, until they took it all away from him in a  hail of bullets on  the evening of Tuesday,  February 28, while Agent Hatcher worked un dercover on Staten Island.  This, sadly,  reminds us all  too well of the  commitment  that we  in  the Congress must  keep to support our law enforcement officers  in the continuing battle to regain our neighbor hoods, our streets, and our souls and hearts  from  the drug  traffickers. These pirates of  peace and prosperity are bent on making a  profit at the expense of destroying all  that is  good about America.  I cannot help but think, Mr. Speaker, about  the horrible price that we will continue to pay  to fight the growing incursion of the drug traf fic  in our great country.  It  is a depressing  thought to know that Everett Hatcher will not  be the last one.  It is disturbing to know that  until we firmly grip this problem as tight as we  can, that we will continue to suffer periodically  from the loss of some our greatest, most self less warriors.  But it is not just the police officers who are  being mowed down like blades of grass by the  modern-day mafia that runs the drug trade.  It could be  the uninvolved citizen who, at  the wrong place at the wrong time, say, at a  traffic light, catches the spray from machine gun  fire as  traffickers  turn otherwise  safe  streets into a temporary battleground over ter ritory.  I could be the unsuspecting victim of rob bery or attack from a crazed dope fiend des perate  for money  to purchase a  fix. Death  does not have to come directly at the hands  of the drug lords or their agents.  ",1989

Rita Calkins  is a special woman who has  overcome great odds  to make a significant  contribution to a number of local, State, and  national civic causes. She is a retired secre tary from the Bay Pines Veterans Administra tion Medical Center who was severely dis abled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947. Fol lowing her stroke, she was confined to a bed  for an extended period of time,  to a wheel. chair for a year, and  then was able to walk  using leg braces for 6 years.  Although Rita is still considered totally dis abled for employment purposes, she has been  an  active  volunteer  throughout  Pinellas  County, FL, for the past 12 years. She was a  pioneer in developing and raising funds for the  Alzheimer's Disease Fund and was the key to  her local chapter's lead in the Florida Federa tion fund drive. She also donates to the Alz heimer's Fund the proceeds from her famous  ""10 bean soup mix"", which she prepares in  packets and sells at the National Association  of Retired Federal Employees meetings. Her  efforts have inspired the association to make  major contributions to the fund.

TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 1989  ",1989
88,,101,-0.376,1042,3,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, in 1964, a group  of women from Redwood City banded togeth er  to  form  their Spanish-speaking neighbor hood's first bilingual nursery school, the Com munity Education Center [CEC] at the Com munity Congregational Church. This year, the  CEC celebrates its 25th season of service to  the Redwood City community.  From  its humble beginnings as a twice-a week nursery school, the center has expand ed to care for nearly 50 preschool children 5  days a week,  is conducting classes for new  mothers, and holds evening English  lessons  for the neighborhood's adult Spanish-speaking  newcomers.  In  spite of seemingly endless  challenges threatening its financing and facili ties,  the CEC has always managed  to meet  the need for greater and more varied services.  The greatest praise one can bestow upon  the work of the CEC comes in the feedback of  both children and parents which, I am delight ed  to say, has been uniformly positive. Par ents' anecdotal stories  tell  it all: Following  their participation  in CEC,  the children  look  forward to going to school, they are filled with  enthusiasm  for doing  their homework, and  they become quite upset when they can't go  to school, even when ill.  The CEC attributes much of the success to  its overarching philosophy. The center strives  to  develop  the whole  person.  In  its day  school, the social, emotional, intellectual, and  physical development of the child takes place  in the belief that school should be a fun expe rience, shared by  the entire  family. Parents  actively participate  in  the education of their  children.  March 8, 1989  Evidence  for  the center's success comes  from  traditional sources as well. Testing has  repeatedly shown that children involved in the  CEC are well above average. It is no wonder  the center's enrollment is always full and the  waiting  list  is nearly as  long as  the  list of  those admitted.  The growth of  the CEC has been made  possible through the generosity of individuals,  local  businesses,  service  clubs,  charitable  foundations, and especially through the dedi cation of the center's staff, volunteer and pro fessional. The center, however, cannot grow  to meet the increasing demand for its services  if its current financial needs go unmet.  The CEC's four major funding sources are  now demanding greater self-sufficiency. They  have limited the CEC's dependence upon any  one source to 20 percent and have cut back  on  future contributions.  In  response  to  this  new threat to the CEC's activities, the center's  parents and children have become involved in  a major fundraising effort to maintain the oper ation. The cost of providing such an outstand ing educational experience, however, remains  a very difficult challenge.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the staff and par ents of the center, which has given thousands  of children a solid start in their education and  thousands  of adults  the English  language  skills necessary to participate fully as Ameri cans.  I commend  the  small group of  inspired  women  in Redwood City who  founded  the  CEC 25 years ago and took responsibility for  their own education and for the education of  their children.  I congratulate  the Community Education  Center on its 25th anniversary, and wish it at  least another 25 years of success:  COAST GUARD ENVIRONMENTAL  COMPLIANCE ACT  HON.

The program of  compliance with environmental  laws mandat ed  for Coast Guard  facilities by  this bill  is  modeled after the existing Defense Environ mental Restoration Program.

90,House,101,-0.186,1055,3,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, today  the distinguished gentleman from New  York [Mr. FrsH] and I are introducing  legislation to fill a gap in our Nation's  immigration laws.  Current law addresses the situation  faced by a person who is the victim of  persecution in his or her own coun try-persecution based on  race,  reli gion, nationality, political thinking or  social class. That person may enter  the United States or remain here if al ready in the country, is entitled to be  called a refugee or a.sylee, and is enti tled to become an American citizen.  The law today also addresses the sit uation faced by a person who is not  persecuted in the home country but  wants  a  better  life  in  the United  States. The  law  says  you  cannot  remain  if you have entered without  documents, but you are entitled  to  enter as an immigrant.  But, the law does not address the sit uation  faced  by  persons-including  many who have left their homes be cause of temporary but dangerous or  life-threatening  conditions  and who  need a safe haven until the threaten ing  conditions-war,  environmental  disaster,  economic  collapse-have  eased.  This latter situation is what our bill  addresses.  This  situation  is  sometimes  ad dressed by the application of extended  voluntary  departure  [EVDl  status.  But, EVD is without sound, statutory  basis, depends on the general parole  authority  of  the  executive,  and  is  granted and withdrawn arbitrarily the bill we are introducing today does  the job better than EVD.  Mr. Speaker,  the  temporary  safe  haven bill is no stranger to this Cham ber. On October 5,  1988,  this  bill  passed by unanimous voice vote. Un fortunately, the bill was not taken up  by the other body in the closing mo ments of the  lOOth Congress. There fore, I would urge my colleagues once  again  to support  this  legislation,  to  make America a safe haven for  law abiding people whose home countries  are wracked with turmoil.  Mr. Speaker, the following is a sum mary of the Temporary Safe Haven  Act of 1989:  SUMMARY OF TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN ACT OF  1989  Authorizes the Attorney General to allow  aliens from any country (or part thereof)  who are  in  the United States,  to remain  temporarily if the Attorney General finds  that:  < 1 > An ongoing armed conflict within the  aliens' home country would pose a threat to  the safety of returning aliens; or  (2) An  environmental disaster has oc curred in the aliens' home country, substan tially disrupting living conditions, and the  country has officially  asked the United  States to provide temporary safe haven to  its nationals; or  (3) Other temporary, extraordinary condi tions exist in the aliens' home country such  that to return aliens to that country would  not be in the national interest of the United  States based on humanitarian, immigration,  and international concerns.  (4) Prohibits future use of ""Extended Vol untary Departure"" or other administrative  action as a substitute for safe haven;  <5> Requires the Attorney General to pub lish notice and  a  statement of  findings  whenever safe haven is granted, extended or  terminated;  (6) Requires eligible aliens to show contin uous physical presence in the United States  since the date safe haven  is granted, but  allows for brief, casual, and innocent depar tures;  (7) Permits no  judicial  review  of  safe  haven determinations of the Attorney Gen eral;  (8) ~equires eligible aliens to register, and  reregister annually;  <9> Denies safe haven to criminals, drug  offenders, and subversives;  (10) Disqualifies safe haven grantees from  federal programs of public assistance;  <11> Requires  the Attorney General  to  report yearly on why each country's nation als were, or were not, made eligible for safe  haven.

91,House,101,0.464,1055,3,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday  the Committee on Education  and Labor marked up H.R. 770, man dated employee leave bill. This is not a  new bill, in fact, it is the same legisla tion approved by the committee in the  la.st Congress.  What has not changed is the central  problem raised by the bill-should the  Federal Government adopt a  policy  that mandates benefits for private em ployers?  Prescribing a one-size-fits-all policy  for  all  businesses,  both  small  and  large, ignores the fact that employee  needs differ from one business to an other. Mandating one particular bene fit limits the ability of employers to  offer other benefits  that appeal  to  their work force.  Leave for employees for the care of a  child or sick parent is a good policy to  pursue. I hope employers would off er  their employees this option. It is, how ever, bad policy for the Federal Gov ernment to require companies to off er  these benefits.  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R.  770.

To  commemorate  that  important  event, I will shortly introduce legisla tion which would direct the creation  of a Middle Ea.st Development Bank.  Such an economic development pro gram, funding local projects, through  foreign assistance, public and private,  and in cooperation with local financial  institutions and  industries, has been  successful in Asia and in South Amer ica. It is my assumption that the dif ferent countries of  the Middle Ea.st  would welcome a similar type of fund ing source.  La.st December, under the auspices  of the House Foreign Affairs Commit tee, I traveled to six countries during a  dynamic period in the region. I was in  Saudi Arabia the day Arafat was get ting  la.st minute  advice  from King  Fahd before his Geneva speech; I was  in Jordan the day King Hussein reor ganized his Cabinet to lessen govern ment  ties with West Bank Palestin ians; and I was in Israel the day it fi nalized its coalition government. In ad dition, I  traveled to Egypt, Iraq, and  Syria.  As a member of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee  on Europe  and  the  Middle East, I have become active in  trying  to  understand  the problems  which seem to preclude peace in that  troubled area of the world.  Today, though, I rise to discuss a dif ferent subject, but one which is direct ly related to the peace process: region al economic cooperation.  One of the recurring themes during  my December trip and my two earlier  official visits  la.st year, was the role  that  regional  economic  cooperation  must play to help build a foundation  for peace. It is known that Israel and  Egypt have many joint economic and  scientific activities. But I learned that,  at  times, notwithstanding very  real  conflicts, some other Middle Eastern  countries have put aside political dif ferences with Israel out of economic  necessity. For example,  Jordan, de spite the fact that it does not have any  peace  treaty or normalized relations  with Israel, has entered into a number  of cooperative agreements with Israel  concerning water  issues  and  other  areas of mutual interest. They jointly  operate  the Allenby Bridge between  their two countries. In fact, there has  even been talk recently about the pos sibility of building an entry bridge be tween Aqaba and Eilat to help pro mote tourism between those two coun tries .  The cooperative exchanges between  Egypt and Israel have played a useful  role in warming and developing their  ",1989
93,Senate,101,0.2,1133,3,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President,  we have been through trying days in  the U.S. Senate. The debate over the  nomination of John Tower as Secre tary of Defense has become a very per sonal decision generating much emo tion and tension for all of us.  We have tied ourselves into a Gordi an knot of moral and ethical consider ations  that has  left  the Nation-as  well as each Senator-questioning the  limits of public disclosure  and  fair  play. Under the best of circumstances  this  nomination would  have  chal lenged the Senate's standards of fair ness. But this decision has only been  made more burdensome by the process  and the tenor of the debate.  Our decision on this nomination is  all the more difficult because it con cerns a former colleague, who served  in this body for 24 years, and because  it goes to the heart of the issue of sep aration of powers. Or perhaps to be  more accurate, this decision brings to  life one of the more peculiar features  of our Constitution in which power is  not only separated but it is shared.  Mr. President, as we  are all well  aware,  the  Constitution  gives  the  President  the  right  to  nominate  people of his choice  to serve  in his  Cabinet. But it is only with the advice  and consent of  the Senate  that his  nominees are appointed. The genius of  our Constitution  is  that  it provides  broad guidance that can withstand the  test of time. The frustration is that it  does not give us specific guidelines on  exactly how to exercise shared power.  Advice and consent, while being the  most lofty duty of the Senate, has also  been one of  the most controversial  among practitioners and scholars over  the years. I have deep respect for the  institution of  the Presidency and  I  have deep respect for our new Presi dent, George Bush. I am also aware of  precedent. As has been mentioned nu merous times during this debate, only  eight Cabinet nominees have been re jected by the U.S. Senate throughout  our history.  But, I firmly believe that our Found ing Fathers did not intend for the U.S.  Senate to be a rubber stamp. I also be lieve that our Founding Fathers made  it clear in the Federalist Papers that  the Senate's advice and consent proc ess was not intended to be simply a  referendum  on  criminality,  but on  overall fitness and merit for the most  distinguished offices  in  this Nation.  The Senate's role, as I see it Mr. Presi dent, is  to assess whether a nominee  can effectively provide the necessary  leadership in the post that he or she is  being nominated for and whether the  nominee can enlist the public's trust.  In  the nomination process we are  forced  to  look  through a prism and  the  images we  see  are diverse and  sometimes distorted. In fulfilling our  constitutional responsibility of advice  and consent, I believe we each individ ually have  to evaluate  these  images  and, upon personal reflection, make a  judgment. This  is our duty  to  the  President and the American people.  The Secretary of Defense,  in my  view, is the most important of all the  Cabinet positions. The Defense Secre tary is in the chain of command on de ployment of forces and questions of  command  and  control  of  nuclear  forces. He provides leadership to our  military forces and to our civilian per sonnel dedicated to this country's de fense. And, he oversees  the  largest  portion of the Federal budget.  We are at a critical crossroads in our  national security policy. Over the next  4 years,  the Secretary of Defense  is  going to have to provide leadership on  major decisions involving force struc ture, arms control, strategy, personnel,  and procurement, which will  deter mine our defense posture in the next  century.  These decisions are going to have to  be made now and under very difficult  circumstances. Budget pressures are  going to demand effective leadership  from  a  Secretary  of Defense who  knows how to provide a strong, eff ec tive  national  defense with  limited  funding and who can forge a consen sus on controversial budget decisions  among the competing services and on  Capitol Hill.  Most  importantly,  the next Secre tary of Defense  is going  to have  to  counter  the debilitating  impact that  the defense procurement scandal has  had on public confidence  in our de fense establishment. As a former head  of the Military Reform Caucus, I have  followed  these very  troubling  issues  closely over  the years. There  is no  doubt in my mind that the Pentagon  scandal has resulted in a growing ero sion of  public  support  for  defense  spending. The Secretary of Defense  oversees contract awards worth $150  billion  annually,  75  percent of  the  goods  and  services  purchased  each  year  by  the  Federal Government.  Dealing effectively with the issues of  fraud, conflict of interest, inefficiency,  waste,  and  reform of  the  revolving  door  are  the major  issues  on  the  agenda of the next Secretary of De fense.  In meeting  these  challenges,  the  next Secretary of Defense must have  the confidence,  trust, and respect of  the American people and  the Con gress. Mr. President,  I am going  to  vote against the nomination of John  Tower because I do not believe he can  ",1989

95,Senate,101,0.056,1198,3,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr.  President,  every day, each one of us does some thing that could get us sent to jail in  at least half the countries around the  world: We speak our mind. On issues  big and small, we voice an opinion  every  day  in  100  different ways.  Indeed, we do it so often and so easily  that I doubt that many of us ever stop  to think about how precious our free dom really is.  Thousands of men and women  in  dozens of countries around the world  know exactly how precious that freedom-the freedom to simply speak-is,  Mr. President. These men and women,  from all walks of life, from all cultur al,  religious,  and  economic  back grounds, are Prisoners of Conscience  who had the courage  to speak their  minds in countries which did not want  to hear what  they had  to say. The  price they pay is  jail, oftentimes tor ture, and sometimes even death.  For 28 years, Amnesty International  has been adopting these Prisoners of  Conscience, shining  the spotlight of  international attention into their dark  cells and putting names and faces on  the statistics. Over the years, their ef forts  literally have  saved  lives  and  have won the freedom of thousands of  men and women.  Today,  the organization  is  asking  Congress and  the administration  to  adopt some of these Prisoners of Con science. Today, Amnesty International  is  asking each State delegation,  the  District of Columbia delegation, and  the administration to come together not as Democrats and Republicans,  not as conservatives and liberals, but  as men and women who cherish free dom-to work for the release of the in dividual Prisoners of Conscience  to  whom they are assigned.  I hope my colleagues will think the  next time they voice an opinion-what  would happen if our opinions landed  us in jail? Would anybody care? Would  those who had a free voice be willing  to speak on our behalf?  I ask that a list of the Prisoners of  Conscience assigned to the delegations  and to the administration be printed  in the RECORD.  The listing follows:  PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE  ADMINISTRATION, COUNTRY, AND PRISONER OF  CONSCIENCE  President Bush: China, Yulo Dawn Tser ing.  President Bush: Israel, Zahl Jaradat.  STATE DELEGATION, COUNTRY, AND PRISONER OF  CONSCIENCE  Alabama: Somalia, Sofia Hashi Madar.  Alaska: Morocco, El Hassan El Bou.  Arizona: Indonesia, Farid Majid.

96,,101,0.345,1224,3,Mrs. MARTIN of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, today  I am  introducing  the Committee Process Re forms of 1989, a package of 14 House rules  amendments aimed at revitalizing our commit tee system.  The acronym for committee process reform  is CPR, and  that's  just what our committee  system needs-a little cardiopulmonary resus citation. Committees are supposed  to com prise the very heart of the legislative process,  and yet  today  they are suffering  from hard ened arteries,  clogged valves, and  tangled  veins.  Committees and Members are overwhelmed  by too many subcommittees, too much staff,  and  jurisdictional overlaps and conflicts.  It's  little wonder  that committees must resort  to  one-third quorums and ghost voting  to get  things done. And it's little wonder that commit tees failed to reauthorize one-third of expired  laws last year totaling $23 billion.  My package of reforms would put us back  on the right track by limiting committees to no  more  than 6 subcommittees, Members to no  more than 4 subcommittee assignments, and  by reducing staff by 1 o percent. Moreover, it  would abolish  joint bill  referrals and proxy  voting,  and  restore majority  quorums  and  open meetings. My resolution would further re store  the May 15 reporting deadline  for au thorizations and require more systematic over sight. Finally, I would require a two-thirds vote  to consider any rule which makes in order an  unreported  bill.  Let's administer CPR  now  before the heart of the House, our committee  system, becomes a useless organ.  A summary of the resolution follows:  March 9, 1989  H. RES. 106  SUMMARY OF ""COMMITTEE PROCESS REFORMS OF  1989""  <A resolution introduced by Representative  LYNN MARTIN  to amend House rules ""to  restore the committee system to its right ful role in the legislative process"")  Sec. 1. Title: ""Committee Process Reforms  of 1989.""  Sec. 2. <a> House Rules would be amended  as follows:  < 1) Oversight Refonn.-Committees would  be required to formally adopt and submit to  the House Administration Committee by  March 1st of  the first session their over sight plans for that Congress. The House  Administration Committee, after consulta tion with the majority and minority leaders,  would  report  the plans  to  the House by  March 15th together with its recommenda tions,  and  those of  the  joint  leadership  group to assure coordination between com mittees. The Speaker would be authorized  to appoint ad hoc oversight committees for  specific tasks from the membership of com mittees with shared  jurisdiction. Commit tees would be required to include an over sight section in their final activity report at  the end of a Congress.  <2> Multiple Referral of Legislation.-The  joint referral of bills to two or more com mittees would be abolished, while split and  sequential referrals would be retained, sub ject to time limits and designation by the  Speaker of a committee of principal jurisdic tion.  (3) Committee Elections and Organiza tion.-Committees would  be  elected not  later than seven legislative days after the  convening of a new Congress and must orga nize not later than  three  legislative days  thereafter.  <4> Committee Ratios.-The party ratios  on committees would be required to reflect  that of the full House <except for Standards  of Official Conduct which  is bipartisan).  The requirement would extend to select and  conference committees as well.  (5) Subcommittee Limits.-No committee  <except  appropriations)  could have more  than six subcommittees, and no Member  could have more  than four subcommittee  assignments.  (6) Proxy Voting Ban.-All proxy voting  on committees would be prohibited.  (7) Open Meetings.-Committee meetings  could only be closed by majority vote for na tional security, personal privacy, or person nel reasons.  (8) Majority Quorums.-A majority of the  membership of a committee would be  re quired for the transaction of any business.  (9) Report Accountability.-The names of  those voting for and against reporting meas ures shall be  included  in  the committee  report, and, if a measure is reported on a  nonrecorded vote, the names of those mem bers actually present shall instead be listed  in the committee report.  00) Prior Availability of Draft Report.-A  draft committee report must be made avail able to members at least one legislative day  prior to its consideration.  <11) Committee Documents.-Committee  documents  intended  for public dissemina tion, other  than  factual materials, must  either be voted on by the committee and op portunity afforded for additional views, or  must carry a disclaimer on their cover that  they have not been approved by the com mittee and do not necessarily reflect  the  views of its members.

97,,101,-0.303,1263,3,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, of  Pittston, PA, who will be celebrating their ?5th  anniversary this year.  The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick is an orga nization devoted  to  the preservation of  the  values brought to America by Irish immigrants.  Because our country  is a melting pot of so  many different cultures, it sometimes happens  that ethnic groups  lose part of  their cultural  heritage and identity in the process of assimi lating  into American culture. But the Friendly  Sons of St. Patrick keep the  Irish spirit alive  for the many individuals of Irish descent who  have  settled  in  northeastern Pennsylvania.  The language, songs, dances, and arts of the  Irish people are enthusiastically practiced so  that future generations may share in the proud  heritage of their ancestors.  The Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, who have  met every St. Patrick's Day for these past 75  years, usually mark the occasion with a guest  of honor and a special award for an outstand ing Irish-American. This year's guest of honor  is Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey, a  good  friend and native son of northeastern  Pennsylvania. Governor Casey joins such dis tinguished names as Senator Hubert H. Hum phrey, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Presi dent Harry S. Truman  in being  the Pittston  Friendly Sons' guest of honor. This year's out standing  Irish-American  is  Maj.  Michael  Jordan,  the area 2 commander of the Penn sylvania State Police.  I am proud to join with  the Friendly Sons  in saluting Major Jordan  and the other honorees, who have contributed  much to Pennsylvania and the country.  This year  the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick  will be initiating a scholarship program for stu dents in the Pittston area. The Jack Brennan  Scholarship-named for a gentleman who has  served the Friendly Sons as Secretary for 17  years-will provide $1,000 for a needy college  student  from  the greater Pittston area. This  scholarship, which will be awarded every year  hereafter, will provide hope and help for stu dents who might not otherwise be able  to  afford a college education. I salute this effort  and am proud to be associated with this pro gram.  Mr. Speaker,  the Friendly Sons of St. Pat rick deserve our special attention and praise.  The members of  this organization seek not  only to preserve our diverse cultural past, but  also set their sights  toward a brighter future  for America.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  DEFICIT REDUCTION IS  CONGRESS' RESPONSIBILITY  HON. JOHN EDWARD PORTER  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 1989  ",1989
98,,101,0.217,1263,3,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, like many other  Members of Congress, I was disappointed that  the  National  Economic  Commission  was  unable to come to a compromise and present  us with a plan to reduce the deficit.  The failings of the Commission only mirror  the  failings of this body, however. For many  years, Congress stood by and allowed deficits  to skyrocket and  then hoped  that a hastily  formed  commission would  give  it  political  cover to avoid the pain of deficit reduction.  With  the publication of  the Commission's  fractious  and  generally  inconclusive  report  comes  the  realization  that Congress cannot  duck  the deficit issue any  longer. Deficit re duction is Congress' responsibility.  The ball  is now squarely  in our court and  that is where  it will stay. The only course of  action left is for Members on both sides of the  aisle  to accept  the President's  invitation  to  bring to the bargaining table their priority pro grams and sacred cows and negotiate  real  deficit reduction.

99,,101,0.017,1263,3,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great sadness that I report to my colleagues  the passing of a dedicated and highly respect ed public servant, Hugh E. Davis, the director  of  the  Veterans'  Administration  Medical  Center at Salem, VA. Hugh died March 5 in  Richmond of a heart attack.  Just  last September, Representative  JIM  OUN and I met with Hugh in his office at the  VA hospital to discuss health care matters of  concern  to  regional  veterans. Hugh  was  down-to-earth, straight-shooting, and very effi cient. And you just couldn't find a more likable  fellow. He  is going to be missed not only at  the hospital but throughout the Virginia veter an community and  in  the Halls of Congress  where he maintained a very cooperative work ing  relationship with  those of us  involved  in  veterans' affairs.  Hugh Davis' career in service to his country  began  in 1942, prior to a 3-year hitch in  the  Army. Following his separation from  the mili tary, he continued to further his education as  he worked his way up through the VA system  in a series of fiscal, accounting, and adminis trative positions in Tennessee, Kentucky, Indi ana, Mississippi,  Arkansas,  South Dakota,  Washington, DC, and eventually Salem, VA,  where he was appointed medical center direc tor in 1972, a position he held until his death.  Since 1980, he had served as associate dean  of the school of medicine at the University of  Virginia. Hugh was very actively  involved  in  civic affairs.  4051  Mr. Speaker, Hugh Davis did an outstanding  job for the veterans of this Nation. I know my  colleagues will want to join with me in extend ing our sympathy to his family and in making  known our appreciation for his contributions to  improved quality in veterans' health care. His  is quite a legacy of distinguished public serv ice.  TRIBUTE TO JOYCE KALE-PESTA  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 1989  ",1989

Joyce was born in Youngstown, OH, and is  the daughter of Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Spangel.  She is an outstanding woman who participates  in community activities with great  frequency.  She  is  the  financial secretary of  the Ladies  A.O.H. and serves as the chairperson of the  L.A.0.H. Ways and Means Committee. She  serves as secretary to the Pete Gabriel's St.  Patricks Day Parade, is on the committee for  the Ursuline Alumni  Irish Show and  is  a  member of the Youngstown area Feis Society.  She is also a member of St. Edward's Parish.  In addition, Joyce is very active in  the Ma honing County Democratic Party  and  has  served under Chairman Don L. Hanni for the  past 11 years. She is a member of the John  F. Kennedy Federated Democratic Women's  Club,  the Federated Democratic Women of  Ohio, and  the Tri-County Democratic Organi zation. As acknowledgement for both her ex emplary efforts and unsurmountable dedica tion, Joyce was honored as  the Democratic  Woman of the Year in 1988.  Joyce is also very proud of her family. Her  husband Thomas J. Pesta and her four won derful sons, Robb Kale, Gregory Kale, Geof frey Kale and Eric Pesta, have provided  the  love and support necessary  throughout  the  years.  Joyce Kale-Pesta's unvarying perseverance,  devotion and  patience  should  serve as  a  model  for all  to  follow. And,  it  is with great  pride that I stand here today to congratulate  her as well as to wish her well in all future en deavors.  EASTERN AIRLINES STRIKE H.R. 1231  HON. JOHN P.

102,House,101,0.176,1276,3,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  express my strong support  for House Joint  Resolution 124, a joint resolution to recognize  the 75th anniversary of  the Smith-Lever Act  and its role in establishing the system of State  Cooperative Extension Services.  The Extension Program has long been rec ognized as  truly outstanding.  It has played a  major role in helping to develop the most pro ductive agriculture system in the world, it has  encouraged our youth to take an active inter est in learning through 4-H, and has improved  our rural communities and urban areas as new  problems confronted  the Nation.  Its philoso phy of enhancing human progress through the  products of research has worked and has ef fectively  taken  knowledge  directly  to  the  people of rural America for 75 years.  Clearly,  the key  to  the success of the Ex tension Program has come because of  its  unique structure as a partnership of Federal,  State, and county governments with  strong  guidance in its priorities from those it serves.  Thousands of local volunteers and extension  professionals in more than 3,000 offices na tionwide contribute time and skills to help with  adult and youth programs.  The future of American relys largely on how  well  people  are  prepared  to  face  critical  issues, and the education Extension provides  can help us achieve that goal. Its focus on im proving  our  health  and  nutrition;  providing  ideas for new and competitive agriculture; re vitalizing  rural America and  the quality of  water we drink; and conserving and managing  our national resources will effectively lead us  into the 21st century.  Again,  I urge my  colleagues  to  support  House Joint Resolution 124 to celebrate the  years of valuable assistance the Cooperative  Extension Service has given us.  ",1989
103,House,101,-0.078,1276,3,Mr. SARPALIUS.," Mr. Speaker, I think every one  in this House recognizes the importance  of  the Smith-Lever Act  and  the  profound  impact our State Cooperative Extension Serv ice has had on this Nation. I also know both  of you understand how much Extension has  meant to our home State of Texas.  But,  I would like to enter in to the RECORD  some  information about  the work  the Texas  Agricultural Extension Service is doing today.  Extension has been extremely  important  to  the 13th District of Texas. It is no small coinci dence  that  the Extension Service has been  aggressive and active in this, one of the most  productive agriculture regions in the country.  By making this information about Extension  services available for all to see, we are paying  tribute to the countless men and women who  over the last 75 years have helped build Ex tension into what it is today.  Texas, as well as  the other states, also  joins with the U.S. Department of Agricul ture to form a nationwide cooperative Ex tension network.  Those  things start with  food and  fiber  products, but also include economies, busi nesses and communities, families, youth and  leaders.  Today's agriculture is based on productivi ty and profitability-a $33 billion per year  economic impact on Texas and the source of  one out of every five jobs.  ",1989

RES. 187  1979,  To commend the Governments of Israel  and Egypt on the occasion of the tenth an niversary of the Treaty of Peace between  Israel and Egypt.  Whereas  in Washington, District of Co lumbia, on March 26,  the Govern ments of Israel and Egypt, with the support  and encouragement of  the United States,  signed a  treaty of peace formally ending  their state of war;  Whereas this treaty, the only peace agree ment between Israel and any Arab nation,  remains a crucial element in fostering peace  in the Middle East;  Whereas under terms of this historic doc ument Israel and Egypt agreed to end the  state of war between them, Israel fully with drew its military forces and civilian settle ments from the Sinai Peninsula, and Israel  and Egypt established formal diplomatic re lations, including the exchange of ambassa dors;  Whereas the establishment of peace be tween Israel and Egypt demonstrates that  direct bilateral negotiations are the most ef   fective way to resolve the Arab-Israeli con flict and can lead to lasting and mutually  beneficial results;  Whereas the other parties to the conflict  have been unwilling to enter into direct bi lateral negotiations but continue to main tain a state of war against Israel;  Whereas the continuation of the conflict  has exacted a high cost in human lives and  human  suffering  from both  Israelis and  Arabs; and  Whereas the treaty has allowed the peo ples of Israel and Egypt to begin to build a  network of cultural, economic, personal, and  political contacts and relations among them selves: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress  assembled, That  the United  States Government(!) commends Israel and Egypt for their  historic act of courage and statesmanship in  signing the Treaty of Peace of March 26,  1979;  <2> calls upon the President to mark this  historic anniversary with appropriate public  activities;  (3) welcomes the willingness of Israel and  Egypt to continue to observe the interna tional obligations they have accepted which  have contributed to the peace and stability  of the region; and  (4) calls upon other Arab nations and the  Palestinians to follow the example of Israel  and Egypt,  to  join actively  in  the peace  process,  to renounce the state of war and  acts of violence, and to enter into face-to face negotiations with Israel to achieve a  just and lasting peace.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to salute  my colleague for her fine work on our  Human Resources Task Force as part  of the work we are doing in the Com mittee on the Budget.  The Committee on  the Budget  is  many times a very depressing experi ence. There are  so many needs  in  America and so few  resources, but I  can  tell  the Members candidly  that  the work on  this Human Resources  Committee has been uplifting, posi tive, and has  really  indicated  to us  that the common complaint that our  programs, our governmental programs,  are ineffective, wasteful, and duplica tive are in this day and age in many  respects not directed properly to the  programs that we address during this  special order.  0 1510  For you see, Mr. Speaker, we have  found over the last 20 years that there  have been many experiments in social  programs  in America which  have  failed, but  likewise  there are many  which have been resounding successes.  We come today in this special order  to  speak of  those successes and  to  speak of  the  continuing  challenges  that face us.  The first  response of anyone who  would listen to our remarks from the  floor of the House, the listening audi ence or  the gallery, might be, ""Oh,  here they come again, another group  of Congressmen and Congresswomen  with some bright ideas that are going  to cost me some more money. Well,  thanks, but no thanks. It's about time  Congress  learned  to  live within  its  means."" For those who fall in that cat egory,  the  so-called  styptic hearted  who want  to know  the bottom  line,  how much money is this going to cost  and what will it save, let me offer a  few statistics about just one aspect of  the problem  facing America  today.  The problem is the challenge of infant  mortality.  Most Americans are surprised, if not  shocked,  to  learn  of  the  dreadful  infant mortality rates  in  the United  States. To put the phrase infant mor tality  in better perspective, we  are  talking about the death rate of babies  in America. How do we  rank in the  world? In fact, we rank 18th. We are  tied for the last among industrialized  nations in the world in terms of the  survival rate of American babies. We  are behind such nations as Spain and  Singapore.  American  black  infant mortality  places us 28th in the world, behind the  overall rates of Cuba and Bulgaria. A  black baby born in this District of Co lumbia  today  in  the shadow of  the  White House is more likely to die  in  the first year of his life than if that  baby were born  today  in  Jamaica,  Trinidad, Tobago, Chile, Panama, Ro mania, or the Soviet Union.

107,,101,0.739,1354,3,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  if recent history  has shown us anything, it has shown us that  Communist governments break  international  agreements with  appalling  regularity.  From  Yalta  to Helsinki  to numerous arms agree ments,  the Soviet Union and  its surrogates  have shown a remarkable propensity to break  agreements.  Nicaragua is a Soviet client state, and Con gress should have no illusions regarding San dinista compliance with  the Arias peace plan  or any other peace agreement that the current  Nicaraguan dictatorship may enter into with its  Central American neighbors.  Indeed the San dinistas  have  already  established  a  track  record of broken promises.  In 1979, when  they needed the support of  the Organization of American States to legiti mize their regime, they promised to allow po litical pluralism, maintain a truly mixed econo my, respect human rights, and conduct a non aligned  foreign  policy. These  promises al lowed the Sandinistas the time they needed to  consolidate  their power  in Nicaragua, power  that enabled them to break each of the at ore mentioned promises.  The only force which has proven itself able  to pressure the Sandinistas into honoring their  promises are the Nicaraguan freedom fighters,  commonly referred to as the Contras, who the  United States has  intermittently  supported.  The Congress has cut off all of the vital mili tary aid to the Contras, and has, in effect, al lowed the Contras to wither on the vine.  Congress  is disregarding history at the ex pense of the freedom of the people of Nicara gua. It is with these thoughts in mind that I re spectfully submit the following  report  for  the  RECORD.  THE ARIAS PEACE PLAN: A BROKEN DREAM  In February of 1987, Oscar Arias of Costa  Rica  introduced his now  famous Central  American Peace Plan;  it was  signed  six  months later by the leaders of all five Cen tral American countries. Although the plan  addressed the entire region,  in essence, it  was meant to end the 9 year-old conflict in  Nicaragua. Unfortunately, for the people of  Nicaragua,  the Arias Peace Plan has thus  far been a failure.  By signing this Peace Plan, Daniel Ortega  committed  the  Sandinistas  to  working  toward the democracy  they had promised  the people of Nicaragua nine years before.  However, as was the case in 1979, it would  seem that Ortega's true intention in signing  the Arias Peace Plan on August 7, 1987, was  to buy time in crushing all internal and ex ternal opposition rather than promoting the  principles of democracy.  In March of  this year,  the Nicaraguan  Democratic Resistance met with the Sandi nistas face to face in Sapoa, Nicaragua. Re sistance  leaders were confident that they  had reached an agreement with the Sandi nistas that would finally mean ""peace with  freedom"" for the Nicaraguan people. This  was not to be the case.  Within  two weeks of signing the Sapoa  Agreement,  the  Sandinistas  violated  its  March 14, 1989  terms. In exchange for a ""definitive cease fire,"" under which  the Resistance would  agree to lay down its arms, the Sandinistas  promised, < 1) an internal dialogue in which  members of  the Resistance would be al lowed  to participate, (2) unrestricted free dom of the press, and (3) release of all polit ical prisoners. Sapoa called on the Sandinis tas to sign an agreement by April 6, estab lishing  a  resupply  system and cease-fire  zones which Resistance  forces were  to  occupy during a 60-day truce.  Once the occupation was under way, the  Sandinistas would have  to follow  through  with the commitments made at Sapoa. This  never happened because  the Sandinistas  reneged on signing the agreement establish ing a viable resupply system for the Resist ance forces. Since that time, the Sandinista  regime has disavowed itself from any agree ments involving democratization and Sapoa,  while at the same time using the cease-fire  to their advantage.  While Nicaraguan Resistance  troops are  forced to become refugees in Honduras, the  Sandinistas have been working aggressively  to wipe out all forms of opposition within  Nicaragua. For some reason,  liberal demo crats in the U.S. Congress have stood by and  watched as  the Sandinistas  increase  their  oppression  in Nicaragua,  thus leaving the  situation more desperate  than before  the  Arias Peace Plan's introduction. Because  the House Democratic  leadership has  re mained faithful  to Sandinista promises of  democratization, the Nicaraguan Resistance  is being stripped of its ability to remain a  viable opposing  force  to  the Sandinistas.  This is a dangerous development for both  the  people of Central America and  the  United States.  It is now clear that the Sandinistas have  no intention of working within the frame work of either the Arias Peace Plan or the  Sapoa Agreement. The future of Nicaragua  has never been more bleak. The hope that  the Arias Peace Plan originally  inspired  within the people of Nicaragua has turned  into  a  nightmare. To  continually  ignore  Sandinista  insincerity  toward  peace  can  only make things worse for those who must  live  their daily  lives under this tyrannical  regime. It is time to hold the Sandinistas ac countable.  ON THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT  DEAR  FRIENDS: For  almost  eight years  thousands of brave men, women and chil dren have been sacrificing  their  lives  in  order  to  secure  a  long-desired  free  and  democratic Nicaragua. Like  those freedom  fighters of  the American Revolution who  fought and died so that future generations  of Americans could live in a pluralistic socie ty where the rights of the individual come  first,  so  do  these dedicated Nicaraguans  desire to benefit from the fruits of democra cy.  When given the opportunity, the Nicara guan Resistance was able  to perform sur prisingly well against a military force receiv ing over $40 million a month in Soviet mili tary aid. Now, because certain members of  Congress decided  to place  their  trust  in  Daniel Ortega, the Resistance is no longer  seen as a viable threat to the Sandinistas.  Unfortunately,  the new Republican ad ministration is  faced with a dilemma that  goes beyond whether  the Resistance  re mains a capable opposition. The problem  now centers around whether the next ad ministration is going  to allow  the intense  human suffering and the increased threat  ",1989

109,Senate,101,0.196,63,7,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to join the senior Senator  from Alaska as an original cosponsor  of  the  Prince William Sound Oil  Tanker Navigation Safety Act of 1989,  which is designed  to respond to the  devastating oilspill off Valdez, AK,  and to prevent a recurrence.  As the ranking Republican member  of the Commerce Committee's Nation al Ocean Policy Study,  the Senator  from Alaska has been a leader in all of  our efforts to protect the ocean and  coastal waters, their living marine re sources, and the people who depend  upon  them. This bill  reflects, once  again, his strong leadership and com mitment to those objectives.  This is comprehensive legislation. It  imposes new  requirements for pilot age,  licensed personnel, alcohol  test ing, disclosure of drunk driving convic tions,  radar monitoring,  and other  measures that should serve to prevent  another grounding  like  that of  the  Exxon Valdez. It also establishes firm  requirements  for contingency plans,  requires that they be approved by the  Coast Guard, makes the provisions of  those plans  legally binding and en forceable, and provides for Federal di rection and control of cleanup efforts  to avoid a recurrence of the shameful  fiasco that we have witnessed over the  past several weeks. Finally, the legisla tion responds to the human needs re sulting from an oilspill of this magni tude. It recognizes that a major oilspill  is, in fact, a national disaster, and pro vides well-deserved  relief and assist ance to people who are impacted by  such a spill.  In short, Mr. President, the senior  Senator  from Alaska has developed  comprehensive and effective  legisla tion in response  to  the Alaskan oil spill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.  ",1989
110,Senate,101,0.346,63,7,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  today I am joining with my senior col league from Alaska, Senator TED STE VENS, to cosponsor the Prince William  Sound Tanker Safety Act.  The need for this corrective legisla tion was  horribly demonstrated on  March 24, 1989 when the oil  tanker  ran  aground  spilling  some 240,000 barrels of North Slope  crude oil into the waters of Prince Wil liam Sound, AK.  The effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill have been disasterous. Hundreds  of miles of formerly pristine beaches  have been fouled by crude oil. Thou sands upon  thousands of birds, ani mals, fish, and other creatures depend ent  upon  the marine  environment  have been killed.  Fishermen, guides, and many other  Alaskans have lost millions of dollars  in income. Some may even lose their  way of life.  Exxon has spent and will continue  to spend millions of dollars to clean up  the crude oil and attempt to restore  Prince William Sound.  All of this occurred because every one involved became complacent.  Because we were careless and com placent we did not adequately and ac curately  assess  the  risks  associated  with oil tanker traffic in Prince Wil liam Sound. Because we  failed  to  assess  the risks, we did not seek to  eliminate them.  Mr. President,  the  legislation that  Senator STEVENS and I are introducing  today attempts to do that very thing.  It attempts to eliminate and minimize,  Valdez  Exxon  ",1989
111,Senate,101,0.304,102,7,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to introduce legislation to desig nate October 1989 and 1990 as Nation al Down Syndrome Month. I have in troduced  this  proposal  every  year  since 1984, and I am convinced that  Congress will once again enact such a  law  to  encourage  continued under standing and advancement in the med ical and educational programs  con cerned with Down syndrome.  Down syndrome occurs once in every  1,000 births. It results from a genetic  mishap in which an extra chromosome  No.  21-which affects physical and  mental development-is found within  the individual's genetic material. For  years,  Down  syndrome  carried  a  stigma of being a hopeless impediment  to a meaningful and productive life.  Happily, recent medical research has  brought about the possibility of cor recting a number of the disorders asso ciated with this genetic defect. More over,  infant  stimulation  programs  taught to parents of babies with Down  syndrome have increased their intel lectual development far beyond previ ous expectations.  Since the enactment of the Educa tion for All Handicapped Children Act  <Public Law 94-142), we have seen the  rewards of educating the developmen tally disabled  in our public schools.  These  rewards can be measured  in  terms of their increased achievements  and, consequently,  the contributions  that these children are later able to  make to society. This alone is a major  breakthrough in our regard for these  boys and girls, men and women, fellow  members  of  our  families  and  our  neighborhoods. We have come to the  important  realization  that  persons  with Down syndrome, though limited,  can and do contribute to the welfare  of our society. These individuals are  not to be regarded as a mere responsi bility. They are capable human beings  who need our encouragement to reach  their full potential.  We have an obligation to forge new  social attitudes so that persons with  Down syndrome will be accepted for  what they are-people first, and sec ondly people with Down syndrome.

113,House,101,-0.097,141,7,Mr. LAUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to introduce a bill for the relief  of River Publishers, Inc. of Wharton,  TX.  The proprietors of River Publishers,  Inc.,  a  small newspaper  publishing  company in my district, wholehearted ly relied upon the Bay City, TX, Post  Office to provide guidance and proper  postal forms required to mail 13,000  copies a week of their publication and  pay the appropriate postage. The post master of Bay City billed River Pub lishers on these 13,000 copies at the  wrong rate from May 5, 1983, through  January 4, 1984. The result was a 9month mistake and an acknowledged  error by the postmaster of $26,491.95.  If the proprietors of River Publish ers, Inc. had been presented with the  correct rate of postage from the post master, they would have quickly decid ed not to proceed with this particular  publication.  My bill would relieve River Publish ers, Inc. of Wharton, TX, of all liabil ity for payment to the United States  of the amount of $26,491.95, which is  the difference between  the amount  that should have been paid and the  amount actually paid by River Pub lishers  for  postage on  a  requester  second-class mailing of the mid-coast  advertiser for the period from May 5,  1983, through January 4, 1984. Such li ability resulted from the reliance of  River Publishers,  Inc.  upon  postal  rates specified  in good faith by the  Bay City postmaster although such  rates were erroneous.  Mr. Speaker, I am introducing this  companion bill along with the gentle man from Texas, Senator LLOYD BENT SEN, who has already submitted his  version in the Senate. I encourage my  colleagues to join and support me to  relieve an erroneous burden from a  vital and indispensable community es tablishment.  This was an election in which the  opposition, media, and press had been  stifled, manipulated, and controlled.  Yet,  Panamanian  people  traveled  many miles on foot or by bus to wait  in lines for 4 or more hours in the hot  sun and registered their opposition to  Noreiga.  This was an election  in which fo menting of anti-United States senti ment was  endemic by  the Govern ment. Yet, we were welcomed at the  polling places literally with cheers and  were begged to stay there to prevent  brutality literally with tears.  The courage and determination of  the opposition voters were remarkable  as was their affection for the people of  the United States. The daughter of a  government candidate for Vice Presi dent worked against her own father  because she believed her children need  to grow up in a democracy. On numer ous occasions voters risked their per sonal safety in insisting on their right  to vote.  It would be a tragedy if their cour age and the will of the vast majority  of the Panamanian people were per manently thwarted.  INTRODUCTION OF CALIFORNIA  MILITARY LAND WITHDRAWAL  LEGISLATION  <Mrs. BYRON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)  ",1989
114,House,101,-0.024,141,7,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Speaker, during  the lOOth Congress I introduced legis lation  to withdraw certain  lands  in  California for military use. While the  legislation passed under suspension of  the rules in the House, it did not re ceive final consideration in the Senate  prior to adjournment last fall.  I am  now reintroducing the measure with  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  California [Mr. HUNTER].  The  lands  to  be withdrawn  are  within  Chocolate Mountain Aerial  Gunnery  Range  and  China  Lake  Weapons  Center.  The  bill  would  rewithdraw these lands for a period of  15 years. While both of the tracts have  been used by the Department of the  Navy since World War II, congression al approval of these lands expired in  the 1970's.  In order to remain consistent with  provisions of comprehensive military  land withdrawal legislation passed at  the close of the 99th Congress,  this  bill sets out similar terms of withdraw al. For example, the 15-year withdraw al, a draft environmental impact state ment to be completed no more than 12  years after the law's enactment, and a  requirement for on-going decontami nation efforts all conform with  the  standards set in Public Law 99-606.  As a member of both the Interior  and the Armed Services Committees, I  am pleased to have the opportunity to  GLOBAL WARMING  <Mr. SHARP asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1989
115,House,101,-0.166,141,7,Mr. SHARP.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  United States worked hard last year to  gain its position as the chairman of  the most important international body  considering the issue of global warm ing. In this position, the United States  has the opportunity to  lead on this  vital question.  But now the administration is squan dering this opportunity because we are  the only major Western country not  advocating an international ""conven tion"" on global climate protection.  This is clearly an international prob lem  requiring  international coopera tion. We must help  formulate  the  worldwide response.  Last week  the Energy and Power  Subcommittee held a hearing where  the Environmental Protection Agency  presented its analysis of the policy op tions we could choose among to slow  global warming. Some actions would  surely be better for us than others. We  certainly have the analytical capabil ity  to help  the world decide what  paths we should take. But if we fail to  lead now, we won't have the credibil ity.  If we fail to lead-if all the adminis tration does is bicker among the dif ferent  departments  and  allow  the  policy to drift, if all the President does  is muzzle his own scientists-we are  going to let others decide our fate.  This week, OMB censored the testi mony of Dr. James Hansen of NASA,  one of the acknowledged experts on  global warming. Last year, when my  subcommittee  invited him to  testify,  the administration  tried  to send us  someone  else,  someone who would  soften the message. Dr. Hansen was al lowed to appear only when we told the  administration  that  if  he  did  not  appear, there would be an empty chair  at the witness table with Dr. Hansen's  name on it.  Perhaps this empty chair is an excel lent metaphor for the role the admin istration is playing in the internation al arena. Unless we mend our ways.

119,House,101,-0.377,154,7,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to join with my other colleageus this  afternoon to congratulate our chair man,  the gentleman from California  [Mr. HAWKINS] for his courage and te nacity getting  this bill  to  the  floor  today.  I found this reauthorization process  gratifying because we were actually  able  to solicit and synthesize a vast  amount of information and design a  common sense blueprint for positive  change.  This legislation and the vocational  educational programs  it supports  in  this Nation need to be elevated, and I  think what  the committee did will  help to achieve this goal.  Mr. Speaker, one of  the areas  in  which this elevation is most important  concerns the level of academic compe tency that is achieved by students in  vocational education programs. If vo cational education programs, and their  graduates, are to realize their full po tential, they will need to obtain the  same basic skill credentials that their  counterparts  in basic  academic  set tings receive. Under the provisions of  our bill only those programs that inte grate both academic and occupational  studies will receive Carl Perkins Feder al funding. Academic and occupational  competencies will be measured, ena bling us to plainly see where improve ments are necessary.  If vocational education programs are  to be on the leading edge of larger na tional efforts to change the way we  learn and train for our jobs, then this  kind  of  approach,  incorporating  higher order learning skills,  is abso lutely essential.  There was a time when a man could  go to work with a good attitude and a  set of tools and earn himself a pretty  solid  living, but  today a man or a  woman in the workplace needs the full  range of skills  that our schools are  able to provide them with. The old dis tinctions  between  blue  and white  collar work may  today  be  forever  blurred. This measure goes far to re flect  that change  in our schools as  well.  I would also like to thank the Chair man and members of the committee  for  including  in  this  package my  amendment on  teacher  training and  development. Teacher training and re cruitment  problems  are  endemic  throughout our education system-1  million new teachers will be needed by  the end of the century-but the prob lem is particularly acute in the voca tional education field. Poor working  conditions, a perceived lack of status  of faculty and noncompetitive salaries  in some places are preventing talented  teachers from joining the system and  driving existing teachers into careers  in business and industry.  The leadership development awards  and professional development fellow ships that are authorized under this  bill-$5 million-should go a long way  towards  building  capacity  into  the  system.  Let me finish, Mr. Speaker, by ex pressing my sincere admiration for the  work that has been done on this bill. I  would also  like  to express my grati tude to our ranking member, the gen tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goon LING] for his leadership in this process.  I  look forward  to working with you  and all our distinguished committee  colleagues  as  the  reauthorization  moves forward.  ",1989

121,House,101,0.46,167,7,Mr. BARTLETT.," Madam Chairman,  I want to take a minute to clarify a bit  the administration's policy as the bill  is receiving increasing levels of biparti san support, even as we take it to the  floor.  A statement of administration policy  was  issued earlier  this week which  made it crystal clear that the section  on restrictions on the Office of Man agement and Budget would not be ac ceptable in any form to the adminis tration and, indeed, the administration  would  veto  the bill,  the President  would veto the bill, or the Secretary of  Education would recommend a veto of  the bill  if that section on Office of  Management and Budget restrictions  were  included. Indeed the statement  of administration policy states  that  the Secretary would recommend  the  President veto  the bill  if the provi sions discussed in this OMB paragraph  were to remain in H.R. 7.  It  is my  understanding, Madam  Chairman,  that, when we begin  the  amendments, that the gentleman from  Pennsylvania CMr. GOODLING] will be  offering an amendment to strike,  to  strike the entire OMB section, and to  replace it with a study by the General  Accounting Office to determine what,  if any, actions by OMB may need to be  further reviewed.  So, I want to say to Members who  have received the statement of admin istration policy opposing the bill,  if  the Office of Management and Budget  section  is  included,  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania CMr. GOODLING] in tends to offer an amendment which I  have reason to believe will pass, will be  accepted,  that will strike  the OMB  provisions in their entirety.  So, while  the administration does  have some additional concerns about  the  legislation, as do  I and various  Members of the House on both sides  of the aisle,  the additional concerns  would not be caused at least based on  the statement of administration policy  to recommend a veto.  Madam Chairman, the two primary  concerns are, first of all, the section on  negotiated rulemaking, which the gen tleman will  also be offering as an  amendment  that will  substantially  compromise that section in which the  House  is offering  to go more  than  halfway on the negotiated rulemaking  section.  I  still have some hopes  that  the  amendment of  the gentleman  from  Utah  to strike  that section will be  adopted, but, if not, it is my belief that  can be worked out in conference.  The administration also has a legiti mate concern about the authorization  level of this bill, which is $1.4 billion,  and indeed I have to say it is too high  and ought to be lower.  But I want to suggest to those who  are watching this debate that the fact  is  that  this bill  is  so  substantially  streamlined over current law, it so sub stantially decreases the amount of pa perwork, and reporting requirements,  and setasides and other cumbersome  administrative  requirements  that  I  still recommend support for  the bill  even though the authorization levels  are higher than what I would like to  see appropriated.  Madam Chairman,  in my opinion  during the course of the conference  and  the appropriations process  the  actual money spending levels will be  adjusted in a way that will be general ly comfortable for all Members of the  House, and so I do urge support for  the legislation.

I am a strong supporter of vocation al education, and I want to do every thing I can to enhance the opportuni ties of people who are pursuing a voca tional  education.  the  ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Nu trition of the Committee on Agricul ture, I just want to inquire of the gen tleman if he is aware of the fact that  we do have a child care deduction pro vision in the basic food stamp law. I  was anxious that we not be duplicative  or do anything  that might confuse  that, and rather than ask the gentle man to withdraw or to further refine  the amendment at this point, I wanted  to ask if he is aware of my concern,  and I just wondered if we might work  it out before the matter goes to con ference.

Unfortu nately, I was made aware of that late,  and it would be my intent that the  gentleman and I will be able to work  this out prior to the appointment of  conferees. If we work it out to the gen tleman's satisfaction, then there will  be no requirement for the Committee  on Agriculture to have conferees on  this bill. If we cannot work it out, it  will  be  dropped  immediately,  and  there would be no reason for the Com mittee on Agriculture to have confer ees on this bill.

They indicated they would  try to make some copies so that Mem bers might understand what they are  voting on.

Janice was a  teacher  for 11  years at  the  Curtis Park School. a special education pro gram at the Sacramento, CA Children's Home.  Janice  taught  elementary  and  junior  high  school students and during her  tenure she  worked with approximately 600 youngsters.  According  to Janice's colleagues at  the  school:  Janice will be remembered most for her  sincere commitment to her students. She  challenged their academic knowledge and  worked  to  build  their  self-confidence.  Always available to listen to their concerns,  Janice had  the  intuitive gift of knowing  when a student was ready to return to the  mainstream of public school. Her dedication  was endless.  Janice will be deeply missed by her stu dents, her colleagues, and the community of  Sacramento. Those who knew her will keep  endearing memories of her with  the knowl edge that she was an exceptional person.  I applaud Janice's commitment to the edu cation of the youth of Sacramento, and com mend her for making the kids that she taught  and knew a part of her life.  May 9, 1989  A CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE  HON. ALFRED A. (AL)  McCANDLESS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 9, 1989  Mr. McCANDLESS. Mr. Speaker, a great  number of people in my congressional district  in California are up  in arms about the Medi care Catastrophic Coverage Act passed  last  year. On March 28, 1989, I met with a group  of at least 300 seniors who had complaints  about the new law, and who had some hard  questions  to answer.  I gave  them  the  facts  about the catastrophic Medicare law, but they  were definitely not pleased with it, and I was  glad I could say I voted against the bill.  We cannot escape the fact  that the cata strophic law does more harm than good. The  following article by Joan Beck outlines clearly  the many hardships  imposed on seniors by  the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.  It  appeared in the Chicago Tribune on February  16, 1989. I urge my colleagues to read it, and  join me in my efforts to repeal the new Medi care law:  A MEAN MISTAKE THAT Is COLD, COSTLY  COMFORT FOR ELDERLY  <By Joan Beck>  All those new Medicare benefits for which  the middle-income elderly are being forced  to pay the highest income tax rates in the  nation don't add up to much.  Just ask the insurance companies.  Members of Congress who pushed  the  Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act have  been trying to assure the outraged elderly  that their new benefits are well worth the  huge new surtax on their federal income tax  and the extra payment on Part B of Medi care. You won't need ""medigap"" insurance  to cover what Medicare doesn't, the bill's  supporters told the elderly. Or at least it  won't have to cover as many benefits and it  won't cost you so much.  But insurers have  taken a hard-headed  look at the benefits the new law provides  and  instead of cutting  the premiums on  their medigap policies, most of them are  raising  their rates. Middle-income elderly  people must now pay up to $848 extra in  new Medicare charges-and most of them  must still lay out 10 to 75 percent more for  medigap insurance.  About 70 percent of Medicare benefici aries have medigap coverage, according to  financial analysts. Policies cost an average  of about $420 to $600 a year, but can range  from about $190 to about $1,300, depending  on the extent of benefits and such factors as  area. New benefits or not, Medicare recipi ents who want adequate protection against  overwhelming medical bills  still have  to  have medigap coverage,  financial advisers  say.  Even the American Association of Retired  Persons, many of whose members are bitter  about AARP's support of the hated new leg islation, has raised premiums on the medi gap policies it sells with the Prudential In surance Co. by an average of 40 percent.  The AARP is making what has become a  standard defense of the cruelly misnamed  bill: Without the new law, the jump in medi gap rates would have been even bigger.  That's probably so. But it's estimated that  the new law is holding down  increases in  ",1989

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ALTERNATIVE FUELS USE AN  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVE  HON. MICHAEL A. ANDREWS  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 9, 1989  ",1989
130,,101,-0.135,271,7,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, when we think  of issues of importance to us  today several  areas come  to mind:  the budget deficit,  the  trade deficit, the savings and  loans situation.  There  is one  issue,  though,  that eclipses all  others in its long-term significance to all of us.  It is the concern about our environment. The  air we breath  is becoming  increasingly con taminated,  the greenhouse effect endangers  our global climate, and the acid rain problem  is not being adequately addressed. We are lit erally destroying the planet on which we  live  for our children and our grandchildren. It is im perative that we do a better job of addressing  our environmental problems.  To  this end  today  I am  introducing along  with Congressman DOWNEY  the Alternative  Fuels  Incentive Act of 1989. We are glad to  be joined by many of our colleagues among  whom are members of both parties from many  different regions of the country.  The Alternative Fuels Incentive Act of 1989  will provide  for  tax  incentives  to encourage  the use of clean burning alternative fuels  in  vehicles. The switch to such fuels is absolute ly essential.  A look at the urban smog problem provides  a graphic example. Ozone is the main ingredi ent in  the haze  that settles on most of our  cities. The Clean Air Act provides for ozone  attainment standards, and almost without ex ception, our major urban areas do not meet  these standards.  The list of these nonattainment areas brings  the problem home: New York, Chicago, Los  Angeles, Houston, Boston, Washington, DC,  Denver, Miami, Dallas, San Francisco, Cleve land, and on and on.  Nearly half of the ozone pollution problem  in many areas can be attributed  to vehicle  emissions from the transportation sector. Re active  hydrocarbons  and  nitrogen  oxides  [NOJ are the two primary ingredients leading  to  ozone pollution,  and  the  transportation  sector accounts for about 40 percent of reac tive hydrocarbons and 48 percent of NOx  in  urban areas.  In  this way  reducing  vehicle  emissions can be a giant step in addressing  the urban smog problem.  One very effective way to accomplish  this  goal is to move toward greater use of vehicle  fuels which burn cleaner than traditional diesel  and gasoline. This is the aim of the Alternative  Fuels Incentive Act of 1989. This bill was in troduced last in draft form and we have since  had a chance  to work with environmental,  transportation, and energy groups and State  and local officials to effect improvements.  The bill provides the needed push to start a  large  scale  clean-burning  alternative  fuels  movement in this country; ""clean burning"" is  defined as natural gas, liquified petroleum gas,  or a fuel which is at least 85 percent metha nol, ethanol, other alcohol, or ether.  Specifically it would provide:  8735  for equipment  to  it may  run on a  A 20-percent  tax credit  convert a vehicle so  that  clean-burning fuel;  A 20-percent credit  for  refueling  station  equipment  directly  related  to  delivering  a  clean-burning fuel into the fuel tank of a vehi cle-including tanks for liquid fuels and com pressor stations for natural gas;  A 20-percent credit for the fuel system of a  new vehicle produced to run only on a clean burning fuel; and  Credit equivalent payments  to State and  local agencies so that they may take advan tage of the credit.  The initial effect of this legislation will be to  encourage private and public fleet owners to  convert their vehicles to run on an alternative  fuel, and it would also encourage the develop ment of a badly needed alternative fuels infra structure in this country.  The benefits of using alternative  fuels  to  combat ozone pollution are clear. Running a  vehicle  on  natural  gas,  for  example,  can  reduce reactive hydrocarbon emissions by up  to 85 percent and NOx emissions by 65 per cent. Similarly, methanol  powered  vehicles  have  shown  significantly  reduced  emission  levels of these compounds.  Alternative  fuels have other environmental  benefits as well. They can be an effective tool  against acid rain. Many of the above agents  which cause ozone pollution and which are re duced by clean-burning  fuels also contribute  to the acid rain problem.  In addition, alternative fuels can help in ad dressing  the  global warming  problem.  In creased levels of carbon dioxide [C02] are a  primary cause of the greenhouse effect and  vehicles which  run on cleaner burning  fuels  emit significantly less C02.  We have the technology to make alternative  fuels a reality  today. Only  the  initial cost of  converting to a system of alternative fuels and  natural inertia are holding us back.  For example, the cost of converting a vehi cle to run on natural gas can be over $1,000.  The cost of installing a compressor station for  the refueling of natural gas vehicles can run  into  the hundreds of  thousands of dollars.  These costs are enormous hurdles to the de velopment of an alternative fuels system.  It is time the Federal Government acknowl edges the value of alternative fuels and en courages their use. They are an effective tool  in  fighting urban smog, acid rain, and global  warming-some of the most serious environ mental problems we  face. The Alternative  Fuels  Incentive Act of 1989 will provide  the  initial support needed to start a large scale al ternative vehicle fuels movement in the United  States.

132,,101,-0.026,284,7,Ms. SCHNEIDER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  being joined by several of my colleagues in in troducing a joint resolution on ""Human Needs  and Mobility,"" which addressed a subject vir tually ignored by decisionmakers both in de velopment agencies and  lending  institutions:  the transportation needs of those who com prise a majority of  the Earth's people,  the  Third World poor.  Lack of transport is one of the gravest prob lems facing  the world's underdeveloped and  debt-ridden countries. The virtual absence of  this  fundamental need adversely affects  the  health, well-being, and economic productivity  of  hundreds  of millions  of  impoverished  human beings.  For millions of families  the daily reality re quires hours of hand carrying heavy loads of  water and  firewood  located miles  from  their  dwellings. The respected  international assist ance organization, Save the Children, finds a  lack of transport to critically undermine essen tial health services. For example, the absence  of vehicles  leave health posts without medi cines, mobile vaccination campaigns are not  carried out,  the sick are not  transferred  to  medical attention, and much disease preven tion and health promotion goes untapped be cause people cannot visit health centers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Although development agencies and lending  institutions have engaged in expanding motor ized  transport services  in developing coun tries, in practice this is an unrealistic possibili ty. Even bus fare, let alone simple motorbikes  or cars, are beyond the reach of hundreds of  millions of families. Lack of money for the pur chase of motorized  transport, plus problems  with maintenance,  repair and supply of fuel,  lubricants and spare parts, makes it unlikely  that in the short-and medium-term these will  be a real answer to the transport problems of  families, or workers  in  the health, welfare,  education, and assistance community.  Save  the  Children,  the  Peace  Corps,  UNICEF and other private and public develop ment agencies working at  the village  level  have found a variety of nonmotorized vehicles  to be quite  in  line with needs of cash-poor  families and local agencies. Bicycles and tricy cles, for example, are relatively cheap to buy,  easy to assemble and maintain, require little in  the way of lubrication and nothing in the way  of fuel. Millions of families currently use them,  often in conjunction with carts, to transport up  to 400 pounds of cargo over even  the most  difficult  terrain. There  is a  long  tradition of  using such human-powered vehicles to trans port  agriculture  products,  fuelwood, water,  manufactured goods, clothes, drugs, and med ical materials, and even for use as an ambu lance in emergencies.  Unfortunately,  development  programs  funded  in part by the United States currently  promote  policies  favoring  capital-intensive  highways and motorized vehicles,  to the ex clusion of nonmotorized options. All  too  fre quently,  the  low-cost,  nonpolluting, more  broadly affordable, human-powered vehicles  are marginalized or destroyed. A few stark ex amples make the point.  Jakarta, Indonesia has thrown 75,000 tricy cles,  the basis of a  thriving system of miMay 9, 1989  croenterprises,  into  the  sea,  ostensibly  to  reduce traffic congestion. El Salvador spends  over one-half of its export earnings on petrole um, yet only a tiny minority can afford cars.  One-quarter of the World Bank's portfolio is  invested in transportation-related projects, yet  almost nothing goes for vehicles people can  afford or to encourage nonmotorized, low-cost  forms of  transportation. Similarily,  the U.S.  Agency  for  International Development  [AID]  has no projects related to reducing transport related energy use or promoting sustainable  substitutes. Humanitarian relief distribution  in  Mozambique and Ethiopia relegate women to  pack animal status to head carry 100-pound  sacks of grain from distribution centers to vil lages.  Sustainable and  affordable  transportation  strategies are desperately needed to address  the mobility needs of all without destroying the  environmental  resources  that underpin sus tainable economic development. The ""Human  Needs and Mobility""  resolution builds upon  language  inserted  in  the  fiscal  year 1989  House  foreign operations' appropriations bill.  It recognizes the problems of too little trans port for so many people, and emphasizes ac tions to be taken by AID and U.S. representa tives to multilateral funding institutions to pro vide real and sustainable solutions for the mo bility needs of the poor in developing coun tries.  If we are to encourage flourishing microen terprises as a means of helping people help  themselves  to overcome  their  impoverished  conditions, and  transform aid-dependent na tions  into  thriving  trade partners,  then we  need to assist in  the development of sturdy,  low-cost, sustainable transport options appro priate to local conditions.

135,House,101,-0.436,349,7,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Madam  Speaker, I think that it is important to  emphasize the need for close and good  relations between  the United States  and Japan and the need to understand  that within that context it is urgent  for both of our nations to take a care ful,  thoughtful,  and hard  look  at  whether particular agreements are or  are not within the national security in terests of each country.  The key question that the support ers of the FSX proposal have indicat ed that they will review is whether the  FSX proposal will or will not signifi cantly  increase and enhance Japan's  ability  to compete with our civilian  aerospace industry. The supporters of  the FSX proposal, Madam Speaker,  doubt  that  the FSX will  enhance  Japan's competitive ability.  I  ask  these  supporters, Madam  Speaker, to listen to the words of the  president of Mitsubishi Heavy Indus tries as  translated  from  the Japan  Economic Journal on January 21 of  1989, where the then president of Mit subishi Heavy Industries said that the  FSX project will ""be a great boon to  us. The  technology we will develop  and accumulate during the project will  be  instrumental  in developing next generation planes such as hypersonic  and supersonic transports.''  We should take the Japanese leader ship at their word. They are much  more candid about  their goals  than  the administration  is willing  to be  about what their goals are. I urge us  to  review  carefully  the  statements  coming from  responsible and candid  leaders in Japan and to reject the FSX  proposal.

We  knew that, but what do we do? What  should be our new policy?  First of all, talking about abrogating  the Canal Treaty is the worst thing we  could do. It would inflame Panamani an passions and would decrease our  credibility in Latin America and give  Noriega the card he desperately needs  to show that we are beating him up.  But we need to be measured in our  response, but in the same vein consist ent. First, our entire bureaucracy and  Congress should work together.  Second, we should consider economic  sanctions applied in a more coherent  and consistent way.  Third, we should get  international  pressure, but effective  international  pressure from Latin American coun tries, Alfonsin of Argentina, Carlos  Andres Perez of Venezuela. We should  not  lead  internationally ourselves.  I  think everybody knows this has been a  fraudulent election.  We should also encourage Panama nian opposition, their continued pro testing, to get out there and talk about  this election. They should not expect  the United States should do it all.  As a measure of safety, we should  consider withdrawing some of our de pendents  from Panama  for  fear of  some kind of military conflagration  that might be caused by Noriega.  Madam Speaker, Noriega is on the  ropes and we should deal a knockout  blow, but do it carefully and not in a  way that would only give him more  life to recover.  UNITED  STATES  SHOULD  SUP PORT  INTERNATIONAL  CON FERENCE ON GLOBAL WARM ING  <Mr. WISE asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute.)  ",1989
137,House,101,-0.32,349,7,Mr. WISE.," Madam Speaker, the fail ure  of  the President  to have  the  United States support an international  conference on global warming  is  in credibly disappointing. It also shows a  total unwillingness to exert leadership,  particularly since our own Department  of State and Environmental Protec tion Agency recommend participating.  I am from a  fossil  fuel producing  State. Hasty action in this area can  jeopardize  jobs. Yet failure  to be at  the international table seeking realis tic solutions can also be harmful.  I  believe  there  are  responses  to  global warming that permit continued  fossil fuel use, alternative fuels, for in stance, made from coal, natural gas,  and so on. But the United States must  be there putting them on the table.  There  is  another  reason. Many  Third World nations today are resist ing  basic  environmental  changes,  charging  that  their  development  should  not  be  restricted,  cynically  charging that the United States has  already achieved a high standard of  living and now wants to deny the same  level to others.  The  global  warming  challenge  cannot be met by one nation alone,  but yet it cannot be met by the ab sence of a great nation like the United  States.  Please, Mr. President, show environ mental and economic leadership by re considering  and having  the United  States participate in an international  conference on global warming.  OPPOSE THE FSX DEAL  (Mr. MINETA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  Mr. MINET A.  Madam  Speaker,  when we  signed an agreement with  Japan several years ago to end that  nation's unfair semiconductor industry  trade practices,  Japan  said  that  it  would open up its domestic market to  U.S.  semiconductor  manufacturers.  But in what has become a classic nego tiating tactic, Japan shunted this criti cal facet of the agreement into a so called side letter and now refuses to  live up to that part of the semiconduc tor industry agreement.  Incredibly, we are being asked again  to fall for the same old smoke and mir rors when it comes to the FSX tech nology transfer deal. We are being told  that Japan has made important tech nological and production concessions  as part of the deal. But do we  find  these consessions in the formal FSX  agreement? No. Where we find them is  in-you guessed it-an exchange of let ters.  Madam Speaker,  the  real  agree ments on these concessions will only  be negotiated after we have finished  transferring our key  technologies  to  Japan. As far as I am concerned, this  is an open invitation for the United  States to get burned twice with the  same  trick,  and  so  I  urge my col leagues to oppose the FSX deal.

139,,101,-0.253,388,7,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  together with six of my colleagues  from  in volved Southwestern States, I am introducing  the  radiation victim compensation bill. This  legislation would  redress an outstanding na tional obligation to citizens in our region, who  were unjustifiably and  involuntarily sacrificed  to advance our Nation's position during  the  cold war.  They are either the heirs of Colorado Pla teau uranium miners who were unwittingly ex posed  to extraordinary  levels of radiation  in  underground uranium mines, where ore for the  Government's  nuclear  developments  was  mined during the 1950's, or they are the heirs  and family members of fallout victims from the  Government's  nuclear  testing  in  Nevada  during this same era.  Both classes of victims have presented their  cases to the judiciary system.  In both cases  court opinions were  issued  that  the deaths  and injuries were caused by the radiation ex posures, and that Government officials knew  of the risks and  failed  to act. However, be cause the courts also found that the Federal  decisions  to disregard  these people's  lives  and safety were premeditated, Federal sover eign  immunity laws were applied to bar their  claims.  Indeed it is because their deaths and  injuries were deemed  intended, or,  in other  words, a policy decision of the United States,  that they have gone uncompensated.  They are the victims of the cold war who,  unlike other war victims, could have chosen to  live or work elsewhere had  they been  in formed.  Both the Ninth and Tenth Circuit Courts of  Appeals struggled  in  these cases with  the  unjust  result  imposed by applicable Federal  sovereign  immunity  laws. The  ninth  circuit  stated:  We agree with the district court that this  is the type of case that cries out for redress,  but the courts are not able to give it; Con gress  is the appropriate source in this in stance.  This legislation would respond to these judi cial recommendations with a national apology  and modest, but long overdue compassionate  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  payments, similar to those provided for victims  of  the Texas City disaster and  Japanese Americans who were unjustly interned during  World War  II.  I invite you, Mr. Speaker, and  my colleagues  in  the House of Representa tives to join in resolving  this outstanding na tional obligation.

FINDINGS  SEC. 2. As a result of testimony received  before various committees of  the Senate  and the House of Representatives, the Con gress finds that< 1 > fallout emitted during  the Govern ment's  above-ground  nuclear  tests  in  Nevada exposed civilians who lived in the  downwind affected area  in Nevada, Utah,  and Arizona to radiation that generated an  excess of cancers among these civilians;  (2) the health of the civilians who were  unwitting participants in these tests was put  at risk to serve national security interests of  the United States;  (3) radiation released in underground ura nium mines  that were providing uranium  for the sole use and benefit of the nuclear  weapons program of the United States Gov ernment exposed miners to massive doses of  radiation that produced an epidemic of lung  cancer and respiratory diseases among these  miners;  <4> the United States should recognize and  assume equitable and compassionate respon sibility for the damages sustained by these  civilians and provides herewith a procedure  to make partial restitution to these individ uals for the burdens they have borne for  the nation as a whole; and  <5> Congress recognizes that the lives and  health of uranium miners and of innocent  citizens who  lived  downwind  from  the  Nevada tests were sacrificed to serve the na tional  security  interests  of  the United  States, and Congress apologizes  to  these  citizens and their families on behalf of the  Nation.

When  the Library of Congress designated  1989 as the Year of the Young Reader, our  students  in  the Newark School District  re sponded with youthful eagerness and determi nation. As part of the year-long celebration,  they have pledged  to  read over 1 million  books. Our students have embarked on a  long,  adventurous  journey,  placed  side-by side, the books would form a path stretching  215 miles  from Newark, NJ,  to Washington,  DC.  Enthusiasm  for  our  hometown  venture,  known as Newark's capital reading project, is  shared  by  our entire  community. Parents,  teachers, school administrators, and students  are all working together to attain this impres sive goal.  Mr. Speaker, we  frequently hear about the  serious  problems  facing  our  urban  areas,  problems like drugs, crime, and illiteracy. Too  often we overlook the many positive and inno vative activities going on  in our cities today.  The capital reading project is an excellent ex ample of a grassroots effort to enhance the  lives of our children.  The multitude of books these students read  will open up new worlds to  their young and  impressionable minds. During the Year of the  Young Reader, it is important that we convey  to our children the joy, magic, and lifetime re wards  that reading brings. Books spark  the  imagination;  they carry us back  into history  and propel us  into the  future. Books  inspire  us,  teach us, entertain us and  sometimes  comfort us.  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues join me  in offering best wishes  to  the students of  Newark as they pursue the challenge before  them.  INTRODUCTION OF COBRA  EXTENSION LEGISLATION  HON. NANCY PELOSI  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 10, 1989  ",1989
141,,101,-0.491,401,7,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing  legislation  that will  assist disabled  Americans in obtaining health insurance cov erage at group rates.  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Recon ciliation Act  [COBRA] of 1985 required  that  continuation of certain health insurance cover age be offered to employees who would oth erwise lose coverage in an employer's group  health plan due to termination of employment  or other qualifying events. For most eligible  beneficiaries the minimum continuation period  is 18 months; for certain other situations, the  minimum period is 36 months.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  When a worker becomes disabled under  provisions of title II of the Social Security Act,  he or she  is eligible  for  financial support 5  months after  the onset of disability. Health  coverage under Medicare is available after an other 24 month waiting period. Thus, an indi vidual who  is disabled by a severe medical  condition  faces a 29-month waiting period  from the date of onset of disability to the date  of becoming eligible for coverage under Medi care.  This  legislation would extend the minimum  continuation period from 18 to 29 months for  individuals who are disabled under title  II of  the Social Security Act.  This legislation will help improve access to  health services and also help protect family fi nancial  resources.  I urge my colleagues  to  support this proposal.

142,,101,-0.225,401,7,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to bring to the attention of my colleagues  a  special  Colorado  connection  with  last  month's Inventor of the Year Awards, hosted  by  the  Intellectual Property Owners Founda tion, April 13, in the Cannon caucus.  One of  the  four scientists sharing  the  top  award as Inventor of the Year is a University  of Colorado graduate, and  two medical doc tors honored as distinguished  inventors of  1989 collaborated while on the faculty of the  University of Colorado Medical Center.  David Goedde!, a 1977 Ph.D. in biochemis try graduate of the University of Colorado, was  one of four scientists at Genentech, Inc., who  shared  the $4,000 prize as  Inventor of  the  Year for their creation of t-PA, tissue plasmin ogen activator, which dissolves blood clots in  arteries, a major cause of heart attacks. The  invention of t-PA  is a good example of how  biotechnology can  be applied  to everyday  health care.  The University of Colorado should also be  proud of the accomplishments of Ors. Charles  A. Chidsey  Ill and Guinter Kahn, who were  honored as distinguished inventors of 1989 for  their work in developing rogaine topical solu tion, a baldness treatment that was approved  for sale last year by the Food and Drug Ad ministration. Rogaine,  like so many discover ies, was the spinoff of an unrelated study into  hypertension drugs.  I salute Ors. Chidsey, Kahn, and Goeddel  and  I salute the  Intellectual Property Owners  Foundation for honoring their work.  PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER  HON. WILLIAM 0. LIPINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 10, 1989  ",1989
143,,101,-0.176,401,7,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute the fine work of President Jimmy  8865  Carter. He has become a one-man  traveling  White House years after his departure  from  office. His  familiarity with  the  situation  in  Panama, his willingness to travel to that coun try, observe  the elections, and  to  return  to  brief this indecisive administration is a testa ment to President Carter's abilities and dedi cation.  The Republicans have been running against  Jimmy Carter for 9 years. Now,  in a time of  crisis, they run to him. It is to his credit that he  has responded to the calls of a candidate who  vilified him and who continues to blame him  for every problem for which the administration  does not have an answer.  Jimmy Carter  implemented vital and  long lasting foreign and domestic policies and ham mered out historic agreements. The Camp  David accords continue to be a model for set tlement in the Middle East. The SALT II Treaty  has served as a vital check on the arms race  and helped  lead  the way to the historic INF  Treaty. The Panama Canal Treaty will help  protect the canal  from  the  likes of Noreiga.  Jimmy Carter was far-sighted on the issue of  energy. In the aftermath of the Exxon oil spill  and  the rising dependence of our Nation on  imported  fossil  fuels  it  is clear we need his  leadership on energy conservation and renew able energy.  Jimmy Carter understood  that  the United  States must lead  the world on human rights  and support for democracy. Leadership does  not mean policy review and indecision. It is a  relief and  it  is an honor  to have President  Carter on the job for the White House and the  United States of America.  THE PHILADELPHIA MOUNTED  PATROL: 100 YEARS OF SERVICE  HON. THOMAS M. FOGLIETI A  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 10, 1989  ",1989
144,,101,-0.506,401,7,Mr. FOGLIETTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay  tribute  to  the mounted police patrol,  who, this year, celebrate 100 years of service  to the people of Philadelphia.  In 1858 Mayor Richard Vaux  first experi mented with the use of mounted officers in an  attempt  to  combat  civil  disturbances  and  pursue criminals on horseback. His attempt  failed, but just 31 years later it became appar ent, again,  that a mounted police patrol was  needed. The mounted police patrol was origi nally made up of 98 officers, all formerly cav alrymen. For 60 years,  they were a major  force; effectively patrolling downtown Philadel phia, its parks and residential districts.  By  the mid-1950's, however, many people  began to question their effectiveness. One of  their bleakest hours may have come in 1952,  when the Philadelphia Police Department ter minated  the mounted patrols on  the recom mendation of the city government.  But the era of horse patrol did not end here.  The Fairmont Park Guard, a division created  in 1967, continued  to patrol city parks on  horseback. Eventually,  the police department  realized they had made a mistake and rees tablished the mounted patrol in 1972.  ",1989
145,House,101,-0.379,414,7,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, unfortu nately the Speaker and the majority  leader and majority whip are current ly at the White House. Save for that  single event they would be here. They  would be here to welcome and recog nize many who have been mentors of  those present Members of Congress,  many who have made historical contri butions to the welfare of this democra cy, many who have enhanced both  this  institution and our democracy.  The Speaker would want me to say a  special personal thanks for this day to  the many Members with whom he  served, with whom he labored to uplift  the quality of life in this country.  Those Members who currently serve  know that we do so as legatees of your  prior service as legatees of the com mitment and  talent and knowledge  that Members brought to the ever-ex panding experiment  in  free govern ment, in the creation of a just though  yet imperfect society, but one that we  believe is more perfect than any other  yet tried by man, and one which these  former Members, Mr. Speaker, individ ually and collectively, have enhanced.  Indeed, we are pleased to again greet  these Members.  There have only been, I  think, ap proximately 11,000 persons who have  been granted  the privilege by  their  fellow citizens of serving in this body.  As we are so proud to point out, there  is only one way to get to the House of  Representatives,  unlike  the  U.S.  Senate,  unlike  the Maryland State  Senate which I serve and the House of  Delegates in Maryland, most probably   of the State legislators, only one way,  and that is to be given the very high  honor of having the faith and trust of  our neighbors placed in Members, to  speak for them and to serve them in  this great democracy.  So  to each and every one of  the  former Members, for those who now  serve, we thank everyone.  I see my friend John Rousselot up  here. I remember when I came to the  Congress as perhaps some other Mem bers did with an image of a Member  because of his or her reputation.  I  came to the Congress, and I have told  this to John not believing that John  perhaps was the best guy that I was  going to be a friend with in the Con gress. He and I did not agree on all the  issues, but in a very short period of  time we became friends and I came to  respect his commitment  to his con stituency and to his country. I think  that is what happens with most Mem bers. We differ on the issues. We have  a different perspective, we  represent  different constituencies, but the over whelming majority of Members with  whom we have served, present and  past, are Members who have a deep  and abiding commitment  to serving  their constituency honestly and eff ec tively. We ought to take pride in that.  The  former Members,  I  think,  are  probably  concerned,  as  am  I, Mr.  Speaker, and as many Members of this  body  are now  concerned, with  the  House of Representatives.

146,House,101,-0.081,427,7,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in support of  the conference  report on H.R. 2. This report repre sents an honest effort  to help our  lowest paid wage earners as well as to  accommodate the concerns of many of  the critics of the minimum wage, first  among them President Bush.  As a longtime supporter of a raise in  the minimum wage I welcome the new  President's willingness to support an  increase. After 8 years of silence and  stonewalling from the White House I  had hoped that with a new administra tion this important issue would finally  be resolved. I believe many of my col leagues were also encouraged by the  promise of cooperation. Unfortunate ly, although our committee and the  majority  in  both  the House  and  Senate have compromised, we are dis appointed that since that action we  have not heard from the President nor  has he  offered  leadership  on  this  issue.  Yes, Mr. Bush has proposed a mini mum wage increase, and, yes, that is  certainly a step in the right direction.  But there is one thing on which we  can all agree, no legislative proposal is  perfect from the outset, including the  President's. The legislative process is  one that requires give and take. De mocracy survives because we work out  our differences  instead  of  fighting  over  them. The President, however,  adamantly refused to talk of compro mise, he has said ""take it or leave it""  to the Congress and then turned his  back on the process and our compro mise.  This  legislation which  passed  by  both Houses of Congress by a biparti san majority takes into consideration  the concerns of many different Mem bers. In our bill we have included a  training wage, an issue that still trou bles many of the Members from this  side of the aisle. We have increased  the tip credit, the small business ex emption, and we have lowered the rate  of increase from our committee bill.  Democrats  and  Republicans  have  worked together to write this legisla tion in the hopes of accommodating  many different points of view. Yet  even with all this work, the President  has not responded to our efforts.  On TV and in the newspapers we see  this conflict presented as a major test  of political will. The commentators  often ask who will win  in  the end.  What so many people do not under stand is that there will be few winners  in this battle. The political benefits of  this fight will be  fleeting. Unfortu nately,  the most  lasting effect  that  this battle will have will be upon the  millions of people who make up Amer ica's working poor.  It will be these people who will be  asked to go on working and sacrificing  every day. For the ninth year in a row  the message to them is, ""Don't expect  to  see  any more  relief or greater  reward for your efforts."" Once again  these people will have been victims of  partisan posturing. There may be no  relief this year because Washington is  too occupied with business as usual.  ",1989

148,House,101,0.492,440,7,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday I took the floor of the House to  let you, the Congress, and the Ameri can people know of a resolution I in troduced urging President Bush to ab rogate the Panama Canal Treaty.  The  recent events connected with  General Noriega's attempts  to steal  the election just held in Panama un derline  the urgency of  this matter.  Until such time as a properly elected,  democratic government assumes legal  control of the nation of Panama, the  strategically located canal cannot be  allowed to be threatened by the likes  of General Noriega. Nor can we stand  by and let  this killer endanger  the  lives of American men and women sta tioned in the Panama Canal Zone.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the  attention of my colleagues to an edito rial I wrote over a year ago concerning  this whole issue. In writing this edito rial, I wanted not just to point out the  dangers posed by General Noriega's  presence in Panama, but to the fact  that  international  law provides  the  basis for abrogation of treaties-such  as the one now governing the canal,  when certain unexpressed understand ings connected with their negotiation  prove to be false, and I am submitting  the article for today's RECORD.  Mr. Speaker, now  is  the  time  for  forceful action by our Government,  backed by the unanimous consent of  the Congress. It is not a time for back peddling and hesitation. The world is  watching and so is this killer, Noriega.  [From the Albany <NY> Times Mirror]  BUSH SHOULD LIMIT CANAL PACT  <By Gerald B. Solomon and Bruce Fein>  Shortly before he  left office, President  Reagan urged  the reconsideration of  the  1977 Panama Canal treaty because of the  unreliability of Panamanian leader Manuel  A. Noriega.  During his confirmation hearings before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  Secretary of State James A. Baker III also  expressed misgivings about the treaty.  One of  the President Bush's first acts  should be  to declare  the portion of  the  treaty transferring sovereignty to Panama  to be provisionally  inoperative. Congress  should also play a constructive role in acting  on these concerns.  Noriega mocks the transfer's presumption  of continuing Panamanian good faith and  ability to prevent sabotage of the canal, and  to  safeguard  its  openness  and  security.  International law would thus justify Bush's  suspension declaration.  In 1903  the Hay-Bunau-Varilla  treated  granted the United States perpetual use of  and sovereignty over a 10-mile-wide, 50-mile long Panama Canal Zone. Under U.S. sover eignty, the canal has operated reliably, and  without sabotage or interruption. It has sig nificantly boosted  the commerce and na tional security of the United States.  During the Cuban missile crisis, 18 Ameri can warships transited the canal overnight,  jumping ahead of commercial shipping to  fortify a naval quarantine of Cuba. The U.S.  warships would otherwise have consumed 13  days to navigate around Cape Hom.  Considering Panama's history of violence,  chronic  political  turbulence  and  anti Yankee sentiments, it is little wonder that  the 1977  treaty considers good will and  friendly relations as being indispensable to  carrying out the treaty's terms. Since  its  birth, Panama has had four constitutions.  During World War II, profascist President  Arnulfo Arias denied the United States de fensive rights outside  the Canal Zone. In  1964 Panamanian students  rioted  in  the  Canal Zone, leaving four American soldiers  dead and dozens wounded while the Pana manian police  and national guard  stood  aloof.  During the 1977 treaty negotiations, par ticipants from both Panama and the United  States openly acknowledged a  basic pre sumption of good  faith and political will  behind the treaty terms. For instance, Pana manian negotiator Carlos Lopez Guevaro  trumpeted: ""The canal has no defense with out  the  friendship  of  the Panamanian  people"" -a view echoed by  the Pentagon  and President Carter. Similarly, Panama's  chief treaty adviser, Romulo Escobar, insist ed: ""I think we must begin from one major  premise:  That  the United  States  and  Panama are not enemies."" American Ambas sador William J. Jorden  recognized  that  ""(a)gainst a threat of sabotage to the water way, by far the best defense was the good  will and cooperation of  the Panamanian  people and their national gUard.""  But Noriega's domestic-and foreign-policy  gambits undermine that treaty assumption.  He has thickened ties with Cuba, Libya and  Colombian Marxist guerrillas, and harassed  the 40,000 U.S. civilians and 12,000 U.S.  troops in the zone. Indicted by the United  States for complicity in drug trafficking and  subject to a companion economic embargo,  he exploits  those actions domestically  to  bestir Panamanian ill will towards America.  The 1977 treaty terminates U.S. sovereign ty over the Panama Canal and the Canal  Zone in 1999. That stipulation, however, is  limited by the higher treaty right of the  United States  to protect and defend  the  canal from armed attack ""or other actions""  that threaten its neutrality or security or  the right of U.S. warships to transit the  canal expeditiously in cases of emergency.  The latter right requires maintaining U.S.  troops in the zone whenever prevailing Pan amanian conditions are  inconsistent with  good faith and Panama's capacity to honor  its 1977  treaty obligations-circumstances  that exist today.  International law empowers a treaty sig natory to suspend provisions when a materi al unexpressed postulate of the negotiations  proves to be false. Thus, during World War  II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared  a shipping convention suspended and inop erative because a continuation of peace was  an essential premise of its provisions. Simi larly, Bush  should  inform Noriega U.S.  troops will  remain  in the zone and  that  zonal security will remain untransferred in  1999 unless  the United States  then con cludes that Panama is both able and politi cally dedicated to preventing an interrup tion of canal operations or a violation of  canal neutrality.

149,Senate,101,-0.188,466,7,Mr. DIXON.,"  In short: There  is a  nerve gas plant in Libya. Next to the  nerve gas plant as a supporting manu facturing system is sort of a metal fab rication plant. Do not hold me to the  precise description because, again,  I  tell you that these are not my areas of  expertise, but the metal plant, which  is next door to the poison gas plant  where the canisters, shells, and bombs  are made for  this  insidious, deathly  nerve gas was in large part developed  by Japanese concerns, with some in volvement by Mitsubishi.  I would  also  like  to put  in  the  RECORD, Mr. President, the statement  by Clyde Prestowitz, Jr., ""The New  FSX Deal Hardly Differs From the  Original.''  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Chicago Tribune, May 5, 19891  THE NEW FSX DEAL HARDLY DIFFERS FROM  THE ORIGINAL  <By Clyde v. Prestowitz, Jr.>  The FSX mountain  has  labored  and  brought forth a mouse. For several months  the Bush administration appeared  to be  raising the priority of defense of U.S. tech nologies leadership in the deal with Japan  to codevelop its next generation fighter as a  derivative of the U.S. F-16. Yet the adminis tration now seems to have settled for little  more than the original deal of last Decem ber.  Under the agreement, the United States  was to turn over to Japan F-16 technology developed at the cost of $3 billion to $5 bil lion-in return for 40 percent of the devel opment work on four FSX prototypes <$460  million), a vague expression of ""best effort""  to achieve a similar U.S. workshare on the  eventual 130-plane production run, and an  equally vague promise of access  to unde fined Japanese technology. Flowback to the  U.S. of Japanese  technology ""essentially""  derived from U.S. technology was to be free  of  charge, while  indigenously  developed  Japanese technology would be available for  a royalty.  Critics pointed out that the wildly unbal anced nature of this deal <similar to others  the U.S. had come to regret> probably would  accelerate Japan's drive toward world-class  aircraft manufacturing status and narrow  the U.S.  lead in its last industrial strong hold.  In  response, President Bush ordered a  review and then asked Japan to agree to cer tain improvements in the deal. Specifically,  the President demanded: <1 > revision of the  basic memorandum of understanding  to  obtain clear assurances of a 40 percent U.S.  production workshare; <2> restriction on the  transfer of key software source codes for  the plane's computers; and (3) a clearer defi nition of  the  term  ""essentially"" derived  from U.S.  technology with regard  to  the  flowback of technology to the U.S.  When made in February, the President's  demands amounted to a denial of the asser tion by  the Pentagon and State Department, as well as by former Secretaries of  Defense Frank Carlucci and Caspar Wein berger, that the deal as originally negotiat ed was the best one possible. In particular,  the President obviously questioned their in sistence that the United States ""had every  reason to expect that it would receive 40  percent of the eventual production work.""  He had good cause. Bitter experience had  taught that the words ""best effort"" in this  kind of deal  really mean ""it will never  happen."" Experience with  the F-15  and  others also  indicated a U.S.  readiness  to  transfer increasing increments of technolo gy for very little or nothing in return.  Nothing confirmed  the wisdom of  the  President's course and confounded the par tisans of the original deal more than the  Japanese response. Three months of hag gling ensued. Where the Pentagon had ear lier insisted that the U.S. ""had every reason  to expect"" a 40 percent production work share,  the Japanese proposed 28 percent,  then inched up to 32-35 percent.  The stakes in this game were the engines.  At a 40 percent U.S. workshare, if the Japa nese were to keep the avionics and other so phisticated work in Japan, the U.S. would  have to get most of the engines that con tained new and  important  technology  in  which the U.S. has a substantial lead.  Similar haggling occurred over technology  transfer issues. For most of that time the  administration held firm for the President's  demands with, amazingly, the State Depart ment taking the lead as the tough guy.  Then, suddenly, it all fell apart. Shortly  after Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's  resignation statement, an agreement on the  FSX was announced. Under it, the U.S. is to  get ""approximately"" 40 percent of the pro duction workshare. Mention of restriction  on transfer of source codes was made, but it  is agreed that the U.S. will transfer all codes  necessary to realization of the FSX project's  objectives.  The terms of the U.S. access to possible  Japanese technology were somewhat clari fied, and the U.S. agreed that it would not  preclude the possibility of Japanese produc tion of the engine. Moreover, these changes  were contained in an exchange of letters  rather than in the memorandum of under standing itself as the President had request ed.  One can only wonder what all  the fuss  was about. This is essentially the same deal  as that announced in January. What is ""ap proximately"" 40 percent. Is at 20 percent or  35 percent? Certainly it is not 45 percent.  Any suggested restrictions on source code  transfer are meaningless as long as they are  qualified by the need to ""reach project ob jectives."" In time, ""reaching objectives"" will  result in virtually total transfer.  Why did the U.S. back down? One can  only speculate, but it appears to be a reas sertion of the traditional primacy of defense  over economic consideration in U.S. diplo macy. With Takeshita on the skids, the U.S.  became concerned that a new prime minis ter could not agree to any deal on the FSX.  Concerned that Japan would not have an  adequate fighter in the 21st Century, the  U.S. appears to have pressed for a quick  deal with Takeshita was still around to do  it, proving once again that, between the U.S.  and Japan, nothing ever changes.

150,,101,-0.492,505,7,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  equal opportunity  in employment  is  the law of the land. Yet despite the  Equal Pay Act and the antidiscrimina tion laws enacted in the 1960's, women  in this country still earn only 70 per cent of what men earn. One of the rea sons for  this persistent wage gap  is  that men and women work at different  jobs. Occupational segregation of the  sexes  is very much a  reality in the  American workplace.  Women are 99 percent of dental as sistants, and men are 91 percent of  dentists. Women are 87  percent of  data entry keyers, and men are 87 per cent of data processing equipment re pairers. Women are 95 percent of all  registered nurses, and men are 98 per cent of all construction workers. And  it is no secret that the occupations  dominated by women pay  less  than  the jobs typically held by men. As an  example, data entry keyers earn $290  per. week, but data processing equip ment repairers earn $515 per week.  The  reasons  behind  occupational  segregation are varied and complex.  We face cultural stereotypes about the  roles of men and women, and biased  attitudes about the types of work that  women can perform. We also must rec ognize the failure of our education and  training systems  to overcome  these  stereotypes  and  biases. Moreover,  women who do choose to pursue non traditional employment often are the  victims of sexual harrassment or more  subtle forms of discrimination.  If we are to promote true equal op portunity in the workplace, we must  work to break down occupational seg regation. Women deserve a shot at the  higher paying jobs that currently are  dominated by men. We must encour age  businesses  to  think  of  hiring  women for traditionally male jobs. We  must encourage women  to go after  these better paying jobs.  Accordingly, today I am introducing  legislation to expand employment op portunities for women. It is a modest  but important measure that will help  erode  the  occupational  segregation  that pervades our work force.  I am  pleased to be joined in this effort by  the ranking Republican on the Labor  Committee, Senator HATCH, as well as  Senators PELL, KASSEBAUM, and KEN NEDY.  The Nontraditional Employment for  Women Act-the NEW Act-amends  the Job Training Partnership Act to  provide women greater access to occu pations traditionally held by men. In  doing so,  the bill will assist women  across the country to acquire skills in  jobs that provide good wages and ben efits and long-term economic security.  There is a clear reward for women  who seek employment in fields tradi tionally dominated by men. It is no  secret that carpenters earn more than  cashiers, and  technicians earn more  than typists. Employment in tradition ally male fields can off er women great er wages, benefits, and advancement  potential  than  traditionally  female  fields of work.  During the lOOth Congress, I chaired  a hearing of  the Subcommittee on  Labor to explore the employment of  women in nontraditional fields. At the  hearing we heard from women who  had been frustrated in their efforts to  become highway construction workers.  We heard from one of the first female  electricians in the Boston area about  what it was like to be the only trades woman at  the worksite. We heard  from women who broke the welfare  cycle by becoming computer  techni cians. These women enjoyed not only  higher wages, but also an enhanced  self-esteem. At  the same  time,  they  spoke of their struggles in overcoming  barriers  to meaningful  training and  successful job placement.  Despite language in the Act to the  contrary, women who participate  in  training  programs  under  the  Job  Training Partnership Act often are  steered into secretarial, bookkeeping,  and other traditionally female occupa tions. These are not jobs that lead to  long-term  financial  independence.  These  are predominantly  dead-end,  low-wage jobs.  Changes  are  needed  in  the  Job  Training  Partnership Act  so  that  women are encouraged to seek train ing and employment in nontraditional  fields of work. The NEW Act will pro vide for these opportunities by focus ing additional attention and resouces  on training and placing women in non traditional jobs. The act accomplishes  this objective in two ways.  First, the NEW Act requires service  delivery areas and States to  include  goals  in  their  annual  job  training  plans for training and placing women  in nontraditional employment. This  requirement will focus attention early  in the planning stages on how to pro vide  for nontraditional opportunities  for women. The bill also includes pro visions  to facilitate coordination be tween Job Training Partnership Act  programs  and  activities  offered  through the Carl D. Perkins Vocation al Education Act and other sources.  Second, the NEW Act creates a 4year demonstration program to foster  the development of programs to train  women  for  nontraditional  employ ment. One of the reasons given for the  low number of women in traditionally  male  training programs  is cost. Be cause of cultural stereotypes, educa tional differences,  child care needs,  and a variety of other reasons, it often  costs more to train women for nontra ditional work  than  for  traditionally  female work. This cost factor acts as a  disincentive  to service delivery areas  that might otherwise seek to increase  the number of women offered training  in nontraditional fields.  Under the NEW Act, the Secretary  of Labor will select up to six States per  year for demonstration grants. Gover nors may use  the  funds  to  award  grants to service providers for the pur pose of training women for nontradi tional employment. They also may use  this money to award grants to service  delivery areas that excel  in training  and placing women in nontraditional  fields of work. Through this approach,  we will facilitate the development of  model programs for training women in  nontraditional fields, which then can  be replicated by other States and serv ice delivery areas.  Mr. President, the NEW Act offers a  simple and straight! orward means to  provide a wider range of employment  opportunities for women who partici pate in programs under the Job Train ing Partnership Act. One of the funda mental purposes of JTPA  is  to  in crease the earning potential of partici pants. Women have not received their  fair share of the training available for  the jobs with the best earning poten tial. The Nontraditional Employment  for Women Act will help  to bring  about  these needed opportunities.  I  urge my colleagues  to  join Senator  HATCH and me in supporting the NEW  Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the Nontraditional Employ ment for Women Act be printed in the  RECORD, along with a summary of the  bill.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 975  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

152,,101,-0.226,570,7,Mr. SANGMEISTER.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great pride that I rise to salute a constituent,  and a friend, who has dedicated most of his  life to the service of his community. After 22  years of service as the mayor of Manhattan,  Will County,  IL, John E.  ""Jack"" Fitzgerald is  retiring and I ask my colleagues in the House  to join with me in paying tribute to this excep tional public servant.  Jack Fitzgerald's dedicated public service to  the village of Manhattan  is exemplary. Jack  was a village trustee of Manhattan from 1965  to 1967 and served as mayor of that village  from 1967 to 1989. In addition, he has been a  member of the volunteer fire department for  32 years; has been assistant fire chief since  1967 and  in 1987 was named paramedic of  the year  for  the Will-Grundy system which  covers 2,000 square miles that includes area  fire departments and private systems.  His public service career is marked by con tinuous achievement concerning  the overall  welfare, growth, and safety of the village of  Manhattan and  its  residents. The village of  Manhattan has gone through many changes,  and Jack Fitzgerald served . as the catalyst for  many of them: forming the local civil defense  organization  [ESDA], developing a compre hensive plan for the growth of the village, ob taining revenue sharing funds, expanding the  police force, and improving the street program  as well as building a new sewer  treatment  plant and water tower. Over the years of his  tenure, Manhattan  has  seen  a population  growth now exceeding 2,000 residents.  Jack Fitzgerald was born, raised, and edu cated in Manhattan and never left. He and his  wife raised their five children there and they in  turn are raising their families there. In addition  to his public service, Jack is active in many  civic, community, and church affairs. I offer to  my colleagues a quote from a newspaper arti cle which  I  feel eloquently expresses why  Jack Fitzgerald is held in such high esteem by  the residents of Manhattan: ""He sacrifices his  time for those who need him, not for financial  reward, but  for his  love of Manhattan. He  knows no other way.""  Mr. Speaker,  the  residents of Manhattan  have been most fortunate to have someone of  Jack Fitzgerald's ability and quality  to  lead  them. He has done a lot of good for them,  and in their behalf and as a friend of mine,  I  thank him and wish him well in the future.  SMALL DAY CARE CENTER  ASSISTANCE ACT  HON. MARCY KAPTUR  01' OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 1989  ",1989
153,,101,-0.35,570,7,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I invite my col leagues to join me in removing an impediment  to provision of day care by cosponsoring the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ""Small Day Care Center Assistance Act."" This  bill which I am introducing today, and which is  being introduced in the other body by Senator  DAVID DURENBERGER, would amend the Fed eral charters of the Federal National Mortgage  Association and Federal Home Loan Mort gage Corporation to permit these agencies to  purchase mortgages  on  homes  containing  family day care centers.  Today, there are many small, family-operat ed day care services which are  run out of  peoples' homes. For many working parents,  these neighborhood centers offer a reliable,  familiar, community setting in which to leave  their children when they go off to their jobs.  Unfortunately, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,  and Ginnie Mae,  the secondary mortgage in stitutions which purchase most home mort gages, are limited by their charters to involve ment with  residential mortgages. What  this  means  for  the owner of a house whose  spouse operates a day care center on  its  premises is that he or she cannot refinance  the mortgage  because  the  local  lender  couldn't sell  that mortgage to the secondary  mortgage market. Or, it means that a couple,  who depend on  the  income from  the wife's  small day care operation to qualify for a mort gage, cannot get the mortgage without giving  up the day care service.  We are all familiar with the many statistics  which  indicate a growing need  for day care  services. Day care centers operated  in  resi dential homes are, by  their very nature, not  huge,  impersonal businesses. They are,  in  fact, the type of day care preferred by many  working parents. Furthermore, because most  States have regulations or  licensing require ments setting standards for numbers of chil dren being served and the quality of care pro vided,  they are safe, clean environments for  provision  of  this  care. We  can  enhance  access to day care by passing this bill and I  hope you and the other Members of this body  will support it.  CLEAN AIR RESTORATION ACT  OF 1989  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 1989  ",1989
154,,101,0.16,570,7,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am pleased to join with my colleagues today  to introduce the Clean Air Restoration Act of  1989, offered by ",1989
155,,101,-0.473,570,7,Mr. WAXMAN of California.,"  This bill constitutes the second phase of our  efforts to reauthorize the Clean Air Act in the  101 st Congress. Earlier this year, I joined with  over 140 of my colleagues  to introduce the  Acid Deposition Control Act  to combat acid  rain. Soon we will be introducing legislation to  control toxic emissions of particulates. These  three pieces of legislation will form the basis  for reauthorizing the Clean Air Act.  Mr. Speaker, on April 27 of  this year,  I  signed a  letter  to President Bush with over  150 of my colleagues, calling upon him  to  send  to Congress comprehensive clean air  legislation. The President has  indicated his  support for just an approach and  I look for ward  to working with  the Administration  this  May 11, 1989  year to enact a Clean Air Act reauthorization  bill.  However, we cannot afford to wait one day  longer  to  take action  to protect  the air we  breathe. Mr. Speaker, it has now been almost  two decades since the passage of the Clean  Air Act, and over a decade since the Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1977 were passed. As  you know, the cornerstone of the law was the  establishment of the national ambient air qual ity standards [NAAQS]. States and metropoli tan areas were given deadlines to meet these  standards or face a series of sanctions. Unfor tunately,  these standards still have not been  met.  Mr. Speaker,  the Environmental Protection  Agency reports that over 150 million Ameri cans live in nonattainment areas, due to un healthy levels of either ozone or carbon mon oxide. As President Bush has said,  the time  for action is now.  The Clean Air Restoration Act of 1989,  which  I am proud to cosponsor, would grant  deadline extensions  to  those areas which  have not been able to achieve the attainment  standards, however,  these extensions would  be conditioned upon the adoption of additional  pollution control measures. Areas with  the  most severe pollution problems would receive  longer extensions, but would also be required  to  implement  the most aggressive pollution  control steps.  Mr. Speaker, the basic approach of this leg islation is to provide each State with the flexi bility to meet the standards by granting exten sions of 4 years for moderate areas, 8 years  for serious areas, 12 years for severe areas  and 15 years  for extreme areas. Each area  granted an extension would then be required  to put  into place special measures  for  the  achievement of  reduction  targets  [SMARn  based upon  the classification by  the EPA.  New targets and milestones would be set up  for each area to insure their compliance, and  new assessments would be made every 4  years.  This  legislation gives States 4 years  to  gather data, assemble emission  inventories,  and develop implementation plans for control ling ozone pollution. However, States are re quired  to continue  to  implement short  term  measures  to continue  their existing compli ance strategies. Free market economic incen tives would be authorized, such as emission  fees or marketable permits as an alternative  to command and control approaches used so  often in the past.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation attacks mobile  sources in addition to stationary sources. New  and  tougher tailpipe standards would be es tablished for automobile emissions to control  hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions.  There would be new requirements to mandate  that auto emission controls last for the life of  the car, not just for 50,000 miles as currently  required.  In addition,  this  legislation aggres sively promotes the use of ethanol, methanol,  and other alternative  fuels which contribute  fewer pollutants.  Finally Mr. Speaker, let me say that the pro tection of our air has always been  foremost  among my  legislative priorities while  in Con gress. I am proud to have received the Clean  Air Champion Award from the Sierra Club last  ",1989

157,House,101,-0.172,661,7,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, today I  begin a series of discussions on the  House floor concerning work by the  Armed Services Committee, and par ticularly the Panel on Military Educa tion, which I had the honor to chair  over the past year.  I might give some background and  history of it and do some initial discus sion because this has been a very im portant piece of work by the Armed  Services Committee and will have far reaching and long-lasting positive ef fects on our military.  Mr. Speaker, on November 13, 1987  the House Armed Services Committee  chairman,  the gentleman from Wis consin CMr. AsPIN]  established  this  Panel on Military Education and he  appointed  this speaker as chairman  and  seven  other members  of  the  Armed Services Committee on this bi partisan panel. The creation of this  panel  signified  recognition by Con gress that rigorous high quality pro fessional military education is vital to  the national security. It is an inves ment in the future military leadership  for both war and peace.  The committee  interest  in profes sional military education  is a direct  consequence of its earlier work from  1982 until 1986 on the defense reorga nization issue. This culminated with  the passage of what is now known as  the Goldwater-Nichols Department of  Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.  Congress reached back on the lessons  concerning  the  importance of  joint  military operations and implemented  those in the Goldwater-Nichols Act.  The primary objective of that 1986  Act is to strengthen the joint elements  of the military, especially the Chair man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and  the Commanders in Chief, also known  as CINC's, of the Combat Commands.  The primary method of that act is to  change organizations and their respon sibilities. The organizational changes  are found in title II, Military Advice  and Command Function, which desig nated  the Chairman of  the  Joint  Chiefs of Staff as the principal mili tary adviser to the President and the  National Security Council and the Sec retary of Defense. It gave the Com manders in Chief, or the CINC's, as we  call  them, clear comm.and authority  over subordinate commands and forces  assigned.  Now, Mr. Speaker, in order to bene fit  fully  from  these  organizational  changes, Congress believes it had to  II,  improve  the performance of officers  assigned  to  joint elements. The  re quired  personnel  changes  are  con tained in title IV of that 1986 act, enti tled ""Joint Officer Personnel Policy.""  Those personnel changes are designed  to insure quality in two related fac tors, both experience and education.  This study conducted by our panel  focuses on education. Education is im portant, both for  learning facts and  for  affecting  attitudes,  as well  as  values.  Specifically,  joint  education  can  broaden an officer's knowledge beyond  his own military service in joint multi service matters and can help the offi cer develop a joint perspective.  Using educational change to supple ment  and  reinforce  organizational  change  is not unique  to  the Gold water-Nichols Act.  Back in 1898, the Spanish-American  War made it clear that the Army's or ganization suffered from divided au thority,  that it could not meet  the  20th-century needs.  Secretary of War Roots established  the Army War College in 1901, and by  1903 had legislation creating a Chief  of Staff and the Army General Staff.  All  three changes  increased  integra tion of the Army.  After World War  the  Joint  Schools were established; namely, the  National War College and the Indus trial College of the Armed Forces in  1946 and the Armed Forces Staff Col lege in 1947, which is located in Nor folk, VA.  Further, the National Security Act  of 1947, later amended in 1949, created  the Secretary and Department of De fense  and  formally  established  the  Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Again, both organizational and edu cational steps were unifying ones.  Military  leaders are not  the only  ones who have emphasized the impor tance of military education. Winston  Churchill, among others, made it clear  about the importance of military edu cation and how  the military officer  was educated to successfully prosecute  World War II.  This panel, appointed by Chairman  ASPIN, was asked to review the overall  professional military personnel of our  Nation, and that we did. The panel's  charter, setup by the chairman, asked  that we study two areas of profession al military education. The first was to  assess the ability of the current De partment of Defense military educa tion  system  to develop professional  military strategists, joint war fighters  and tacticians.  Along this line, I became quite con cerned a  little over a year ago and  made a series of five speeches on strat egy and the need to educate future  American strategists, and out of those  speeches  came  this panel  and our  charter.  The second was  to review the De partment of Defense plans for imple menting  the  joint professional mili tary  educational  requirements  set  forth  in  title  IV of  the Goldwater Nichols Act with a view toward assur ing that this education provides the  proper  linkage between  the  service  competent  officers  and  competent  joint officers.  The third area of  inquiry,  though  not specifically stated, but was quite  implicit  in the terms of the panel's  charter and also explicit upon exami nation, was  the area of quality. Ac cordingly,  the  report  addresses  all  three of  these  areas, Mr. Speaker:  strategy, jointness and quality.  The scope of the study was to deter mine where to concentrate our efforts.  The panel had to relate the areas of  its examination to  levels of existing  professional  military  education  schools. The first level of military edu cation, precommissioning education, is  accomplished in service academies and  the ROTC Corps, which are units of  civilian colleges and the officer candi date schools.  D 1230  There are levels of military educa tion after the commissioning. The first  is the primary level where courses are  normally attended within the first 8  years after commissioning, and they  are focused on the officers' branch for  specialties such as armor, infantry, ar tillery, submarines, and the like. The  second  level  is  that of  intermediate  level, and the courses there are nor mally attended between the 10th and  the 15th year of service when the offi cer  is a major  in the Army or Air  Force or lieutenant commander in the  Navy or major in the Marines, and at  the Army Intermediate School at Fort  Leavenworth, the primary focus is not  on how a single branch operates but  on how various branches such as in fantry and armor and artillery fight  together in what they call combined  arms as a  team. The third level, the  senior level, are courses normally at tended between the 16th and 23d year  of service when the officer is a lieuten ant colonel or colonel or a Navy com mander or captain. While the curricu la vary,  the war colleges generally  study about operational art and strate gy.  The three service war colleges, the  two  joint colleges, the National War  College and the Industrial College of  the Armed Forces make up the senior  category  of  schools.  The Marine  Corps, I might point out at this point,  has no senior school, but it does a  good job of sending its officers to the  other senior schools.  There is a fourth level known as the  general officer or flag officer  level,  and the services created short courses  for flag officers, and by the 1980's, it  ",1989

159,,101,-0.318,687,7,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, it is a rare occa sion when we, as Members of Congress, have  an opportunity to bring to the attention of our  colleagues and their respective constituencies  a person who has truly devoted himself to the  betterment of the  individual,  the  family, and  the community. Such an  individual  is Father  Edward Walsh of the First Congressional Dis trict in New Jersey.  Ordained a priest  in  the Roman Catholic  Church in 1964, Father Walsh has consistent ly responded to the needs of his parishioners  and neighbors with  thoughtfulness and com passion. On May 21,  the people he  has  served so well will have an opportunity to pay  tribute to him upon the occasion of his silver  jubilee.  Father Walsh's efforts are centered  in nu merous civic and  religious organizations that  serve virtually every age group and region in  southern New Jersey. From  the Community  Planning and Advocacy Council to the United  Way, Father Walsh has proven to be an advo cate of those individuals truly in need. He is  the embodiment of those Judea-Christian prin ciples we all respect and admire.  As public servants, we can certainly appre ciate the importance of the role he plays in his  church and community. We in government are  keenly aware of the need for quality individ ual's participation  in  the  administration  of  public programs. Father Walsh is that individ ual and I commend him for his selfless efforts.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that my col leagues join with me in praising Father Walsh  and wishing him much success and happiness  in the many years to come.

161,Senate,101,0.078,726,7,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr.  President,  this  agreement presents a difficult decision  for many of us. It is tempting to sup port the resolution of disapproval for  the wrong reasons-reasons that color  our view of Japan generally  rather  than reasons  that relate directly  to  the proposed FSX agreement.  One such reason is my longstanding  concern over the dangers of handing  over  critical  technology  to  trading  partners who will have little hesitation  in using it to compete against us later  on.  In a  perfect world,  technology  would flow freely  in both directions,  but, Mr. President, we do not live in  such a world, and the Japanese clearly  do not live in such a world. If we are to  preserve  our  competitive  edge, we  must preserve critical technologies. It  is as simple as that, and much of my  ",1989
162,Senate,101,-0.426,739,7,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr.  President,  I  wonder  if we are going  to make an  agreement, if we ought not make the  agreement  so we  understand  how  much time is going to be left, and how  it is going to be divided up.  ",1989
163,Senate,101,-0.313,739,7,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr.  President,  I  off er my apologies to the manager of  the bill for coming in at this time with  a  request, but I had no alternative,  and I thank them for their courtesy.  Mr. President, I wish to make a few  points about this issue. We have heard  that what the Japanese should do is to  buy an F-16-that is the answer-and  that there are American jobs at stake.  Well, the fact of the matter is that if  the Japanese bought an F-16,  they  would not be purchasing an F-16 until  1995 or 1996, because the purpose of  the new plane is  to meet the fourth  generation Soviet aircraft and to pro tect the sealanes out 1,000 miles from  Japan.  So  the argument  that you should  buy an F-16 will produce no  jobs in  the United States  in 1989,  in 1990,  1991 or 1992 or 1993 or 1994. That is  point No. 1. If you go the F-16 route,  no  jobs  are  created  in  the United  States until 1995, 1996 or maybe 1997.  So let us put that issue aside.  The choice is between, really, code velopment of the FSX or the Japanese  development of it by themselves. That  is the only choice. When the Japanese  looked at  their needs  for  the  late  1990's, the early 21st century,  they  saw they needed an aircraft that had a  shorter takeoff, greater missile loading  and longer-range capability than the  F-16. They decided that the F-16 was  not a sufficiently capable plane, and  that they should develop  their own  plane not only  to meet  their own  needs but also to meet common needs,  identified by  the United States,  for  them to def end their sealanes out to  1,000 miles. So they decided to build  their own plane. We then came in and  said, ""Do not build your own plane.  Let us codevelop it with you."" The de cision was taken to go ahead with co development. That means  develop ment in this country and more jobs in  this country. To decide no, as the reso lution of disapproval, would mean no  more  jobs. So, Mr. President, let us  face the question of jobs up front.  Next, there is a fear expressed that  if we go through with this deal, it will  mean greater development of the Jap anese aerospace  industry. Mr. Presi dent,  I submit that if the Japanese  have to go their own way, have to de velop all their research and develop ment capabilities themselves, have to  go down all those blind alleys that we  have gone down from time to time and  find out all those things that you find  out only when you design a fighter air craft entirely on your own,  that 10  years  from now  the Japanese aero space industry would be further ahead  than if we codevelop it with them.  So, Mr. President, I argue that the  Japanese aerospace industry, 10 years  from now, will be  further ahead  if  they develop the FSX themselves that  if we codevelop it with them.  The next point: Who in Japan would  like to see them develop the airplane  alone?  I  know  one  company  that  would, Mitsubishi.  In  the  political  debate in Japan they were vociferous  in saying that ""We want to develop  the plane ourselves; we do not want  codevelopment  with  the  United  States."" So here in the U.S. Senate, if  the disapproval resolution is approved,  we  say,  ""Mitsubishi, you have won,  you will be the prime contractor; you  develop it yourself. We are out of the  ball game."" We are not in the room  learning; we are not in the room shar ing. We are out.  So, Mr. President,  the next point:  We have heard on this floor through out this debate  that this  is a  trade  issue. Mr. President, the problem is a  trade imbalance. The way out of that  imbalance is not cutting back imports,  but expanding exports. We have a pro vision in the trade bill, Super 301, that  allows us to expand exports to Japan,  to get across to the Japanese market.  That is the place where we should ad dress the trade issue, not on an agree ment that was signed in 1987, deliv ered  in 1988 by one President,  re viewed and renegotiated by another  President. His Commerce Department,  State Department, and Defense De partment all signed on the line. We  should not reject the President.  Mr. President, one other point: A  question has been made about  the  ability of Japan to protect any tech nology. Let me submit that post-Toshi ba, the Japanese put in an export con",1989

This bill will encourage airport sponsors to  spend money up  front  for noise abatement  knowing  that at some point  in  the  future,  these expenditures may be reimbursed out of  the airport and airway trust fund. As  I under stand it, the legislation would establish no pri orities for funding but would have the effect of  expediting expenditures for noise abatement.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",1989
170,House,101,-0.322,869,7,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  the  House is considering H.R. 968, a bill providing  Federal cost  reimbursement of  local airport  noise abatement projects.  This  legislation  is necessary because air plane noise control  is a growing concern of  airports and their neighbors. With ever-greater  air traffic and increasingly sophisticated meth ods of noise abatement available, projects  which minimize this annoying form of pollution  should be expedited.  H.R. 968 permits the Department of Trans portation to award grants from the airport and  airway trust fund to airports for noise control  projects after work on  such a project has  begun. This would allow airports to start work  on these efforts while being reimbursed at a  later date  if Federal  funding  is not currently  available.  Under current  law, an airport may not re ceive Federal funding for noise abatement if it  has already begun work on a project before a  grant is awarded. Reforming this counter-pro ductive procedure would provide greater effi ciency in the use of Federal airport noise con trol dollars.  H.R. 968 is not a budget buster either; ac cording  to  the Congressional Budget Office,  the enactment of this measure will result in no  additional costs to the Federal Government.  I have been assisting Milwaukee's General  Mitchell  International Airport  in my Fourth  Congressional District of Wisconsin with sev eral noise abatement projects. However, air ports cannot be expected to bear the burden  of noise control on their own. By cutting red tape  through  legislation such as  this, we  in  Congress can assist in this process.  I urge my colleagues to join constructively in  the war against airport noise by voting  for  H.R. 968.  ",1989
171,House,101,0.091,882,7,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 2145.  This bill comes before the House at a criti cal time. Although the danger of the PLO's im minent entrance into the World Health Organi zation has lessened, the question remains on  the WHO's long term agenda. Futhermore, the  PLO is now shifting its efforts to other U.N. or ganizations where  it believes  it has a better  chance for short-term success. For these rea sons, it is important that we act quickly to pro vide the administration the legislative authority  it will need to cut off U.S. contributions to any  U.N. organization that admits the PLO as a full  member state.  Last week  the World Health Organization  barely turned back  the PLO's effort  for  full  membership on a series of votes that culmi nated  in an unprecedented secret ballot on  the question. The result was not a full defeat  of the PLO's application on the grounds of its  clear  illegality under  the U.N. Charter. The  WHO merely deferred action for a year. The  PLO  fought against  the deferral, and  has  vowed to continue its efforts for full member ship of U.N. specialized agencies. In fact, the  PLO has already submitted as application for  membership of UNESCO, which may be con sidered in the coming weeks.  I am pleased by one clause in the deferral,  which directs  the Secretary General of  the  WHO to study and report on the legal implica tions of the application. Such a study, if hon estly conducted, can only come to one con clusion. I felt earlier that the Secretary Gener al of both WHO and  the full United Nations  should have  taken a more principled and  public position on such a clearly political and  illegitimate application.  I look forward to their  public position on  this  issue when  it next  arises.  Even  this measured success at WHO was  possible only because of the expected pas sage of this legislation.  If we  fail  to approve  this bill today we will be telling the United Na tions that the U.S. Congress does not care if  the PLO  succeeds  in  its campaign  for  full  membership of U.N. organizations. If we fail to  pass this bill we will deny Secretary Baker the  clout and legislative authority he needs to im plement the administration's firm policy on this  question.  Organizations in the U.N. system must rec ognize  that they must make a choice. They  can undermine their own credibility and violate  the U.N. Charter by admitting the PLO, which  does not have even the most rudimentary at tributes of statehood. If they take this action,  they must know that the United States will feel  under no obligation to continue to provide a  quarter of their budgets.  It would be unfortunate  if effective U.S.  withdrawal from some U.N. specialized agen cies becomes necessary. Any U.N. organiza tion, however, derives its value directly from  the willingness of its member states to treat it  seriously and respect its principles.  In its ef forts, the PLO has demonstrated that it cares  more about using specialized U.N. agenices  as political tools than allowing them to contin ue their important technical work in a variety  of fields.  After passage of this legislation, the United  Nations and the PLO will have a clear choice.  They can either have the continued financial  support and full presence of the world's great est power, or they can play politics and under mine the U.N. system by approving a fraudu lent application for membership. This legisla tion eliminates any  illusions  that  they can  have both.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",1989
172,House,101,0.478,895,7,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I want  to  take a  few mo ments to talk about a rather sensitive  issue, one which those of us on the  Banking Committee often look at as  being sacrosanct, one which we should  not really even discuss, because if we  bring it up we are often considered op ponents, and that is specifically the  Federal Housing Administration.  Mr. Speaker, there have been several  press reports recently on two General  Accounting  Office  CGAOl  studies  which analyze  the Federal Housing  Administration's CFHAJ  growing  fi nancial problems. I am concerned with  these reports because there are several  bills pending before the Housing Sub committee  which  would  greatly  expand FHA for the very well-intend ed purpose-and I underscore the fact  that it is a very well-intended purpose,  Mr. Speaker-of alleviating the hous ing affordability problem at little cost.  Before we proceed with these propos als, however, we must determine the  true cost of the Federal Housing Ad ministration.  The first GAO study is a financial  audit of FHA  for  fiscal year 1987.  Prior to the study, no financial audit  had ever been done of FHA-and I un derscore that again, prior to the study  on the fiscal year 1987, no independ ent study had ever been done on FHA.  The audit found that, using general ly  accepted  accounting  principles,  GAP accounting, FHA's reserves are  $1.9 billion less than what FHA had  reported. GAO adjusted FHA's equity  down from $3.1 billion to $1.2 billion.  The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund  known as MMIF, which covers FHA's  single  family  lending program, was  lowered by $600 million. The GAO  audit also concluded that FHA added  $643 million  to  the Federal deficit.  FHA is a cost to the American taxpay ers because, when FHA experienced a  cash  shortage,  it withdrew money  from the U.S. Treasury by cashing in  Government  securities  before  they  matured.  GAO, Mr. Speaker, is expected to re lease its audit for fiscal year 1988 in a  few months. FHA has already report ed a $368. 7 million loss for the MMIF  for 1988. Losses are expected to continue over the next few years as the  large volume of FHA  insured  loans  originated in 1986 and 1987 enter the  peak of the default cycle. The GAO  study points out  that most  foreclo sures occur 2 or 3 years after  the  homes are purchased.  As FHA's losses grow,  I  am con cerned that we may be facing another  bailout of a Federal  insurance pro gram. Before we blindly expand these  programs, more information is needed  to balance proper social policy with  fiscal  responsibility. For example, a  second GAO study released 2 weeks  ago shows that more than 25 percent  of the FHA  insured  loans with  less  than a 5-percent downpayment in the  1981 and 1982 policy years, went into  default. This type of foreclosure rate  is a financial disaster for FHA and we  must consider whether we want  to  expand the availability of these very  low downpayment loans, particularly  if we combine the low downpayment  with very high loan amounts. We also  need to consider whether we are help ing families when as many as 1-in-4  homebuyers  could  potentially  lose  their homes.  This  is  a  very  serious  issue, Mr.  Speaker, and I believe that as we look  at  the  involvement of  the Federal  Government in the savings and loan  crisis we must also do everything that  we possibly can to avert a potential  crisis in this area.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  submit  for  the  RECORD  two newpaper articles which  more fully discuss the GAO studies,  and  I urge further consideration of  this growing problem.  [From the Washington Post, May 6, 1989)  FHA SUFFERS FIRST Loss ON ITS SINGLE FAMIL Y HOME INSURANCE FuND  <By Ann Mariano)  The  Federal  Housing  Administration  added $643 million to the federal deficit last  year, partly because of the first-ever loss it  suffered  in the single-family house  insur ance fund that has helped millions of Amer icans buy homes, the General Accounting  Office reported this week.  To cover its cash shortage, the FHA with drew money  from  the U.S. Treasury by  cashing  in  government  securities  before  they matured, thereby increasing the $165  billion federal budget deficit.  Losses in the insurance fund are expected  to continue over the next two years as the  record number of Americans who bought  homes in the boom years of 1986 and 1987  enter the period when financially pressed  homeowners are most likely to stop making  their mortgage payments. Experience has  shown that most foreclosures occur two or  three years after the homes are purchased,  according to the GAO.  In response to a congressional request, the  GAO used the private mortgage industry's  accounting  standards when  it  examined  FHA's records.  As a result, officials had to cut $1.9 billion  off the figure first reported as the govern ment's total equity in the four  insurance  funds administered by the FHA.  ",1989
173,House,101,-0.564,921,7,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker,  this March,  the  country suffered a tremendous  loss with  the  passing of Jim O'Hara, a wise and caring  leader both  in  and  out of Congress.  Jim  O'Hara will be sorely missed by not only his  former colleagues  in  the House, but by citi zens across the Nation. He was a dedicated  public servant and a man with an unswerving  commitment to the highest principles.  Though I began my tenure in Congress after  Jim O'Hara had left Congress and begun work  in the private sector on behalf of various labor  and education groups,  I had  the privilege of  working with him during my service on  the  Education  and  Labor Committee. Reliable,  trustworthy, and always straightforward,  he  more than lived up to his reputation of intelli gence and integrity over the course of my as sociation with him.  A  consistent  theme  runs  through  Jim  O'Hara's diverse range of legislative accom plishments: He was never afraid to champion  causes many others were afraid to take on.  During his 18 years  in Congress, he was a  stalwart  in  the battle  for  fair wages, a key  player in the passage of legislation to expand  Federal financial support for education, and a  vocal advocate of civil rights. His subsequent  outstanding work as chairman of the Federal  Minimum Wage Commission  from  1979  to  1981 provided a vital framework from which to  consider  a  fair  and  appropriate minimum  wage.  Jim O'Hara's former constitutents in Michi gan's 12th District, his colleagues, and mil lions of Americans directly benefited from his  work. I want to express my profound sorrow at  his passing and extend my deepest sympathy  to his family.  ",1989

There's Bill, 50, and his wife, Connie, work ing every day. Then there are the four kids,  17 to 28, just getting started. And, of course,  Bill's two grandkids.  Together they tell the story of Social Se curity in America: In a single family, they  are the promise made,  the promise kept,  and the promise about to be broken.  Grandma Opal came of age as Social Secu rity was born in the 1930s. By now, she says,  she's gotten back thousands of dollars more  than she ever paid in.  Bill's an optimist. He figures he's going to  live a  long time, long enough to enjoy all  that he's paid in. Maybe even a little more.  Then there are the children and grand children.  ""It doesn't look so good for  them, does  it?"" Bill asked, knowing the answer all too  well. ""With the politicians dipping into it,  the plan is doomed to fail.""  As benefits representative for United Auto  Workers Local 31 at the General Motors  Fairfax  assembly plant, he knows what  most other Americans don't know and don't  really want to know: There is no Social Se curity trust fund, at least as most of us or  any of the nation's bankers think of a trust  fund. There is no money waiting for Bill  Middleton, except in the future paychecks  of his children's generation. And if there is  none for him, there certainly is none for  them.  In the dark annals of American govern mental deception, none looms blacker than  the myth of the Social Security trust fund.  If asked, most Americans would say that  trust fund  is growing every day, building  more greenbacks through interest and pay check contributions toward each citizen's re tirement day.  They think that way because that's what  their leaders have told them. When the law  was revised in 1983, for instance, Sen. Bob  Dole of Kansas was at the forefront, an nouncing that the system was ""now sound  well into the next century.''  In fact, by Webster's definition, pedding  the ideas of a genuine Social Security trust  fund is peddling a  lie. Jim Blum, chief of  the budget analysis division of the Congres sional Budget Office, explained.  ""The trust funds really are only account ing conventions to keep track of the num bers. These aren't trust funds in the normal  sense of  the word,"" Blum said. ""I don't  know why we call them trust funds. I guess  the  aim  is  to  deliberately mislead  the  public.""  On paper, there is a trust fund, and it is  accumulating a  surplus. In point of fact,  that surplus money is immediately traded to  the federal government for non-negotiable  bonds, and the money is spent on other gov ernment activities. So  the best  the trust  May 16, 1989  fund has, Blum said,  is a stack of IOUs'  from the U.S. Treasury.  ""We are building up IOUs in the Social  Security trust fund that will come due in  future years. The question  is, how do we  pay for those IOUs in the year 2010 and  2015?""  In principle, the Treasury will return that  money  to  the Social Security  trust  fund  when the trust fund needs it. In reality, the  Treasury has  virtually  no money,  ever,  except what it is collecting in taxes.  REFORMS BROUGHT PROMISES  So what does that mean to the Middle tons? It means there will be no money for  Bill's retirement check in 2015 unless the  Middleton kids pay higher taxes of one vari ety or the other in 2015 to provide that re tirement check.  But what about all the pledges of long term solvency by Dole and others after  Social Security's reform legislation in 1983?  They were  technically correct, explained  one economists,  in the same sense that a  man might tell his wife he's putting money  in  the vacation fund every month, while  quietly ""borrowing"" it to play pool with the  boys. Eventually he must try to squeeze a  trip to Yellowstone out of the August pay check. The  family  vacation  fund would  show a fine Aug. 1 balance on paper-and be  empty.  Jeffrey Sachs, professor of economics at  Harvard University, summarized the long term effect of the 1983 reforms this way:  ""The simple fact is that before the 1983  Social Security fund's needs in 2015 <when  the flood of baby boomers will be retiring)  would have had to be paid out of current  revenues (tax collections) in 2015,"" he said.  ""After the tax increases, the Social Security  fund's needs in 2015 will still have to be paid  out of current revenues in 2015. You just  can't double count that <trust fund> money.  It is already being spent to pay for current  operations of the government.""  So what, exactly, did the Social Security  tax increases in 1984, plus all the rate in creases since, really achieve? Sometimes, in  a fit of candor, lawmakers tell us clearly and  concisely.  Rep. Leon Panetta, a California Democrat  who is chairman of the House Budget Com mittee, said in a recent interview: ""I think  most Americans would agree that they did  not anticipate that by enacting that <Social  Security> reform they were basically enact ing a blank check for other government  spending. We  implemented  those reforms  on the basis that we would secure the Social  Security  system,  that we  should protect  from bankruptcy.  ""So we created this huge Social Security  surplus by virtue of (Social Security) tax in creases. And now what we're seeing is a situ ation where, through the back door, we are  using  that money  to basically pay other  bills. So, yes, it is. It is a cover for basically  meeting needs that were not intended by  the <Social Security> tax.""  The money did,  indeed, come  in handy  back  then. That Social Security  tax  in crease, which fell hardest on poorer taxpay ers, was really the second major tax revision  of the early 1980s. The first had been a tax  cut for the more wealthy taxpayers. Taken  together, the two actions produced a trans fer of taxes from the rich to the poor.  THE CHILDREN'S CHOICES  In the end, Bill Middleton's children will  have only four choices in 2015.  ""When it comes time to spend that money  owed to the trust fund, the taxpayers in the  ",1989

Under the leadership of its founder, Arthur  Mitchell,  the Dance Theatre of Harlem has,  since 1969, brought hundreds of thousands of  dance lovers around the world to their feet as  a result of its  innovative well-choreographed  performances. The history of this company is  May 16, 1989  a rags to riches story, which emanated out of  Harlem, NY, going  from  local popularity  to  become one of the most sensational dance  experiences on stage today.  Arthur Mitchell has  taken his  talents and  has not only shared them with disadvantaged  youth from the black community, but has built  bridges  of  understanding  between  black  Americans and  the cultures of  the world.  It  has been a distinct and uplifting pleasure to  watch  the company's art  form breaking  into  the world of American, and  then  to  interna tional ballet.  In a time when nations feared and  fought  each other, when dialog was needed between  peoples of the world, Arthur Mitchell and the  Dance Theatre of Harlem were ambassadors  of peace, promoting understanding and  the  university of human experience through an art  form that can only be described as exhilarat ing.  Mr. Speaker, Arthur Mitchell and the Dance  Theatre of Harlem are not only  to be com mended  for outstanding contributions  to  the  world of the arts, but also deserve recognition  for their significant and eloquent symbolism in  support of peace at home and abroad.  I ask my colleagues to join me in extending  best wishes  for continued success in all  the  future  endeavors of Mr. Mitchell and  the  Dance Theatre of Harlem.  AWARD WINNER: PAM  LUGINBILL  HON.

The administration does not  want the Congress to appropriate any  more money for crime and drugs. That  is a fact. Everything else in this bill  has been agreed to, everything else.  The President came up here and got  on the steps of the Capitol on Monday  and called for twice as much money as  we have in this bill for additions to  function 750; that is, for law enforce ment and justice. He asked for twice as  much money as we have in this bill,  but they do not want the bill to come  up, and they do not want the House to  vote its will on whether or not they  want more money for crime and drugs.  Everything else has been agreed to in  this bill.

186,,101,-0.517,1116,7,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker,  it has been 8  years since  the minimum wage was  last  in creased. The $3.35 per hour wage today only  purchases $2.46 worth of goods and services  in the marketplace. Workers today deserve to  earn a decent wage for  the hard work  they  perform. H.R. 2,  the Fair Labor Standards  Amendments of 1989 creates the long over due opportunity for Congress and  the Presi dent to provide millions of low wage workers a  measure of economic justice.  President Bush's veto threat of this modest  proposal  is wrong and unfair to  the poorest  working men and women in the Nation. When  the President supports a capital gains tax and  opposes a modest  increase  in  the minimum  wage,  it is easy to see why the  income gap  between the richest and poorest Americans is  the greatest in more than 40 years.  I urge the President to reconsider and not  veto this legislation for the sake of 30 cents  an hour. Also, I believe it is important for all of  us to realize Congress' 60-day training wage  proposal  for  the very  first  job-or jobs-a  worker takes, is significantly different than the  Bush 6-month, potentially  lifetime,  submini mum.  The  following  article,  ""Bush's Minimum Wage Ploy,"" by Arnold Mayer, vice president  of the United Food & Commercial Workers  [AFL-CIO], that appeared  in  the Washington  Post on May 16, 1989, points out the differ ences in the two proposals and clearly shows  the only meaningful  increase  in  the Federal  wage floor is the congressional package.  I encourage my colleagues to join in our ef forts to convince President Bush of the imperEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tance of signing a meaningful minimum wage  bill. Copy of the article follows:  BUSH'S MINIMUM-WAGE PLOY  Some workers could end up on a submini mum training wage treadmill.  Much is missing from the public debate on  the differences between the minimum-wage  legislation passed by both houses of Con gress and the one supported by the Bush ad ministration. News reports concentrate on  1) the Bush call for a $4.25 an hour mini mum wage in three years as compared with  the congressional $4.55  rate; and  2>  the  Bush proposal  for  a  six-month  so-called  training wage versus the congressonal two month limit.  In actual fact,  the training wage differ ence is much greater and much more signifi cant both in economic and political terms.  The administration  is  demanding  a  six month training period every time a worker  changes his or her job, while the congres sional 60-day  total  training wage would  occur only once-on the very first  job or  jobs a worker took.  Under the Bush proposal, a worker could  be plagued with  the  subminimum wage  throughout his or her working life. Under  the Congressional  legislation,  the worker  would endure the subminimum only at the  start.  But there is more. In both proposals the  training wage would be either $3.35  an  hour-the minimum-wage  rate  in  effect  since Jan. 1, 1981-or a percentage of the  existing minimum  wage,  whichever  is  higher. The subminimum percentage would  be 80 percent in the Bush proposal and 85  percent in the congressional bill.  Multiply either the Bush minimum-wage  proposals of $3.65 an hour for 1990 or $3.95  for 1991 by 80 percent and the all-pervasive  training wage stays at $3.35 an hour both  years. In 1992, the Bush-proposed minimum  wage would go  to $4.25 and the training  wage would finally rise-by 5 cents to $3.40.  Minimum-wage workers leave jobs often.  In 1980,  the U.S. Minimum Wage Study  Commission  found  that  ""turnover was  greater among minimum-wage workers than  among those making higher wages."" In fact,  more than twice as great.  ""On a monthly basis, 13 percent of mini mum-wage workers left their jobs,"" accord ing to the commission. For the economy as a  whole, ""workers left their jobs at a 6 per cent monthly rate."" Many experts believe  the  turnover  rate among minimum-wage  workers is higher today.  The Bush proposal also gives employers  an  incentive  to conclude -that  these  low wage workers are inadequate  in their  job  performances as they approach the magic  six-month deadline. While the substitute of  subminimum workers  for  those  receiving  the full minimum wage would be illegal. the  U.S. Labor Department's Wage and Hour  Division has been so denuded of staff that it  could hardly enforce this difficult-to-prove  provision.  As a result, most workers employed at the  subminimum wage would never reach the  full rates proposed by Bush. Job changes either voluntary or forced-would effective ly keep them at the $3.35 and $3.40 rates.  The media has speculated that the Bush  ""take-it-or-leave-it""  attitude on minimum  wage is a political ploy aimed at stiffening  the image of a president who often compro mises with Congress. It is to show conserv atives that he does stand his ground.  Bush's minimum-wage strategy is actually  a shrewder maneuver  than  that. It is  a  May 17, 1989  double  play. Bush demonstrates  to  the  nation  a  ""gentler and kinder""  approach  than the Reagan flat ""no"" on minimum wage increases. At the same time, he assures  employers that under the law they will not  have  to pay more  to a  large number of  workers until 1992 and then an increase of  only a nickel an hour.  There  is yet another benefit for mini mum-wage opponents. Representatives, sen ators and the media are guessing what will  happen after the expected Bush veto of the  congressional minimum-wage legislation.  Congress will probably be unable to over ride  the veto. While both chambers ap proved the minimum-wage bills by comfort able margins, they did not pass them by the  two-thirds majority which the Constitution  demands for a veto override.  Bush may not be willing to make changes  in his proposals even after a veto. He could  very well continue his ""tough strategy"" for  the economic benefit of employers and the  political benefit of conservatives.  But  the political pressures may be  too  great. The administration may be willing or  may have to negotiate a new bill with Sen.  Edward M. Kennedy <D-Mass.) and Rep.  Augustus F. Hawkins CD-Calif.), the chair men of the congressional labor committees.  No genius  is needeJ  to foresee what a  compromise  of  the minimum-wage  rates  could be like. One side or the other may get  the better deal of a nickel in the difference  between the Bush prcposal of $4.25 an hour  in  the  third year and  the c,ongressional  $4.55 figure. The result is likely to be some where between $4.35 and $4.45.  Such a compromise would b1 ~ difficult for  minimum-wage  increase advocates to swal low. The cost of living has increased 37 per cent since  the $3.35 minimum  first went  into effect. The minimum should be at $4.60  today to make up the lost purchasing power  of these low-paid workers.  The $3.35 rate represented 48 percent of  the nation's average wage when it became  law in 1981. To equal the same percentage  of the average wage today, $4.58 would be  needed. Any wage compromise would there fore push minimum-wage workers even fur ther down the equity scale.  But  the negotiating sticking point will  come on the training wage. If the adminis tration becomes generous and cuts its six  months subminimum to just one month at  every  job  change,  the minimum-wage  worker still will be in deep trouble. Because  of  job  turnovers,  the $3.35 and the $3.40  rates will remain a major factor-and per haps  the predominant factor-in  the  job  market for minimum-wage workers.  This  after-the-veto  situation  puts  the  Democrats in a political bind. If they agree  to such a  training wage deal, they cripple  the effectiveness of the Fair Labor Stand ards Act-long a major jewel in the Demo. cratic New Deal's crown-and  they will  enrage  labor and other advocates of  the  working poor.  If congressional Democrats refuse to make  the deal, the administration will try to make  them appear as dogmatists who will not  compromise to provide a much-needed wage  increase to low-wage workers-even though  President Bush is not proposing a real in crease.  The minimum-wage fight could end up as  a victory for political cynicism at the ex pense of the working poor.  ",1989
187,,101,-0.478,1129,7,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, on Sunday,  May 21, many who remember a rare, coura geous, idealistic man named Tom Brown, will  gather  in  the Bronx  to  try  to honor  that  memory in a way that befits Tom's life by es tablishing  the Tom Brown Memorial Scholar ship Fund.  Today, I want to honor Tom's life, his ideals,  and his commitment to service.  Tom's entire adult life was devoted to help ing and serving other people.  Tom Brown was born  in 1943, grew up  in  the North Bronx and went  to one of New  York's  competitive  high  school's  for  high  achievers-Stuyvesant High School  in New  York City.  By  the  time he had  finished college,  in  1963, John Kennedy had said ""Ask what you  can do for your country!""  Tom asked himself that question, and an swered  the  question  as  a  young  idealist  would.  He entered  the brandnew Peace Corps  to  use his training in agriculture, political science  and economics, and was sent  to promote  community development in rural Chile.  When he  returned home  in 1965, he  re mained an  idealist, eager to use his new ex perience in solving important problems in his  own country.  First, Tom earned a masters degree in Latin  American studies, then returned to New York  City to help ensure that its Community Devel opment Agency would achieve the goals of its  antipoverty programs.  Tom was praised by Commissioner George  Nicolau who found  in him attributes essential  to antipoverty work: Cultural awareness, per sonal experience  in working with  the poor,  and a broad interdisciplinary knowledge of the  political, economic, historic, and social forces  that are involved in carrying out development  pr9grams.  He left that agency in 1969 to continue anti poverty work  in a different way: Working  for  the City University of New York,  in programs  aimed at helping students whose educational  or economic background had put  them at a  disadvantage in obtaining higher education.  In 1977, Tom returned to community devel opment work, this time in the Bronx communi ty where he lived with his wife and children.  He was appointed district manager of Commu nity Planning  Board  No.  11,  Bronx,  and  became known as someone who took no po litical sides at all, but worked for the benefit of  district residents.  Tom worked with merchants' and  tenants'  organizations, with  local and borough  repre sentatives of city agencies, and  testified at  public hearings and meetings. He worked hard  to improve municipal service delivery, and for  the quality of neighborhood life.  He fought hard for both large goals, such as  the revitalization of a commercial area, or the  establishment of a new police precinct, and  he fought for smaller gains, such as demoli  ",1989

It is great to sit here and cry because  the money is desperately needed and  the House will act, but do not lose  sight of the problem historically cre ated by their administration and their  administration of  the Veterans' Ad ministration itself.

195,,101,0.322,1311,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, today we  have before us the House and Senate  conference report on the 1990 budget.  The budget reductions provided in this  plan are very modest, but  they do  meet  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  targets for fiscal year 1990 and keep us  on the road to completely eliminating  the deficit by 1993. Now comes  the  hard part-sticking with  the  agree ment  and  resisting  temptations  to  expand  spending  or  raise  taxes.  Throughout this year we must keep in  mind the Gramm-Rudman targets: 100  in 1990, 64 in 1991, 28 in 1992, and 0 in  1993.  Next year we will have to find a min imum of $36 billion to meet the 1991  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  target, and  that's going  to  require  some  tough  choices. Some programs are going to  have to be cut back, others completely  eliminated, and  in an election year  that's going to be very difficult. Maybe  we can make our job a little easier by  starting negotiations on the fiscal year  1991 budget right now, as called for by  the bipartisan summit agreement and  the President of  the United States.  Cutting the budget is always hard, but  under the spotlight of a campaign the  temptation to postpone tough choices  becomes almost too great.  Unfortunately, a lot of cynics in this  town are skeptical about the chances  for  early negotiations on  the 1991  budget.

199,Senate,101,-0.382,1376,7,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I am pleased to join my distinguished  colleague  from Kentucky,  Senator  FORD, and our distinguished majority  leader, Senator MITCHELL, in introduc ing this bill to establish a Commission  on Aviation Security and Terrorism.  The goal of this Commission would  be to get the answers to the lingering  questions  surrounding  the  tragic  bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on De cember 21,  1988. Further,  it would  evaluate our Nation's ability  to  re spond to the terrorist threats posed to  civil aviation, and make recommenda tions for improving those efforts.  On March 17,  I  introduced Senate  Resolution 86, which called on  the  President to appoint an independent  commission to conduct this investiga tion and review. I was joined on that  day  by  Senators  FORD,  HOLLINGS,  BRADLEY, MIKULSKI, D'AMATO, HEINZ,  SARBANES, and MOYNIHAN. There are  now 19 cosponsors to Senate Resolu tion 86.  Unfortunately,  the President  has  chosen not to appoint such a commis sion. The administration has taken the  position that internal reviews will be  sufficient to correct the problems that  allowed the bombing of Pan Am 103 to  take place,  so  that more American  lives won't be lost to such terrorism.  By  introducing  this  bill, we  are  saying we don't agree. Mr. President, I  would say that, for this Senator, it is  not a matter of not taking the admin istration at its word; that word being  the President's stated commitment to  finding  the  answers  and  improving  aviation security. But rather, as I've  stated before, it's a question of juris diction. The issues involved fall under  the purview of several Federal depart ments and agencies. Similarly,  they  fall under the jurisdiction of a number  of different committees in the Senate  and House.  It continues to be my belief that the  best way  to address the serious con cerns about Pan Am 103 and our avia tion  security  programs  overall  is  through  a  single,  comprehensive  review of the facts. A commission like  that outlined in the bill we're intro ducing today would meet that stand ard.  This Commission would have nine  members:  two each from  the House  and Senate; one from the Department  of Transportation; one from the intel ligence community; one from the Na tional Transportation Safety Board;  one from the airline industry; and one  from the victims of Pan Am 103, the  group of families and friends of those  killed on that flight.  I believe that this composition would  allow for a  thorough, fair  investiga tion. The intention would not be to  repeat or overlap ongoing criminal in vestigations. Its goal would not be to  point fingers; but rather to point out  needed changes.  Mr. President, we were all touched  by the tragic destruction of Pan Am  flight 103 on December 21 over Lock erbie, Scotland. That bombing was an  unprecedented assault on America and  American citizens. It is our responsibil ity to find out all we can about how  the bombing happened, and do what  we can to prevent such attacks in the  future.  But  today, almost 4 months after  their  loved  ones were  so  viciously  taken from  them,  these people still  don't have the answers they deserve.  They don't know who knew what,  when  they knew  it, what was done  with the information, and what should  have been done. Further, there contin ue to be unanswered questions about  whether we're doing all we can to pro tect the lives of the millions of Ameri cans traveling abroad each year.  On March 14, the Subcommittee on  Transportation of the Senate Appro priations Committee held a hearing to  look into the Pan Am 103 bombing. At  that hearing,  important  information  was withheld from the subcommittee.  It was only when press  reports  in  Europe disclosed that there had been  a security bulletin  issued  to our air  carriers because of a possible threat  from  terrorists  that  the administra tion admitted to the existence of such  information.  It is unacceptable to have important  information  continue  to  come  out  piecemeal. We must get the facts, so  we can improve the efficiency of our  aviation security system. This requires  a close look at the events leading up to  the bombing of Pan Am 103 and a  comprehensive look at how our Gov ernment addresses the growing prob lem of aviation terrorism.  The bill Senators FORD, MITCHELL,  and I are introducing today provides a  means of getting such a review. I ap plaud Senator FORD  for his efforts,  and urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  Mr. President,  in closing  I would  note that the families and friends of  those killed on Pan Am 103 continue  to call for a full Senate investigation,  separate  from  the Commission  that  would  be  established  by  this  bill.  They've been frustrated by the admin istration's refusal to agree to an inde pendent review. I greatly respect their  refusal  to  take ""no"" for an answer,  and will continue  to work on  their  behalf to request a separate Senate in vestigation, as well.e  By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr.  BOREN, Mrs. KASSEBAUM, Mr.  NICKLES, Mr.  BENTSEN, Mr.  GRAMM,  Mr.  BAUCUS,  Mr.  BURNS,  Mr.  PRESSLER,  Mr.  WIRTH, Mr. PRYOR,  and Mr.  DASCHLE):  S. 1044.

201,,101,0.231,1506,7,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, this Member  had  the intellectually challenging and satisfy ing experience  to be among  the 60 partici pants in the 76th American Assembly, Colum bia University, which met on April  20-23,  1989, at the Arden House in Harriman, NY, to  focus on the global economy of the 1990's as  it relates to American interests. The Honora ble William E. Brock and Dr. Robert D. Hor mats acted as codirectors  for this assembly  program and supervised  the preparation of  papers used as background  reading by  the  participants.  I believe  the  final  report of the assembly,  entitled, ""Seize the Moment,"" is a statement  that deserves the attention of my colleagues  in the U.S. Congress, our staff, the executive  branch,  American  business  interests,  and  Americans generally. While not all participants  in the assembly agree with all aspects of the  statement,  it does  represent  an  unusually  large degree of general agreement given the  complex  and  controversial  nature  of  the  issues and interests involved and the vigorous  discussion and debate that occurred.  I invite  the attention of my colleagues to the following  report of the American Assembly:  SEIZE THE MOMENT: U.S. INTERESTS IN THE  1990's  PREAMBLE  Dramatic changes have taken place in the  global economy-and the pace is  likely  to  continue at a  relentless rate. We see the  next few years as a watershed-a significant  turning point in post-World War II political,  economic,  and security  relations.  It  is  a  uniquely  promising moment  in  history,  when Western Europe  is moving  toward  unity; Japan has attained great economic  power and is seeking appropriate world re sponsibilities; the Soviet Union, several na tions  in Eastern Europe, and China are  turning away from doctrinaire communism  to attempt economic and political reforms;  and  many  developing  countries  have  emerged as pace-setters in political and ecoEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  nomic reform. In short, we have relative  peace and many shared political and eco nomic goals-a large number of which have  been inspired by U.S. example. Moreover,  this  remarkable moment  in  history  is  formed by a fast-moving, multi-dimensional  technological revolution which has height ened the increasing interdependence of na tions.  Yet, at a time that should be triumphant,  the industrialized democracies have permit ted dangerous trade and other economic im balances to build up within the internation al system. Unless corrected soon, they could  engulf the world in a new wave of protec tionism and bring a financial crisis in the  1990s. Those imbalances are rooted in mis taken  and often  self-indulgent  domestic  policies of  the  industrialized democracies.  Responsibility for ensuring a health inter national economy now rests primarily upon  domestic  policy  changes  in  the United  States, Japan, and Western Europe. It is  urgent that the leaders of those nations act  quickly and decisively, The 1990s represent  a decade of enormous opportunity, but we  must no longer ignore the growing dangers.  We need to seize the moment to create a  new architecture for international economic  cooperation, one  that  takes advantage of  the economic strength many of our friends  and allies have attained in recent years. We  need to promote global growth, expand and  liberalize trade, strengthen the internation al development effort, and address  issues  such as drugs and environmental deteriora tion, which  affect  virtually  all  nations  acutely.  Constructing this new architecture poses  an exciting challenge to American leader ship. Having risen to the task of rebuilding  the global economy after World War II, the  United States is at a point in history when  it must again exert  leadership, as  it did  then, to develop a comprehensive strategy  for addressing the myriad issues before the  international  economy.  This  time  the  United States can act with the help of a  group of nations that were unable to play a  major role in the 1940s, but they can and  must now share responsibility for providing  the ideas, leadership, and resources neces sary to meet the challenges ahead.  The world has made remarkable economic  progress since the devastation of World War  II-and Americans  should  feel  a  strong  sense of pride that their nation's leadership  has played a critical role  in  this success.  Most of the goals set by the United States  for  achieving  a  stronger and prosperous  democratic world over the last forty years  have been met beyond expectations: West ern Europe and Japan are thriving and pros perous democracies, market economics has  demonstrated its superiority to communism,  and world  trade and investment have ex panded dramatically.  What  then should our goals be, what  policy instruments should be employed to  achieve them, and what institutional struc tures are best suited to the tasks ahead?  The economic and political relationships  among nations and the underlying charac teristic of the global economy today differ  greatly from those of the 1940s, when cur rent international institutions were created,  and by the end of this century they will be  far different still. Today  the  freedom of  capital flow exerts powerful constraints on  national management, burgeoning popula tions in the developing world exert massive  pressures  for migration, governments  in creasingly seek to manage flows  to  trade  and direct investment, the forces of economMay 18, 1989  ic nationalism have been stronger as globali zation of the world economy renders work ers and industries more vulnerable to inter national  forces; nations artificially create  competitive advantage to the detriment of  others;  trade and current account  imbal ances reflect large domestic imbalances in  the United States and its trading partners;  populations have come to realize how vul nerable they are to one another's lack of en vironmental  responsbility,  remarkable  changes in the previously rigid economies in  the Communist world  reflect  recognition  that they lack global competitiveness and  are unable to meet the basic needs of their  citizens; the world's poorer nations, most of  them  debt-encumbered,  are  experiencing  enormous human and economic problems  which portend social volatility and interna tional instability; and technological changes  cause quick shifts in competitive advantage  and bring the world closer together by per mitting the instant and massive dissemina tion of information and ideas.  Leaders and officials under pressure of  time and politics must make choices that  will influence the course of our lives and so cieties. Often what appear  to be  insur mountable political or resources constraints  to new policies or shifts in priorities, atti tudes, or patterns of resource allocation can  be overcome if benefits of doing so, or the  costly implications of not doing so, are made  dramatically clear. President Franklin Roo sevelt conveyed a  sense of  the costs  to  America of failing to provide Britain with  lend-lease aid by explaining the importance  of helping a neighbor to put out the fire in  his home lest it next spread to yours.  It is frequently asserted that democracies  take bold decisions only in crisis. In the cur rent environment it is essential to build a  new architecture of international economic  cooperation and address internal economic  problems,  to avert a crisis. Failure to act  puts the United States in harm's way-vul nerable to an energy crisis as our import de pendence increases, vulnerable to a finan cial crisis as domestic and international defi cits and our attendant dependence on mas sive imports of foreign capital persist, vul nerable to an outbreak of economiic nation alism as trade issues and imbalances go un attended to, vulnerable to massive instabil ity in the Third World along with massive  immigration pressures as the debt problem  festers, vulnerable to unexampled dangers  to the physical environment, and vulnerable  to the geopolitical consequences of instabil ity in Eastern Europe as their economies de teriorate. Even if such crises never occur, in sufficiently bold action on the domestic and  international economic fronts will mean a  steady drift that renders us less and less ca pable of influencing events and saps Ameri can leadership potential and spirit.  FIRST AMONG EQUALS: RELATIONSHIPS WITH  JAPAN AND EUROPE  From being first,  the United States has  become first among equals, its main rivals  also being  its closest allies:  the European  Community <EC) and Japan. The difficul ties  thus created stem  in  large measure  from the success of earlier American initia tives. Economic reconstruction of Western  Europe and Japan and the political integra tion of  the European Communiuty were,  with  the  successful  containment of  the  USSR, the principal strategic goals of the  United States in the postwar world.

This group is from  my congressional district, and  they were my  representatives in the State of Texas competi tion which they won.  Twenty-seven students from A&M Consoli dated High School in College Station reached  the national  finals  through much hard work  and dedication by studying  these documents  and  the values and principles  they embody.  These  students are: Kelly Andrews, Karen  Bassichis, Abid Bhimani, Christine Bivins, Josh  Busby, Jennifer Busch, Lisa D'Souza, Richard  De Vaul, Christopher Dinkel, Barbara Ellison,  Kay Fisher, Brian Fiske, John Herring, Brooke  Hill, Chi-Cheng Huang, Jeremy Hyman, Padma  Kodali,  Christina  Laane,  Eric MacGilvray,  Darrin Marquez, Michael McGrann, Kazys Mo tekaitis, Rahim Rajan, Shannon Ramsay, Wil liam  Taparauskas,  Thomas Weaber,  and  David Ray Wright.  I highly commend  these students, along  with  their  teacher, Mr. Bobby Slovak,  their  State coordinator, Ms. Hope Lochridge, and  their district coordinator, Mrs. Barbara Wei singer. They have worked very hard and have  represented Texas well.  Educating our Nation's young people about  the Constitution  is an  investment we  can  never overlook. These students are the deci sionmakers of tomorrow, and we must depend  on them to carry out what our Founding Fa thers envisioned for the future.

204,,101,0.33,1519,7,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition  of  three  outstanding  young  people from my district: Scott Kelley, Sue Yu,  and Aaron Cooper. These young people de serve our congratulations as  the winners of  the 1989 Creve Coeur Missouri Chamber of  Commerce and the Lions Club Essay Contest.  Scott, Sue, and Aaron will each receive a  scholarship from the Creve Coeur chamber of  commerce and  the Creve Coeur Lions Club  based on  their exceptional understanding of  economics as illustrated by their prize-winning  essays  in  the Chamber of Commerce and  Lions Club annual essay contest. This contest  has  traditionally attempted  to challenge stu9983  dents to  formulate a response  to a specific  question in their answer, combining pragmatic  considerations with social responsibility.  This years question, ""In a capitalist society,  is there an obligation in the business commu nity  to narrow  the gap between  the ""have""  and ""have not's?"" would challenge even the  most seasoned of social architects, but leave  these young people undaunted. Their answers  are notable for their bold and intelligent analy sis, and  reflect  tremendous  insight  into  the  problems which confront our society today. In  their discussion of  these  issues  they have  shown an awareness often  lacking  in more  experienced policymakers.  The  first place answer came  from Scott  Kelley of Westminster Christian Academy who  likened the problem of poverty in America to  Robin Hood of England. His argument, that re distributing wealth for social purposes by any  mechanism is inferior to increasing productivi ty for poverty aleviation, should be must read ing for American policymakers.  For this award-winning answer Scott will re ceive a $2,000 scholarship from the Chamber  and  the Lions Club. The second and  third  place awards of $1,000 each go to Sue Yu of  Parkway Central Senior High School  and  Aaron Cooper of Parkway North Senior High,  but in my book they are all first place winners.  Our Nation is fortunate to have fine young  people such as these and organizations such  as  the Creve Coeur Chamber of Commerce  and  the Creve Coeur Lions Club which en courage these activities. The chamber and the  Lions Club are  to be commended  for taking  an active  interest  in  the education of our  youth, and  for backing this commitment with  the investment in time and money it requires.  This is the sort of private sector initiative we  should, indeed must, encourage.  Our young people are  the window  to  the  future of our Nation. Through  their eyes we  can see tomorrow, with their thoughts we will  dream new dreams. The winners,  indeed, all  of the participants, renew our optimism in the  future of this Nation. For this we thank them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask each of my colleagues to  join me  in congratulating these young Ameri cans and wishing  them success in whatever  field of endeavor they pursue.  IMPORTANCE  VETERANS'  PROGRAMS  OF  PROTECTING  HEALTH  CARE  HON. LARKIN I. SMITH  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 18, 1989  ",1989
205,Senate,101,-0.303,5,12,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President,  I  have not had the opportunity to hear  all of the remarks made by the distin guished Republican leader, but I think  I probably heard  them before. Cer tainly I heard them in the Agriculture  Committee markup this morning and  over the last couple of days in our ne gotiations, and our discussions. There  is no one more persistent, more deter mined, and in some ways more eff ec tive in articulating his position than  the Republican leader.  And so it is with due respect that I  rise in strong opposition to his charac terization of  the bill  that was  just  passed in the Senate Agriculture Com mittee moments ago. The fact is-and  the Republican  leader will attest to  this-we have tried for weeks, virtually  months, to arrive at a consensus on  what we should do in disaster legislation this year. Time after time we met  with  the Republican  leadership and  time after time we failed to arrive at  that consensus, as close as we were on  a number of opportunities. Today's  markup was our best shot at consensus  in the realization  that  the drought  continues and worsens in some cases.  We also recognized that we are now  bumping up against the August recess,  implying that we could do nothing else  but pass out a bill, and that we did  this morning.  This bill  really does  three  things.  First of  all,  it  recognizes  that  the  drought does not just affect those who  signed up for the program. It affects  everybody. Our Republican Secretary  of Agriculture  in South Dakota has  made a number of very eloquent state ments with regard to the need to cover  all crops and to be sure that we do it  effectively. This bill does that.  The second thing this bill does very  effectively is come within the guide lines, the bounds, that we face budg etarily. We have  to  respond  to  the  budgetary problems as well as the crit ical agricultural problems as we deal  with drought and other diseases and  this bill does so.  The third and perhaps in some ways  the most effective argument in this  compromise proposal is that it is fair.  Not only does  it deal with program  and nonprogram  crops,  understand ably, with  some differential, but  it  deals with  the broader situation at  hand. It recognizes that under the Re publican proposal, farmers are going  to be required to pay back deficiency  payments in December. I would call it  the ""Grinch Bill"" if I wanted to char acterize it in a negative way, but I am  not going to do that.  The fact is the Lugar-Dole bill would  require farmers, for reasons inexplica ble,  to pay back their advance defi ciency payments at  the  same  time  they are buying Christmas presents. I  cannot figure that out.  Perhaps most importantly in dealing  with fairness, the compromise bill rec ognizes, that it is wrong for us to pit  farmers against farmers. It is a mis take we make in the Senate and Con gress time and time again. We cannot  do that, and this compromise bill rec ognizes  the  importance of ensuring  that all farmers are covered.  In  contrast,  the Lugar-Dole  bill  would  exclude  780,000  com  farms,  698,000 wheat  farms  from  receiving  disaster  assistance,  simply  because  they did not participate in the crop  programs  this year. In the State of  Kansas alone, 9,000 com farms and  41,000 wheat farms would be excluded  under the Lugar-Dole bill. In my own  State of South Dakota, 10,000 com  farms, 24 percent of  the  total, and  11,000 wheat farms, 35 percent of the  total, would be excluded.  ",1989

While I am a member of  our Savior's Lutheran Church in Fond  du Lac, WI, when we are in Washing ton, my family and I very much enjoy  participating in the life of Reverend  Wegener's congregation, where we are  stimulated by and learn much from  his sermons.  My colleagues in the House may be  interested to learn that the gentleman  who led us this morning in the Pledge  of Allegiance,  the  gentleman  from  South Carolina CMr. SPENCE], was a  member of Reverend Wegener's con gregation for many years while Rever end Wegener was there at St. Peters  Lutheran Church in Lexington, SC.  I should also  like  to welcome  the  Reverend's wife, Ellie, other members  of the Wegener family, and members  of the congregation who have joined  us on this occasion.  WHO GETS THE TAX BREAKS?

207,House,101,-0.082,96,12,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  1980 Ronald Reagan said:  in  I'm going to cut your taxes, and I'm not  going to stop there. I'm going to cut your  boss' taxes, and when I do, you are going to  have more money in your pocket and you  can spend that money. Even though I cut  your taxes, the Gross National Product is  going  to grow and our tax revenues are  going to grow, even though you pay less  taxes.  Well, here  is how that worked. If  you were a  family of  four making  $25,000, you got a  tax break about  enough to take your family to a good  dinner.  If you made  $250,000  you  could take that tax break and buy a  brand new Mercedes Benz,  the best  one made, and then take your family  to dinner. So much for the tooth fairy!  Now President Bush wants  to cut  the capital gains tax. I say, right on,  Speaker FOLEY, keep fighting before  the cab drivers in New York are haul ing Americans around in rickshaws.

210,House,101,-0.342,174,12,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, today, the gentleman  from Kentucky, my  colleague  and  ranking member  on  Investigations  Subcommittee, and I bring before the  House  a  drug  interdiction package  based on extensive hearings and staff  work. This is a package that the House  can be proud of-not a quick response  to the floor action and politics of the  moment.  In last year's Defense authorization  bill, the Congress seized the initiative  and, under the leadership of our late  colleague, Bill Nichols, created a new  role for the military in drug interdic tion. Today, we clarify, strengthen and  fund that new role.  Let me tell you what this package is  not:  It is not the answer to the enormous  drug problem in this country.  It is not a program which will de stroy  the  readiness  of  the Armed  Forces.  It is not a plan to put the military  on the streets enforcing the laws of  this country.  This package calls upon the military  to help fight the real threat to our na tional security in a way that enhances  conventional  readiness,  without  making  the military a  law enforce ment agency.  Last year we put our money where  our mouth was to the tune of $300 mil lion. We are making progress. We have  seen some successes,  some changing  patterns  of  smuggling,  and  some  changing attitudes on the part of the  Department of Defense. This year we  put our money where our mouth is to  the tune of $450 million.  Here is what we fund: $100 million  for  operations-steaming  days  and  flying hours, $125 million for equip ment such as radars and aerostats and  associated communications, $70 mil lion for State National Guard oper ations, $50 million for  interoperable  communications gear for law enforce ment agencies, $48 million for aircraft  conversions <Marine OV-10), $35 mil lion for intelligence support, $20 mil lion for drug-related R&D for law en forcement agencies, and $1 million for  Civil Air Patrol flying hours in sup port of law enforcement agencies.  Once again Congress must seize the  initiative because the President's and  Defense Secretary's budget contained  no funding for drug interdiction. We  know what the people of this country  are concerned about in the area of na tional  security-and  drugs  is  their  number one concern. Make no mistake  about  it,  this  is a national security  matter. Congress must  respond and  this package keeps the initiative in the  Congress.  I  urge my  colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to get behind  this program and send a clear message  to our citizens and the drug smugglers  alike.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  gentleman  from Massachusetts CMr.  MAVRouLEsl  has consumed  3112 min utes.  ",1989
211,House,101,0.347,174,12,Mr. HOPKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank my colleague for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to join  my friend and Chairman of the Inves tigations Subcommittee, NICK MAv ROULES,  in bringing  this comprehen sive military drug interdiction amend ment before  the House.  I want  to  extend my congratulations to the gen tleman for his leadership in this area.  Everyone  in  this Chamber knows  that the war on drugs is being lost.  Look at our schools,  look at our  streets, look at the borders and in our  Nation's Capital City the drug smug glers and drug traffickers are laughing  at the best efforts of our law enforce ment community. They need help.  It should be clear that America must  deploy whatever  resources,  like  the  military and use them where prudent  and necessary.  For the past 2 years, the House has  adopted  amendments  during  this  debate strongly directing the Depart ment of Defense to help out in this  war on drugs.  Last year, the House-Senate confer ence yielded an agreement which es tablished a brand new mission for the  military in the area of drug interdic tion.  Predictably,  the military's immedi ate knee-jerk reaction was one of skep ticism and opposition, but I believe  this is changing. They wouldn't volun teer, so we drafted them.  After a number of hearings and ex tensive  consultation with  the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, I am pleased to report  that progress is being made.  The Department of Defense is begin ning to formulate the necessary plans  and resources to put together a credi ble  and effective drug enforcement  plan.  Last year, we not only gave them the  charter, we also gave  them funds to  get  this effort off  the ground and  meet the challenge head on.  With our amendment today, we are  ready to take the second step.  We have crafted a responsible, meas ured and effective package which de serves  the  strong  support  of  this  House.  In the future-consider using-spe cial operations like SEAL teams who I  think would welcome  to help with  drug interdiction.  But for now, vote ""yes"" on the Mav roules drug interdiction amendment.  ",1989
212,House,101,-0.153,174,12,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to thank the gentleman from Massa chusetts for yielding me 1 minute, and  want to thank him and his colleague  the  gentleman  from Kentucky  for  doing good work in this entire area. I  have a question of the gentleman.  ",1989
213,House,101,0.47,187,12,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to commend the gentleman on his ar gument. He is absolutely right, by the  United States showing the will of the  West  and  going  forward with  the  ground launch cruise missile and the  Pershing missile, we brought the Sovi ets to the bargaining table. Members  could use exactly the same argument  that it was a waste of money to have  ever built these in the first place, but  the facts are, if we had not built these,  the Soviets would never have removed  the SS-20 that they were intimidating  our allies with.  This is a very important manif esta tion of the will, not only of this coun try but of the Western alliance. Mr.  Gorbachev has been over there driving  the wedge, and we need to show our  allies that it has not worked, and show  our adversaries that it has not worked.  I commend the gentleman.  ",1989
214,House,101,-0.058,187,12,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Chairman, I want to voice  my opposition to the amendment to eliminate  authorization for the SAAM-T. With all due re spect to my honorable colleague from Califor nia,  I do not believe  that  in  funding  the  SAAM-T the Air Force violated  the spirit of  the INF Treaty.  The INF Treaty is very clear as to the types  and ranges of the missiles it sought to elimi nate. They were  ground-launched missiles  with a range of 500 to 5,000 kilometers. The  SAAM-T missile is air launched and its maxi mum range would be well under 500 kilome ters. Further discussion of  this point  is not  possible because we are in open session.  Furthermore, I wish to point out that in de veloping a missile such as the SAAM-T, the  United States will match an already existing  Soviet capability. Soviet missile systems, such  as  the AS-X-16 Kickback, and  the  longer  range AS-3 and AS-4, carried on Backfire  bombers, are all comparable to the SAAM-T.  During negotiations, which  I hasten  to point  were painstaking and  thorough, a decision  was made to exclude such missiles from the  INF Treaty. This coupled with  the  fact  that  similar Soviet systems already exist, suggest  that in no way is the SAAM-T a violation of  the spirit of the INF Treaty.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge my colleagues to re store funding to the SAAM-T Program. Devel",1989
215,House,101,-0.404,200,12,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, first  on the substantive point, if the gentle man turned to page 7 of the amend ment, he would see very clearly that  the provision entitled ""Inapplicability  to  foreign  persons  licensed  by  an  MTCR country,"" member country who  grants export license, subsection does  not apply in this case, which is directly opposite to the point the gentleman  made.  ",1989
216,House,101,0.232,200,12,Mr. WELDON.," That may be  the  case.  If there  is  a  consideration,  I  should have looked at it. I apologize.  However, the point is, we have not  considered this legislation in the com mittee. It is unfair to ask members in  the Committee on Armed Services to  add a substantive piece of legislation  in this nature without giving members  the opportunity to debate to air the  pros and cons, and to have 5 minutes  back and forth on this issue. I do not  think we should vote.  ",1989

219,House,101,-0.416,213,12,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise not to criticize Secretary Cheney  or to criticize Mr. DICKINSON, who is  involved  in this amendment. It is a  very  important  amendment,  and  I  think it really will define what this bill  is ultimately about.  Secretary Cheney came to the De partment and he made some choices,  and he  thinks  they  are  the  right  choices.  I  do not agree with  those  choices. I think we can do better than  that. I think in the main, the commit tee did that. The choice the committee  made was not to fund the strategic de fense initiative or the B-2 bomber to  the extent that the Secretary wanted,  but  instead to add some dollars for  interdicting drugs, to add some dollars  for cleaning up nuclear waste, and to  add  some  dollars  to  conventional  6112  D 1850  I  I  afford everything, and that is what  the Cheney budget does.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, my es teemed colleague from Massachusetts  [Mr. MAVROULES] said that the Cheney  budget meant that the next 2 days are  irrelevant. They are not.  forces. I  think these are things that  most Members agree need to be done.  The charge is that by not passing  the Cheney budget, we will be adding  pork.  I  resent  that charge.  If it  is  made, I do not think it is true. The V22 is a good system that enhances our  conventional capability. The F-14  is  needed for our nuclear aircraft carri ers, and I  think they are good and  strong arguments that can be made  Mr. Chairman, my colleagues can  for both.  John Kennedy once  said  that  to  support the Cheney budget and still  vote against one item or two items, if  govern  is  to make choices. We are  they choose to do so  in the next 2  making a very important choice in the  days, but they have the opportunity to  passage of this bill. I simply rise to re spectfully  suggest  that  the  choices  vote aye on the Cheney budget, aye on  the Dickinson amendment.  Secretary Cheney makes should not be  our choices, but that we have an op",1989
220,House,101,-0.173,213,12,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to the amendment offered by the gentle man from Alabama [Mr. DICKINSON).  Regardless of the arguments that might be  made  in support of big-ticket  items-notably  the B-2  bomber-in  the  so-called Cheney  budget. I think the committee has already con sidered well the greater priorities in  this tight  budgetary climate-especially as it affects the  National Guard and Reserves and  the V-22  Osprey.  After much consideration of our budgetary  constraints and the tough decisions faced by  Secretary Cheney, I think his decision to cut  the V-22 was shortsighted. This helicopter/  airplane hybrid will vastly increase the capa bilities of our fighting  forces-getting  troops  where  they are needed faster with a better  [Mr. CARPER].  ",1989

",1989
223,Senate,101,-0.142,252,12,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  to  join my  colleague, Mr.  NICKLES,  in expressing our apprecia tion to the Armed Services Committee  for agreeing to this amendment to au thorize the fiscal year 1990 budget re quest of $31.8 million to fund  three  military  construct'ton  projects  at  Tinker Air Force Base in preparation  for  the maintenance of the B-2 air craft.  The Air Force,  several years ago,  prepared the Depot Military Construc tin Program for the B-2 estimating a  budget of $113 million spread over 4  years  for  the most  cost-efficient  manner of providing the necessary calay  that  pability  to maintain this highly so phisticated weapons system.  Authorizing  the funding  for  these  three projects, which were included in  the Air Force fiscal year 1990 budget,  prevents  costly  delays. The  secure  storage facility design will be 100 per cent complete by January 1990. The  integrated support facility will be 100percent design complete by early No vember this year and the avionics fa cility  is  already  100-percent  design  complete.  The House and Senate have voted  this week to support the authorization  of the procurement of the B-2. This  amendment will make  it possible  to  keep  the  depot  activation  timely.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their  support.  ",1989

226,House,101,-0.308,369,12,Mr. BRENNAN.," Mr. Speaker,  the  principal mission of the B-2 bomber is  to penetrate Soviet airspace after both  sides  have  already  launched  their  thousands of nuclear missiles. Presum ably these missiles will have hit their  targets and both  the United States  and the Soviet Union will have been  destroyed.  In essence, by  that  time  the war  would have been lost by both sides.  Then after both countries are devas tated, the B-2 would fly into action,  penetrate Soviet airspace and drop its  bombs. This comes as close as I can  possibly envision to a mission literally  to make the rubble bounce.  To me, that sort of mission for the  B-2 does not justify the spending of  $70  to $100 billion of the taxpayers'  money. Yes, the B-2 bomber is a plane  without a mission, certainly a plane  that does not justify the most expen sive weapons system in history.  It is time to stop a weapons system  we do not need, cannot afford, and  really has no justifiable mission.

228,House,101,-0.506,382,12,Mr. FOGLIETTA.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in strong support of the amend ment  offered  by Messrs. DELLUMS,  KASICH, and ROWLAND.  The B-2 bomber makes no sense on  strategic  grounds,  or  on  budget  grounds. Arguments for the B-2 and  against this amendment are seriously  flawed.  Some B-2 supporters argue that it is  necessary for arms control. I disagree.  The United States has no intention of  bargaining away the B-2. A bargaining  chip is not a bargaining chip if you  will not bargain.  Some B-2 supporters say that stop ping this bomber will ruin the triad.  But the B-1 bombers-which have  already been purchased-could be up graded to be a penetrating bomber at  about one-tenth the cost of the B-2  program.  Some opponents of this amendment  argue that we must find some sort of  middle  ground.  I  say  there  is  no  middle ground. According to the cur rent 5-year plan,  in  1992  the B-2  bomber will get $8 billion. Come on,  there is hardly a person in this room  who realistically thinks that we will  give $8 billion to one program.  However, if the budget is chopped in  half, the per plane costs will double.  So we spend 50 percent of the money,  and we get a 25-percent return on our  investment.  By  restructuring  the program, by  trimming the buy, all we do is drive  the costs per plane through the roof.  If we think $600 million per bomber  is  sticker  shock, wait  till we  start  spending over $1 billion per bomber.  Let's be real.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on  the Dellums-Kasich-Rowland amend ment. Vote YES for sanity.  ",1989
229,House,101,-0.321,382,12,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oregon [Mr. AUCOIN].  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman,  I do  not like paying this kind of price for a  weapon any more  than anyone else.  But more  important  than price  is  value. And  the Stealth  technology  bomber is high value.  Slow weapons are better than fast  weapons, because they can't be used  for a surprise attack first strike. By  the same logic that makes MX, D5,  and their Soviet quick-strike counter parts destabilizing, the B-2 is stabiliz ing.  Any manned bomber  is stabilizing,  but the B-2  is  the most stabilizing.  Why? Because you not only have to be  slow, you have to be sure you're going  to penetrate whatever defenses  the  other side can put up. And the B-2  gives every evidence of being the best  penetrator ever built.  Its Stealth technology is even better  than that of the advanced cruise mis sile. Its range with a heavy payload is  exceptionally long.  And while this hasn't been discussed  by the Air Force, any airplane with  such large wing area is going to have  phenomenally long loiter time. This is  critical, because long loiter is exactly  what a President needs in a crisis. He  needs an airplane that can take off, fly  to the fail-safe point, keep it orbiting,  safe, recallable-and nonprovocative over American territory for the long est possible time while he negotiates  to prevent Armageddon. The B-2 gives  him that capability.  Another apparent advantage of the  B-2 that hasn't been discussed is the  no-tail design. Generally speaking, the  part of an airplane that's most vulner able to nuclear blast is the vertical fin.  The B-2 doesn't have one. This would  appear to give it better pre-launch sur vival than conventional airframes.  I know many of you approach the B2 with a jaundiced eye, because of the  bad experience we've had with the B l. I agree with you. The B-1 was a mis take. It was Reagan's Folly, one of  many. We should never have built it.  But this isn't the B-1, it's the B-2. If  it tests out OK, it'll be a far better de terrent than the B-1, the MX, the D5,  and star wars combined.  So please, don't let the sticker shock  be the whole story. The B-2 is high value, well worth the price. I respect  the  sincerity  of my  friends, Mr.  KASICH  and ",1989
230,House,101,-0.133,382,12,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in support of  the Aspin-Synar  compromise which cuts $470 million  from the bill's authorization for the  Stealth,  requires  the Department of  Defense  to  restructure  the program  and meet  test and performance  re quirements limiting to two the number  of airplanes bought in fiscal years 1990  and 1991. The DOD must come up  with a plan about this airplane which  requires a subsequent vote from the  Congress.  Mr. Chairman, of all the proposals  this probably  is  the most intelligent  way to deal with this particular air plane.  I  know  that Americans  are  shocked because of the cost of this air plane, but, quite frankly, it speaks to  the imprudence of keeping a program  of this size in a classified nature for so  long. The sticker shock is largely due  to the fact that it is a surprise because  it has been a classified program, and it  speaks for the fact that we ought not  to  ever  let  this happen again. We  ought to never let a program of this  magnitude stay secret for so long so  that the American people do not believe that they have the knowledge of  whether the weapon system is useful,  can fly, can do what we say it can do.  Mr. Chairman, we have spent a lot  of money on this plane. I do not know  for sure whether we ought to continue  it or cancel it, but I know that it is im prudent for us, 3 months after it has  come out of a classified status, to just  cancel it given all of the money that  has been spent into it to date.  If its mission is anywhere near what  the military says it is, it is probably a  pretty good deal for us. If the mission  is what the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  KAs1cHl says it is, it is a lousy deal for  us.  The question  is: What  is  the best  way for us to find that out? Mr. Chair man, I  think the Aspin-Synar is  the  best way  to do  it. Test it seriously.  Decide whether the money spent in  the past is worth the money or not,  and vote on it again based upon that  data, and, if the gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. KAs1cHl  is right, we will can the  program in 6 months to a year, but, if  he is wrong, we will scale it back, and  we will have a weapons system that is  more prudent and more cost efficient.  So, Mr. Chairman, it is not a com fortable position for me because my  constituents are not crazy about the  cost of this program, but I  think it  best for the national security of this  country and  for  fiscal prudence  to  adopt  the middle-ground  approach  which is the Aspin-Synar approach.

232,House,101,0.217,382,12,Mr. PORTER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  strongly support the amendment of fered by Mr. KASICH,  and commend  him for his tireless efforts on this very  important matter.  Today we are  faced with another  vote  that  requires us  to make  the  tough choices, choices we must make  if we are to take our continued budget  deficits  seriously  together with  the  need to provide responsibly for the de fense of our Nation.  I opposed the B-2 program for two  reasons-its outrageous cost, and  its  nonexistent mission.  At a time when we must exercise ex treme budgetary restraint, it would be  inappropriate to press ahead with pro duction of the B-2. This is a program  which would rob dollars from more im portant weapons  systems and other  defense needs. These highly complex  and as yet unproven aircraft are esti mated to cost $550 million each, and if  past experience  in weapons procure ment is any guide, I would expect the  final cost to be closer to $750 million  each or  even more. The Pentagon  would  like an eventm .. l  force of 132  planes, which puts the overall cost at  ",1989

234,,101,-0.321,408,12,Mr. SYNAR.," Very briefly, my col leagues, we  are  now  down  to  the  amendment  that will  provide  four  basic things which we need in the B-2  bomber. First, cost reduction. Second,  performance standards and  rigorous  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  July 26, 1989  testing. Third, a reduction of the con currency which is presently going on.  Finally,  and most  importantly,  the  strengthening  of  the  oversight  through  independent audits and the  lifting of the excessive secrecy which  for too long has plagued this program.  If Members want to get reins on this  program, if they want to come back in  a year and make an informed and com plete decision about  the B-2,  then  they have but one choice left, and that  is to support the Aspin-Synar amend ment.  ",1989
235,,101,0.393,408,12,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Chairman, nu clear deterrence has preserved peace  over 44 years.  Mr. Chairman, our nuclear deterrent has  preserved the peace over the past 44 years  primarily because  the United States decided  to split our strategic forces among land, sea,  and air components. This strategic triad is cru cial to a stable and effective deterrent against  our adversaries.  When the B-1 bomber was considered for  production  by  the  Reagan  administration  during the early 1980's, many opponents felt  that  this weapons system was a waste of  money. They argued that we should upgrade  our 30-year-old B-52's with cruise missiles  and other advanced electronic gear.  In addi tion, they proposed that the United States ac celerate development of the Stealth bomber,  which was then viewed as the technology of  the future.  Now the time has come for a decision on  building the Stealth bomber, and these same  liberal critics all of a sudden have a change of  heart. They now oppose this system because  it's too costly and it may not fly.  These critics have  forgotten  the strategic  importance of  the need  for  this weapons  system. The Soviets have deployed several  hundred mobile missiles, similar  to our pro posed Midgetman and MX on  rail cars. Be cause  of  the  vast  air  defense  network  throughout  the Soviet Union, we  need  a  bomber that is capable of evading radar to hit  these mobile missiles.  The Stealth bomber fits these requirements.  Its  design  and  composition  repels  radar  scans, and  its advanced electronics  could  track down Soviet mobile missiles and destroy  them.  In addition,  the potential spinoffs from  the research  in  this advanced  technology  is  limitless. These  two  factors  in  the minds of  Soviet war planners would serve as a deter rent to starting a nuclear war. That is,  in es sence, real peace.  Attempts  to stretch out  this program will  only  increase  the cost of the B-2 Program.  We've heard  from opponents of the Stealth  that the bombers may eventually cost over $1  billion a copy, using sticker shock to scare the  American people into believing that we can't  afford this weapon system.  But  this  is  not what Defense Secretary  Cheney proposes. If we endorse his proposal,  the procurement costs will be kept at  the  lowest  level. However,  this means  that we  must appropriate sufficient funds to keep the  lines open at  the most cost-effi production  cient level.  It's basically a simple lesson in economies  of scale. You can't expect to save money by  stretching out the costs over a longer period  of time.  It may work in the short-run, but ulti mately it will cost the taxpayers more money.  Just like family budgets, you can't expect the  total cost of an  interest-bearing  loan  to de crease if you keep lowering the monthly pay ment and agree  to  lengthen  the payment  period. Ultimately, it'll cost you more money.  If Cheney's proposal is enacted, the Stealth  bomber would be built over a period of 5 to 7  years, making the yearly cost between an af fordable $10  to $12 billion. This would com prise about 1.3 percent of the total defense  budget, which is proportionally less than what  was required to build the B-47, the B-52, or  the B-1 bomber force.  Mr. Chairman, we need  the B-2. The Air  Force plans to retire the aging B-52 bomber  force by the end of the 1990's. With only 97  B-1 bombers  forming  the  remaining compo nent of the air breathing leg of our triad, this  will not be a sufficient force to evade the so phisticated and dense air defense network  surrounding  the Soviet Union. The bomber  force comprises  the most stable  leg of our  triad because of its ability to be recalled after  take-off. Unlike  the  ICBM  force, we cannot  bring  the missiles back once  they've been  launched. That's why we need the next gen eration of aviation technology to maintain our  deterrent.  Finally, because the President has empha sized retaining the most stable component of  our nuclear deterrent in arms control talks, the  bomber  force will be assigned a very  large  percentage of our targets. In the initial START  negotiations, despite the number of warheads  a bomber can carry, it will be counted as one  nuclear weapon for purposes of arms reduc tion. Other strategic systems will be counted  on the basis of the number of warheads they  can carry.  In other words,  the Soviet Union  and the United States have agreed in principle  to assign a greater priority  to  the bomber  component of the triad.  As a  result,  to cut  the B-2 will severely  d.amage our capability to penetrate the Soviet  Union in the post-START environment. This is  not the time to abolish the bomber component  of our  triad. Combined with  the  land-based  mobile missile force,  the bomber wing would  add a stabilizing factor to our deterrent.  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to  oppose all amendments that restrict our ability  to proceed with  the B-2 program. These  amendments undercut  the President's arms  reduction proposal  in Geneva.  In addition, all  that  research  into  the cutting-edge  stealth  technology would go down the drain.  What a waste that would be. Stealth tech nology is the next generation of research  in  aviation, which have many other military and  civilian applications. Let's resist sticker shock,  and support the President's bipartisan strate gic nuclear modernization proposal.  ",1989
236,House,101,0.496,421,12,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I ap preciate the comments made regarding  the questions that were asked. I really  would like to submit to the committee,  if there is anyone who can find a fool proof system  in  this whole military  thing, I woud like to see it. I do not  think there is one.  I  remember  as  a State  legislator  when we were worried about Hill Air  Force  Base  because  planes  were  coming in. These were not 757's; there  were test aircraft, and they would go  through  areas,  and my  colleagues  know that problems can occur. In a  vertical silo my colleagues know prob lems can occur. We talked about the  idea of, well, what about going to the  civilian population. Well,  I hope my  colleagues  in  the East  realize  that  those of us out in the West have a lot  of wide-open spaces, and sometimes  one can go  for miles and miles and  miles and one will see nothing but rat tlesnakes and  jackrabbits, and I am  not too concerned about some of those  particular areas.  Also one can talk about civilians per  se. If we  look at our Navy, our Air  Force and our Army, we find that ci vilians are working on  those  things  constantly. So, when my colleagues  get right down to it and take those  things  into consideration, we  realize  that we have a lot of problems in this,  but there is no foolproof system.  I think those who have had some of  these briefings realize that the mili tary is doing the very best that they  can and possibly this is as foolproof as  any aircraft would be, any military in stallation, and so when my colleagues  get to this, I really do not feel these  are honest, viable questions that have  been brought up concerning this.  A rail garrison, the small ICBM and  the train, the truck, however my col leagues want to do this, is again an ad vanced piece of technology, and it is  important to the United States, to the  military. It is important to the idea of  defending this country, and, as we see  the Soviet Union do this, we find out  how difficult it is. We know that they  would have the same problem. I really  feel that we look at the big picture,  and the big picture is that we go ahead  and continue on with the rail garrison  and the small ICBM.  Mr. Chairman,  I would urge  def eat of this amendment.  The  CHAIRMAN  pro  tempore.

239,House,101,0.505,447,12,Mr. NIELSON of Utah.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in opposition  to the Bustamante amendment  calling for a diversion of funds from the pro duction of chemical weapons to the National  Guard for the purchase of six C-26 aircraft.  What a choice?  On the one hand we have the opportunity  of producing a highly efficient and completely  safe chemical weapons system  to deter our  enemies, to defend our country, and to serve  as a chip in reaching any international accord  regarding these munitions.  On the other hand we have a chance to buy  the National Guard a half-dozen airborne staff  vehicles which have not been  requested by  the Secretary of Defense or  the administra tion, and which serve only a few.  The threat of chemical warfare is real.  There are 20 nations with chemical weapon  capability,  including  Iraq, Afghanistan,  and  Libya.  Iraq and Afghanistan already have used  their chemical weapons against enemies who  could not retaliate, and Qadhafi is building up  his arsenal right now.  Assuming we can only afford one or  the  other, would you rather vote to keep us safe  from a fanatic like Qadhafi who has no fear of  anyone who cannot retaliate?  Or would you rather vote for an expansion  of the National Guard Airborne Taxi Service?  I call for defeat of this amendment.  D 1950  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

241,,101,-0.506,460,12,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today t am introducing legislation to revise the  current  rules governing eligibility  for Aid  to  Families With Dependent Children [AFDC] for  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  plo~ed  victims of major disasters. As a result of two  tragic accidents which occurred  in  the con gressional district which  I represent,  I have  learned of an injustice in AFDC eligibility rules.  The current law punishes the victims of major  disasters by terminating all aid to families who  accept compensation.  On May 12, a 69-car Southern Pacific train  jumped  the  tracks at  the  foot of the steep  Cajon Pass in San Bernardino, CA. The trai~  was unable to navigate a sharp turn when 1t  reached the bottom of the hill, after it acceler ated to more than 90 miles per hour. The run away  train  jumped  the  tracks, and  through a residential neighborhood, demolish ing seven houses and killing four people. The  train also landed on top of a pipeline, operat ed by  the Calnev Pipeline Co., which  trans ports gasoline from California to Nevada. Fol lowing  the accident,  the  resident were  told  that the area had been inspected, and that it  was  safe  to  return  home. Someone was  wrong. Only 13 days after the train accident,  tragedy struck the San Bernardino neighbor hood again when the pipeline exploded in _the  same location. The flames rose 500 feet into  the sky. Two people were killed, 1 O homes  were burned  to  the ground, and dozens of  people were injured.  .  Fire crews were unable to put the fire out  immediately because faulty check valves per mitted the backflow of gasoline to fuel the fire  even after the pipeline was shut down. The  firefighting  efforts  caused  fluctuating water  pressures, and several homes  flooded as a  result.  The most severely damaged homes have  been bulldozed, and  trucks rumbled  through  the neighborhood as they removed  the fuel soaked soil. Lawns  throughout the neighbor hood were charred. While touring the site re cently, I saw an automobile with tail lights that  melted off the car  from  the heat of the  fire  that burned several blocks away. The air still  reeks of gasoline, and much of the trona car ried by  the  train  remained on  the ground 3  months after the accident to remind the resi dents of the tragedies that have taken place.  Residents are experiencing upper-respiratory  ailments, yet they are told the chemicals they  are breathing are not toxic, just ""irritants"" that  are uncomfortable. Yet, no one will sign a  statement calling the neighborhood safe.  Families have been torn apart as a result of  the stress, and children still live with relatives  because they are afraid to return home. One  mother  told me  that her children ask her  whether their house will blow up in the future.  But it is not just the children who are terrified  to return to their neighborhood. The residents  were told it was safe to return after the rail road accident-someone was wrong that time,  and maybe they are wrong again. Many want  to sell their homes, but their property values  have declined so dramatically that they cannot  afford to move.  In order to help the victims recover from the  accidents, the railroad and pipeline companies  offered each household that had been evacu ated  $5,000 as  a partial  settlement. This  money was to be used to cover the inconven ience,  transportation, housing,  food, clothing,  and incidental expenses during the evacuation  period. Should a family feet that they are emo tionally unable  to  return  to  their home,  this  July 26, 1989  money would enable them to look for a new  place to live. In time,  I expect the courts will  see to it that the victims are fairly compensat ed for their damages and losses. In the mean time, most of  the  residents have spent  the  money, and are working to pick up the pieces  of their shattered lives.  The families in the neighborhood have ex perienced two major disasters in the past few  months. Now  some of  these  families will  endure yet another crisis. Last week I learned  that the County's Department of Social Serv ices sent  letters  to several  families  in  the  neighborhood to inform them that their AFDC  payments would be terminated-until February  1990-because the victims accepted compen sation  for expenses and  losses experienced  as a result of the accidents. Clearly, the inten tion of the law is not to cause victims addition al suffering, yet this is what is happening.  Because there is no distinction in the eligi bility rules, the State considers this to be the  same  type of windfall as winning the lottery.  AFDC  regulations consider  it to be  income,  and declare the families  ineligible for aid  for  the number of months equal to the lump sum  divided by each family's monthly need stand ard. The State has agreed to disregard por tions of this money,  if the victims can supply  receipts proving that this money was used to  replace  items  lost or damaged  in  the acci dents. Considering  the circumstances of the  twin disasters,  it is highly unlikely that these  victims kept full records and receipts of how  the money was spent. These people experi enced multiple evacuations, and many were  victims of extreme emotional trauma. Keeping  sales receipts was the least of their worries at  the time.  Given  this  injustice,  I have  introduced  the  Victims' Welfare Compensation Act  to help  victims of accidents such as  these.  It disre gards disaster relief compensation for victims  for 3 months. This gives victims a short time  period in which they can use the money to put  their lives back in order. The bill also accounts  for those who may receive a large settlement,  and whose situation may improve in the long term. After the 3-month time limit, the remain ing cash on hand would be considered when  determining eligibility. Furthermore,  the new  assets purchased by the victims could be in cluded as resources. This effectively caps the  amount that a victim could claim as disaster  assistance.  By allowing this compensation to be disre garded as income, we are permitting. victim~  of major disasters to move ahead with  their  lives. Accidents such as these do not happen  often, but when they do, we must be sure that  we do not punish innocent victims.  INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  RE VERSE MORTGAGE INSURANCE  FOR OLDER AMERICANS ACT  OF 1989  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 26, 1989  ",1989
242,,101,-0.52,473,12,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation that has far-reaching im plications for two very important Northwest re sources:  fisheries and  hydroelectric power.  This measure authorizes the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission [FERC] to extend the  deadline for the commencement of the Cow litz Falls Hydroelectric Project, No. 2833.  The  Lewis County Public Utility District  [PUD]  has been  pursuing  this project  for  nearly 1 O years and was given the green light  by FERC in June 1988. In April 1988, FERC  granted the one-time, 2-year time extension to  the PUD. The project is now required  to be  under construction by June 30, 1990. FERC  has no discretion to further extend the dead line, only Congress can do so.  The Senate has already passed the neces sary legislation (S. 750) on June 8, 1989, to  permit FERC  to  issue as many as  three, 2year extensions on this project. The bill that I  am introducing today would do the same.  Mr. Speaker,  the PUD has  identified  the  Cowlitz Falls project as the only major energy  resource, apart from energy conservation, that  is both cost-effective and  located within  the  district. Earlier this year, the Northwest Power  Planning Council agreed with the PUD's con clusions and projected a need  for more re gional power resources  in  the 1990's. Addi tionally,  the Bonneville Power Administration  announced recently that there no longer exist ed a regional energy surplus and  that new  sources would need to be developed.  The Cowlitz Falls project, with the generat ing capacity of 70 megawatts and an average  of 261,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annu ally has the potential to contribute substantial ly  to the region's future energy needs. This  energy production  is the equivalent of about  428,000 barrels of oil or 128,000 tons of coal  per year.  Despite the need  for  the project,  it is too  costly for the ratepayers of Lewis County to fi nance alone at this time. With the extensions  provided by this bill, the PUD hopes to attract  other utilities who will share  the costs-and  benefits-of  the Cowlitz  Falls  project.  In  agreements signed earlier this year, the PUD  assured its customers that it would raise rates  by no more than 14 percent. This extension  will provide needed  flexibility  to develop the  best financing program for the project.  This project is also the only potential means  of someday restoring the magnificent salmon  and steelhead runs that once returned to the  upper Cowlitz River. Older dams, built in anEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  other era, have cut off this habitat. Because of  its  run-of-the-river design,  the Cowlitz Falls  project will permit fish collection in the future  when scientists cure  the  fish diseases now  plaguing lower Cowlitz River fish runs.  Mr. Speaker, the question that many of my  colleagues will have is why Congress should  allow  this project  to  receive additional  time  before proceeding with construction?  The answer is simple.  After  the Cowlitz Falls project  received a  FERC license in 1986, the PUD applied for a  Washington State Shoreline permit. At  that  time, three separate parties-a State agency,  a corporation, and a local citizen-filed formal  appeals before the State Shoreline's Hearings  Board. The PUD, while recognizing its Federal  preemptive rights, did not exercise them.  In stead it attempted to negotiate reasonable so lutions acceptable to all of the parties.  Last month,  the PUD  reached an accord  with all appellants through separate, but inter related, settlement agreements. These agree ments contain many project enhancements  and provide added environmental mitigation.  One of  the most exciting aspects of this  project is its potential benefit to the fisheries  resources in the upper Cowlitz drainage. I am  particularly pleased that the PUD will be pro viding financial support for a new Trophy Trout  Program being sponsored by one of my local  sportsmen's organizations, the Friends of the  Cowlitz.  Under the Trophy Trout Program, the PUD  will  grant $100,000  in  capital  construction  matching funds to build trout rearing pens on  the upper reaches of the Cowlitz River. In ad dition, the PUD will contribute up to $35,000  annually to rear and stock trophy-sized rain bow and cutthroat trout. These are trout which  will be raised in river water ponds for 3 to 4  years,  on a natural diet, before being  re leased.  Once established,  the  trophy  trout  fishery  on  the Cowlitz River  is expected  to attract  sports enthusiasts from throughout the Pacific  Northwest, pumping needed  tourism dollars  into the local economy.  In short, I want my colleagues to know that  this utility district used its one-time, 2-year ex tension  to address  the environmental  con cerns of the three appellants. It chose not to  enter the courts to seek its Federal preemp tive rights and it agreed to provide additional  mitigation for fisheries resources that were not  required under its FERC license.  Mr. Speaker, my legislation differs in minor  respects to the Senate counterpart. To begin,  it pertains only to the Cowlitz Falls project. My  colleague from Arkansas, Mr. ALEXANDER, re cently has introduced H.R. 2694, which covers  the  three projects in his State  that were  in cluded in the Senate bill.  Also, my bill does not include provisions of  S. 750 relating to the time limits within which  the PUD must complete construction of  the  project and acquire necessary real property in terests. While I would be quite content if this  body were to pass legislation identical to the  Senate bill,  I will be encouraging the Energy  and Commerce Committee to consider several  deletions from the Senate bill.  First, the Federal Power Act does not spe cifically  limit  the  time  for completion of a  project's construction. It requires the licensee  16451  to commence such construction in good faith  and with due diligence, but gives FERC  the  discretion  to extend  the  time  for  finishing a  project when necessary.  Similarly,  the Federal Power Act presently  does not constrain  the  time  in which  the  li censee may acquire the property needed for  project construction and operation. FERC typi cally requires that all necessary property rights  be acquired within 5 years after issuance of a  license, but  that  time can be extended  for  good cause. Therefore, there really is no need  for  the provisions  in S. 750  that authorize  FERC  to extend  the  time  requirements  for  project  completion  and  acquisition  of  real  property-the Commission already has  the  discretion to do so.  Not only are these provisions unnecessary,  they actually create deadlines that don't pres ently exist and  thus could detract  from  the  flexibility this legislation is intended to provide.  While  the PUD  believes  it  can  complete  project  construction well within  the 5-year  timeframe,  it  is concerned about  tying  the  deadline for property acquisition to the date of  the bill's enactment. The legislation might re quire the PUD to purchase thousands of acres  of  land  in and around  the project  reservoir  years before the project becomes operational.  In such a case, a premature and onerous ex pense would be  imposed upon  the PUD's  ratepayers.  Mr. Speaker,  I offer these minor modifica tions of S. 750  in an effort to fine-tune  that  legislation, not to overhaul it. I do not want the  differences in my bill to delay consideration of  this legislation in any way. As I have indicated,  if my alternations pose significant problems, I  would be pleased to amend my bill to conform  to S. 750.  A TRIBUTE TO MR. CHARLES  CROWE  HON. MARILYN LLOYD  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 26, 1989  ",1989
243,,101,-0.058,473,12,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise with great  pride  to bring  to  the attention of my col leagues  the accomplishments of one of my  constituents, Mr. Charles Crowe. Mr. Crowe  has been  recognized by  the Department of  Energy for his outstanding service as a volun teer  in his community of Oak Ridge, TN.  I  would  like  to congratulate him  for  receiving  such an honor and share my pride in the in spiring example he has set for all American  citizens by briefly describing  the extensive  work he has done for his community.  Mr. Crowe, currently chief of  the contract  management branch at the Department of En ergy's Oak Ridge operations office, has used  his free time to help with various community  programs  that  promote  the well-being  of  young people, primarily minority youth. Some  of Mr. Crowe's work includes tutoring, career,  and college counseling, helping students find  summer employment, providing transportation,  and helping students with applications for col lege admission,  financial  aid,  and  scholar ships.

In  1969,  the United  States  unilaterally  stopped  production  of  chemical weapons.  That moratorium  remained  in  force  for 18  years with no harm  to our security.  In 1987,  the Soviets also stopped production of chemi cal weapons.  In response, we resumed pro duction 10 months later.  We should not be here today considering a  request for production of new chemical weap ons for four very important reasons.  First, we don't know how to safely dispose  of the huge and dangerous stockpile of chem ical weapons that already exists and yet we  want to build more. According to a 1988 Army  study on current research  facilities, chemical  safety has slipped through a crack and poses  increased  risk  to workers and  surrounding  ",1989
248,House,101,-0.479,525,12,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of  the amendment offered by our  fine col league,  the gentleman  from Massachusetts  [Mr. MAVROULES).  It is important that all parts of our society  participate in the American dream. It is the re sponsibility of our Government  to help our  fellow citizens attain that goal.  This House has a  longstanding policy  to  help disadvantaged members of our society  start on the road to the American dream. One  method we use is to help individuals enter the  procurement process.  The SOB set-aside is an important program  that must be continued.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support ing the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Massachusetts [Mr. MAVROULES).  ",1989

Everybody  pays  equal  taxes. We  have been drafting people equally. We  do not even throw them in the front  lines equally, but if we want to look at  it, all we are saying is give everyone in  America a chance.  Women are not included in this, yet  they are moving into small businesses  at a rapid pace, and they get less than  1 percent of Government contracts.  If anybody  really believes govern ment contracts are done on a competi tive basis,  they believe  in the tooth  fairy.  I  support  ment.  ",1989

I would also address the figures that  have been manipulated here from time  to time. Of the 40 percent of the De fense Department contracts that were  offered to small business, that is the  universe that was available to all small  business,  small  and  disadvantaged  firms got 7 percent of that total. Of  the ones that were offered and award ed to small business, small disadvan taged firms got 14.4 percent.  The gentleman from California CMr.  DREIER] made  an  important  point.  This  section 1207  cvuld be put  in  better order, but we were denied the  opportunity  to address  the  improve ments that could be made to it, so in  its present form it should be stopped  before  the program ends up  in  the  world of Wedtech.

251,House,101,0.019,538,12,Mr. STENHOLM.," I will return the  favor when I have the chance.  Mr. Chairman, I am not contending  that all of this savings is  in the de fense bill. This is  total Government  contract work. Defense is only 30 per cent of these numbers.  DOES THE MURPHY AMENDMENT EXPAND  PREVAILING WAGE LAW? NO  Some  of  the  opponents  of  the  Murphy  amendment  have  invested  considerable time and expense spread ing misinformation  about  how  the  Murphy amendment supposedly vastly  expands Davis-Bacon prevailing wage  law. This simply is not true. I under stand and sympathize with my col leagues who do not serve on the Labor  Committee and may become confused  about some of the complicated provi sions in the Davis-Bacon Act, as well  as related administrative and judicial  rulings and how the Murphy amend ment affects current law.  This amendment saves money-read  the CBO  letter  in our Committee  Report 100-504.  This amendment does not expand  the Davis-Bacon Act to cover Federal  lease construction. It already covers  lease construction. Call the Secretary  of Labor and ask her for her own  Wage Appeals Board rulings  in  the  Fort Drum case and the Crown Point,  IN, Veterans Clinic case. Both apply  Davis-Bacon to Federal leases. That is  how the Secretary of Labor currently  interprets the Davis-Bacon Act.  This amendment does not expand  the Davis-Bacon Act to offsite fabrica tion facilities. The current law already  covers offsite work, which is undertak en solely in support of a Davis-Bacon  project. Call the Secretary of Labor  and ask her.  This  amendment does  not vastly  expand the Secretary of Labor's au thority to interpret the Davis-Bacon  Act and make her rulings binding on  other  agencies.  The  Secretary  of  Labor already has that authority pur suant  to Presidential Reorganization  Plan No.  14 of 1950-an Executive  order which  is still  in effect  today.  Call the Secretary of Labor and ask  her.  This amendment does not violate  privacy rights by ordering release of  Copeland Act payroll reports. A Feder al circuit court of appeals decision al ready has ordered release of such pay roll reports. This amendment actually  narrows the payroll information that  must be disclosed under that court de cision.  This amendment does not subject  construction employers to a new and  dangerous private right to action for  unpaid wages. The private right in this  amendment is identical to the existing  private  rights of actions  in section  16<b> of the Fair Labor Standards Act  CFLSAJ. Construction employers are  already subject to this identical FLSA  private right of action for any over time pay violations they may commit.  Call the Secretary of Labor and ask  her.  I could go on, but I  think my col leagues can already understand that  this bill is not imaginative, new or rev olutionary. It is largely a codification  of existing prevailing wage law, court  rulings, Presidential Executive orders,  administrative  rulings by  the Secre tary of Labor, and other aspects of the  extant body of prevailing wage law, or  related wage and hour law.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise  today to ask  the House to join with me once again  in support of reasonable reform of the  Davis-Bacon Act. I can only wish that  the rest of my life would be as certain  and as  regular as our perennial at tempts to reform Davis-Bacon. Manag ing this issue every year has become so  familiar to me that I find myself men tioning the words ""Davis-Bacon"" when  I  encounter  someone  complaining  about how life is constantly changing,  and  taking with it the many things  that they have come to rely on. With  Davis-Bacon the old adage ""the more  things change the more they stay the  same"" could not be more true.  Some of my colleagues may have  preferred to deal with this controver sial issue earlier in the lOlst Congress.  That may have been a better time.  However,  there were no requests  to  hold hearings and in light of the discord which prevailed during the earli er months of this session. It was a wise  move for the Committee on Education  and Labor to wait until now to address  this issue.  The question now, as it was in past  debates on Davis-Bacon, is the same;  do we want real reform or repeal of  the act? In hearings held by the Sub committee on Labor Standards, we de termined  during  the  last Congress  that the Davis-Bacon Act remains an  important means of protecting  the  livelihoods of American workers. And  like  anything  that works well, we  would like to keep it in good working  order so we proposed modest changes  that would fine tune the act, not de stroy its effectiveness by narrowing its  scope.  Last year, the Committee on Educa tion and Labor  supported a Davis Bacon  reform  proposal  that would  have  increased  the act's thresholds  from  the current  level of $2,000  to  $50,000. This modest approach was  adopted by the House as an amend ment to last year's defense authoriza tion bill on May 3, 1988, but unfortu nately it was removed in conference. I  am hoping that today as we prepare to  vote, to give the Pentagon $300 billion,  that we will not forget the millions of  American workers who depend on the  decent wage established for them by  the Davis-Bacon Act.  We find now ourselves in the exact  same battle as a year ago with the  same players and the same numbers.  The amendment that I am asking you  to  support  today with  some minor  technical changes is the same amend ment adopted by the House last year.  And for those of you who may need a  refresher course,  let me outline for  you my amendment.  As I stated earlier, it will raise the  act's coverage threshold for construc tion projects financed with tax dollars  from $2,000 to $50,000. It raises from  $2,000 to $15,000 the threshold for re pairs and remodeling on Federal con tracts.  It provides an objective standard to  prevent agencies from splitting con tracts to avoid the application of the  new threshold.  It compels the Department of Labor  to issue more timely wage determina tions.  It restores  the scope of prevailing  wage surveys to include all similar con struction in an applicable area and not  statewide.  It provides  two alternatives to the  present much  criticized  compliance  system of exclusive relief from the De partment of Labor. It expedites  the  administrative process, and it provides  a private right of action.  It reduces by 50 percent employer  payroll reporting requirements under  the Copeland Act. Employers are now  required  to  file weekly  reports and  ",1989

254,Senate,101,0.687,655,12,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I thank  my friend from Arizona for yielding 3  minutes. I also thank him for focusing  attention on this issue. As I sit here  and listen to this debate, I find this is  a classic example of the debate that I  have been hearing in Washington, DC,  for many years: An example of where  we allow policy  to be driven by the  bean  counters.  I  am on both  the  Budget Committee and  the Finance  Committee-committees  that  have  given us almost $3 trillion of red ink.  I can tell you that outside the belt way, people could care less about the  Budget Act. They know we have $2.8  trillion  of  red  ink.  Congress  has  handed  them  a  bunch of benefits  called the catastrophic insurance pro gram that they did not ask for, they  did not want, and they do not want to  pay for it. It is easy for this Senator to  point out the fact because I was 1 of  only 11 Senators who on June 8, 1988,  stood on the floor and voted against  the bill.  I still think it's a bad bill. Congress  should admit it made a mistake, repeal  this act, go back to ground zero, and  pass a catastrophic bill for the Ameri can people based on true catastrophic  needs, without  limiting  it  to senior  citizens, Mr. President. This program  should cover all Americans and we  should all share  the cost. Congress  should not force citizens to go on Med icare. Let  them keep  their dignity.  That is what most Americans thought  they were going to get when we began  discussing  the  issue  years  ago.  turned out to be something completely  different from what President Reagan  It  and others talked about in 1986 as cat astrophic insurance.  Mr. President, as  I have said, we  probably cannot win  this today. We  probably cannot repeal it. But I, as a  member of the Budget and Finance  Committees, salute the Senator from  Arizona. I think he is right on target.  The American people deserve to have  this Congress admit it made a mistake,  as well as the administration. We need  to come up with a reasonable proposal  and fix what we have without taking 2  years to do it. Some of our seniors will  be in the highest tax bracket in our so ciety as a result of this legislation. We  ought to fix it. I reserve the remainder  of my time, and I thank the Senator.  ",1989
255,Senate,101,0.375,655,12,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, I appre ciate the difficulties that this particu lar amendment raises being attached  to  the energy and water appropria tions and also the difficulty with the  deficit and possible sequestration. But  I also appreciate the frustration that  many of us feel over the inability to  deal with what I think most consider a  flawed program, a program that needs  reform and needs it quickly if we are  going to salvage it at all.  I hope, regardless of the outcome of  the vote about to take place, we will  move forward as expeditiously as pos sible to revisit the entire Catastrophic  Coverage Act and look at both the cost  side and benefit side and revise it in  such a way that we can continue to  provide  basic  catastrophic  coverage  which most seniors want at a cost that  they can afford.  ",1989
256,Senate,101,-0.256,655,12,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, what a  choice the Senator from Arizona gives  us in this amendment. We all want to  fix the catastrophic health care bill.  We have all heard from the ""benefici aries"" of that act-and they have told  us in no uncertain terms that they do  not like it. We asked the Finance Com mittee to study the issue and give us,  after careful reflection and investiga tion,  some  recommendations  for  changes.  The Senator from Arizona, however,  was not satisfied with that. He has a  temporary solution-and it may be a  good one-and he wants  it adopted  now, today, without full examination  or hearings. Well, I do not think that  is the best way to serve the needs of  our senior citizens.  I also do not think we serve our sen iors by adopting this amendment on  this bill. As the chairman of the Ap propriations Committee told us, if we  adopt this amendment we will exceed  the allowable budget deficit for this  year and, under the law, we will face a  sequester-an across-the-board cut in  every program in the Federal Govern ment. Programs which help seniors.  Programs which help children. Pro grams which clean up  the environ ment. Programs which provide for our  national defense. That is not helping  seniors. That is not helping America.  And I cannot support it.  What I can support are changes in  the Catastrophic Health Care Act. I  have heard the message of the seniors  in Wisconsin and I want to respond to  their concerns. But the best way to do  that is carefully, after we have consid ered all  the  implications. We have  time to do  that. We have a promise  from the bipartisan leadership of the  Senate that we will do it.

259,,101,-0.465,785,12,Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York.," Mr. Speak er, today I rise to salute the exceptional work  of a woman  from my district who  recently  gave up 2 weeks of her time to help cleanup  efforts in  the aftermath of the Ex  n Valdez  oilspill in Alaska.  Miriam Nathan of Scottsville, NY, worked  tirelessly as a volunteer at the Oil Spill Volun teer Response Center  in Seward, AK. She  provided the  invaluable service of monitoring  the health of oil-fouled wildlife and assisting  with their recovery. Time was of the essence  to save  lives. Now, 4 months after the Na tion's worst oilspill,  long-term cleanup efforts  continue. Exxon employees, Coast Guard offi cials, and scores of volunteers are still labor ing to cleanse the beaches, wildlife, and the  water of more than 1 O million gallons of crude  oil  that poured  from  the Exxon Valdez on  March 24.  Ms. Nathan has never considered herself  an activist; she works full time as a sign lan guage interpreter in Rochester, NY. However,  the scope of  the Exxon disaster compelled  Ms. Nathan to take time off and help in any  way she could. She felt she could not sit by  and allow our beaches and marine wildlife to  be destroyed by toxic crude oil.  Mr. Speaker,  I applaud Ms. Nathan's atti tude, determination, and effort. She did not  merely deplore the situation; she took action  to help in a time of need. I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in seeing  that her contributions  were not in vain. We have an obligation to Ms.  Nathan and  the other cleanup volunteers  to  enact safeguards to prevent future oilspill dis asters. The loss of life, livelihood, and a once pure environment that we have witnessed  in  Alaska's Prince William Sound must never be  repeated.  16763  A RIGHT DIMINISHED  HON. DON EDWARDS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 27, 1989  ",1989
260,,101,-0.599,785,12,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  an editorial in the San Jose Mercury News on  July 4, 1989, offers an  insightful look at the  Supreme Court's recent decision  in Webster  versus Reproductive Health Services. The edi torial  illustrates what a fractured, unfortunate  opinion Webster offers.  It demonstrates that  this case undermines  the 1973 Roe versus  Wade decision, which affirmed  reproductive  freedom as a constitutional right of privacy.  The date of July 4 was an excellent choice  to print this editorial as  it demonstrated  the  irony of celebrating America's  independence  when  the day before-July 3-the Supreme  Court decision made many women  less free.  As  the Mercury points out:  ""for women,  the  celebration of Americans' inalienable rights to  life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness rings  hollow today.""  The editorial shows clearly that by uphold ing  the Missouri statute's prohibition against  the use of public facilities and public employ ees to perform abortions, the Court essentially  ruled against poor women, minority women,  and rural women, whose only access to medi cal  facilities may be the  local city or country  hospital.  There is no doubt in my mind that this deci sion invites the Government to intrude into the  bedroom of every American family. As the edi torial states, what is at risk ""here and every one, is not simply a woman's right to an abor tion, but women's right to control their lives.""  The editorial follows:  [From the San Jose Mercury News, July 4,  19891  A RIGHT DIMINISHED  All men  are  created  equal. But,  for  women,  the celebration of Americans' in alienable rights to life, liberty and the pur suit of happiness rings hollow today.  Monday, a narrowly and bitterly divided  Supreme Court expanded state power  to  regulate abortions, and promised  to hear  cases next term that could strip away the  constitutional right to abortion.  If the Webster  ruling  is  the first step  toward overturning the 1973 Roe vs. Wade  decision, as the court minority warns, then  it will mean that men in state legislatures  across  the  country will  decide whether  women shall bear children.  It will be the first case of a constitutional ly determined civil right being withdrawn  from the people. This is no decision to ap plaud.  The five-member majority in the Webster  case upheld a Misosuri law that bans state funded hospitals and state employees from  providing abortions or counseling, unless  necessary  to save a woman's life, and re quires doctors to test a fetus for viability  before perfoming an abortion after 20 weeks  of pregnancy.  The decision ducked ruling on the consti tutionality of  the  law's preamble, which  proclaims  that ""the  life of each human  being  begins  at  conception""  and  gives  unborn children ""all the rights, privileges,  and immunities available to other persons,  citizens, and residents of this state.""  ",1989
261,House,101,0.246,798,12,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time a.s I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by  commending the subcommittee chair man, the gentleman from California  [Mr. ROYBAL]  and the subcommittee  ranking Republican,  the  gentleman  from New Mexico  [Mr. SKEEN]  for  their fine work on this bill. In the sub committee they had to deal with some  very  contenious  issues. They did  a  masterful job in working out a solu tion to most of those problems before  they came to the floor.  There was one item added in the full  committee which generated substan tial interest in the Rules Committee.  That was a provision to prevent the  implementation of what has become  known a.s section 89. Section 89 a.s cur rently drafted promises  to work  a  major hardship on our small business men and  their employees. Many of  them may cancel their health insur ance plans for employees, rather than  go through all the redtape in section  89. I not only support his concept but  I would also support the concept of an  actual repeal of section 89.  If it had been necessary, I was pre pared to offer in the Rules Committee  an amendment to the rule to protect  the section 89 provision from a point  of order. However, the Rules Commit tee majority ultimately decided to in clude protection for the provision in  their proposed  rule, even  though  it  had not been requested by the Committee on Appropriations. As a result,  I never had to off er my amendment.  0 0940  Mr. Speaker, the amounts appropri ated in this bill fall within the amount  allocated under the budget resolution.  However, for my colleagues who are  concerned about waivers of the Budget  Act, I should note that at lea.st a tech nical waiver is  included in this rule.  The bill  includes  a  3.6-percent pay  raise which is  technically an entitle ment. Since the Appropriations Com mittee did not receive any new entitle ment authority for  fiscal year 1990,  the waiver was included in the rule.  The chairman of the Budget Com mittee wrote a letter noting that the  pay rate increase provided in the bill is  consistent with the budget resolution  for fiscal year 1990. The budget resolu tion assumed a pay raise of 3.6 percent  for fiscal year 1990.  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  CMr.  GEKAS].  ",1989
262,House,101,0.426,798,12,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  This a good day to be a Member of  the House of Representatives of the  U.S. Congress because we  are now  poised to strike a blow in the eventual  elimination of section 89 from the face  of the Internal Revenue Code a.s pro pounded in 1986.  This odious section, section 89, has  caused so much trouble with our small  and large businessmen, not to mention  the working people  themselves who  are threatened to lose health benefits  because of the provisions of section 89.  The Committee  on Appropriations,  through the leadership of the gentle man from Texas and the gentleman  from Oklahoma were able  to  insert  into this rule and into their bill, and  subsequently approved by  the Com mittee on Rules, a measure by which  we could halt in its tracks the imple mentation of section 89.  This makes it an excellent day to be  here in Washington, DC. I commend  the  gentleman  from  Texas  CMr.  DELAY] for bringing it to the Commit tee on Appropriations, the gentleman  from Tennessee  [Mr. QUILLEN], who  was ready to help in the Committee on  Rules  to make  sure  this provision  would stay in place, and to the others  on the Committee on Rules on both  sides who have crafted such a  rule  that will let Members vote up or down  on the Treasury appropriations while  simultaneously saying to the business  world, to our free enterprise system, to  our working people, that we are going  to  remove  that noose around your  necks known a.s section 89.  ",1989
263,House,101,-0.45,811,12,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of  this  legislation and,  in particular, section  619  on Employee Disclosure Agreements,  which places a moratorium on  the executive  branch's use of certain nondisclosure agree ments, standard forms 312 and 4355.  The provision will prevent the administration  from collecting new signatures on these con tracts or enforce certain aspects of them  in  the coming fiscal year.  This moratorium is meant to allow time for  continuing discussion between  the executive  branch and the Congress with regard to these  contracts. This issue has been under review  and negotiation and more time is needed for a  successful resolution. The moratorium would  provide that.  This issue has been the subject of litigation  regarding a prior, similar moratorium on em ployee disclosure agreements,  in which my  colleagues in  this lawsuit, and  I, argued that  the executive branch was not in compliance  with the law. The case went to the Supreme  Court. The Court sent the case back to  the  district court suggesting that the case may be  moot.  This new moratorium addresses new con tracts promulgated by the administration while  our case was pending. Litigation before  the  Court pertains to the old contracts, therefore  there  is no  longer a basis  for  the suit. The  lawsuit, therefore, is moot. The two branches  will then be able to work toward a resolution  of  their differences  regarding nondisclosure  agreements.  ",1989
264,House,101,0.339,811,12,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today  in  support of H.R. 2989,  the Treasury, Postal  Service, and General Government Appropria tions bill.  I want  to congratulate  the Appropriations  and Rules Committees for zeroing out funding  for the enforcement of section 89. Although  this action  is not a substitute  for complete  repeal of this burdensome law, it is a step in  the  right direction. Denial of  funding would  ensure  that businesses need not spend ex cessive amounts of money and time comply ing with  rules universally  recognized as un workable.  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and,  in doing so, support  fairness  for small busi nesses.  ",1989
265,House,101,0.378,811,12,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Chairman, the pro visions in section 89 of the Internal Revenue  Code are overly complicated and an onerous  burden that has been placed on the shoulders  of American businesses. I applaud the Appro priations Committee's actions today in prohib iting the Treasury Department from enforcing  penalties on businesses who  fail  to comply  with  the section 89  rules. Their action reaf firms Treasury Secretary Brady's statement  that section 89 ""imposes unreasonable com pliance burdens on business,"" and that ""the  law needs to be changed.""  Although  I believe that the delay in  imple menting the section 89 regulations is a step in  the right direction, I also believe that the ulti mate solution lies in a repeal of the entire pro vision. By  the  fact that over 300 of our col leagues are cosponsors of Congressman LA FALCE' s bill  to  repeal section 89,  it is clear  that  the overwhelming majority of our col leagues share in that belief. In  light of this,  I  would ask that Mr. LAFALCE's bill be brought  to the floor for a vote by the full House.  I believe that no amount of change is going  to prevent compliance with section 89  from  being an undue burden on business, especial ly small business. In an effort to insure better  benefits for workers, section 89 may be ensur ing that fewer companies offer any benefits at  all for fear of noncompliance or that the cost  and bother aren't worth it. That sounds like a  law that won't work, and I encourage my col leagues to support its repeal.  ",1989
266,House,101,-0.051,811,12,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to H.R. 2989,  the Treasury, Postal Serv ice, and general Government appropriations  for fiscal 1990. This measure appropriates a  total of $18.4 billion for the Treasury Depart ment, U.S. Postal Service, various offices of  the Executive Office of the President, and for  certain independent agencies.  The bill's total is $2.4 billion-15 percent more than  the fiscal 1989 appropriation and,  in many categories and programs, represents  increases over the request of the administra tion. This  level of increase  is  too great and  should be reduced.  Mr. Chairman,  this  is  the  appropriations  measure for most general services of the Fed eral Government and as such is a reflection of  our willingness to reduce the size and scope  of the Federal bureaucracy at a time of large  budget deficits. By increasing the funds for the  general services of Government over 15 per cent, as this bill does, we are sending a signal  that we cannot hold down the very costs of  operating Government, while at the same time  we are  reducing and even cutting  important  programs like education and the environment.  Is this the signal we wish to send here today?  I hope not and I will oppose this measure on  final passage.  Some in this body will argue that we will not  eliminate  the deficit and balance  the budget  by eliminating the Federal infrastructure itself.  This statement is entirely correct and  I con cede the point. However,  this appropriations  measure contains a number of questionable  expenditures.  For example, next fiscal year, this measure  appropriates $1.8 million for the expenses and  pensions of former Presidents of the United  States. I strongly object to this appropriation,  which  is $392,000 more  than was appropri ated for fiscal 1989. I had planned to offer an  amendment to reduce the appropriation for al lowances of former Presidents but  I will not  offer that amendment today. I want Members  to know, however,  that  I may offer amend ments in the future to reduce spending in this  area.  Mr. Chairman, in examining spending in this  area of the budget, I was disturbed to discov er that our former Presidents will receive any  future pay increases awarded to Cabinet Sec retaries. Should we  later consider  legislation  to  increase compensation  for Cabinet members and Members of Congress,  I intend  to  offer amendments to prohibit any adjustments  to  the salaries of  former Presidents of  the  United States as well as former Members of  Congress.  Former Presidents today receive a pension  of $99,500 per year.  It  is well documented  that our  former Presidents have substantial  outside incomes and have little need for sig nificant adjustments to their pensions. I do not  begrudge our former Presidents a pension;  I  do object to significant adjustments to those  pensions that come as a result of adjustments  in salaries of current officials of the executive  branch.  Mr. Chairman, we should vote this bill down  as excessive, but we should also closely ex amine specific programs like Presidential pen sions.  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  support the provision of the Treasury/Postal  Service appropriations measure which prohib its the use of these funds to enforce the com plex and burdensome  regulations  in section  89. Let me applaud the subcommittee for its  understanding and creativity. Many business  owners in Ohio have expressed their concerns  for this provision, which will cause them to ter minate their health benefit plans. Certainly the  history of these rules indicates the inappropri ateness of this provision. Last year Congress  found  it necessary to include a simplification  of this section in the technical corrections bill,  before the section went into effect. Even with  this action,  the Treasury Department  found  the section so complex  that  it was months  late in  issuing the proposed regulations. The  Commissioner of IRS has found  it necessary  to continually move  the effective dates be cause  few people could understand, much  less  implement  these rules. This  law places  small business employers between the rock of  the long, arduous, expensive testing, and the  hard place of  terminating  the health plans  which would become prohibitively expensive  for their enterprises, benefits which  the sup porters of section 89 mistakenly thought they  were promoting. The prevention of spending  funds to enforce this provision is a step in the  right direction, and one which I hope will lead  to its complete repeal. I urge my colleagues to  support this ban.

267,House,101,-0.407,811,12,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Chairman, section 619 of  H.R. 2989, a bill making appropriations for the  Treasury Department, the U.S. Postal Service,  the Executive Office of the President and cer tain  independent agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 1990, would place a  moratorium on certain nondisclosure agree ments.  Similar provisions have been part of appro priations bills in the past several Congresses.  As a consequence,  the administration's non disclosure program has been improved. How ever, there are still several areas of controver sy that need to be resolved.  Mr. Chairman, since 1983 I have been work ing to provide relief to employees of the exec utive branch  from excessively burdensome  nondisclosure contracts. Riders passed in pre vious Congresses have placed moratoriums  on  the use of particular nondisclosure con tracts that have subsequently been withdrawn.

268,House,101,-0.419,824,12,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  this amendment  ceived and shortsighted.  The  gentleman's  amendment  seeks  to  strike funds  from a number of initiatives de signed  to  improve  this Nation's disastrous  shortage of strategic and critical materials. As  anyone who takes time to learn about this sit uation will quickly  recognize, our country  is  precariously dependent upon unstable foreign  supplies of strategic materials. In the event of  war or national emergency, these supplies will  simply dry up.  The Soviet block and South Africa control  over 70 percent of world production of  the  four highest priority strategic minerals. These  are chromium, cobalt, manganese, and plati num. Without these four minerals, our military I  industrial complex would come to a standstill.  It is ironic that less than 24 hours after we  passed a National Defense Authorization Act  providing for the security and defense of the  country, we are asked to consider an amend ment to deprive our Armed Forces of the stra tegic minerals which are essential to produc ing  the sophisticated  fighting equipment  for  our modern Army.  The minerals I speak of are essential to the  production of high-grade steel and superal loys. They are also used extensively by  the  electronics and medical industries. Our coun try simply cannot afford any interruption in the  development  of  future . supplies  of  these  metals.  Unfortunately,  the  gentleman's  amendment would do just that.  For the past decade, my State has been fo cusing on ways  to  reduce our dependence  upon uncertain foreign supplies of critical and  strategic materials. Few people realize  it but  the world's greatest untapped mineral depos its lie beneath the ocean. And the richest of  these  deposits  are  in  the waters  around  Hawaii.  One of the agencies within our subcommit tee's jurisdiction is the National Critical Materi als Council. It's a small agency, but it serves a  very important function.  According to the National Critical Materials  Council, there are over $40 billion-that's bil lion, not million-worth of strategic and critical  minerals  in Hawaii's 200-mile exclusive eco nomic zone. These deposits are but a small  part of  the worldwide seabed minerals  re source.  For years, scientists have known  that  the  sea holds vast mineral deposits, known as  seabed modules and sea mount crusts  to  those  in  the  trade. Their existence, and  the  potential  they hold as a minerals  resource,  have been known  for decades. All  that  is  missing is the technology to harvest these re sources.  That is why the University of Hawaii, with  the support of the Federal Government, has  been exploring ways of harvesting  these re sources and putting  them  to productive use  for American industry. This is not the first year  that funds have been included in our bill for  this purpose.  In each of  the past 4  fiscal  years, Congress has supported funds for stra tegic minerals development. The funds in our  fiscal year 1990 bill will complete the project  in my State. The other projects in this bill are  designed  to achieve  the  same  result,  but  some of them use different methods such as  the development of synthetics  that can be  substituted for minerals now in short supply.  During general debate,  I heard the propo nent of the amendment state that perhaps this  research could be carried out more cheaply or  more efficiently by other universities. Speaking  for Hawaii, I can tell you that Hawaii is located  in the heart of the richest ocean mineral re source known in the world.  In effect, we are  sitting on top of the mother lode. There is not  another State within 2,400 miles of Hawaii and  I can't imagine anyone doing a better job of  investigating this resource than Hawaii.  Mr. Chairman,  the modest  investment we  make  to develop these minerals will yield a  handsome return for our Nation. This is an in vestment in America's future.  I urge Members to defeat the amendment.  ",1989
269,,101,-0.552,850,12,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker,  today I, along with Mr. GUNDERSON, am intro ducing  the Non-Traditional Employment  of  Women [NEW] Act. The purpose of the NEW  Act is to encourage greater efforts to train and  place women  in  nontraditional employment  through  the  Job Training  Partnership Act  [JTPA], and requires coordination, at the State  level, with  the Perkins Vocational Education  Act.  Equal opportunity  in employment may be  the law of the land, but it is not yet a reality in  the workplace. Women  in  this country still  earn less than 70 percent of what men earn.  One of the reasons  for this persistent wage  gap is that men and women work at different  types of jobs. Occupational segregation of the  sexes is a fact of American life.  Regrettably, Federal  job  training programs  have contributed  to  the problem.  In  far  too  many instances, our Federal job training pro grams, however unintentionally, are steering  women into lower paying female jobs. Studies  conducted at the State and  local  level have  shown  that  those seeking assistance under  JTPA end up in traditionally male and female  fields of work. The limited national figures that  are available support these findings.  Studies show that there is a dramatic differ ence in future earning potential between what  JTPA programs seem  to  regard as men's  work and women's work. In Chicago in 1985,  91 percent of  the participants  in word-proc essing courses under JTPA were female; 87  percent  of  the  participants  in  electronics  courses were male. The median hourly wage  for word processing operators in the Chicago  area is $9.40 per hour, while the correspond ing wage for electronics technicians is almost  $6 higher, $15.30 per hour. Likewise, 89 per cent of  the enrollees  in clerk-typist courses  were female; 86 percent of the participants in  truck driving courses were male. The median  hourly wage  for  typists  in Chicago  is $7.01,  but  truck  drivers earn more  than  double,  $15.08 per hour.  Women who enter Federal job training pro grams  need  to  be  told  that  no work  is  women's work, that all jobs are open to them.  Despite  the  fact  that women comprise over  half of JTPA program participants,  it is clear  that women have not received their fair share  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  of the  training available under JTPA  for  the  jobs that offer the best wages, benefits, and  long-term earning potential. This  is a short coming  in  JTPA which Congress can and  should do something about.  The NEW Act will provide for greater oppor tunities  for women  to  receive  training and  placement  in  construction,  electronics, and  other nontraditional fields of work, where the  rates of pay are substantially higher. The bill  will accomplish this objective in two ways.  First, the NEW Act requires service delivery  areas and States  to  include goals  in  their  annual job training plans for training and plac ing  women  in  nontraditional  employment.  Second, the NEW Act creates a 4-year dem onstration program at a cost of $1.5 million  annually,  to  foster  the development of pro grams  to  train women  for nontraditional em ployment.  This  is modest  legislation, but  it  is much  needed  legislation. The NEW Act has  re ceived bipartisan support in the Senate, and is  supported by  the National Governors' Asso ciation, the AFL-CIO, Wider Opportunities For  Women,  the National Women's Law Center,  the Women Construction Owners and Execu tives, and the New York and Ohio State Em ployment Bureaus.  SUPPORT  FOR  PRESIDENT  BUSH'S CLEAN AIR ACT PRO POSAL WITH RESERVATIONS  HON. J. ROY ROWLAND  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 28, 1989  ",1989
270,,101,-0.127,850,12,Mr. ROWLAND of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  rise at this time to state my support for Presi dent Bush's Clean Air Act proposal but with  strong  reservations.  I am sure  that many of  my colleagues have wrestled with  the same  questions and complexities of the issues that  have troubled me in the days since the Presi dent made public  the  legislative specifics of  his previously outlined goals.  The President should be commended  for  his  leadership  in moving  the debate forward  for the first time in a decade.  However,  I am deply concerned about the  weaknesses and omissions  I see  in his pro posals. Over  the  last several days  I have  spoken at length with industry representatives,  State government officials and environmental  groups about the problems each interest per ceives. We all share the desire and the strong  motivation  to achieve real  reductions of the  pollutants which threaten our environment, our  health and the future of the next generations.  But  there  is, sometimes, wide disagreement  as to what specific actions will get us to our  destination.  For instance, Georgia is one of the fastest  growing States in  the country. Population  in creases demand more  jobs. Both residential  and  industrial  growth will  require  greater  energy needs. Additionally, Georgia  is also  trying to overcome the poverty and lower than  average standard of  living conditions of  the  past. This,  too,  requires more energy. More  cars and other transportation modes usually  result  from growth and  improved  life-styles.  July 28, 1989  The caps implicit in  the President's proposal  will not allow continued progress in Georgia's  economy.  In another area,  the President's bill does  not seem to take into account some very im portant regional differences. For example, At lanta and the rest of the State have to contend  with an unusually high  release of hydrocar bons  from vegetation and our pine  forests,  which are very important to our economy. We  will need  to control  the other ozone precur sors,  nitrogen  oxides  emissions, more  to  offset  the naturally occurring  releases. The  Bush plan stresses reductions  in volatile or ganic  compounds  [VOC's]  and  should  be  more flexible in this area.  Many States, such as Georgia, have already  made and paid for serious clean air programs,  while others,  for varying  reasons, have not  made much progress. I feel whatever bill ulti mately passes should give credit  to States  which have achieved real  reductions. Other wise, we will be penalizing them for getting a  head start on  the problem, while  rewarding  other States  for having delayed  facing  the  issue.  In spite of all  these and other criticisms,  I  have decided in my own mind, after much re flection,  that the President's plan  is the best  vehicle at hand by which we can move for ward.  It needs significant modification. But  it  has drawn on the several bills already pending  in  the Congress as well as other  ideas ad vanced by the experts. Therein lies its great est strength in my opinion.  It seems to have  the greatest potential for real compromise and  consensus. In cosponsoring the bill, I hope to  be part of the strong team we will need to be  successful in enacting a good, workable Clean  Air Act this year.  TRIBUTE TO FRIEDRICH LIST  HON. GUS YATRON  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATl VES  Friday, July 28, 1989  ",1989
271,,101,-0.174,850,12,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to Friedrich List, on  the occasion  of the 200th anniversary of his birth. Friedrich  List, a West German economist who resided  in Reading, PA,  for 5 years  in  the early  1800's, made many contributions to the Read ing area and to our Nation. The history of his  life is a long a storied one, but worthy of brief  explanation at this time.  Friedrich List was born in Reutlingen, West  Germany and immigrated to America in 1825.  He settled in Pennsylvania and eventually to  Reading where he worked as an editor for the  Reading Adler newspaper-the forerunner of  our present Reading Eagle.  In addition  to  being an important columnist, he was also im portant in the political world and is claimed to  be  responsible  for Andrew Jackson winning  Pennsylvania during  the  1828 election. He  was a personal friend of Lafayette as well. As  an economist, Mr. List was considered one of  the most prominent of the 19th century, in the  same category as Adam Smith and Karl Marx.  His experience and observations  in America  are said to have had a substantial impact on  his economic theories. Mr. List eventually re",1989
272,House,101,-0.472,1006,12,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. 0BER STAR], who has a special  interest  in  this legislation, as his district is affect ed by it.  ",1989
273,House,101,-0.553,1006,12,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to compliment the gentleman on  his prompt action on the legislation  and  for his very  thorough ma1""!age ment of the bill, both in the commit tee hearings and markup, and here on  the House floor. The gentleman has  rendered land management issues  in  our State, nationwide, a great service  not only here but in his other work in  the committee of which he  is  the  chair.  I strongly support H.R. 2783 to allow  the Bureau of Land Management to  transfer small parcels of land to the  State of Minnesota. If this is enacted,  the BLM will transfer 850 parcels of  land. These small land parcels, primar ily islands, are now owned by the Fed eral Government. The Federal  land  management agencies simply are not  able to effectively manage these small  and widely dispersed parcels.  The Minnesota Department of Natu ral Resources, county and local agen cies are better suited and have better  resources to manage these lands eff ec tively.  I support the legislation for two pri mary reasons: first, the Minnesota De partment  of Natural Resources  is  better  suited  to manage  effectively  small, widely scattered parcels of land  than are the BLM or other Federal  agencies; Equally important, the legis lation will grant the BLM greater ad ministrative authority to resolve land  title disputes in an equitable manner,  and  to assist Minnesota  landholders  who find their title to lands clouded  by Federal interests, surveying errors,  and other oversights and misunder standings. This  legislation will help  BLM  resolve numerous  longstanding  land title disputes, a matter of particu lar interest to landholders in my con gressional district.  Several  landholders  in my district  have  occupied  parcels  of  land  for  many years, believing they hold title  to those lands. Some have built homes  and cabins on those lands. Some have  paid property  taxes on  those  lands.  These same property owners now find,  much to their surprise, that the land  they believed they owned is actually  owned by  the Federal Government,  under  the  administration  of  the  Bureau of Land Management.  Under current law, such landholders'  only recourse is to seek remedy under  the very complex and stringent proc ess required by the Color of Title Act.  Unfortunately, many landholders who  have a reasonable claim are unable to  qualify for transfer of title or other  equitable resolution of  title disputes  under  the stringent,  time-consuming  and often expensive color of title proc ess.  Therefore,  under  current  law,  landholders who  have  occupied  a  parcel of land for many years, erected  structures on that land and paid prop erty  taxes on  that  land may  find  themselves forced to vacate the land  without compensation for their invest ments of time and money.  The bill  I  am cosponsoring  today  will grant the Bureau of Land Man agement greater flexibility to resolve  legitimate claims of landholders in an  equitable  and  expeditious manner.  The bill grants BLM authority to sell  land under its jurisdiction in Minneso ta to holders of legitimate claims to  that land, and to consider such factors  as longevity of occupation of the land,  payment of property taxes and value  of structures erected on the land in  discounting  the price of sale of the  land. This process would be far superi or to the procedure in place under cur rent law-more effective, more expedi tious, and more equitable.  This new procedure  to settle  land  title disputes will work properly only  if affected landholders are aware of  the clouded title and their options to  resolve the problem. When I first re viewed this bill in draft form,  I was  concerned that landholders with legiti mate claims but who  live  in remote  areas might not be notified of their  options in time to take advantage of  the new title review process. Careful  review of the final form of the bill and  discussions with the Bureau of Land  Management,  the Minnesota Depart ment of Natural Resources and  the  Parks and Public Lands Subcommittee  have persuaded me that all parties in volved are committed to making their  best effort to ensure that landholders  with  legitimate claims are aware of  their land title situation and their op tions under the new legislation.  If the bill is enacted into law, affect ed  landholders will have 6 months  from the date of enactment to make  their claim known to BLM. The trans fer of the lands to Minnesota will be  made  at  the  end of  the  6-month  period. The BLM and the Minnesota  DNR already know the occupation or  landholder status of the vast majority  of the parcels to be transferred to the  State and have attempted to contact  all affected landholders to notify them  of  their options. As a  further safe guard against omission of  legitimate  claims from consideration prior to the  transfer,  the bill requires that BLM  make aggressive efforts to notify Min nesota residents of the status of the  lands, of the intent to transfer those  lands to the State, and of the options  available  to  landholders  occupying  those lands. The Bureau of Land Man agement plans to advertise in local and  regional  papers  in Minnesota  and  make other efforts  to  ensure  that  landholders are properly notified of  the impending transfer and are aware  of the options of claimholders.  Officials of the Minnesota Depart ment of Natural Resources have as sured me they will not accept transfer  of any lands whose title remains in dis pute,  clouded  or  unclear.  Further,  BLM  is committed to resolving  title  disputes  fairly and equitably before  transferring lands to the State. This  bill provides both impetus to discover  and resolve title disputes and a mecha nism  to  facilitate  fair  resolution of  those disputes.  Despite all of the above safeguards,  there  remains  a  remote  possibility  that a  landholder with a  legitimate  claim,  acting  in good  faith, would  somehow be unaware of clouded title  ",1989

276,House,101,0.465,1032,12,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in support of H.R. 1391, the Tele vision Violence Act of 1989. This bill  would insulate the television networks,  the  cable  interests,  producers  and  others in the industry from any anti trust risk should they decide to meet  to develop voluntary guidelines to alle viate the impact of televised violence.  I  think that this is an area which  cries out for the application of some  common sense. There should be little  doubt in anyone's mind that excessive  exposure to violence can have harmful  effects, particularly  in  the  case of  young people. A 1982 report issued by  the  National  Institute  of Mental  Health, summarizing the literature in  the field, states that ""recent research  confirms  the  earlier  findings  of  a  causal  relationship between viewing  televised violence and later aggressive  behavior."" Resolutions adopted by the  American  Psychological Association,  the American Psychiatric Association,  and the American Medical Association  are consistent with these findings.  As  a  society which  cares  for  its  young people and which is rightfully  alarmed by the rising tide of violent  behavior  in our homes and  in  the  streets of the communities in which  we  live, we  are  compelled  to  take  action.  As I said at our hearing on this bill  last May, I think a lot of commonsense  things can be done to take the worst  violence off the air. I think that most  shows can be done and the story line  can be developed without  the grue some  and  abhorrent  details which  have become commonplace  in televi sion programming. It does not  take  great wisdom to perceive this and, I  think, to devise workable guidelines to  deal with it.  There has been reluctance by the  networks and others in the television  industry  to  take collective  steps  to  reduce the level of violence  in their  programming. This has been  tied to  their uncertainty about potential anti trust liability should they, as competi tors, meet to discuss collective action  in  this area. The entire purpose of  H.R. 1391, accordingly,  is  simply  to  eliminate antitrust anxiety as a reason  for inaction by the television industry.

BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 31, 1989  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker,  I would like to  call to the attention of my colleagues the fol lowing  editorial-opinion written  by Charles  Whited. It is my hope that Mr. Whited's writing  will raise Member's consideration of the Amer ican aviation  industry, Government  interven tion in a free marketplace, the determination  of the human spirit, and the advancement of  technology  for both military and commercial  use.  How POLITICS BURIED A GOOD AIRPLANE  DESIGN  <By Charles Whited)  MIAMI.-This is the story of an American  aviation scandal.  The Burnelli aircraft.  You never heard of it. Few people have.  Few encyclopedias make mention of it. Bur nelli. Even pilots will give you a blank stare.  For 50 years,  the Burnelli, an original  ""lifting body"" aircraft similar to the flying  wing, has been relegated to the dustbin of  U.S. aviation because of a U.S. president's  fit of political temper.  Despite tributes to the design from such  giants of early military aviation as Gens.  Billy Mitchell and Hap Arnold, bad luck so  dogged its creator, Vincent Burnelli, that he  went to his grave broke in 1964. The last  Burnelli was built in the late '40s.  And yet a small clutch of believers still  cite the Burnelli as a stunning example of  power politics in the military-industrial es tablishment, by which rival airplane manu facturers have kept the flying public shack led to inefficient, dangerous aircraft types  that today girdle the earth.  ""It's insane ... an evil conspiracy that  starts at the Pentagon.""  Thus, in an office in Dade County, Fla., a  debonair one-time  test pilot of America's  first supersonic aircraft, Chalmers ""Slick""  Goodlin, 66, keeps vigil for the creations of  Burnelli, whom he has venerated since boy hood as an unsung aviation genius of all  time.  In the late 1940s, Goodlin flew the Bell X1 rocket plane to the verge of Mach 1 before  turning it over to Chuck Yeager, who broke  the sound barrier. Today, Goodlin makes  his living running a firm that buys, sells and  leases aircraft. But his heart  is with the  Burnelli Co. Inc., of which he is board chair man and president, holding  the Burnelli  patents.  The old  frustrations are  revived afresh  following two aviation events last week.  One was  the maiden  flight  of  the  batwinged B-2 stealth bomber, whose design  so  closely  resembles Burnelli  technology  ",1989
284,,101,-0.448,1136,12,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  in troducing, at the request of the Securities and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Exchange Commission, the Investment Advis er Self-Regulation Act to provide for the es tablishment of one or more self-regulatory or ganizations for registered investment advisers.  These SRO's would establish qualification and  business practice standards, perform  inspec tions, and enforce compliance with the law. At  no additional cost to the taxpayer, the industry  itself, under tough SEC oversight, would set  standards for and police its own members for  the protection of public investors.  Earlier this week, NBC Nightly News did a  segment on 67-year-old Norm Dietrich who  had  to come out of  retirement and start a  metal parts business when he lost his life sav ings, over $206,000. The Dietrichs were  re portedly among 2, 700 people who allege that  they lost a total of $40 million through Finan cial Concepts, an  Illinois  financial planning  firm. Lured by advertisements to attend  free  seminars, clients were persuaded to invest in  apartments, motels, and other real estate lim ited partnerships that  turned out disastrously  for most of them. Seventy-eight-year-old Eliza beth Synder learned she lost her $25,000 in vestment when she received an envelope in  the mail stamped: Sorry. You lost your money.  On June 11, 1986,  the Subcommittee on  Telecommunications,  Consumer  Protection,  and Finance held a hearing on investment ad visers,  financial planners, and customer pro tection. The  record  revealed  that while  the  vast majority of financial planners and invest ment advisers operate with integrity and com petence, there were far too many examples of  egregious fraud of unsophisticated  investors.  Many of the malefactors fell outside the regu latory reach of  the SEC. And  the growth of  the regulated industry was far outstripping the  Commission's resources.  On February 12, 1988, the SEC submitted  to  the subcommittee a  report based on a  study of the  financial planner industry  in  re sponse  to  the subcommittee's July 9, 1986,  request.  It examined a number of customer  demographics, characteristics of planners, and  the regulatory program for registering and  in specting p.lanners. The report also evaluated  the National Association of Securities Dealers'  pilot program to inspect NASO members who  are also investment advisers.  In September of  last year,  the SEC pub lished a  rule proposal, which  I strongly op posed, to exempt thousands of small-scale in vestment advisers from its registration require ments and  shift  its  responsibilities  to  the  States. Those rules have not been adopted.  Earlier this month the Committee on Energy  and Commerce ordered favorably reported to  the Budget Committee, for inclusion in budget  reconciliation,  legislation to provide the Com mission with the budget resources it needs to  police  the  securities markets  effectively.  These resource issues are real.  Since 1980,  the number of investment ad visers has more  than  tripled,  to 15,000 cur rently registered with  the SEC. These range  from sole proprietorships,  to  large  firms with  hundreds of employees. Assets under  their  management have increased more than 1,000  percent, now  totaling $5.3  trillion, which  is  greater than the combined deposits of banks  and savings and  loans. These assets now  amount  to 20  to 25 percent of all  financial  assets owned by Americans. There are also  July 31, 1989  approximately 200 foreign firms registered as  investment advisers in this country, reflecting  the  increasing globalization of our  financial  markets.  In the face of explosive growth in this indus try over the past decade, SEC staff levels de voted  to  supervising  the  industry have  in creased only slightly. As a consequence,  the  SEC is able to inspect investment advisers at  the rate of only once every 12 years.  On June 19, 1989,  the SEC submitted  to  Congress the legislation that I am introducing  today in order to further the public debate on  the problems associated with  inspecting and  regulating the mushrooming investment advis er industry in the face of severe limits on SEC  resources.  The committee will also be  looking at a  number of other substantive areas such as  how to regulate  those who hold  themselves  out to be financial planners, but who are not  registered as  investment advisers with  the  SEC. We also need  to look at the need  for  greater disclosure and customer education,  regulation conflicts of  interest, and ensuring  private rights of action under the  Investment  Advisers Act.  The  International Association  for Financial  Planning has announced its enthusiastic sup port for this legislation, while the National As sociation of Personal Financial Advisers has  issued a position paper opposed to self-regu lation in the investment advisory industry. I en courage all  industry members and  investors  who have an interest in this legislation to con tact the committee with their views so that we  may responsibly and effectivley fill in the exist ing regulatory gaps and protect the American  public and its savings from unethical and dis honest conduct.  The material follows:  SECURITIES AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION,  Washington, DC, June 19, 1989.  Hon. JOHN D. DINGELL,  Chairman, Committee on Energy and Com merce, U.S. House of Representatives,  Rayburn House Office Building, Wash ington, DC.  DEAR CHAIRMAN DINGELL: I am pleased to  transmit, on behalf of the Securities and  Exchange Commission, the attached legisla tive proposal to amend the Investment Ad visers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"") to pro vide for the establishment of one or more  self-regulatory organizations <""SROs"") for  registered investment advisers. The propos al  is  patterned after  the  self-regulatory  scheme for broker-dealers established in the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Exchange  Act].  The proposal would amend the Advisers  Act primarily by adding a new section, Sec tion 203A, that would authorize the Com mission to register one or more national in vestment adviser associations to provide a  self-regulatory mechanism  for  investment  advisers, subject to Commission oversight.  These associations would establish qualifica tion and business practice standards, per form  inspections, and enforce compliance  with the law. As a general matter, member ship in an association would be mandatory  for all registered investment advisers.

Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in strong support of the propos al by DAN ROSTENKOWSKI and DICK  GEPHARDT  to  give  a  tax break  to  middle-income Americans, while at the  same  time  reducing  the  Federal  budget deficit. The simple closing of a  loophole-which currently permits the  wealthiest among us to be taxed at a  lower rate than middle-income Ameri cans-can accomplish this.  The enactment of this proposal will  increase savings, help families to buy a  first home, help pay for college educa tions, and reduce the budget deficit by  about $25 billion in the first 5 years.  That's the kind of positive action the  American people would  like  to  see  from Congress. Let us not disappoint  them.

291,House,101,0.254,264,16,Mr. CHANDLER.," I  thank the gen tlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I  join many of my  colleagues in suggesting that Mr. VIs CLOSKY has in mind here a perfectly  legitimate goal. I do not question his  motives in the least.  Let me make a couple of points that  would tend to, I think, persuade per haps one to conclude this is not a good  idea.  First of all, Mr. VISCLOSKY  in his  comments said that leverage buyouts  would somehow be affected by mem bership on these investment boards of  workers. That is a  totally irrelevant  issue to this debate. It has absolutely  nothing to do with this.  In a leveraged buyout, when a plan  termination is involved, that is a deci sion of the employer. The employer  makes that decision, and this group of  workers would have absolutely noth ing to do with it. So set that aside;  LBO's are totally separate.  Our  colleague  from Florida  [Mr.  GIBBONS], who just happens to know  something about this issue from his  years of experience, concluded, as I  did, that workers also do not need this  so-called protection.  0 1510  In 1974 President Ford signed the  Employee Retirement Income Securi ty Act [ERISA]. When he did so, he  put in place protections for workers  that had never existed before, and  ERISA has worked pretty well.  The problem is now we are going to  say that an employers must share re sponsibility with employees for deci sion making on the investment of pen sion plan assets. Also, employers are  going to say, ""No."" They will not do it.  What is  their alternative? Well,  the  answer is clear in the response to the  question  from  the gentleman  from  Texas. They can and will terminate  their plans, or as our friend from Flor ida said, they will not set them up in  the first place.  In the last 10 to 15 years this Con gress has changed tax and pension law  practically every year. The Congress  has heaped on new requirements, year  after year. What has been the result?  Members can look back at years 1983,  1984, 1985, and I will  tell Members  what plan sponsors were doing. They  were doing then what they will do if  this amendment stays in place. They  were terminating their plans in record  numbers, and that is what will result  from the Visclosky amendment.  ",1989

293,House,101,-0.346,277,16,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in  opposition  to  the Dorgan  amendment.  First, let us get the facts straight.  Section 89, contrary to what the Wall  Street Journal contends, did not come  from the tax staff, but from the Treas ury Department. Second, section 89  does not force employers  to provide  benefits, but simply says that to the  extent an employer chooses to provide  benefits, they must be provided on a  nondiscriminatory basis.  Now I know that we have all heard  that section 89 is too complicated. And  it was, which is precisely why we on  the Ways and Means Committee re vised it, not once but three times, in  response  to  just those concerns. We  enacted a series of safe harbors and  simplifications last year in the Techni cal and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1988.  The chairman then introduced H.R.  1864 which totally revamped section  89. The committee then held hearings  and heard from over 30 witnesses, the  majority of whom did not advocate  repeal, but agreed with the chairman's  bill.  ",1989
294,House,101,0.496,290,16,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  to me and only want to corroborate  and  reiterate what  the  gentleman  from Minnesota  [Mr. FRENZEL]  said.  This money that is being spent, No. 1,  is being spent for safety, and safety on  airline traffic is as important as buildis  to  ing runways. I do not think any of us  can deny that.  It is being spent for a purpose for  which  it was collected, which  make the airports safer.  But second, Gramm-Rudman makes  tough choices. We have to face up to  that, all of us in this body, and they  are not going to get easier. I for one  would rather see the trust funds put  off budget, and one day I believe we  will do  that. But  they are not off  budget today.  A deal was made in order to imple ment the budget summit agreement, a  compromise, and now the Committee  on Ways and Means is going to stand  full force behind that compromise. It  may not be totally acceptable to every one in this body, but it is the only way  we can go at this point and measure  up  to our responsibilities under the  budget agreement.  ",1989
295,House,101,-0.416,290,16,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of  the Anderson  amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with the dis tinguished chairman of the Public Works Com mittee  in support of his amendment and  in  support of his strong commitment to ensuring  that the future of American air travel will not  be held hostage by budget tricks or short-term  thinking.  I would urge my colleagues  the purpose of a trust fund.  It  is to endow a vital activity with  sources needed to ensure its future.  Diverting funds from a trust fund for immedi ate emergencies ensures that when the future  arrives, when the rainy day comes, we will be  unprepared.  This  proposal would  divert  funds which  could modernize our air traffic control system;  fund the capital developments which will allow  our airports to expand and better serve Ameri can travelers and businesses; and provide the  maintenance which  is vital to the safety and  security of every traveler.  Don't be mistaken by the fact that huge sur pluses have built up in the fund.  Those surpluses exist not because they are  not sorely needed for our air  infrastructure,  but because they are victim of an administra tion budget trick.  Building up the airport trust fund with one  set of budget tricks to keep the deficit seem ing  smaller and  then using another budget  stratagem to take the money, does not live up  to the idea of a trust fund, and does not serve  the public interest.  The CBO and the House Budget Committee  have issued opinions stating that the added  revenues from suspending the tax trigger will  count toward the $5 billion no matter which  fund these moneys go to.  So let's keep them where they belong,  the airport trust fund.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the  Anderson amendment, showing that when we  in  ",1989

The week is to recognize employee owned companies across the Nation  for the  contribution they make to American's econo my. Throughout the country and  in  the 18th  District of Ohio, employee stock ownership  plans  [ESOP's] have been preserving  jobs  and helping to avoid the rash of closings that  have been sweeping through America's indus tries.  In 197 4 when Congress enacted  its  first  ESOP  legislation,  there were  few employee owned companies. Today there are over 200  employee-owned businesses  in Ohio alone  and more  than  1 0,000  s_uch  enterprises  across the United States.  In 1986, the E.W. Bliss Co. of Salem, OH in  my congressional district, was on the verge of  a shutdown. Citing general decline in the steel  industry,  the heavy equipment manufacturer  laid off 300 employees and demanded wage  concessions from  the 100 that remained.  In stead, Steelworkers local 3372 rejected con cessions and suggested an employee buyout.  Since  the  institution of  the ESOP  in 1986,  Bliss-Salem  Inc.  has  seen  profits  improve  steadily. Over 150 new employees have been  hired, sales have  tripled, and employees re ceived their first bonus this September.  Management  attributes  the  recovery  of  Bliss-Salem  to  its ESOP.

298,,101,-0.292,433,16,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Mr. Speaker, not long ago,  Lee Guy, editor of the Panhandle Press in my  home district, wrote an editorial expressing  the  frustration  that many Americans  feel  re garding the threat of terrorism. Mr. Guy's edi torial follows:  I do not remember the exact details of the  story because I read it many years ago, but  the  following  incident actually happened  during  the  administration  of  President  Theodore ""Teddy"" Roosevelt  in  the very  early years of this century.  It seems that a Middle Eastern sheik, ac tually more of a desert maurauder or what  we might call a  terrorist  today, had kid napped a wealthy Amerian heiress and was  holding her for a huge ransom which the  kidnappers  demanded  from  the United  States Goverrunent.  For want  of  remembering  the  lady's  actual name, we'll call her Mrs. Smith for  this  re-created  account. The  kidnappers  sent their ransom demand to the U.S. Gov errunent. President Roosevelt sent the fol lowing 12-word reply in a  telegram to the  sheik: ""24 hour stop Mrs. Smith stop Or  your head on a stick."" Within 24 hours, the  U.S. Government  received notification of  where Mrs. Smith would be waiting to be  picked up.  During the war with the Japanese, 50,000  U.S. Marines stormed the beaches of Okina wa, which was fortified to the hilt with sev eral hundred  thousand  Japanese  soldiers  and enough supplies  to  last  for months.  Enormously outnumbered, the Marines re lentlessly drove  the numerically  superior  hordes of Japanese back across the island  until the last 3,000 of them jumped over a  cliff and into the ocean. From several hun dred thousand Japanese, the U.S. Marines  took approximately 1,300 prisoners.  On the cruel, barren Pacific volcano island  of  Iwo  Jima, outnumbered U.S. Marines  doggedly  slugged  it out with  the enemy  until five bloodied and battle-weary Ameri cans firmly planted Old Glory on  top of  Mount Suribachi. And that, thank you very  much, was all she wrote for the Japanese.  You all remember the picture-the world famous photograph was the model for the  U.S. Marine Corps Memorial at Arlington  National Cemetery.  On June 6, 1944, Allied forces-American,  British and French-stormed the beaches at  Normandy and Omaha in the face of unbe lievable, dPq.dly, withering gunfire from the  firmly-enti,  ched  and  fortified German  22193  army. Today, such a scenario might cause  modern soldiers to ""fall back and re-group.""  But, our men  relentlessly drove  forward  through the lethal onslaught, overran the  enemy, and that was the beginning of the  end of the world-conquest dreams of Adolph  Hitler.  Where have all our soldiers gone? Where  is the guts and backbone of the American  fighting man and his leaders? Throughout  the history of the United States of America,  from Valley Forge and Bunker Hill to Balti more Harbor; from the Marne to Belleau  Wood;  from Pearl Harbor to Okinawa to  Iwo Jima; and from the Thirty-Eighth Par allel  to Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak  Ridge, the American fighting man has faced  insurmountable odds and has always pre vailed against the most aggressive and de termined enemies. During this century, the  accomplishments of the American fighting  man have become legend, as well as fact, in  our history books.  Now, America lowers her eyes and stares  at the ground like a subservient slave when  an unspeakable act is performed against one  of her citizens in a foreign land. Witness the  alleged brutal murder of Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins, USMC, in Beirut. Col. Higgins was  an American fighting man who faced hostil ity and aggression in the service of his coun try, and he did so without backing down or  compromising with  the enemy. Now  that  this brave soldier has been taken from the  service of our nation by a cowardly act of  terrorists, the United States must not back  down from exacting the last ounce of justice  from his kidnappers.  When  is  the United States of America  going to stand up to these cowardly acts of  terrorism and punish them severely, instead  of holding hysterical talk sessions on televi sion in which our national leaders mumble  inane phrases like ""delicate situation"", ....  ""can't upset the balance"" ... , ""negotiations  are going on"" . . . , etc.?  How long is it going to be before United  States military forces see to it that terror ists in the Middle East are afraid to so much  as snatch an American woman's purse?  How long do we have to tolerate the mos quitoes without being allowed  to use  the  simple solution of insecticide? How long?  TRIBUTE TO DOROTHA  FREDERICK  HON. DAVID E. BONIOR  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 27, 1989  ",1989
299,,101,-0.547,433,16,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to an outstanding woman, Dorotha  Frederick, on  the occasion of her retirement  from over a half-century of practice as a li censed cosmetologist in Mount Clemens.  Even more  than  this distinguished profes sional accomplishment. Dorotha's humanitari an spirit and commitment  to  the disadvan taged  in our community have made her a  touchstone in the hearts of family, friends, and  countless others.  Known  as  a  ""whirlwind  of activity and  action,"" Dorotha's volunteer and  fundraising  work with  the Salvation Army has set new  standards  of energy  and  devotion  to  the  Army's charitable mission.

300,House,101,0.371,446,16,Mr. SUNDQUIST.," Mr. Ch&nnan, I  thank my  distinguished  colleague  from Texas for yielding time to me on  this important issue.  My friends, today we have a choice  to make. I do not think it is a very dif ficult choice. I deplore those on the  other side of the aisle who are trying  to make a class war out of it, pitching  one group against the other. Today we  have a choice that is very simple. We  can  extend  IRA's  for  individuals.  Eighty-four percent who make more  than $50,000 benefit. Reduce the cap.  ital gains tax, 75 percent making less  than $50,000 benefit. It is that simple.  High capital gains are a penalty on  middle-class savings and investments.  ",1989
301,House,101,-0.099,459,16,Mr. SLATTERY.," I thank the chair man.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today as a  Member who favors a preferential tax  rate for capital gains and have during  my congressional career. But it must  be permanent and it must be paid for.  And the Bush-Jenkins proposal before  us fails on both counts.  It is ridiculous for us to cut capital  gains tax rates for 2 years, which will  do nothing but stimulate  a  lot of  churning on Wall Street while at the  same time compounding and worsen ing the deficit problem over the long  term.  This proposal will increase the defi cit, it is going to increase interest rates  in this country, it is going to reduce  the national savings rate and, to add  insult to injury, the big winners, ladies  and gentlemen, are going  to be the  quick-buck artists on Wall Street who  are making millions  today  through  leveraged buyouts and all the merger  mania that is going on in New York.  In closing,  like all  tax cuts, Mr.  Chairman, it is easy to vote for the  Bush-Jenkins proposal; it is a tax cut.  It is bad fiscal policy, bad tax policy,  and ladies and gentlemen, it should be  defeated.  ",1989
302,House,101,-0.372,459,16,Mr. JOHNSTON of Florida.," Mr.  Chairman, I have not participated in  debate on  the  floor of  the House  before but I have chosen this time be cause of the extreme importance of  the Rostenkowski-Gephardt  amend ment.  I  spent  the  last week  agonizing  about the choices offered here, and  was undecided until  last night. But  after  researching both proposals,  I  reached some conclusions.  I am philosophically in favor of a  differential in rates, but the Bush plan  is  simply  the wrong scheme at the  wrong time.  We have got to start looking at the  next decade and the next century in stead of the next election. The fact is  that the Bush capital gains plan will  have  a  devastating  effect  on  the  budget deficit in 1993 and 1994. Over a  10-year period, it will have a $21 bil lion shortfall.  The Rostenkowski-Gephardt amend ment will not only help families pur chase a  first home or send a child  through college, but according to the  Joint Committee on Taxation, it will  also earmark over $25 billion for the  deficit reduction trust fund.  Accordingly, I'm casting my vote for  this amendment and I have no reser vations about  the political or fiscal  consequences.  ",1989
303,House,101,0.268,459,16,Mr. RITTER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of Jenkins-Archer and echo the  comments of NEAL SMITH of Iowa, who  said the indexing provisions in this bill  alone are  important enough for  the  Democrats as well as Republicans to  support the measure.  Mr. Chairman, make no mistake about it, my  colleagues, capital gains  tax  reduction  is a  winner for America. It provides seed corn for  our  jobs and  for our  future. Right now,  the  United States has the highest capital gain tax  in  the  industrialized world and we've been  beaten to the punch too often by foreign com petition.  Senior citizens, small business people, aver age  citizens  selling assets-a business, a  farm, a property-whose increase in value is  packed with inflationary gains will benefit from  the capital gains indexing in Jenkins-Archer.  talk  doesn't  leadership  The Democratic leadership just doesn't real ize how many middle-class Americans benefit  from capital gains and thus would benefit from  this reduction.  The Democratic  about that.  Instead,  they challenge  the President and  many of their own hardworking, knowledgea ble Members with a jerry-rigged,  last-minute  appeal for class warfare. They don't talk about  how capital gains revenue to the Government  increased when rates have been reduced  in  the past.  They talk competitiveness, but won't reduce  the cost of capital.  They rail against Japanese R&D  intensive  industries and the inroads they've made into  our markets, but back down when something  could be done about it.  On  the other hand,  I understand some of  their other reservations.  I believe we could have crafted a better  capital gains  tax  reduction-more  like  the  President's original idea for a 15-percent rate  or more  like what Treasury Secretary Brady  has been talking about to spur longer term in vestment.  But the political process is not always so  easy and compromise comes  into play. We  are, in this case, hamstrung by static econom ic models being used  for Gramm-Rudman  number crunching where the numbers them selves are often far from real. We are forced  not to recognize the growth-creating, revenue increasing  stimuli  that  all  previous  capital  gains reductions have provided.  Nevertheless, Jenkins-Archer  is a step  in  the right direction. It has the exceedingly im portant feature of indexing capital gains for in flation and making  long-term investment that  much more attractive to the American people.  As the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITH], a  Democrat, stated,  it's fair because it doesn't  force people to pay excessive taxes on gains  which are the result of inflation. He implored  his colleagues to do what's right and support  the capital gains measure.  Indexing capital gains for inflation, I say to  my colleagues on the Democratic side of the  aisle, is, in and of itself, solid, substantive ra tionale for supporting Jenkins-Archer.  Finally, many in this House believe as I do  that America needs to  look to the long term  rather than the next quarterly report. America  has too  long underinvested in the plant and  equipment,  research and development, and  the technologies of the future which  lead to  better jobs, higher living standards, and an en hanced quality of life. Jenkins-Archer should  be viewed as an  initial step  in enhancing  longer term thinking about our economy. It's a  foot in the proverbial door of a rational, longer  term savings and investment tax policy.  ",1989
304,House,101,-0.213,472,16,Mr. JONES of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman, I sup ported  the Jenkins-Archer proposal  to  rein state the capital gains rate differential, and I  am pleased the House voted to include this  provision  in  the reconciliation bill before the  House today.  I do not consider this to be a partisan issue.  I consider it a mainstreet, mainstream Demo",1989

I am pleased to  be joined by my colleague and fellow  Washingtonian,  Senator  SLADE  GORTON.  Mr. President, 1989 marks the 100th  year of statehood for our home State  of Washington. On November 11, 1889,  at 3:09 p.m.,  the  first Governor of  Washington State, Elisha P. Ferry, re ceived a telegram from President Ben jamin Harrison announcing the desig nation of Washington as the 42d State  in the Union. A story in the Tacoma  Daily News the following day exempli fies  the pride and  joy  felt by  the  people of Washington State:  Occupying, as it does, the very richest sec tion of the whole country, with its wealth of  inland shores lined with timber enough to  supply the world, with its rich veins of valu able  ores, with  its valuable  agricultural  lands  and  its  unparalleled  scenery  for  beauty and grandeur, combined with its un equalled climate, it starts out on its life of  statehood with not only the eyes of this  land, but the whole world upon it.  In addition to the obvious resource  wealth of our State, we have been  blessed  by  a  population  that  has  always shown a tremendous ability to  overcome adversity and lend a hand to  fellow Washingtonians  in  times  of  need. We have celebrated all of these  treasures  throughout  the centennial  year with hundreds of festivals, exhib its and other special events that signi fy all that is Washington. These activi ties will remind the residents of Wash ington and people around the Nation  of our resources.  We will also recall the tremendous  economic and population growth of  the 1700's and 1800's. We often hear  the stories of fur  traders and gold seekers who came West seeking fame  and fortune. First came  the  rugged  travelers, then the brides, and finally,  whole  families, determined  to brave  the hardships of a new life. The com pletion of a railroad with the East in  1883 eventually brought many of the  luxuries and innovations of an advanc ing nation to the Northwest.  Since statehood in 1889, Washington  has witnessed  tremendous  growth.  Washington State has become a leader  in aviation, shipbuilding, trade, forest ry, agriculture, and energy resources.  The population has reached over 4.4  million. The Puget Sound area flour ishes as a gateway to the Pacific. East ern Washington consists of rich agri cultural land that has made our State  famous worldwide for its Washington  apples and many other crops.  At the same time we look upon the  past with pride, we must recognize we  have made a good start and use this  momentum to lay the groundwork for  future excellence.

OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 28, 1989  ",1989
311,,101,0.6,706,16,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I have received  a copy of a letter from one of iT''J constituents,  Dr. Edward Tauxe of Knoxville, TN, to the Di rector of National Drug Control Policy, William  Bennett.  Dr. Tauxe proposes a Federal security sur charge on the filing of all  income tax  forms.  This revenue would go  to  fund our national  war on drugs. Additionally,  he  suggests a  system  for better management of handling  drug dependent persons.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  September 28, 1989  I comr.iend  this  thoughtful and  insightful  letter to my colleagues  in  the House, and  I  would  like  to submit  it  to be printed  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  I believe  that all  Members would gain insight from reading this  letter.  KNOXVILLE, TN, September 7, 1989.  Mr. WILLIAM BENNETT,  I  Director of Office of National Drug Control  Policy, Office of Secretary of Education,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. BENNETT:  I congratulate you on  your new comprehensive program to attack  the drug problem  in  the country.  am  indeed grateful to President Bush for his  support in purposing this and for his timely  speech introducing this to the nation.  I will be sending a copy of this letter to  my Senators and friends  in  the House of  Representatives in the hopes of strong bi partisan support for a terrible non-partisan  problem. As you know partisan politics can  certainly stifle  this program. We have  to  guard against that. It would be rare indeed  for the bill to go unamended and if the po litical powers that be are indeed able to give  useful amendments; then I  think this may  be useful in helping make this a bipartisan  bill.  The purpose of this letter is to propose a  couple of considerations that I would hope  may  improve  the bill. As you know,  the  Democratic leadership seems to be saying, it  does not go far enough. I am sure that all  Democrats and Republicans in our national  leadership would like for it to go further,  but, we must start somewhere. It is obvious ly the will of the nation that we do not in crease taxes. I do see a way, however, that  some partial funding can be made  if  the  President will agree not to veto and if the  Democrat leadership agree not to attempt  to capitalize on the idea of tax increase, and  if  the bipartisan  leadership would  agree  such that the vote would be so dramatic the  President would be unable to veto a bit of  extra funding. I am proposing a surcharge  for every household in the country who files  income  tax  forms.  I would propose  that  every household be given a $20.00 (plus or  minus) federal drug security surcharge. As  you have brought out, this is a multi-facto rial problem. The grower, the manufacturer,  the importer, the pusher and the user, as  well as  the person who  is aware of  this  going on and does nothing to stop it.  We  talk about disincentives and  this  is  true. The average citizen, however,  is not  getting a direct disincentive,  that I  really  see, that would be interpreted as such in the  present bill proposed.  do not see  the average citizen  really  doing anything, except perhaps small talk.  If we are not a part of the solution, we are a  part of the problem.  A  federal  security  surcharge,  however,  would be a direct disincentive and coupled  with ""hot lines"" can certainly encourage the  citizenry to do more toward being a part of  the solution to the problem.  As you know, the problem has been with  us for many scores of years and will always  be a problem as a result of the drug depend ent personalities, etc., with which we are  born. The problem becomes one of manage ment. When I began to practice medicine,  back in early 1952. We had a system of fed eral hospitals. When our doctors found a  person abusing drugs, they were simply re ported  to  federal authorities, and  in our  area they would be taken to the hospital in  Lexington, Kentucky. There  they may go  voluntarily or  involuntarily  for a  ""cure"".  This really worked quite well. While there  I  were a large number of failures, the prob lem was indeed managed relatively well; re alizing  the problem can never be  totally  gone.  I would  suggest  looking  into  this  system of federal hospitals that were ""on  the line"" back in those days.  I am sure there will be many other consid erations and possible amendments. I  think  this should be encouraged so the final bill  will still have the appropriate direction yet,  the support of both parties and hopefully a  100% vote  in both Houses to support the  final bill.  I want  to emphasize a surcharge would  not be a new tax and should not be con strued as a new tax. While incomes of a cer tain level, perhaps could be ""excused"" from  such a  surcharge. It is  important,  in my  mind, that this be a surcharge paid equally  by everyone, that it be coupled with a possi ble means of everyone being able to report,  and to be encouraged to report drug offend ers and possible verbal supportive criticism  to improve the problem and that the sur charge vary from year to year according to  the necessity for over and above normal law  enforcement.

312,,101,0.162,706,16,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, over the last  several months all of us have been dismayed  by  the revelations of scandal coming out of  the Department of Housing and Urban Devel opment. As  the  ranking minority member of  the Subcommittee on Housing and Community  Development,  I have  been  particularly ap palled at the abuses which occurred and the  neglectful  attitude  which  was  pervasive  throughout  the  top management of  the De partment.  Our  own Housing Subcommittee  of  the  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Commit tee has  looked  into the scandal.  In addition,  the Subcommittee on Employment and Hous ing, chaired by  the distinguished gentleman  from California [Mr. LANTOS], has conducted a  superb series of hearings which has produced  extensive  information which has been both  relevant and disturbing. I have attended many  of those hearings and can attest to the com pletely professional, nonpartisan methodology  the committee has used  in uncovering  this  mushrooming scandal.  Just  this week we witnessed  the unfortu nate spectacle of former Secretary Pierce and  the man who was his chief assistant refusing  to  answer questions  from  a congressional  committee and invoking their fifth amendment  privileges. This just underscores the serious ness of this matter and the complexity of the  investigation.  Today,  I am  introducing  legislation  to ad dress some of the abuses which have come  to  light. This bill  is not an attempt to imple ment sweeping programatic changes at HUD.  ",1989

314,Senate,101,0.013,758,16,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I send  an amendment to the desk on behalf  of myself, Senator HELMS,  Senator  HEFLIN, Senator DOLE, Senator HEINZ,  Senator GRASSLEY, Senator LOTT, Sen ator HATCH, and Senator COCHRAN, and  ask for its immediate consideration.  ",1989
315,House,101,0.122,953,16,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speak er,  I rise  in strong support of this bill. Since  the steel import restraint program was first au thorized  in 1984, the domestic steel  industry  has done a remarkable job regaining profitabil ity  and market  share while making  great  strides  toward being  internationally competi tive. But, while the program has succeeded in  meeting challenges of the 1980's, our daunt ing  task this year has been to create a new  policy to meet those of the 1990's.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe  this bill  represents  that policy.  I am proud  to be an original co  sponsor of the bill before us today and want  to  thank  trade subcommittee chairman Mr.  GIBBONS for his leadership on this bill.  As  the economy has expanded  in  recent  years, I have spent a great deal of time work ing with my companies in Connecticut to help  them gain access  to adequate supplies of  steel. They are a diverse group, ranging from  metal stamping shops which may employ only  a few workers,  to  the Stanley Works which  manufactures a wide range of tools and other  products, and Theis Steel, a small high-quality  specialty steelmaker. While these firms gener ally have supported  the VRA program,  the  short supply process has at times forced them  to expend more time in Washington working  on short supply requests than in Connecticut  manufacturing.  The significance of this bill  is not that the  VRA's are being extended but  that  the pro gram is being  improved. A straight extension  of the VRA's would not have met the needs of  the economy and would not have gained the  wide support this bill has. Our bill, H.R. 3275,  will support the modernization of our steel in dustry, but it will also ensure that steel users  will have access  to as much steel as  they  need in an expanding economy.  In recent years, with the domestic industry  at near-capacity,  the domestic steel makers  have not always been able to supply the full  needs of our manufacturers. When domestic  steel makers cannot fill an order, we need to  ensure that steel users have prompt access to  steel from other sources.  Moreover, our bill also gets to the root of  the problem that led to the original VRA pro gram: unfair  trade practices. Mr. Speaker,  if  when  the VRA's expire 2% years  from now  subsidized steel is still reaching our shores we  will not have done our job. If, 2% years from  now, foreign steel makers can dump steel to  gain U.S. market share, we will have  failed.  The U.S. steel industry has done a remarkable  job regaining its competitiveness over the past  5 years, but  the job  is not finished. Our bill  puts the world on notice that we are serious  about ensuring  that our market will only be  open to fairly traded steel.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ways and  Means Committee which has jurisdiction over  this program, I am proud that this bill has the  support of interests who, at the beginning of  this debate, were on opposite sides of  the  issue. I urge my colleagues to support the bill  and hope the Senate acts quickly to approve  this important program.  Mr. AlTIER. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  urge my colleagues to support the extension  of  the Voluntary Restraint Agreements  for  steel imports included in H.R. 3275. However,  my support is only lukewarm.  As someone who was personally involved in  bringing VRA's into existence in 1984, I firmly  believe that while there has been significant  progress, there is still much to be done. This  is why I would rather see a 5-year extension,  rather than the 2 %-year extension as included  in  this  legislation.  I'm not sure 2% years  is  enough  to accomplish  the  intricate negotia tions needed to provide an  international con sensus to remove unfair trade practices and  to provide more time for the industry to adjust  and modernize.  But  I also understand  the  tough negotia tions which  took place between members of  the Congressional Steel Caucus, U.S. steel  producers, U.S. steel users and the adminis tration which went into producing this legisla tion.  This 2%-year extension  is a compromise,  balancing the interests of steel producers and  users.  I will abide with  this compromise and  not offer any amendments today. But, be as sured,  I and my colleagues who care about  the future of an American steel industry will be  closely monitoring the progress which the ad ministration  makes,  both  bilaterally  and  through  the Uruguay round of GA n, during  the next 2% years. If, in that time, insufficient  progress  is made  in negotiating  international  agreements  curbing  steel  subsidies which  have given  foreign producers an advantage  over U.S. steelmakers, Members of the Con gressional Steel Caucus will work  to have  Congress revisit this issue.

The question is  on the motion offered by the gentle man from Ohio [Mr. PEAsE]  that the  House suspend the rules and pass the  bill, H.R. 3275, as amended.  The question was taken.  ",1989
317,House,101,0.421,979,16,Mr. GOSS.,"  I  appreciate  that, be cause  the gentleman  is  exactly on  point. I believe the international press  today attributed a statement from the  Arias government  indicating  that in  fact the campaign, the election, was  going to be over the end of October.  That clearly alluded to this registra tion  process,  because we were  in formed by both sides and, of course.  we saw the Sandinistas as well as the  opposition while we were  there be cause we were in a neutral observer  role;  they made it very clear that if  you have not registered exactly prop erly it does not matter what you think  or what else you do, that if you miss  your last chance to register when the  fourth Sunday of October is gone, you  are disenfranchised from the election,  and if there is a mistake in the elec tion process, you are also disenfran chised, as it is a little complicated for  the average campesino, or if there are  mistakes, and there are many people  aware of  the political  situation  in  Nicaragua who know the average cam pesino is displeased with the Nicara guan Government.  ",1989
318,,101,-0.408,1005,16,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to the North Wind Undersea Institute  located in my congressional district.  The North Wind Undersea  Institute  is an  educational and environmental museum which  is dedicated to preserving and protecting the  environment and marine life. North Wind has  participated  in  the  dramatic  rescues  of  beached  marine mammals  and  has  re searched and developed new technologies to  aid wildlife and the environment.  North Wind  has  received many  honors  during  its existence and recently obtained a  patent for its Benjamin Box live trap for sea  lions. The Benjamin Box is a floating cage de signed to safely capture sea lions and other  mammals and transport them to more secure  habitats. Past devices for capturing sea lions  have  tended  to  injure or kill  these animals.  The Benjamin Box is truly a significant break through  in the humane treatment of animals.  Additionally, North Wind recently received a  $30,000 grant for a program to promote the  welfare of wild mustangs. This grant will allow  approximately 2,000 Bronx schoolchildren  to  learn about horses,  their history and  their  present environmental dilemma. This money  will permit North Wind  to expand  its already  successful message of environmental conser vation and awareness to even larger numbers  of young people.  I have been proud to work with North Wind  during its 1 0 year existence. The patent of the  Benjamin Box to help sea lions and the ob taining of a grant for the preservation of wild  mustangs shows this organization's continued  commitment toward the assistance of all ani mals.  I offer my sincere congratulations  to  North Wind for its achievements and look for ward to working with them  in their efforts to  educate people about protecting the environ ment and the rights of animals.  HONORING MARGARET ""PEG""  SWEZEY  HON. GARY L. ACKERMAN  OF NEW YORK  HON. FLOYD H. FLAKE  OF NEW YORK  HON.THO~J.~ON  OPNEWYORK  HON. JAMES H. SCHEUER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday October 2, 1989  ",1989
319,,101,-0.429,1005,16,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, the Queens  delegation rises today to honor a woman re spected and beloved throughout our county of  22765  Queens by all who have had the pleasure to  meet her. That woman  is Margaret  ""Peg""  Swezey, a successful businesswoman, a com mitted community  leader, an avid patron of  the arts, and above all a wonderful person  without whom  the Queens community would  be much the poorer.  In appreciation of the many years of distin guished service Peg has given Queens, Citi bank's Queens Retail Bank and members of  the Queens community will hold a cocktail  party in Peg's honor on October 5 at the East  River Yacht Club.  It  is extremely difficult  for us  to describe  here  just  how much  Peg  has  done  for  Queens. Her contributions  to  the economic  and  cultural  improvement of Queens have  been  so  numerous  and  varied  that  they  cannot be summed up  in a  few sentences.  Her accomplishments literally speak for them selves.  Born and raised in Queens, Peg has devot ed herself to economic development, civic re sponsibility, and assisting others. She still lives  in Queens with her husband, Harold, a retired  electrical engineer with Western Electric. Their  one son, Mark, is now a high school teacher  in Kansas.  Peg has spent her whole career working in  Queens  for Citibank.  In a career spanning  three decades, she has diligently climbed the  corporate ladder, starting as a junior clerk and  working her way through the ranks to become  vice-president and director of community and  government relations. She will conclude her  career this year when she retires from her po sition as vice president to join her son, Mark,  in the Midwest.  At Citibank she has encouraged increased  coopreation between the borough of Queens  and many community organizations. She has  herself served on the board of directors of a  wide spectrum of Queens organizations,  in cluding  the Queens Outreach Corp.,  the  Flushing Council on the Arts, and the United  Cerebral Palsy of Queens. Peg also holds the  distinction of becoming  the  first woman  to  become president of the Queens Chamber of  Commerce in its 71-year history.  Peg's services  to Queens have extended  beyond  the  local  level, however. She has  worked strenuously on the national and inter national  levels  to promote development  in  Queens. In 1980 and 1986, she served as a  delegate to the White House Conference on  Small Business and  in 1982 she traveled to  China with  the Queens borough president to  encourage Chinese investment in Queens.  In recognition  for her services to Queens,  December 12, 1979 and April 18, 1983 were  proclaimed  to be  ""Peg Swezey""  days.  In  1980, Governor Cuomo cited her for her serv ice to Queens and in the same year she re ceived national recognition for her work with  the Small Business Administration when Presi dent Carter cited her as ""Banker Advocate of  the Year."" In recent years she has been cited  by the Queens borough president and hon ored by a resolution passed by the New York  City Council  recognizing her service  to  the  City of New York. Peg has also earned a  whole string of awards from local groups, In cluding  the Flushing Boys Club,  the United  Cerebral Palsy, the J.F.K. Rotary Club, the AI",1989
320,House,101,0.276,1018,16,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Madam Speaker,  repeal, repeal, repeal. My constituents  have spoken. These  trays  represent  more than 20,000 responses from the  seniors in the Second District of Mary land who object to being taxed via the  existing  catastrophic  health  bill.  There are 58.9 percent of my constitu ents who want total repeal. Of the re maining 41.1  percent,  they want a  delay of 1 year while a blue-ribbon bi partisan commission studies  the Na tion's whole health picture. However,  if a delay is not possible with such a  commission, then that same 41 percent  want the bill repealed.  Fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent  have asked for one of the alternate  proposals.  I want to point out to my colleagues  that my seniors are  typical middle  class Americans who made provision  for their retirement while they were  employed. My constituents want an  ""aye"" vote on  the Archer /Donnelly  amendment.  OPPOSITION TO H.R. 3, THE  HAWKINS-DOWNEY BILL  <Mr. HOLLOWAY asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  ",1989
321,House,101,0.475,1018,16,Mr. HOLLOWAY.," Madam Speaker,  the language in H.R. 3 governing title  II, title Ill, and title IV clearly states  that ""no child care provider receiving  financial  assistance under  this  sub chapter shall engage in any sectarian  activity,  including sectarian worship  and  instruction,  in  the program for  which such assistance is received.""  Churches  are  currently  providing  one-third of the center-based care in  the U.S. today and have been most in strumental in our inner cities. Many  inner city churches have chosen to re spond to the poor's need for child care  and have made a life-changing impres sion on disadvantaged youth  in our  Nation. Michael Novak of the Ameri can Enterprise Institute has reported  that black male  teenagers with reli gious values in the inner city today are  47 percent less likely to drop out of  school; 54 percent less  likely to use  drugs; and 50 percent less  likely  to  engage in criminal activity.  In theory if these religious providers  abandoned  their  religious  activities  they could receive funds through Hawkins-Downey, but ony if they abided  by a wide range of regulations includ ing State control of their choices for  program administrators and staff se lection. Obviously few, if any, religious  childcare providers are going to let the  State control tne choice of their staffs  and few will remove all religious traces  from their programs. Therefore, Haw kins-Downey will cut them out of the  process.  In addition to the religious discrimi nation in Hawkins-Downey there are  other provisions which are just as bad.  The bureaucracy created by this bill is  unbelievable.  It sets in motion 150 new regulations  on State governments receiving day care funds.  It also requires each State receiving  Federal daycare  funds  to  create  a  ""child development council"" for each  local government. If every State were  to accept Federal daycare funds under  the legislation, over 38,000 local child  development councils would need to be  created. Each council  is  required  to  submit reports  to  the State govern ment every 4 years. Which means by  the year 2000 over 120,000 Govern ment reports on daycare would be re quired.  H.R. 3 is such a bureaucratic mess.  Under this bill a grandmother caring  for her own grandchild has to comply  with  regulations  including  building  standards in her home, safety stand ards, nutrition standards, injury pre vention  and  treatment  regulations,  child  abuse  regulations  and health  regulations.  In addition,  the grand mother would be subject  to  inspec tions  by  the State government  to  make  sure  she was  caring  for her  grandchild in a manner that made the  State happy.  For these reasons,  I urge my col leagues to ""Just say no"" to Hawkins Downey.  Mr.  TOWNHALL MEETINGS IN OKLA HOMA AGAINST CATASTROPH IC HEALTH CARE PROGRAM  <Mr. INHOFE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  INHOFE. Madam Speaker, we  have heard a  lot  today about cata strophic health, and we are going to  hear a  lot more, but this is nothing  compared to what we have heard at  our townhall meetings back in Oklaho ma. I have over 5,000 names on peti tions of people saying, ""We don't want  the catastrophic health bill that was  passed.""  We have yet to have 1 person out of  over 20 meetings say that they like the  bill as it is, so I think we need to admit  that we have made a mistake. It was  wrong. The benefits are wrong. The  surtax is wrong.  The only decision  today  is do we  repeal it or do we amend it? I do not  believe you can Band-Aid this one. I  think the patient is dead.  I do not  think  there  is anything  more  refreshing  to  the  people  of  America than to have us stand up in  these hallowed halls and  say,  ""We  made a mistake. We're going to correct  it.""  A few minutes ago from this podium  one of my colleagues said that we do  not want to throw the baby out with  the bath water.

That  is  indeed what the so-called  fairness doctrine in this bill would do.  Until its proper repeal 2 years ago,  the fairness doctrine required broad casters to air opposing views on issues  of public  importance. Proponents of  the fairness doctrine said the airwaves  were so scarce that we couldn't trust  our broadcasters to be fair.  Who could be against laws requiring  something called fairness?  What sounded so noble, though, had  nothing  in  common with  fairness.

Synthia Suzanne Cockrell was born  totally  deaf, has no peripheral vision due  to para lyzed eye muscles, and suffers from amblyo pia, which means that she can only use one  eye at a time.  Synthia worked throughout high school as a  keypunch operator for Sample Brothers, and  she was  hired  by  the Defense Mapping  Agency Aerospace Center  in St. Louis, MO,  shortly after her high school graduation. She  has been promoted twice in the last 6 years,  and she has received several outstanding per formance ratings.

IN HONOR OF GEORGE HAGO PIAN,  CHAMPION OF VETER ANS  HON. DAN ROSTENKOWSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 3, 1989  ",1989
331,,101,-0.39,1356,16,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Sp.eaker, I rise to  address the House on a matter of great sad ness  for me-the passing of the Honorable  George Hagopian, alderman of the city of Chi cago and champion of the veteran, at age 68,  on September 1, 1989.  George Hagopian was a man of the highest  principles and  the deepest commitment. He  was also one of the kindest men I have ever  met.  I must have had hundreds of conversations  and meetings with George. Yet,  there is one  incident which I will always think of first in re membering of him. One of my daughters was  suffering a grave  illness, and  I was worried  sick. George went out of his way to track me  down. He offered  the simple comfort of his  spirituality and he asked what he could do for  me.  The call had the most remarkable effect on  me.  It lifted me up when  I needed  it most.  That one phone call captures what George  Hagopian meant to me and I will never forget  him.  As a dedicated elected official, George dis tinguished himself  in many good causes on  behalf of the people and businesses of his  Northwest Side 30th Ward. However, George  October 3, 1989  reserved his most passionate work for a con stituency which stretched far beyond his ward  lines-the veteran.  It can truly be said that George yielded to  no one in the protection and promotion of the  interests of  those who served our country,  and their families.  He proposed the Chicago City Council Com mittee on Veterans Affairs, fought for its cre ation, and served with distinction as  its first  chairman. A veteran himself, he threw himself  into the championship of causes and positions  backed by his wartime peers. Sometimes this  embroiled him in raging controversies, such as  the question of the use of the American flag in  artistic and political expression. His devout pa triotism was never more forcefully displayed,  nor with greater effect.  George also had a deeply spiritual side. His  study of the Bible and biblical history was con tagious, resulting in a regular study group in volving a number of aldermen and other local  leaders. He was honored by his colleagues by  being asked  to deliver the  invocation at city  council meetings. George took that responsi bility very seriously, and did it beautifully.  His devotion to things spiritual was matched  by his pride in his ethnic heritage. Born of Ar menian  immigrants, George never  forgot his  roots. Nor would he let others forget the tragic  events which fell upon his people at the turn  of  the century. His  faithfulness  to  the  task  made him my chief adviser on  that  terrible  event. I am sure that he also helped a great  many others to guard against the horrors of  genocide  in any  form.  In  that way, George  was protecting the past and the future.  George's commitments to God and  to the  Armenian people found common ground in his  generous involvement in St. Gregory the Illu minator Armenian Apostolic Church, at Nor mandy and Diversey  in Chicago.  In  fact, he  donated the very land on which it was built, al though he was hardly a wealthy man. He kept  all of his friends fully aware of the doings at  the  church,  and many  visited  there with  George.  In sum, Mr. Speaker,  this was a fine man  and I am proud to have called him my friend.  He will be terribly missed by his family, his col leagues, his constituency, and his city. My  sympathy and  that of my entire  family goes  out to his children, his grandchildren, and all  who loved him.  I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to  put this tribute to Alderman George Hagopian  into the permanent RECORD of the House. He  deserved to be so remembered.  LONG  BEACH  ORED  FOR  ACHIEVEMENT  TRANSIT  HON OUTSTANDING  HON. GLENN M. ANDERSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 3, 1989  ",1989

The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog nizes the gentleman from Texas [Mr.  ARCHER].  ",1989
334,House,101,-0.378,1447,16,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, it has been said here  by my  distinguished  friend  from  Texas, ""Repeal the surtax."" That is  going to happen anyway.  There was a problem with the fi nancing of catastrophic. The surtax  hit middle-income taxpayers and sen iors too heavily. The answer was to fix  that, not to fracture the whole pro gram.  What we  are  seeing here,  I  am  afraid,  is a paralysis in government.  Last week,  in  terms of  the capital  gains tax, we had paralysis by polar ization. This week on catastrophic we  have a different form of paralysis. It is  government by default, a government  by passiveness.  In  terms of Congress, we are  re sponding  to misinformation, and we  are responding to pressure. In terms of  the President, where is he? he is the  invisible executive. Instead of a bully  pulpit, we have an empty chair.  Some  are  saying,  and my distin guished colleague from Texas has said  so, ""Let us take another look,"" but I  do  not  think  that  is what  repeal  means. Repeal means a continuation  of the old problem. Repeal is not reex amination by Members of this body. It  is retreat.  0 1230  Is it likely that as the budget crisis  worsens and an election nears we are  going to act on thorny health issues?  Will failure to meet any part of a $10  billion need as in this program truly  enhance the chances to tackle a $50  billion program?  Full home and nursing care.  Is  it  likely  that  the  repeal of any  sem blance of relating benefits to income  will enhance the chances of a broad  attack on this problem? Not at all. Not  at all.  '  In a word, repeal is not reexamina tion, it is going to be retreat.  Let me add, what might seem like a  popular vote today is going to appear  less and less appealing as the popula tion ages and Washington equivocates.  ",1989
335,House,101,-0.192,1460,16,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Chairman, first I  would like to take this opportunity to  thank the chairman of the committee,  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ros TENKOWSKI]  for  doing  all  that he  could over the last several months to  reach a compromise on this piece of  legislation. He has given us opportuni ty in the committee, votes in the com mittee to deal with it, but there was  just no way to fix this bill. It is unfair  and it deserves to be repealed. It was  created with the best of  intentions,  but with an onerous funding mecha nism imposed on us by the President.  Health care coverage  is a problem  that faces not only senior citizens, but  every citizen in our country. We have  the most  sophisticated health  care  system in the world, but the accessibil ity to our great health care system is a  disgrace.  We spend more on health care than  any other industrialized nation, yet 37  million Americans  are uninsured, 7  million of whom are children. How can  it be that we spend 11.2 percent of our  GNP on health care and still have so  many Americans uninsured and under insured; when Canada, spending 8.6  percent of their GNP, and England,  spending  just  6.1  percent of  their  GNP, provide quality health care to  all of their citizens? It is because we  insist on dealing with health care in a  piecemeal  fashion. As a  result, our  health care system is needlessly com plex, incredibly expensive, and fails to  meet the needs of large numbers of  our citizens. A  recent  report shows  that 25 percent of the money we spend  on health care is wasted, thrown down  the drain. The health care system in  the United States needs  to be  re formed. This reform should have as its  goal universal access to health care for  every citizen.  We should make the same commit ment to health care that we made to  putting a man on the Moon and devel oping  a  national  highway  system.  Until we make universal health care a  national priority, we will continue to  have a health care system that the  young  cannot  afford,  that  the old  cannot  afford,  and  that  the  poor  cannot afford.  I appeal to every citizen in America,  both young and old,  to make a com mitment to urge our leaders to start  down the road  to establishing a na tional health care system. We should  demand that of our leaders. We should  send our postcards, send our letters,  call our Representatives, call our Sen ators and call the President, tell them  we want universal health care cover age and we deserve no less.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  today  to make  this  commitment.  Repeal the Catastrophic Health Care  Program.  Vote  for  the Donnelly Russo-Archer amendment and begin  today the debate to establish a univer sal health care system that delivers  the best quality health care to all citi zens at an affordable cost. To do less  would be a national disgrace.  ",1989
336,House,101,0.238,1460,16,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  to ex press my  support  for  the  amendment  to  repeal  the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage  Act.  The time has come to wipe the slate clean,  and  to come  to grips with  the  fact  that this  program-despite its good  intentions-is fun damentally flawed.  Not to mince words, our older constituents  are vivid about the cost of this program, and  the prospect of paying a surtax up to $800 in  the first year.  But, Mr. Chairman,  it goes beyond  that.  They also see a future of uncontrolled, esca lating costs for a program that does not even  begin  to deal with  their most pressing con cern-long-term health care.  Earlier this year,  I wanted  to  find out just  how strong  the sentiment against  the Catastrophic Care Program was. I circulated an in formal survey in my congressional district.  Thousands of  responses poured  into my  office, and no less than 96 percent emphati cally said  this health care program was not  what they wanted.  Mind you, this was before the Congression al Budget Office issued  its report saying  the  program was bankrupt before  it has barely  begun.  It would be an exercise  in  futility  to  stand here today and try to justify a program  which will run $9 billion in the red in the first 5  years alone.  The decision at this point is clear. Seniors  say ""the cat must go,"" and they are right.  I  urge my colleagues  to support  this  repeal  amendment. And  I urge  them  to make  this  repeal measure stick by rejecting  the reform  amendment which will follow.  I can understand and appreciate the fine in tentions of my colleagues who wish to retain  the drug benefit, and  in doing so, salvage  some remnants of the Catastrophic Care Pro gram. But now is not the time to be jumping  for a quick fix.  Again, we must wipe  the slate clean, and  we  should  reopen  the whole  health  care  debate. We should be moving  toward  long term, nursing home-type care. That  is what  our seniors want, and that's what they need.  ",1989

339,House,101,0.233,1460,16,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in opposition  to  the Donnelly Archer amendment to repeal the Med icare Catastrophic Coverage Act. I ap preciate  that my colleagues do not  offer this significant change lightly.  However,  I  take  issue with argu ments made by some in this Chamber  that the public is only interested in  outright repeal. Repeal may appear at tractive today, but in the not too dis tant  future, Members may  regret  taking such unprecedented action.  Mr. Chairman, as one of the framers  of the Medicare catastrophic legisla tion, I thought we got it right the first  time. Two years of thoughtful delib eration and hard work went into devel oping the program. Both the House  and the Senate passed the measure by  large majorities, and the Reagan ad ministration embraced the effort.  While there certainly are valid rea sons to oppose the current law, from  ",1989
340,House,101,0.33,1473,16,Mr. BUECHNER.," Mr. Chairman, over 1 year  ago I was visited by the lobbyist for one of our  Nation's most powerful senior citizens groups.  He demanded  I support the Medicare Cata strophic Coverage Act. I expressed to him my  serious concerns with the bill. He said he felt  it was  in  the best  interest of our Nation's  senior citizens and  likened  their bill  to be a  train coming down the track and that I could  either support them or be left at the station.  My reply was  I think  I'll just step aside and  listen for the crash.  Well, Mr. Chairman, the crash has occurred  and Congress is being called upon to clean up  the mess it created. Only 1 year ago, the Cat astrophic Coverage Act was hailed as a major  advancement for long-term health care for our  senior citizens.  I had serious problems with  the bill and was one of 72 Members who  voted against it.  Two overriding  factors guided my vote. At  town meetings  in my district senior citizens  called upon Congress to address their prime  concern of long-term care cost.  I heard their  voices and decided the present catastrophic  package did not meet  the criteria  they set  forth.  Now,  in a true catastrophic care package  the  long-term needs of our Nation's elderly  population would be directly addressed and  not simply swept over with a ""free-for-all ben efit expansion"" of the present system. Unfor tunately, the present catastrophic  law was a  generous benefit expansion which obviously  did not resolve the long-term care dilemma. In  fact, the package has actually harmed seniors  by way of prohibitive, duplicative costs and in  absence of true long-term care benefits.  The Stark-Waxman  revision of  the cata strophic law is not the answer. The amend ment may seem to retain some long-term ben efits, when,  in  fact,  there  is no meaningful  long  term  custodial  care  feature  in  this  amendment or under current law. The home  health coverage and hospice benefits  it re tains are associated with acute care, not long  term custodial care.  29-059 0-90-47 (Pt. 16)  Even the Ways and Means revision of the  Catastrophic Health Care Act bill does not ad dress  the problem.  It does not address  the  concerns of seniors who do not want to dupli cate catastrophic benefits  that are already  available through supplemental insurance poli cies. Further, the revision ties the catastrophic  benefits to part B of Medicare which amounts  to more of subliminal cohersion rather than a  true option.  Another factor in my decision not to support  the bill last year was that most of the senior  population who shoulder  the costs  for  this  massive Federal program are older Americans  who were already covered with some form of  private  insurance. The ""catastrophic""  financ ing provision is not only unfair but carries with  it costs that will spiral out of control. In addi tion, the costs that will be picked up by Medi care adds one more obligation  to a system  that is already stretched to its limit.  The public outcry over the Catastrophic Pro gram  is deafening, and the voices calling for  repeal are getting louder. Our ""window of op portunity"" to provide a straightforward, acces sible, and cost-effective catastrophic package  that meets the needs of our aging population  closes with each passing day.  The same people who gave me the direc tive to get me on  the train that crashed are  back. This time they have a plane.  It's called  the Stark proposal. It provides the wrong ben efits at the wrong price. Let's ground it now  before it too crashes.  The cure  for  this ailing program  is quite  simple: Congress should  just  ""do  the  right  thing"" -repeal the current defective plan and  begin more deliberate work on a system truly  responsive to needs of our elderly Americans.  ",1989
341,House,101,0.419,1473,16,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Chairman, today we will  consider whether or not to repeal  the Medi care Catastrophic Coverage Act. Last year  ",1989
342,House,101,0.23,1486,16,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Chairman, I  take  this time to explain why I plan to vote  for  the  Stark-Gradison-Waxman  amendment.  Last year I vote for an  insurance  program designed to protect our Na tion's elderly from catastrophic costs  related to health care. Most people in  my district support the belief that we  need  catastrophic health  insurance  protection-and have since I was first  elected to Congress. That must have  been true in most districts, since Con gress passed the largest expansion of  Medicare benefits  to  the elderly  in  more than two decades.  Since  then,  I,  like all of us, have  been swamped with thousands of let ters from seniors who object to paying  the surtax for a variety of reasons.  Some have adequate coverage in pri vate plans and others like employees  of the State of Ohio have catastroph ic-type  coverage under State plans.  They were asked  to pay a  tax  for  something  from which  they cannot  benefit.  I understand how they feel  and, Mr. Chairman,  I  voted  for  a  repeal of  the surtax a  few minutes  ago.  I will now vote  for  the Stark Gradison-Waxman  amendment,  be cause to me it retains the concept of  catastrophic health care benefits. As  has been mentioned, it retains the pre scription drug benefit.  I know from  personal experience that the cost of  prescription drugs can be catastrophic  in the case of  long-term painful  ill nesses. This amendment retains mam mography screening. I am told by my  good friend, Dr. Arthur James, a lead ing cancer specialist,  that thousands  of women's lives can be saved through  periodic mammograms. This is reason  enough for me to vote for this amend ment.  It retains the new home health care  coverage, hospice, and in-home respite  care.  For a lot of people this is a vote for  merciful treatment of our elderly. It  retains  the  spousal  impoverishment  provision.  Most people who have contacted me  do not seem  to object  to  the $4 a  month increase in monthly premiums  to pay for these benefits. I feel the eq uities weigh  in favor of a  favorable  vote on this amendment.  ",1989

344,House,101,0.284,1512,16,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  let me  begin by thanking the gentleman from  Kansas  [Mr. SLATTERY]  for his com ments.  The last time I was in Nicaragua the  gentleman  from Kansas  [Mr.  SLAT TERY] and I were down there at the  same time, and I appreciate his com ments and his statements.  Second, I want to thank the gentle man from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY]  for  allowing the bill to come out and to  move.  This is a good package. It is a good  package. All of the Members  in the  body want peace. We are not talking  about sending AK-47's down to Nica ragua. We  are  not  talking  about  bombs. We  are  not  talking  about  mining the harbors. We are not talk ing about any kind of mines  that  young people could step on. We are  talking about the opportunity to pro mote democracy.  We have an opportunity  for  free  elections. As one speaker said, when  we look at all the resources the Sandi nistas have, when we met several years  ago with Cardinal Obando y Bravo  and  later with Mrs. Chamorro and  went back again to see the resources  the Sandinistas had, this helps with  regard to changing the process.  It worked in Poland. We are pushing  in this body the President to put more  money in Poland because we, both Re publicans and Democrats, do not think  he has done enough.  Well,  the same  thing would hold  true here. It worked in Chile. In Chile  and Poland it worked. Let us give it a  chance down in Nicaragua.  I would hope that we would have a  big strong vote. This is a bipartisan  issue. This is not a Republican issue  and it is not a Democrat issue. Hope fully we can come together in a spirit  of reconciliation to bring about democ racy down in Nicaragua. So I rise in  strong, strong support.  I thank the gentleman from Wiscon sin [Mr. OBEY] for allowing the pack age to come out. I  think the gentle man is a real statesman.  I thank the gentleman from Kansas  [Mr. SLATTERY] for his position. Hope fully my colleagues on both sides will  come together to do what I  think is  appropriate,  to help bring about de mocracy in Nicaragua.  ",1989

346,House,101,0.055,1525,16,Mr. SMITH of Vermont.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today in opposition to the Durbin amendment,  which would violate the provisions of the bi partisan compromise on United States aid for  the Nicaraguan elections.  I think we ought to recognize the distance  this administration and the Committee on Ap propriations have come in crafting a compro mise on election assistance  to Nicaragua.  This money is not covert;  it  is open, above  board aid given to balance the political playing  field, and thus to allow the Nicaraguan people  to choose their own destiny.  In the past few years we have seen a series  of countries experience  the  satisfaction of  self-determination for the first time. We have  the opportunity  today  to give  the people of  Nicaragua, who have suffered through an end less war aod an even  longer economic de pression, a fair choice next February. Let us  be farsighted enough to ensure that freedom  which has meant so much in Poland and else where. The National Endowment for Democra cy has given us confidence in the fairness of  elections  in Chile, Panama,  in  addition  to  Poland, and can do the same for Nicaragua.  I urge my colleagues  to vote against  the  Durbin amendment.  ",1989
347,,101,0.426,1551,16,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to draw the  attention of my colleagues to a very special  young person in my congressional district.  Frieda Dyson is a high school senior from  Harrisburg, PA, who was selected to represent  the State this week in Washington as a child  ambassador. Frieda, and other child ambassa dors from around the country are here to cele brate National Children's Day with a series of  events intended to call attention to the state  of our Nation's children. The ambassadors are  helping Congress  to  focus on  the positive  possibilities open to young Americans, as well  as to consider the pressing needs and prob lems facing our youth.  The ambassadors testified yesterday before  the Select Committee on Children, Youth, and  Families and  the Budget Committee Task  Force on Human Resources. Their unique in sight and experience was both moving and in spirational.  The testimony of my constituent, Frieda, fo cused on the importance of teens rising above  peer pressure to stay away from drugs. Frieda  knows a great deal about such inner strength.  She lived in foster homes for the first 8 years  of her life; yet Frieda has been able to over come  this difficult start. She  is president of  her senior class at the Harrisburg Academy,  she  tutors  disadvantaged  children  after  school, she aspires to be a writer, and is an  articulate  spokesperson  on  saying  no  to  drugs. Needless to say, I am extremely proud  to have this young lady in the 17th Congres sional District.  I would like to take this opportunity to share  with my colleagues a segment of Frieda's tes timony from yesterday's hearing:  Children are malleable and  impression able. We are open to a lot of stresses and are  vulnerable, but the reverse is true too. We  are open to positive influences if they are  made available to us; we need adult influ ences that are positive. More environmental  emphasis needs to be focused on strengthen ing family units, stable homes and contin ued support will, over time, decrease drug  usage rates among my peers. For further  significant positive changes to occur there  needs to be communication and cooperation  between the youth of America and the lead ers-the educators and the parents.  In conclusion, only through joint efforts  on all levels and spheres of influence will  the situation brighten. We,  the youth of  America, are looking  to you,  the present  leaders, not necessarily for the answers to  the drug crisis, but  for your continued  pledged commitment to us. As it has been  said many  times-we are  the future and  even more so, we are the present. We need  your help and your concentrated efforts  here and now.  Mr. Speaker, it is when I have the privilege  of meeting young people like Frieda Dyson, I  become more certain than ever that America  is in good hands.

348,,101,0.554,1551,16,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to turn our attention to  an issue which is close to all of our hearts our Nation's children.  I am  inserting  into  the RECORD here  the  lyrics to a song written and produced by two  constituents of mine in Ocala, FL, which says  beautifully that it is our duty and responsibility  to care for and care about the children of the  world. Their rights to a future that is safe, free,  and healthy should be a priority to all of us,  and  I applaud the efforts of Robin MacBiane  and Larry Whitler to bring attention to this im portant goal. Their song  ""Stand Up  for  the  Children"" is a wonderful tribute to their com mitment, and I am proud to share it with you  today.

I want to congratulate the chair men of the full committee and sub committee, as well and  the  ranking  member of each of these committees,  for bringing this matter back before  the House. It does show that the proc ess is working.  The Subcommittee on Health has  worked hard and diligently trying to  come up with an agreeable formula  that would be acceptable to the thou sands and hundreds of thousands and  millions of seniors across this country  who have voiced  their opposition to  the present law.   In  the  full  committee we worked  hard. The gentleman from California  [Mr. STARK] brought to our attention  that the benefits are also going. Of  course, this is true. But, of course, the  tax  is  the  locomotive that pulls the  cars down the track. if you remove the  locomotive, the cars are useless stand ing there idly.  So  it  is  up  to  this Congress  to  remove all of  those  impediments  in  the  legislation  from  the books, and  perhaps this will have an opportunity  to start over. We have some great  minds that have  tried to work on a  compromise. Under the existing condi tions that compromise simply  is not  out there.  I do not believe any Member repre sents more seniors than I do in the  15th Congressional District of Florida.  Sometimes it is very difficult, but it is  an historic moment when Congress  gets up and says we voted for some thing that the people really did not  want, so now we are going to listen to  the people again, the people that we  represent, the people that sent us here  to Washington,  to voice  their view.  They are singing out very  loud and  strong, repeal catastrophic.  This is not going to be the end of the  line. We will continue to talk about  the health needs of the elderly. This is  something that is very much on the  minds of all of the members of the  Committee on Ways and Means.

353,House,101,-0.361,163,20,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Chairman, as an original  cosponsor of H.R. 1465 and a member of the  Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee,  I  rise  in strong support of the Comprehensive  Oil Pollution Prevention, Response, Liability,  and Compensation Act of 1989. The enact ment of a comprehensive Federal oilspill pre vention and cleanup regime  is  long overdue,  and I encourage my colleagues to support this  worthwhile legislation.  This body has repeatedly worked for the en actment of such legislation during the past 15  years. The measure before us today is a cul mination of those efforts. As a result, this bill  has a stronger and more comprehensive ap proach  for addressing  the aftermath  of a  tragic oilspill. The bill also seeks to take those  actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of  such spills. The bill will put  in place  those  mechanisms which will help prevent oilspills  from occurring, train personnel and ensure the  proper equipment  is  in place  to  respond  to  any spills that do occur, provide for the clean up of oil spills, and compensate those parties  who are injured by spills.  Mr. Chairman,  this  is a good bill; a strong  bill. While we can never guarantee an oilspill  of  the devastating magnitude of  the Exxon  Valdez will not occur  in  the  future, we can  take those steps necessary to attempt to pre vent such spills and ensure  the  financing  is  available to pay for the cleanup and compen sate the victims of a major spill. The legisla tion we are considering will accomplish these  worthwhile goals.  Mr. Chairman, I congratulate  the chairman  and ranking member of the Merchant Marine  and Fisheries Committee, Mr. JONES of North  Carolina and Mr. DAVIS,  the chairman of the  Coast Guard Subcommittee, Mr. TAUZIN,  the  chairman and  ranking member of  the Public  Works and Transportation Committee, Mr. AN DERSON and Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT, and my  good friend and colleague from New York, Mr.  NOWAK, the chairman of the Water Resources  Subcommittee, and the ranking member of the  subcommittee, Mr. STANGELAND,  for their ef forts  in bringing  this measure  to  the  floor.  Again,  I urge my colleagues  to support  this  landmark piece of legislation.  ",1989
354,House,101,0.325,163,20,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of the Miller-Studds amend ment to H.R. 1465, the Oil Pollution, Preven tion, Response, Liability, and Compensation  Act of 1989, to protect the rights of States to  maintain their own oilspill response standards.  Earlier this year, it was the damage to Alas ka's environment caused by the Exxon Valdez  that shocked our Nation and gave this body a  renewed  incentive  for action. Twenty years  ago  it was  the Delian Apo/Ion which  ran  aground  in Tampa Bay  leaving behind a 20square-mile oil slick  that spurred  the Florida  State Legislation  into adopting what remains  today our Nation's toughest oilspill standards.  The legislation we have under consideration  this week would  establish  important,  long  overdue,  new  Federal  standards  requiring  emergency  response plans  in  the event of  tragic oilspills such as the one we witnessed  in Alaska. It also would clarify the responsibil ities and liabilities of tanker owners and ship pers in the event of a spill.  As  reported by  the committee, however,  H.R. 1465 significantly undermines the author ity of States to maintain their own more strin gent Federal oilspill  response standards and  liability requirements. States such as Florida,  which has been a national leader in the enact ment  of  legislation  to  protect  our  fragile  marine environment and  resources  from oil spills and other accidents at sea, should not  be penalized for their efforts to establish em nergency response plans and funds.  As  a  former Florida State Senator and  author of our State's Oil Spill Prevention and  Containment Act, I strongly support the Miller Studds amendment to preserve these  impor tant States rights in this area. The 1970 legis lation which  I drafted was the first of its kind  in our Nation and became a model used by  other States  in establishing  their own oilspill  response programs and standards.  The Florida State Legislature's overwhelm ing support for my legislation was the result of  our experience  in February 1970 when  the  Delian Apo/Ion  ran aground  in Tampa Bay,  spilling more than 10,000 gallons of crude oil.  I remember  the helpless  feeling of standing  on  the shoreline as  the oil spead  into a 20square-mile slick. No containment or cleanup  equipment was available anywhere in the area  and there was no preplanned strategy to stop  the spread of oil. This  lack of preparedness  caused the death of thousands of birds, fish,  and other wildlife, damaged and destroyed  many boats, and covered our beautiful sandy  white beaches with tar balls.  Within 4 months of that accident, our State  did something to prevent future damage to our  environment by enacting tough oilspill legisla tion  that was eventually upheld unanimously  by .the U.S. Supreme Court. The  intent and  scope of this legislation included many of the  same provisions that we have under consider ation in H.R. 1465. As with this legislation, the  Florida law established an oilspill trust fund to  pay for cleanup costs associated with oilspills,  required  oilspill  containment  and  cleanup  equipment to be available in case of a spill,  and provided penalties for those responsible  for oil spills. We also established in Florida 11  district response teams to be ready and avail able  to assess damage and  initiate cleanup  activities  in  the event of a spill anywhere  in  the State. A similar response team program is  included in the legislation before us today.  The damage to Alaska's wildlife and envi ronment in Prince William Sound is a stark re minder of the destruction a major oilspill can  leave behind, especially when emergency re sponse efforts are  limited by a  lack of pre paredness. Just 2 weeks ago  in Florida, we  endured  two near cataclysmic shipping acci dents within a 5-day period. Although  there  was no major loss of oil or other cargo in the  water,  the grounding of  these  two  tankers  caused  irreparable  damage  to  the  unique  coral reefs in the Key West area. Thousands  of square  feet of coral  that  took more  than  100 years  to grow, was destroyed  in  these  two accidents. One can only wonder about  the magnitude of damage  that would have  ",1989
355,,101,-0.172,215,20,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  make the Members of the House aware of the  unique accomplishments of two Missourians Mrs. William H. Weldon of Jefferson City and  her horse Will Shriver. Recently,  they were  both inducted into the St. Louis National Char ity Horse Hall of Fame, and Will was the first  horse ever to receive this prestigious honor.  Mr. Speaker, this tribute was a fitting culmi nation to the storied career of Will Shriver, the  leading sire of American Saddlebreds and the  greatest gaited horse ever to enter the ring. It  was also a tribute to the patience and sound  judgment of Mrs. Weldon who saw champion ship potential in Will Shriver when others had  their doubts.  Will Shriver's career has been a story of  courage and perseverance because success  did not come quickly or easily to this horse. In  both 197 4 and 1975, he qualified to compete  in  the grand championship class at the Ken tucky State Fair-the ""Super Bowl"" of horse  show competitions. In both years, however, ill ness and injury robbed him of the chance to  contend for the title. To a lesser horse, these  would have been career-ending setbacks. But  not to Will Shriver. Under the guidance of Mrs.  Weldon, he fought back from his injuries and  claimed  the grand champion title  in 1976 at  the age of 10. He was the first Missouri horse  to claim top honors in 35 years. Mrs. Weldon  retired Will after his triumph and started him  on a second career  that  led  to his being  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  named the No. 1 sire in the country in 1985,  and in each succeeding year.  Mr. Speaker,  I know all of my colleagues  will  join me  in congratulating Mrs. William H.  Weldon and her horse Will Shriver on receiv ing his much deserved recognition.  THE PETER J.

Dedication cere monies were  c.onducted as  the community  opened the Peter J. O'Neill, Sr. Memorial Li brary in memory of Peter J. O'Neill.  Long a resident of Freehold, NY, Mr. O'Neill  was an active and admired member of  the  community. He had served as past president  of  the Greenville  Irish American Club,  a  member of the Knights of Columbus, and a  member of our Lady of Knock Council 6439.  This library is a fitting tribute to his memory.  It will be housed at  the  Irish Cultural and  Sports Center, where renovations are now un derway. The goal is to create a warm, pleas ant atmosphere where people may come and  browse  through materials on  Irish and  Irish American subjects. The reference center will  include not only books, but newspapers, mag azines, children's books and videotapes.  I know I join the family and many friends of  Peter O'Neill in congratulating the Irish Sports  and Cultural Center on  the establishment of  this memorial  library.  It will be a significant  part of the community, and I look forward to  its contributions  in  the preservation of  Irish  culture.  TRIBUTE TO EDUCATION  COMMISSIONER BETTY CASTOR  HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 8, 1989  Mrs. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased  to announce  that Florida Education  Commissioner Betty Castor will be given an  award by the Mental Health Association, Flori- .  da division,  for her continued support and  work on mental health, alcohol, and  drug  abuse programs. The first woman ever elect ed to the Florida Cabinet, Education Commis sioner Betty Castor  is widely  recognized as  the State's leading advocate for education.  She has earned that recognition. Ever since  she received a degree in education, Commis sioner Castor has worked  tirelessly  as  a  teacher,  civic  leader,  county commissioner,  State Senator and  top-level administrator  to  promote excellence  in Florida's educational  system.  Her  first  teaching  assignment  was  in  Uganda, East Africa. Then  she  taught at  Holmes Elementary School  in Dade County  and went on to get a master's degree in edu cation from the University of Miami. She later  28039  was elected to the Hillsborough County board  of commissioners and worked as director of  governmental  relations  for  the University of  South Florida. During  three terms as a State  Senator,  she  distinguished  herself  as  an  expert on the education budget, receiving nu merous awards for her innovation and leader ship.  In her first year  in office, she has reorga nized  the department of education,  trying  to  make it more responsive to the needs of dis tricts, teachers, communities and most of all,  the students. She emphasizes successful pro grams, business partnerships, professionalism  in teaching and preparing students for today's  competitive world marketplace.  Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to congratulate Com missioner Castor for her award and hope that  she continues  to promote good programs in  Florida.  A SALUTE TO ZONTA  INTERNATIONAL  HON. CONSTANCE A.

364,House,101,-0.398,462,20,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, many years  ago, U.S. banks were,  in many places across  the country, the initial force in encouraging the  Nation's  school  children  to  save money.  Banks would set up small,  temporary offices  in grammer and junior high schools where the  children, each week, could bring their dimes,  nickels and pennies to be deposited  in  their  own savings account. They would have their  own bank book. Some children saved part of  their allowance; others their lunch money. In  the early grades, teachers would do  the pa perwork;  later, they would supervise the chil dren who did the work.  Mr. Speaker, these programs were a won derful and simple way for the children, espe cially those living in the inner city, to be able  to learn a phenomena they had never heard  of or seen. One must  remember  that  there  was no  television  in  those days.  If  it didn't  happen in a child's neighborhood or in school,  the pupil would be unlikely to experience such  an event.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another most likely the costs involved-such programs  went the way of the 5-cent trolley car ride, the  10-cent bottle of soda pop and  the 15-cent .  movie.  Recently, I read two newspaper stories that  reminded me of those earlier days.  First, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,  speaking  to some 600 bankers  in Towson,  MD, a Baltimore suburb, asked them for their  help  in getting Am~ricans to save more of  their money. He said the annual savings rate  has  been  declining  every  year  since  the  1970's thus  raising questions about  the Na tion;s ability to invest and grow.  Because Asians and Europeans save more  of their earnings, Brady said,  interest rates in  those countries are  lower and  foreign busi nesses find it cheaper to borrow for their ex pansions.  He  said  American  businesses  cannot pay more  than  their competition  for  capital, which is a basic input, and come out  ahead in the global marketplace.  Mr. Speaker, the second story was about a  program sponsored by Riggs National Bank of  Washington to teach 10-and 11-year-old stu dents at an  inner city school about banking.  The Washington Times reported that through  a partnership Riggs  has  formed with  the  Walker-Jones Elementary School, a special  ""bank""  has  been  set  up  on  the  school  grounds that will enable fifth and sixth grade  school students to open a regular savings ac count for 1 O cents. Students can earn 5 per cent  interest on any money deposited until  May 31.  Students, under the guidance of Riggs vol unteers, also will  learn  the  fundamentals of  running a bank by serving in such positions as  teller, accountant, president and chairman of  the board. Riggs will also train parents, many  of whom do not have bank accounts or basic  take  consumer  skills.  In addition,  they will  Walker-Jones students on field trips.  Mr. Speaker,  there  is an expression we  often hear: What goes around, comes around.  The Riggs program  is not new. Such bank  sponsorships were being held 50 years ago, if  not  longer. They were successful  then and  could be successful again. The Nation's econ omy will become strong and able  to grow  when citizens learn the discipline of saving as  young students and continue the regimen as  grown-ups.  The Riggs program, as one official said,  an investment in the future.  is  ABORTION AND ITS IMPACT ON  THE CURRENT AMERICAN PO LITICAL PROCESS  ",1989
365,House,101,0.49,462,20,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Mr.  Speaker, the tradition as we all know  in this House for a special order, par ticularly if it goes beyond 5 minutes, is  to take the well of the House and use  one of the lecturns down there. I have  so much material that I want to refer  to, I would like to opt for the privilege  to take that special order here from  the leadership desk.  Mr. Speaker, I hesitate using an oxy moron here, but it is the only way I  can  express  the  feelings  by  some  people in this House in trying to ana lyze  the  issue  of  abortion  and  its  impact on the current American politi cal process. But the oxymoron  is, a  mild panic seems to have set in. It in volves my side of the aisle, maybe a  few Members on the other side, who  prior to this fall or summer had been  proud to describe  themselves as pro life  candidates,  anti-abortion  candi dates. Now they seem to have hit a  panic button, and  there  is nothing  quite so shaky as a politician who feels  the ground beginning to move under  his feet.  When John F. Kennedy, our young est elected President, wrote his book  before he  came  to  the Presidency  called  Profiles  in  Courage, which  helped him get there and for which he  won  a Pulitzer Prize,  the  title was  simply to describe elected officials, not  just in the United States, that would  take a stand that was unpopular with  the constituency that elected them.  D 1820  Mr. Speaker, the example that sticks  in my mind is the distinguished gentle man  from  the other body, Senator  Robert Taft of Ohio, who  took  the  highly unpopular position after  the  Second World War that he thought  war crimes trials of Nazi killers was  wrong on its face because the law set ting up the trials were passed after the  crimes were committed.

367,House,101,-0.304,670,20,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, as a cochair man of the international narcotics control task  force,  I want to commend Chairman F ASCELL  and Representative LARRY SMITH, chairman of  the task force, for their leadership in bringing  this bill to fruition. I would reiterate that much  of the bill consists of the provisions we ap proved in the foreign aid bill. I would  like to  take a minute to highlight a few parts and to  add my observations on where we stand  in  the drug fight.  First,  the bill  responds  to Secretary Ben nett's  request.  It provides authorizing  lan guage  for  the $125 million Andean  initiative  along with  the  requested waivers.  I would  point out  that  the waiver on aid  to police  forces applies only to the three Andean coun tries, only for those units that are organized  for the specific purpose of narcotics enforce ment, and only for the next fiscal year.  Second, the bill contains human rights lan guage and other reporting  requirements  that  will ensure that Congress is notified about the  type and value of assistance provided; which  units will receive assistance; and an explana tion of how  this aid meets our antinarcotics  objectives.  While I support this bill, I must say that I am  disappointed by the absence of economic as sistance and  the failure of the administration  to come up and fight for more economic aid.  The administration's rationale is that first we  must assist these countries  in  reestablishing  control  of  those  areas  dominated  by  the  cartel-then we can provide economic assist ance.  But our efforts on the enforcement side will  be seriously hampered unless  these nations  see that the United States is able to provide  tangible economic assistance  to  their coun tries. Our experience tells us that cooca farm ers will continue growing coca, even  in  the  face  of  increased  enforcement actions,  if  there are no realistic alternatives to the drug  trade. We have received assurances from the  administration that a more detailed plan, out lining a multiyear, $2 billion effort will be sub mitted  in February and  I  look  forward  to  seeing that plan.  The  task  force and committee have been  the vanguard  in  the House  in giving the ad ministration the tools it needs to fight the drug  war. This committee has been  there  in  the  past and it is this committee that will be sup porting that effort in the future. Our first step  is passing H.R. 3611.  ",1989
368,House,101,-0.514,709,20,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself as much time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker,  today  I bring before  the House  the bill, H.R. 3046,  the  Copyright Royalty Tribunal and Mis cellaneous Pay Act of 1989.  At the outset, I would like to thank  the members of my subcommittee the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellec tual Property, and the Administration  of Justice-for helping to develop this  legislation. I would underline the ef forts of the ranking minority member  of the subcommittee,  the gentleman  from California CMr. MOORHEAD] and  the ranking minority member of the  full Committee,  the gentleman from  New York [Mr. FISH].  H.R. 3046, as amended, is a house keeping bill which,  in the  long run,  will  improve the functioning of four  important Government entities: Three  with  important  intellectual property  responsibilities and one in the criminal  justice arena. The proposed  legisla tion, the outgrowth of hearings held  by my subcommittee earlier this year,  seeks to assure that high level officials  at  the Copyright Royalty Tribunal,  the Copyright Office, the U.S. Parole  Commission, and the U.S. Patent and  Tradell)ark Office receive salaries con sistent with their counterparts in Gov ernment. H.R. 3046 also provides sev eral structural reforms for the Copy right Royalty Tribunal.  First. The Copyright Royalty Tribu nal: The Copyright Royalty Tribunal,  located  in  the  legislative branch of  Government, was created by the Copy right Revision Act of 1976. The pri mary functions of  the Tribunal are  first, the distribution of funds collect ed for cable and satellite transmitted  television signals and  for  jukeboxes  and second, the setting of rates for the  cable  and  jukebox  compulsory  li censes.  H.R. 3046  reduces  the number of  Commissioners on the Tribunal-from  five  to  three-provides  for  lapsed  terms so  that a Commissioner may  serve beyond the expiration of his or  her term, until a new Commissioner is  confirmed;  and  changes  the  salary  classification rates for members of the  Tribunal-from GS-18 of the General  Schedule to Executive Level V. In this  latter  regard, Executive Level V  is  equal to the entry level for Presiden tial  appointees  in  the  executive  branch.  When the Tribunal was created in  1976, GS-18 was the highest level for  Civil Service employees. Subsequently,  in 1978 Congress  revised  the super grade system, supplementing it with  the Senior Executive Service CSESl.  Since then almost all GS-18 positions  have been converted to SES. The GS18 position, which once numbered in  the thousands now number less than  80, mostly non-supervisory personnel  in the executive branch. Although the  pay levels for GS-18  is the same as  that of Executive Level V,  the Presi dent's Quadrennial Pay Commission  recommended revisions in the Execu tive Level salary schedule and not the  General Schedule. H.R. 3046 does not  therefore result in a pay increase for  the Commissioners of  the Tribunal  but it does pave the way if a pay raise  occurs for high-ranking individuals in  the congressional, executive and judi cial branches.  Second, the U.S. Copyright Office:  The U.S. Copyright Office, located in  the Library of Congress, is responsible  for administering  the copyright  law  and the semiconductor chip protection  law pursuant to title 17 of the United  States Code. The Copyright Office is  directed by the Register of Copyrights  and  several Associate Registers  of  Copyrights. The Office, being a part  of the Library, is located in the legisla tive branch and  is an excellent  re source for Members of Congress.  H.R. 3046 provides that the Register  is to be compensated at the rate of pay  in effect for Level IV of the Executive  Schedule,  treating the Register simi larly with the Commissioner of Pat ents and Trademarks. The bill also  provides  that the Librarian of Con gress shall appoint Associate Registers  of Copyrights in accordance with the  recommendations of  the Register of  Copyrights in accordance with the rec ommendations  of  the Register  of  Copyrights  to assist  in the perform ance of the Register's duties. The As sociate Registers shall be paid at a  rate  not  to  exceed  the maximum  annual rate of pay payable to GS-18  of the General Schedule. If the Li brary is reorganized at any time in the  future, the subcommittee will be con sulted and will,  in  turn, participate  constructively in the reorganization. A  reorganization might,  for  example,  convert General  Schedule  position  into SES positions, creating a situation  where  further  amendments  to  the  Copyright Office charter are neces sary.  Third,  the United  States Parole  Commission: The United States Parole  Commission is an independent agency  within the U.S. Department of Justice.  It currently is comprised of nine mem bers  appointed  by  the  President.  Among the Commissioners, the Presi dent designates one to serve as Chair.  Although the Parole Commission is  slated  for abolition  in 1992,  it still  serves a very important function for  inmates sentenced before 1987. There fore, H.R. 3046 transfers the Commis sioner positions from GS-18 to Execu tive Level V; it also makes the Chair of  the Parole Commission an Executive  Level IV.  The need to amend the Parole Com mission charter was originally brought  to my attention by  the gentleman  from Maryland CMr. HOYER], who de serves credit for this provision.  4.  U.S.  Patent  and  Trademark  Office: Finally, the Patent and Trade mark Office, within the U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, administers laws  relating to patents and trademarks to  promote the progress of science and  technology, to strengthen the national  economy, and to benefit the public in terest. H.R. 3046 upgrades three high ranking Presidential appointees-the  Deputy Commissioner,  the Assistant  Commissioner of Patents, and the As sistant Commissioner of Trademarks from the General Schedule to Execu tive Level V. Again, the rationale for  this change  is  the same as  for  the  Copyright  Royalty  Tribunal,  U.S.  Copyright Office and the Parole Com mission.  H.R. 3046 will not require additional  budgetary outlays. I am aware of no  opposition to the measure.  Given the current emphasis of this  country in a more effective criminal  justice system as well as improved in tellectual property laws, it makes emi nent good  sense  to  treat high-level  Government  employees-especially  those appointed by the President of  the United States-with  the  respect  that they deserve. As recently noted  by Paul Volcker,  in his capacity as  chairman of the National Commission  on  the Public Service:  the Federal  Government        is  increasingly  unable to attract, retain, and motivate  the kinds of people it will need to do  the essential work of the republic in  the years and decades ahead. H.R.  3046 is a short step in the right direc tion of solving this quiet crisis in Gov ernment. I am just thankful that the  four Government entities affected by  this legislation have, over the years,  been ably led by individuals devoted to  public service and have fulfilled their  legislative charters in a time of budg etary stress. The bill is in part a trib ute to their leadership, in part a mes sage to keep up the good work. The  Congress and this country need your  services.  I urge your support of this impor tant piece of legislation.  ",1989

371,House,101,-0.242,722,20,Mr. ECKART.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  crisis for which we are here today on  the floor involving its demonstration  in our communities  in  the form of  drug abuse and substance abuse obvi ously needs the full attention of this  Nation and the Congress. There are a  few people for whom they do not have  any choice as to whether or not to ad dress it however. Among those are pre hospital emergency medical personnel  who find themselves, like many in the  counseling community and the medi cal community, on the front  line of  this war. Provisions in this legislation,  which  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  CMr. MADIGAN]  and  the  gentleman  from California CMr. WAXMAN] have so  graciously consented to include, pro vide for an appropriate training regi men for prehospital emergency medi cal professionals to obtain the kind of  training and curriculum that will help  them to come to grips with this power ful new force in our community. We  have discovered in several new major  communities across this Nation a new  phenomenon,  and  that  is  physical  abuse of emergency medical personnel  when they come to try to assist an in dividual who  is  involved in drugs or  substance  abuse. The provisions of  this legislation go a long way toward  helping  these  front-line  emergency  medical professionals deal with  this  new crisis in a meaningful and respon sible new way, and I am grateful for  this assistance to these individuals.

374,House,101,-0.41,735,20,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday I  chaired an  important conference on alterna tive fuels and  the environment at Arkansas  State University in Jonesboro, AR.  This  important meeting  focused  on  how  farmers in Arkansas and across America can  play a role in the coming transition to alterna tive motor fuels, which will clean America's air  and reduce the Nation's dependence on for eign oil.  It brought agricultural and business leaders  from Northeast Arkansas together with energy  and environmental experts  from  around  the  Nation,  including former Secretary of Energy  James Schlesinger, to discuss the potential of  fuel from the farm.  The conference was  judged  to be a suc cess, and I will share more about it with my  colleagues at a future time.  Unfortunately, because of my attendance at  the conference I was absent from the House  for rollcalls 346 and 34 7.  Rollcall 346 was on passage on H.R. 3614,  the  drug-free  schools  and  communities  amendments, and rollcall 34 7 was on passage  of H.R.  the Drug Forfeiture Amend ments Act. Had I been present, I would have  voted for both measures.  H.R.  3614 would  direct  nearly  all  new  money above the fiscal year 1989 level for the  Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program  to local school districts.  It would also require  schools and  institutions of higher education  receiving Federal funds  to adopt a drug-free  school policy, and would create a program to  assist children of substance abusers.  H.R. 3550 would extend the  important au thority for transfer of up to $150 million a year  from  the asset forfeiture fund  in  the Depart ment Qf Justice to the special forfeiture fund  under control of  the drug czar.  In  return,  it  would require Secretary Bennett to designate  certain  high-intensity  drug  trafficking  areas  under the authority of the 1988 drug  law not  later than February 1, 1990. H.R. 3550 would  also clarify the relationship between Federal  and State forfeiture law.  Both of  these bills will provide continued  support of the troops in the war on drugs, and  I support them wholeheartedly.  3550,  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  ",1989

378,House,101,0.312,943,20,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, I think this  is very simple, and need not take a lot  of time on this issue.  It seems to me if Members want to  support the United Nations which sup ports a program, or manages a pro gram of coerced abortion or  forced  sterilization,  then vote no on  this.  Then Members will end up supporting  the U.N. population fund, which,  in  turn, supports the Chinese program.  On the other hand, if Members are  off ended by the Chinese program of  coercion, then do not help the United  Nations which  does  not  take  our  money and give it to China, but takes  some of its own money. Any agency  that supports or encourages or facili tates  coerced  sterilization,  coerced  abortion, ought to be anathema.  However,  if Members want to sup port that, go right ahead. This  is a  clear opportunity to say all this money  goes for family planning, but so long  as the Chinese program is supported  by  the United Nations, we  are not  going to support the United Nations.  It is that simple. Family planning is  supported all over the world, but not  through the United Nations, so long as  the United Nations supports the Chi nese program. It is that simple. Not  convoluted at all.  I hope Members will vote yes on this  amendment.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Wis consin [Mr. MOODY].  ",1989
379,House,101,-0.161,982,20,Mr. COOPER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 1602, the Trauma Care Systems Plan ning and Development Act. This bill should go  a  long way  toward addressing our serious  public health problem of injury.  I'm especially pleased  that during commit tee consideration of  this  legislation, several  changes were made that should improve the  effectiveness of this legislation in rural areas.  This  is especially important because 70 per cent of highway deaths occur in rural areas,  and studies show you're twice as likely to die  from a bad accident in a rural area than if you  had that same accident in the city.  These alarming statistics can be explained  in part by the great distances and sometimes  rugged terrain in rural areas. But it's not just  geography-it's the EMS  infrastructure  itself  that's causing the trouble.  When Federal funds dried up at the begin ning of this decade, many rural areas did not  have  the  resources  to  fill  in.  Instead,  they  depend on bake sales and  raffles  to  raise  funds.  In  the worst cases,  they don't even  have an ambulance. That's the case  in one  county in my district. If you're lucky, there'll be  a pickup truck to take you  to the hospital in  the next county. For  these  kinds of  rural  areas,  it's unrealistic to expect that on  their  own,  they could  implement  the  triage and  transport policies required by H.R. 1602.  Rural  trauma  care-like all  rural  health  care-needs help. The bill before us today in cludes an amendment I offered in the Energy  and Commerce Committee. It set aside $5 mil lion for rural EMS research and demonstration  projects in communications technology, model  curricula, making EMS courses more available  to folks in rural areas, and promoting the re gional pooling of resources, especially trans portation equipment.  This is a modsst but important first step in  addressing the serious problems of rural EMS.  It should help get us the information we need  to improve rural  trauma care.  I urge my col leagues to support H.R. 1602.  ",1989

382,House,101,0.413,1008,20,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 1, and  I urge my colleagues to vote  in  favor of this important reform legislation.  I particularly want to congratulate Secretary  Jack Kemp for his dedication to restoring  in tegrity to HUD and placing it above reproach. I  am sure that his first 1 O months at HUD have  seen him focus on a different agenda than he  had planned. But  internal  reforms must be  made before new authorizations and reauthor izations take place. It would make no sense to  authorize more of the same without knowing  what works and what doesn't; where  fraud  and abuse is and where it isn't.  At the same  time, we must recognize  that  the goal of creating more affordable housing  alternatives for the American people is both a  challenge and a goal that must be addressed  upon completion of this reform package.  Mr. Speaker, over  the  last  two decades,  American  taxpayers  from  coast  to  coast,  border  to border, have paid  taxes  to help  house  families who could not afford decent  shelter otherwise; to help rebuild communities  and neighborhoods that were slowly crumbling  away; and to help expand homeownership op portunities  to all who were willing  to work  toward  that dream. But  instead. of helping  people at the end of the line, many of those  tax dollars went to pad the bottom lines of un scrupulous developers, investors, and consult ants.  Our job today, then, is to restore the confi dence of the public by closing  the doors of  unethical influence peddlers and opening the  door, again, for those who need our help.  The  legislative package before us contains  over 50 specific  legislative changes  that re place business as usual with good business  practices. Under  this  reform  package,  our  housing and community development dollars  will be allocated using formulas that determine  what people need  rather  than who people  know. The bill establishes strict standards of  conduct  for people working at HUD and  for  people outside the Government who want to  influence them. H.R. 1 enacts civil penalties and  in  some  cases  criminal  penalties-to  punish misconduct and to deter those who are  tempted to challenge these reforms. The bill  tightens evaluation and monitoring procedures  for all of HUD's programs and restores control  and accountability to the FHA insurance fund.  In  short,  the HUD  reform package barri cades the avenues to abuse that have been  traveled far too often by too many people in  past years, and lays the groundwork for a new  direction for housing in the years ahead.  There are one or two provisions in  the bill  that concern me, however, and  I would be  remiss  if  I did not mention one here-the  change in the Community Development Block  Grant Program. The CDBG Program has not  been  the subject of any scandal,  reports of  abuse, or any rumor of either.  Indeed, by al lowing the States and  local governments the  flexibility  to use  these  funds  in ways best  suited  to  their communities,  the CDBG Pro gram has been the source of some great suc cesses.  Mr. Speaker,  I  think we all want  to help  those who most need our assistance, but by  further  restricting  the  targetting provisions,  I  am concerned that many smaller entitlement  cities  and  nonentitlement  communities will  have difficulty qualifying for CDBG funds. As a  result, some extraordinarily good projects may  be  left at the wayside, and that troubles me.  I should also note  that Secretary Kemp  would like to refocus the CDBG Program into  strictly a poverty-fighting program. As I believe  this would be a significant change in thrust for  CDBG's, I .am pleased that the committee left  that question for next year when we consider  comprehensive housing  legislation. This will  give us the opportunity for hearings and more  analysis.  Mr. Speaker, a fine and dedicated group of  people were mobilized and motivated to bring  this  reform  package  to  fruition.  Secretary  Kemp and the honest, hardworking people at  HUD-at all  levels-deserve our  thanks  for  their candor, recommendations, and desire to  ",1989

386,,101,-0.502,1138,20,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I, along  with  Mr.  RINALDO,  the  ranking  minority  member of  the Subcommittee on Telecom munications and Finance, which  I chair; and  my  subcommittee  colleague  from  New  Mexico, Mr. RICHARDSON, am  introducing the  Securities Markets Stabilization Act of 1989  and  the Coordinated Clearance and Settle ment Act of 1989, both of which were unani mously approved this morning by the subcom mittee.  The Securities Markets Stabilization Act of  1989  represents  the  first  legislative  step  toward reform of the stock market in the after math of  the  frightening crashes of October  1987 and October 1989, events  that have  shaken  investor confidence  to  its very core.  This long-awaited and much-needed first step  comes after nearly 2 years of extensive con sideration of all the issues surrounding market  reform, a process that has included 12 hear ings by  this  subcommittee, 4  in  this year  alone;  in-depth expert analyses by the Brady  Commission, the Katzenbach Commission, the  Securities and Exchange Commission, and the  working group on financial markets; as well as  a further series of 6 SEC investigations of pro gram trading and other related issues initiated  in response to requests of this subcommittee.  November 14, 1989  first  introduced  comprehensive  market  reform legislation in the 1 OOth Congress, with  H.R. 4997. And earlier  this year, at  the  re quest of the Securities and Exchange Com mission, Chairman JOHN DINGELL and  I intro duced  similar  legislation, H.R.  1609,  the  ""Stock Market Reform Act of 1989.""  The Stabilization Act contains  four provi sions necessary to market reform: (1) a grant  to the SEC of authority to halt all trading in a  market emergency, (2) a directive to the SEC  to require large traders to report their transac tions, (3) a directive to the SEC to assess the  financial health of parents and affiliates of  broker/dealers, and (4) a grant of authority to  the SEC to constrain program trading. A fifth  provision would direct the Commission to fa cilitate coordinated clearing and  settlement  with other Government agencies. This provi sion stands alone  in  the coordinated clear ance and settlement committee print.  All these provisions have been the subject  of extensive negotiation with  the SEC and  Treasury, who strongly support moving  for ward on market  reform. The provisions we  have negotiated with the SEC and the securi ties industry on large trader reporting, risk as sessment and others are extremely valuable  from a market surveillance standpoint. In addi tion, the section concerning powers to prohibit  certain  trading practices addresses  the one  issue at  the  top of every  investors  list-the  habitual, excessive, and violent market volatili ty that has driven the individual investor out of  the stock market. This manufactured volatility  has turned Wall Street into the mean streets  of investing. It's as if we turned off all the Na tion's stop lights, made all speed limits volun tary, stopped filling the pot holes, or repairing  the bridges-and told the American public to  go  it alone. Such a  retreat  from common  sense would not be  tolerated  in any of our  hometowns, yet we are  treating Wall Street  with  the kind of appalling disregard that can  only  result  in  financial  disrepair.  For  this  reason,  the Securities Markets Stabilization  Act committee print includes a provision that  would authorize the SEC to suspend or con strain manipulative,  abusive,  or  disruptive  practices that feed volatility-such as program  trading-during times of excessive market vol atility.  Right now, we are faced with the tyranny of  our own ingenuity. Somewhere along the way  our regulators and our Government forgot the  fundamental notion that technology must exist  to serve, not suppress, human needs. Tech nology must continue to serve as an  instru ment to nurture our financial markets, markets  which were first established to serve the cap ital  raising needs of Amercia's corporations.  And technology must serve to allow individual  Americans  to  invest  in a piece of corporate  America. But since October 1987, I have re ceived numerous calls and letters from angry  investors who have withdrawn  their money  from the market because they find no security  in a stock market that behaves more like a yo yo than an orderly mechanism for buying and  selling shares in corporate America.  I do not believe  that Congress can  or  should  legislate up markets or down mar kets-what we should do is legislate fair mar kets. Right now we have unfair markets-mar",1989

391,House,101,-0.685,1216,20,Mr. DYMALLY.,"  While the Democrats and Republi cans have not always agreed on every  issue  relating  to  this  legislation,  in stances of disagreement  have been  rare and we have tried to work them  out in a spirit of cooperation. This is  the third time I have served as Repub lican manager of  the State Depart ment authorization bill, and Republi cans and Democrats have consistently  worked together in bipartisan coopera tion.  First and foremost, this conference  report is fiscally responsible. This was  a major priority of mine throughout  the entire authorization process. This  conference report holds the budget of  the foreign affairs agencies at or below  current services.  There are only two notable excep tions where authorizations exceed cur rent services. The first is full funding  for the United Nations, which was re quested  by  both  former  President  Reagan and President Bush. In past  years  the  Congress  has  restricted  funding for the United Nations until  the United Nations adopted substan tive reforms in its budget process.  Now  that the United Nations has  adopted and  implemented  those  re forms, the United States has no obli gations to provide our full contribu tion in accordance with our treaty ob ligations.  The second area is in the one time  increase to construct the joint Voice of  America/Board  for  International  Broadcasting  transmitter  in  Israel.  This will allow the radios to broadcast  for the first time into the fast-growing  areas of Soviet Central Asia.  Overall,  the conference report au thorizes $4. 7 billion for the budgets of  the  State Department, USIA, . the  United  Nations,  and  Radio  Free  Europe and Radio Liberty. This level,  only $45 million above the fiscal year  1990 appropriation, conforms  to  the  bipartisan  budget  agreement,  and  holds to the levels contained in the  Senate and House bills.  This bill contains important legisla tive  initiatives as well.  It prohibits  United States negotiation with PLO  members who have been involved in  past terrorist acts against Americans,  and  imposes  economic  sanctions on  China. The two bodies passed nearly  identical China sanctions provisions,  and  the  conference  adopted  the  Senate version to ensure presidential  support.  It also establishes the TV Marti Pro gram to broadcast uncensored news to  Cuba. Last year, during the 30th anni versary of the Communist revolution  in Cuba, Castro announced, ""Glasnost  has no place in Cuba."" To emphasize  the  point, Castro  recently  banned  Soviet newspapers from Cuba, accus ing them of advocating Western cap italism.  TV Marti will  bring  the  visual  impact of such events as the opening  of the Berlin Wall and free elections  in Hungary to the people of Cuba. It  will make it more difficult for Castro  to continue to swim against the tide of  dramatic  changes  elsewhere  in  the  Communist world.  In another important action, House  conferees for the first time succeeded  in eliminating virtually all of the Sen ate's extraneous, nongermane amend ments. We took this action while de f ending virtually all of the provisions  contained in the House bill.  In  recent  years,  the Senate had  begun weighting down this bill to such  an extent as to tum it into an alter nate foreign aid bill because of their  unwillingness for the past 5 years to  bring up their foreign aid bill for con sideration. In one motion, the confer ence removed more than 60 extrane ous Senate provisions while def ending  virtually all House provisions.  For all these reasons, I urge my col leagues support passage of the confer ence report.  D 1800  In addition, Mr. Speaker, all but two  of  the House amendments were  re tained  in  this conference  report as  well, and I think, given the fact that  the Senate had more than 60 unrelat ed, nongermane issues to this legisla tion, we were able  to extract  those  amendment in the conference report.  So, I am pleased that we are able to  reach this point with this legislation  because I think it represents the will  of this House and all of the Members.  ",1989
392,House,101,-0.278,1229,20,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker,  later  this week, the House will take up the  conference report on budget reconcili ation. While  I  cannot speak  for or  against the report as a whole, there is  a portion of  it  that,  in its current  form, will destroy a vital and neces sary segment of the higher education  community.  Within  the  budget  reconciliation  conference report,  there is a section  that purports to save almost $40 mil lion in budget outlays for fiscal year  1990, but which  really  is  a  thinly  veiled attempt  to reduce access and  choice for young people who want to  attend career training schools rather  than more traditional academic 2-and  4-year education programs by making  it more difficult for them to get stu dent aid.  The subconference committee deal ing with that issue is on the verge of  offering a  laundry list of items that  are less directed toward those savings  as required by the Budget Committee  than they are at radically changing  current policies on student aid.  I have attached the full list of items  with the potential savings of each, as  calculated  by  the  Congressional  Budget Office. As you can see, overall,  there is little to commend them as sav ings. Some do make sense as manage ment tools to improve the flow of dol lars to students and schools while pro viding better controls over those dol lars, but three items are out-and-out  threats to the futures of thousands of  ",1989

394,,101,0.31,1281,20,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I  thank  my distinguished colleague, the Sena tor from Oregon.  I commend my good friend, the Sen ator from Colorado, for his eloquent  statement. I,  too, came over here to  speak about the absolute unfairness of  the current system of taxing phantom  gains as regular income.  The proposal before us today has a  very modest relief from this phantom  tax by providing a 5-percent reduction  for up to 7 years in the gain to com pensate for inflation.  People of modest means in my State  are very upset. They are outraged that  they now have to pay a tax on gains  they never realized.  The Senator from Colorado gave a  good example.  Let me give you a simpler example.  A $100  investment held for 2 years.  Say over 2 years  that  inflation has  now put a marketplace value of $110  on it. Under the current system the  holder of that asset, if he or she turns  around and sells it, would be taxed at  an income tax rate perhaps as high as  33 percent on that $10 of gain. This re duction in the gain only reduces 10  percent of that $10. So they would still  have to pay a tax on the $8 of phan tom gain. But at least it is better than  paying tax on the full $10.  In many instances this will not even  compensate  for  the  losses  that  the  phantom gains of inflation  taxes as  income will generate.  I have had small farmers, husbands  and wives, who want to retire and sell  their farm who have told me if they  sell it for twice what they paid for it  they will be getting  less  in actual  spending money,  less  in actual pur chasing power than they put in.  And yet  they have  to pay  taxes,  higher in some instances than the tax,  the marginal  tax,  that multimillion29-059 0-90-41 (Pt. 20)    I  President,  aires who buy junk bonds have to pay  on their income. It is not fair.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues,  in the interest of fairness, to recognize  that when inflation devalues our cur rency, it artificially inflates the value  of property, and unless we do some thing  to  recognize  that  inflationary  gain or element, we will be imposing  an unfair tax.  I thank my colleague. I urge my col leagues to support the motion for cloture.  I yield the floor.  ",1989

398,,101,-0.332,1359,20,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, in the last  5 years, apartheid in South Africa has  become one of the major issues on the  American  foreign  policy  agenda.  During this time, the American people  and Congress have not only become  more educated about  the  injustices  and inhumanity of apartheid, but also  better acquainted with  those South  Africans-black and white-who have  fought courageously and persistently  to bring apartheid to an end. One of  these is the Honorable Helen Suzman,  a member of the opposition Progres sive Federal Party who  recently  re tired after 36 years in Parliament.  Mrs. Suzman is well known here and  in South Africa for her steadfast oppo sition to apartheid and her deep per sonal commitment to freedom and jus tice for all South Africans, regardless  of race. During the course of her long  and distinguished  career  in Parlia ment, Mrs. Suzman consistently spoke  out against the apartheid policies and  the repressive actions of the ruling Na tional Party and  its  leaders. Often,  hers was a sole voice. Now retired from  Parliament, she continues to speak out  forcefully,  at  home  and  abroad,  against apartheid and  in favor of a  nonracial, democratic South Africa in  which all South Africans can exercise  basic  fundamental  freedoms  and  human rights.  Last month, during a visit to Wash ington, Mrs. Suzman did an interview  with  the  ""MacNeil/Lehrer  News Hour."" In the course of this interview,  she offered some very interesting in sights into the present South African  situation and particularly the new ad ministration of President de Klerk.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the interview be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the inter view was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MACNEIL: One woman who has spent her  life fighting for a dialogue is Helen Suzman.  As leader of the Liberal Party for more than  30 years, she was often the only voice  in  Parliament speaking out against apartheid.  But she's been criticized recently by some  people in the anti-apartheid movement for  her opposition  to sanctions. Mrs. Suzman  retired from Parliament this year at the age  of 71.  I spoke with her on Friday in New York.  Mrs. Suzman, thank you for joining us.  How important do you think how signficant are the changes President De Klerk  has instituted so far?  HELEN SUZMAN: Well, I think they're quite  significant,  in that I  think they mean to  show a real change of direction, away from  police toughness to an understanding that  people want to protest and protest peaceful ly, particularly if they. don't have the vote.  The important thing, too, is that he has al lowed  the  Johannesburg  City  Council,  which is National Party-controlled, to deseg regate all public  facilities.  I'm sure  they  couldn't have done that without asking his  permission.  And then, too, he has signified that he's  prepared to speak to the leaders that the  people themselves have chosen, rather than  the leaders that have been elected through  the system. And I think, therefore, his talks  with Archbishop Tutu and  the Reverend  Chikane and the Reverend Boesak are quite  significant, as well.  MAcNEIL. Do you regard these as sort of  tactical maneuvers, or as demonstrating the  first steps in a real change of strategy and  direction?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, I think he's trying to  win confidence. He's trying to win the confi dence of black people in South Africa who  feel they have been frustrated, they have  been ignored in the party political and parliamentary political system. And that's one  thing he's trying to do, is to create a climate  for negotiation.  I think the fact that he's released Walter  Sisulu and several other leading African Na tional Congress people who were sentenced  to imprisonment together with Nelson Man dela, I think that's important as well.  MACNEIL. Why not Mandela at this stage?  What do you read into that?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, I would think the re lease of Walter Sisulu and the others is a  tryout to see just what the result will be,  what the effect will be, what the reaction  will be among  the mass of  the people.  There's a very large Mass Democratic Move ment  in South Africa, and I've no doubt  that they will organize huge rallies to wel come the people who've been released, and   no doubt they want to see if they can con trol that, that there'll be no violence. Be cause Nelson Mandela is, of course, the folk  hero who will, I'm sure, result in much more  of a public demonstration even then Walter  Sisulu and the other members of the ANC.  MACNEIL. Some observers of the South Af rican scene are suggesting that De Klerk  may be making some of these moves now in  order to head off the pressure for tougher  sanctions against South Africa which some  countries want to raise at the British Com monwealth  Prime Ministers meeting  in  Kuala Lumpur later this month.  Do you believe that it is-that he is-that  De Klerk is doing that?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, I think he probably re alizes that Mrs. Thatcher, who's been a lone  voice against sanctions at Commonwealth  conferences, needed something to take with  her to Kuala Lumpur when she goes later  this month. And this is probably something  that he is at least providing. It's not enor mously significant, but it certainly, as I say,  shows a change of direction. And it is some thing which Mrs. Thatcher can say, ""Look, this man is different. It's a new policy a new  direction. Give him a chance. Let's wait and  see. Let's not impose further sanctions.""  MACNEIL. You have, for all your years in  Parliament, been an opponent of apartheid,  the system of segregating the races. Do you  believe this new man, De Klerk, is serious  about dismantling it?  Mrs. SuzMAN. Well, he  is a Nationalist.  He's a politician. He's a pragmatist. He's not  a starry-eyed liberal, as some people have  called me. But he, I think, realizes change  has got to come. I think he also, however,  has got his own particular bottom line, and  he does represent a party which is intent on  maintaining group identity.  So, I don't think he's going to go as far as  my party, for instance, would like him to go,  or as far as the Mass Democratic Movement  would like him to go. But he's going to go  further than his predecessor, and he's going  to try and create a climate for negotiation.  MACNEIL. So, when he says that he wants  to create a new constitutional democracy in  which no race can dominate the other,. that  is still qualified by having each separate  group governing  itself separately, but the  whites fundamentally governing the coun try. Is that ...  Mrs. SUZMAN: Well, I think he will stick to  the present system, whereby there are sepa rate group identities protected by law, by  the separate voters rolls; and probably some  different constitutional mechanism, where by he can see that the three groups that are  not white are not able to vote together in  order to out-vote the wishes of the white  minority.

400,,101,-0.37,1411,20,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  ask that an article from the Baltimore  Sun, November 1, 1989, be included in  the RECORD.  This article deals with a problem we  have long struggled with in the Con gress-quality day care  for our Na tion's children. We are not attracting  and retaining the people we need in  the field  to take proper care of our  kids, and this article discusses the rea sons why. I urge my colleagues to join  me in thinking long and hard about  the issues raised in this piece.  The article follows:  THEY CAN'T AFFORD To CARE  <By Abby Karp)  Once upon a time, Richetta Fields had vi sions of becoming a school teacher. So after  she graduated from high school, she studied  early childhood education at the Communi ty College of Baltimore. A few months later,  she took a job caring for other people's chil dren at the Midtown Children's Center.  Her starting pay as a day-care aide was  $3.75 an hour. Two and a half years later,  she'd gotten a raise-10 cents more an hour.  She had no health insurance for herself or  her 5-month-old son. She had no car. And,  she figured out, when her son turned 2, she  wouldn't be able to afford to place him in  the day-care center at St. Paul Street and  North Avenue where she worked.  Yesterday the 21-year-old said goodbye to  her class of 2and 3-year-olds. Today she  begins a new job, photographing children at  a Sears portrait studio. Although she knows  nothing about taking pictures, her starting  pay is $5.50 an hour. She will have health  insurance, life insurance, paid leave.  Much as she loves working with children,  Ms. Fields has no plans to return to a pro fession where Play-Doh's a given but real  dough's rarely found.  ""I had to leave,"" she says, after living as a  single parent on $500 a month. ""I said, 'it's  time to find a job with more money.'""  Like Ms. Fields, four out of 10 day-care  workers abandoned the profession last year,  mostly because of low salaries. The paltry  pay extends up  the day-care  ladder: Ms.  Fields' boss, director Carolyn Iwata, makes  only $13,000, 17 years after she began work ing at the non-profit center.  Kathy Chapman, director of Red Balloon  Day Care Center in Waverly, still lives at  home with her parents.  ""I've never felt I could live someplace nice  on my own,"" says Ms. Chapman, 31, who  has worked  in day-care  since graduating  third in her class from Coppin State Univer  sity in 1981.  Low pay leads to turnover in day-care cen ters and that, in turn, diminishes the qual  ity of care and education children receive,  according to a national study of such cen ters released last month.  Children in centers with frequent turnov er are slower to develop language and social  skills  than  those  in more stable environ ments,  the National Child Care Staffing  Study found. Researcher Carollee Howes,  an education professor at University of Cali fornia  in Los Angeles,  said. ""Children  in  America are L'l jeopardy because their child care teachers are poorly paid.""  Most day-care workers find it easy to im prove on their pay-a national average of  $5.35 an hour-when they leave, becoming  public school teachers, store clerks, recep tionists, real estate agents.  Ironically,  the job so many leave is the  only one they love.  They bristle at comparisons with baby sit ters,  likening  their work  to  teaching and  parenting. More  than half have  studied  early childhood education or development  and one in five has a bachelor's degree, ac cording to the national study.  What they like best, day-care workers say,  is the informality, the lack of bureaucracy,  the feeling of making a difference, the read ily offered affection.  ""What other job do you go to where some one says every day, 'I love you,'"" asks Mary  Dickson, a teacher of 2-year olds at Down town Baltimore Children's Center.  ""You  feel very special to be here.""  The center's director tries to retain staff  like Ms. Dickson by paying far more than  the national average, as much as $20,000 to  senior teachers with bachelor's degrees.  ""I can't stand to see people with four-year  degrees having to go out and waitress at  night to make car payments. That really  burns people out very quickly,"" says the di rector, Nancy L. Kramer. ""I hate to think  this is a field where someone can work a few  years and then she has to go out and get a  'real' job.""  Yet, she adds, ""I just don't know the solu tion to it all: You get so caught between the  needs of the parents and the needs of the  staff.""  The only route to change, daycare opera tors agree, is for governments and employ ers to begin contributing to the day care's  tuition costs, which average $317 a month in  Maryland.  ""I'm confronted over and over with people  saying, 'Can't you do [day carel cheaper?'""  says Anita Prentice, president of the DBCC  board of directors. ""Early childhood educa  tion hasn't been understood as a separate  profession because a lot of women do it for  free as mothers.""  Ms. Prentice hopes  the  federal govern ment may soon put more money in child  care. The House of Representatives recently  approved a $22. 7 billion child-care package,  which includes income tax credits for poor  families and subsidies for those who provide  day care to children of lowor moderate income families. House and Senate members  are meeting to match efforts.  ""So far, the cost of day care is being paid  by  parents  and  by  staff  accepting  low  wages,"" agrees Barbara Willer, public affairs  director for the National Association for the  Education of Young Children, an advocacy  group for educators. ""We've got to under stand that good early education benefits all  society, and the cost should be shared by all  aspects of society.''  Day-care directors see an urgent need for  government and private-sector intervention:  Not only is it becoming harder to hire quali fied staff, but they see children in day care  suffering because of the high teacher turn",1989
