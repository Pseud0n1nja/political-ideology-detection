0,House,99,-0.1,28,1,Mr. TALLON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the  life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  and  the dream  for which he died. At certain  brief and  isolated moments, history is seized  by the energy and vision of a single man. The  life of Martin Luther King was such a moment.  Dr. King  infused us with  the dream of  free dom,  equality,  justice  and  peace  for  our  Nation and the world. He touched each of us  with this dream and  then showed us how to  bring that dream alive. This legacy remains a  constant source of inspiration and responsibil ity.  In honoring Martin Luther King, let us reflect  on our place in his march for freedom and jus tice. We have a moral obligation to realistically  examine how faithfully and how far we have  carried ""the dream."" This reassessment is the  first step in what Dr. King called his nonviolent  campaign  for  justice. King noted  four basic  steps in his campaign: First, collection of the  facts to determine whether injustices are alive;  second, negotiation; third, self-purification; and  fourth, direct action.  I believe we have a responsibility to contin ue Dr. King's campaign  for nonviolent social  change. A collection of the facts clearly indi cates that domestic and  foreign policy viola tions of civil  rights, equality,  justice  remain  prevalent  in our domestic and our  foreign  policy.""Certainly, blacks have made significant  political, economic, and educational gains. Yet  still, minorities  in  this country are still not  given the educational and economic opportu nities that are available to their white counter parts. There are heartwrenching examples of  inequality and  injustice all around us. Unem ployment  for blacks stands at 15 percent.  Nearly half our black children are born  into  poverty. The median  family  income for black  families is $15,432 compared with $27,686 for  white  families. Vestiges of prejudice are still  prevalent in some of our social, political, and  economic institutions.  Injustice and inequality remain a part of our  foreign policy as well.  In South Africa  today  there are millions of blacks who struggle and  long  for  freedom and equality. This struggle  parallels that of black Americans just 30 years  ago. We have a responsibility to support and  assist them in this struggle.  Negotiation is the second stage. Negotiation  is different  from  concession or  regression.  Rather,  it  requires careful consideration and  compromise as we work to promote freedom  and equality  for  the disenfranchised. This  is  perhaps  the most difficult stage, demanding  tenacity,  foresight and  cooperation. As Dr.  King observed,  the negotiator  is often con fronted with  ""blasted hopes, and  the dark  shadow of deep disappointment.""  A  time of  reflection and  recommitment  is  important in this long difficult struggle for free dom. The Martin Luther King holiday provided  us such time. The stage that Dr. King termed  self-purification  is a period  for  introspection  and self-examination. This stage allows us to  regain courage to confront the reality of injus tice and the will to work for peaceful change.  Dr. King provides us with the inspiration to re commit. We can gain strength  from his un flinching determination  to overcome  racism  and promote equality.  The  final  stage  is  that of direct action.  ""Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such  creative  tension  that a community  that has  constantly  refused  to negotiate  is  f creed  to  confront the issue,"" said Dr. King. Neglect of  civil  rights  in America  is something  that we  had to confront during King's lifetime and it is  something  that we must confront now. The  issue and threat is as real now as it was then.  For, as Dr. King observed, ""injustice anywhere  is a threat to justice everywhere."" I am fright ened by a complacency and a dullness that  seems to have settled across America. Now,  more  than ever, we must heed Dr. King's  advice that ""we must use time creatively, and  forever realize that the time is always ripe to  do right. Now  is  the  time  to make  real  the  promise of democracy,  and  transform  our  pending national elegy  into a creative psalm  of brotherhood.""  In conclusion, I would like to share with you  a few remarks from the Reverend Boesak. ""I  am convinced that there is another America.  An America that remembers its own struggle,  that cherishes  its  freedom and dignity,  that  therefore understands  the aspirations of an  unfree people. An America that lives up to the  ideals of  injustice and equality so  jealously  guarded by your constitution and so preciously  held  in  the hearts of your people.""  It is this  America that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. envi sioned. Let us gather  the courage,  integrity  and commitment to make his dream a reality  for all Americans.  ",1986
1,House,99,-0.435,28,1,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I take  this op portunity to commend Representative MICKEY  LELAND, chairman of the Congressional Black  Caucus, for taking the special order to honor  a great American, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Dr. King's vision of America at its best-a  land of equality, fairness, and compassion for  all of its citizens-and his unyielding devotion  to  nonviolent  protest  (while  facing  death  threats, jail, and ugly verbal abuse and physical brutality) helped lead our Nation through a  turbulent, but necessary, period of growth.  This past Monday, our country of rich and  diverse cultures came  together to honor Dr.  King's memory and rekindle its commitment to  making his dream a reality. This national trib ute was  long overdue.  In 1968, shortly after  Dr. King's death,  I sponsored a bill  to desig nate a national holiday in his honor; 18 years  passed before a day was set aside to honor  his birth.  I am also pleased to note that I am cospon soring legislation with Senator FRANK LAUTEN BERG  to name  the planned Federal  court house in Newark after Dr. King.  However,  our  celebration  of Dr.  King's  legacy is tempered by the sobering fact that  for many Americans, his dream has not yet  become a reality: The gap between rich and  poor  grows  dangerously wider  each  day;  blacks continue  to  suffer disproportionately  high unemployment and infant mortality rates;  the  future  of  essential  social  services  is  threatened  by Gramm-Rudman  and  other  budget-slashing schemes;  the Department of  Justice  is working  to  turn  the clock back on  civil rights gains of the last three decades.  Let us join together to honor the memory of  this great man by carrying on his work.  Dr. King's dream was a dream of social, po litical, and economic justice  for all. He dedi cated his  life  to securing a society  that will  judge its citizens not by the color of their skin,  but by  the quality of their character and  the  contents of their minds. The civil rights  laws  guaranteeing  equal  opportunity  and  equal  rights would be legacy enough for most great  men. But not for Dr. King. For his  is also a  legacy of hope and promise that bigotry will  be erased, justice will be served, and human  rights will be  respected  in  this country and  throughout  the world.  In  1975,  I  told  the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference:  They  shot  down  the man-and  they  snuffed out his  life-but  they could not  shoot down his dream. For his dream was  stronger than life and more powerful than  death. And the dream lives on.  Let us join together to honor the memory of  this great American by working for the realiza tion of his dream.  ",1986
2,House,99,-0.578,28,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  thank my distinguished colleague, the gentle man  from Texas  [Mr. LELAND]  for  reserving  this special order so that Members can partici pate  in  the observance of  the  first Federal  holiday enacted in honor of a black American.  That black American was Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., whose young life was snuffed out by  an assassin's bullet almost 18 years ago.  Mr. Speaker, much has been written; much  has been said; and many events have been  conducted  in  the  last month  relative  to Dr.  King and this new Federal holiday. Each event  has focused on the monumental contributions  and achievements of Dr. King on behalf of not  just black Americans but for all Americans.  This historic occasion is a time for America  to pause and memorialize, to perpetuate, and  pay tribute to a man whose greatness was es tablished  through his  leadership of a move ment which  pricked  the  conscience  of  a  nation and changed the course of history. But  more  than  that,  the holiday  is a time  for all  ",1986
3,House,99,-0.658,41,1,Mr. CONYERS.,"  I  thank my  col league  from Maryland  [Mr. HOYER]  whose  eloquence  humbles me,  and  who is very generous in his praise for  me.  I happen to know that your partici pation  in  this measure  across  the  years was not inconsiderable, and that  he led in many of the activities in the  House and in the other body which ul timately  led  to  its passage when so  many of our colleagues to that over whelming vote that occurred on that  day in 1983.  I am also impressed by your sense of  history not simply civil rights history,  but our history. Every year when I  begin to think I have just about taken  in all that I can, and that I have a fair  knowledge of our historical underpin nings, each year reveals other rich in formation, sparkling jewels of history,  incidents, facts that were not known  to me all of these years before. So this  education and reeducation of mine my  colleagues and of America continues  because this celebration is very impor tant for this reason.  I do not know what forces lent their  way upon you to help form the feel ings that led to the energies that you  contributed to the bill, sir, that I can  tell you  that  in addition  to Martin  himself, there were two that were very  close  to me. First,  there was Rosa  Parks, whom  you mentioned. Rosa  Parks has been with me every step of  my  congressional  career. Can  you  imagine what an enormous, incredible  force to have a saintly person like this  impacting upon an unpredictable and  ",1986
4,Senate,99,0.068,158,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Reading at the top  of page 2, the Assistant Attorney Gen eral says:  Based on  the  information we have ob tained to date, including but not limited to  the recent Preliminary Report of the De partment's  independent  consultant, R.L.  Banks and Associates,  it does not appear  that the proposed divestiture will establish  a rail carrier in the designated carrier capa ble of providing long-term viable competi tive service.  The Assistant Attorney General goes  on  to raise questions about the ade quacy of the divestiture proposal. Mr.  President, I for one would be very in terested to see an earlier draft of that  letter if that is in accordance with the  Department  of  Justice  practices.  I  would like to see how strong the lan guage was. We are now finding in Jan uary of 1986 that a month ago the De partment of Justice said these very se rious problems may have been correct ed. Well, how could they have been  corrected? What did the Assistant At torney General say in his draft letter  of September 25? The Judiciary Com mittee has not concluded  its hear ings-we  just had  the  informal  inquiry-and these would be questions  that  this Senator would  raise. Why  should we sweep this under the rug?  Why should we be asked to pass upon  this issue about an antitrust problem  when these questions have been raised  by the chairman of this very  impor tant subcommittee of  the House of  Representatives? If the Senator from  Missouri believes that this is raising a  sour note, then I have to disagree cate gorically with him. I think this is an  issue of utmost materiality and utmost  importance, and it is our job in the  United States Senate  to  find  those  facts before we are asked to make a  conclusion and/or  to  reach  a  judg ment. I think perhaps it is most significant  to  consider what  the  distin guished chairman of the Senate Com merce Committee did not say, as op posed to what he did say. He picked an  alleged sour note by Senator METZ ENBA UM, an alleged sour note on this  inquiry, but he did not deal with the  substance  of  the  ICC  staff  report  which found a violation of the anti trust laws.  The  chairman  of  the Commerce  Committee, the Senator from Missou ri, did not deal with the conclusions of  the Banks study which found insuffi cient stature by Guilford, Pittsburgh,  and Lake Erie to provide competition.  The Senator from Missouri did not  deal with the parallel of the Southern  Pacific-Santa Fe merger. If that pro posal violates the antitrust laws, then  certainly the Conrail-Norfolk  joinder  violates the antitrust laws.  The Senator  from Missouri dealt  very briefly with the question of the  viability of Conrail, and I would ref er  to the USRA finding:  The agency established by Congress  to  oversee Conrail's operation concluded in a  staff report reviewing the financial outlook  for an independent Conrail back on July 29,  1985, that ""All available evidence supports a  finding that Conrail can generate positive  cash flow for the foreseeable future. Traffic  shortfalls compared to the forecasts should  not threaten Conrail's survival as  long as  the rail regulatory fare work is unchanged  allowing service to be shaped to meet the  demands of the market. By the end of this  year Conrail will have been profitable for 5  years. It has been reasonably and credibly  forecast  to be profitable  through  the  re mainder of this decade. While there can be  no absolute certainty it might have a fore cast, to require more evidence from Conrail  of its likely reliability will impose an unrea sonable burden of proof on  that opposi tion.""  Mr. President, it must be noted that  Conrail has  sustained extraordinary  profits: In 1981, $39 million;  in 1982,  $174 million; in 1983, $313 million; in  1984, $500 million;  in 1985, $440 mil lion. The 1985 figure came at a  time  when traffic was down somewhat, and  I believe  there were extra payments  made to labor. But I think the viabili ty of Conrail has been established.  Mr.  President,  I  know  the  hour  grows late and there is an inclination  to adjourn the Senate at this moment.  But I conclude by expressing the hope  that the important issues projected in  Senate bill 638 will  receive adequate  consideration by this body.  Senator METZENBAUM wants to know  if he can go home. Yes, we can. But  these issues require analysis. The De partment of Justice has not made that  analysis. The  Interstate Commerce  Commission has not made that analy sis. The Senate Judiciary Committee  has not made that analysis. It is up to  the Senate to do so, and we ought not  to shorten the time. We ought not to  impose cloture.  I  thank the Chair and I yield the  floor.  ",1986

7,Senate,99,0.391,158,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, on  January  17,  1986, Ambassador Do brynin of the Soviet Union formally  presented  to me,  in my capacity as  President pro  tempore of  the U.S.  Senate, a message addressed  to  the  Congress from the U.S.S.R. Supreme  Soviet. This document urges Congress  to accept the nuclear weapons propos al which was previously submitted by  Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev  on January 15, 1986.  Ambassador Dobrynin and I had a  constructive meeting. We  discussed  our hopes of  improved  communica tions between our nations based on  the  recent Geneva  summit. As  a  member of the bipartisan Senate dele gation which  traveled  to  the Soviet  Union last September, I told Ambassa dor Dobrynin that General Secretary  Gorbachev and  I had discussed  the  need for cooperation between our na tions. I  told Gorbachev last Septem ber, and reemphasized to Ambassador  Dobrynin,  that  just as our nations  stood together to defeat the Nazis in  World War II, we should work togeth er today for the cause of world peace.  We both agreed that annual summit  meetings would greatly assist in nor malizing  the  relations  between our  countries.  We  also  discussed President Rea gan's Strategic Defense  Initiative.  I  told Ambassador Dobrynin  that  I  would urge President Reagan to stand  firm on this important defense plan.  It is my belief that the path for con structive  dialog  and  proposals  for  peace should always  remain open.  I  told Ambassador Dobrynin  that  I  looked forward to studying this latest  Soviet arms  reduction proposal and  making the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet  ",1986

9,,99,0.353,197,1,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, Laurie Brown,  of Coon Rapids, MN, a Minneapolis suburb,  completed a 2-year Peace Corps assignment  in the Philippines in 1985.  Her experience, in the town of Matag-ob, in  Leyte Province, was  typical  of  the Peace  Corps. The work was hard, the privations were  many, the pay was poor.  Often she found that when she could help  to make life better for the people with whom  she worked, it was in ways which had little re lationship  to her skills and education. Other  assets,  like adaptability, patience,  courtesy,  judgment, and love were often more important  than training.  When her  time was up,  the people with  whom she worked drew a resolution of thanks  to Laurie Brown. It calls her an ""Ambassador  of Goodwill,"" cites her good work, and desig nates her as a ""true daughter of our Barangay  of San Sebastian.""  Laurie's unique experience has left her with  more than a flowery resolution. She also has  a heart full of memories,  lots of friends, new  self-reliance, and a sense of real accomplish ment.  Laurie Brown and her friends in San Sebas tian Barangay are not the only ones to profit  from the past 2 years, however. The really big  winners are  the people of the United States  who sent her, and who annually send hun dreds of Americans all over the world to prove  that  the United States  is not only a great  country, but a good one as well.  Laurie Brown's resolution follows:  REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PROVINCE OF  LEYTE, MUNICIPALITY OF MATAG-OB, BGY.  SAN SEBASTIAN  To all to whom these presents shall come:  We,  the undersigned signatories, all citi zens of the Republic of the Philippines and  all residents particularly of Barangay San  Sebastian, of the Municipality of Matag-ob,  Province of Leyte, Philippines, by virtue of  this simple document do hereby by these  presents express our heartfelt feelings of  gratitude and warmest regards to the Good  People of America <the United States of  America) through its Peace Corps Volunteer  Program for the show of genuine, deep and  sincere concern over our welfare, we who  are otherwise known and classified, as the  ""poor, impoverished, ignorant, suffering or  miserable"", segments on our Philippine So ciety, by way of having made available in  our midst for almost two <2> years, one of  their truest Ambassadors of Goodwill in the  person of Miss Lorie Brown, who despite our  shortcomings and ways of life have stead fastly withstood the rigors of our economic  conditions <depressed, distressed and under served), in the process of letting us awaken  once more to the realities that regardless of  how little we are in life, the Good People of  the United States of America do whole heartedly consider us, as a true brother and  sister.

10,,99,-0.104,210,1,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the memory of  the members of  the  101 st Airborne who lost their lives on Decem ber 12, 1985 in the service of their country.  When loved ones answer the call to duty in  the face of danger, we are wont to know both  pride and fear. Whether they be soldiers serv ing in distant lands, or police patrolling neigh borhood streets, we are all too aware of their  vulnerability. We are heartened by their cour age, but we are also anxious for their return.  Knowing what we may, when tragedy is vis ited,  the grief is no  less. And so it is for the  families of the 248 fine young soldiers whose  in e quiet,  mission of peace ended abruptly  snow covered field in Gander, Newfoundland.  Our hearts go out to  the  loved ones who  grieve  the untimely  loss of these brave sol diers. Though  it does  little  to  lessen  the  sorrow of  their  loss,  I know  I join with  the  entire country in expressing my deep sympa thy to each family. While we will never know  what  accomplishments  they  might  have  achieved had  they  lived, we will always  re member the cause  for which  they served so  proudly.  TRIBUTE TO ELLIE GRAHAM  HON. CARL D. PURSELL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 21, 1986  ",1986
11,,99,0.12,210,1,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to  take  this opportunity to pause and comment  on the career of a woman from my hometown  of Plymouth-Ellie Graham.  Mrs. Graham is retiring from her work at the  Observer & Eccentric Newspapers this month  and I believe it fitting to comment on her out standing work and dedication as a community  journalist.  Mrs. Graham went to work at the Observer  Newspapers in May of 1967. Then headquar tered in Plymouth, she was no stranger to the  community-having  raised  her  family  there  and having been active in Plymouth events.  Ellie spent most of her time working on the  central  copy  desk  until  1976, when  she  became the suburban life editor of the Plym outh edition. This was a natural  role  for a  woman who already was  involved with  the  Plymouth Symphony,  the Plymouth Historical  Society, Plymouth Fall Festival, and other or ganizations.  The distinguishing part of Mrs. Graham's  work is her dedication to the community and  the people who live there.  It is rare to find a  community  journalist who,  beyond  writing  about a town's people and their events, takes  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the  time  to  truly care about  them. And be cause of that, Mrs. Graham has had a positive  impact on the Plymouth community.  But beyond that, I believe it bears mention ing  that  this appreciation  for an American  town and American people comes  from one  who was born and raised in a different coun try. Mrs. Graham  is a proud citizen of our  neighbor to the north, Canada.  I would like to join with the people from my  hometown in congratulating Ellie on her retire ment. It truly is to our benefit that years ago a  schoolteacher from Essex County decided to  cross  the Detroit River and make her  resi dence in Michigan.  BTX'S: A THREAT TO HEALTH  AND THE ETHANOL INDUSTRY  HON. DOUG BEREUTER  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 21, 1986  ",1986
12,,99,0.231,210,1,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation that will prohibit oil refin ers  from  introducing benzene,  toluene, and  xylene, commonly known  in  the  industry as  BTX's,  into commercial gasoline.  I introduce  this  legislation for two primary reasons: One,  is environmental; the other is economic.  From an environmental standpoint, all of us  are aware  that the Environmental Protection  Agency  has mandated  that oil  companies  phase out the use of lead as an octane en hancer  in gasoline. The EPA mandated  this  phaseout because  it has been determined  that lead is a toxin and that its use in gasoline  is detrimental to both air quality and individual  health.  The EPA lead phaseout has left oil compa nies with two basic alternatives for increasing  the octane level in the production of gasoline.  One is the use of ethanol manufactured from  agricultural products such as grain or sugar  cane. The other  is  the use of one or more  BTX's-benzene, toluene, or xylene. The first  is a clean and efficient method for increasing  the  octane  ratings  in  gasoline. The  other  raises potentially serious health consequences  for Americans because benzene  is a proven  carcinogen and  toluene and xylene are sus pected carcinogens.  Because BTX's are naturally present in gas oline and a by product of petroleum refining,  the major oil companies during the past year  have tended  to invest in  the development of  STX facilities rather than turn to ethanol as an  octane enhancer for gasoline. The increased  use of BTX's, however, raises several poten tial health concerns. The carcinogenic conse quences of BTX's are currently being investi gated by EPA, OSHA, and other Federal and  State agencies. Recent cancer biopsies from  animal studies show that benzene causes leu kemia, and a variety of other cancers includ ing  lymphoid cancers, cancers of  the skin,  ovary, oral cavity lip, tongue,  lung, and mam mary gland.  While it appears that the regulation of BTX's  would have positive health benefits, it is also  apparent  that  their  limitation, or even com plete phaseout, would have positive economic  consequences  for our depressed agricultural  January 21, 1986  economy. A recent report by the Congression al Research Service shows  that  the United  States uses nearly 11 O billion gallons of gaso line annually. Assuming a 10-percent alcohol  mixture, CRS estimates that 11 billion gallons  of alcohol would then be required. At 2.55 gal lons per bushel, 4.3 billion bushels of grain  would be needed to manufacture this amount  of alcohol. Thus, 40 percent of the grain har vest of the United States could potentially be  utilized to supplement our Nation's automotive  fuel supply.  While  it may be many years before  this  amount of grain is put to use in the production  of alcohol,  there  is already a proven market  for ethanol in the United States with a tremen dous potential  for  future growth.  Increased  ethanol usage  in  recent years has already  proven  to be an  important market  for corn  producers. Between  1980 and  1985,  corn  used  in production of ethanol  rose  from 16  million to nearly 200 million bushels annually.  With  the phaseout of lead as an octane en hancer in gasoline, the potential exists for the  amount of corn used  in ethanol  refining  to  double, or even possible triple, over the next  few years.  In  light of our current huge surpluses of  grain, ethanol production  is a safe, efficient  and economical means of utilizing excess ag ricultural products. The use of corn in ethanol  production also helps to increase farm income  and  reduce  the cost of Federal  farm pro grams. However, if oil refiners are allowed to  manufacture and use BTX's on an economi cally large scale, then ethanol will cease to be  a viable alternative to lead as an octane en hancer and a market for surplus grain produc tion.  The legislation which I am introducing today  is a simple, straightforward means  to both  protect public health and  insure a future  for  our developing ethanol  refining  industry. My  bill would prohibit any petroleum refiner from  introducing benzene,  tolulene, or xylene  into  gasoline  for  the  purpose of  increasing  its  octane  ratings. Naturally occuring BTX's al ready present in gasoline would be limited to  the following amounts: benzine-1 percent to lulene-3 percent and xylene-3 percent by  weight.  I urge all my colleagues who are concerned  about the environmental health consequences  of BTX's and the future of the ethanol industry  to support this legislation.  HONORING BERTRAND E.

13,,99,-0.455,210,1,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay  tribute to a good friend and outstanding civil  servant, Mr. Bert Stewart, Jr. After nearly four  decades of distinguished service in the Feder al work  force, Bert retired on December 31,  1985.  Bert enjoyed an exemplary career as a civil  servant. His 38 years of service featured nu merous honors that highlight the outstanding  contributions he has made to our Nation.  In",1986
14,House,99,-0.496,223,1,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  Members are still reeling from the rev elations as to what they are going to  have to go through with the Gramm Rudman law particularly the cuts in  important programs for our cities, for  people in need, and for the environ ment. Nevertheless, today's New York  Times says President Reagan will seek  $100 million  in aid  for  the Contras  who are seeking the overthrow of the  Nicaraguan Government.  if  that were  not  chutzpah  enough, an article  last week  in  the  Washington Times says: ""Reagan  to  ask Hill for broad war powers."" And I  am now quoting:  As  President Reagan will ask Congress for a  resolution, similar to that passed in 1964 fol lowing the Gulf of Tonkin incident, to em power the executive branch to use ""what ever military force is required"" to deal swift ly and effectively with the terrorist threat,  a senior administration official said.  I  suppose  the theory  is  that Con gress,  having  abdicated  its  fiscal  powers, might now be prepared to ab dicate its war powers. If so, then we  might as well go home, just turn ev erything over to the geniuses of the  Pentagon and the OMB, and declare  that we are no longer a democratic Re public but a nation ruled by one man  and his hand-picked bureaucrats.

15,House,99,0.581,223,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, every  bit of data that we have makes clear  that the American people want  the  budget balanced. Many would have  you believe that there is no difference  between the two great political parties  on this issue. Oh, really? Let us look at  the record.  When the law was passed requiring a  balanced budget, a majority of Demo crats, mostly  liberals, voted against  the balanced budget law. A majority of  Republicans voted for it. The first call  in this House to repeal the balanced  budget  law came  from a Democrat.  When the court suit was filed trying  to gut the balanced budget law, it was  filed by mostly Democrats. It is  the  Democrats in this House who are sug gesting stonewalling the budget proc ess in order to undermine the balanced  budget law. It sounds like some pretty  wide differences between the two par ties on this crucial issue, and my guess  is that as the year unfolds, the differ ences will become even wider.  We ought to be working together in  a  bipartisan  spirit  to do what  the  American people want: Balance  the  budget. But that is not what is shap ing up in this House.  OUR HUGE DEFICIT REQUIRES  CUTS  IN  SPENDING AND  IN CREASES IN TAXES  <Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
16,House,99,-0.082,223,1,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr.  Speaker,  during the last Presidential election,  Walter Mondale said, ""I will have to  raise taxes and I am telling you the  truth."" Reagan will too, only he will  not tell you.  Although the President still declares  that there will be no  taxes, even he  now recognizes that this huge deficit  will require both cuts in spending and  increases  in  revenue  that should be  fair and should target those who pay  little or no taxes.  Gramm-Rudman, our current plan,  is flawed from a constitutional, an eco nomic standpoint, and a human stand point. If we allow it to continue, de pressed areas like mine will  literally  collapse. We have suffered from this  administration while they continue to  boast of a growing economy. An econo my  that  I  term  now  ""supply-side  suffer."" It is time for Congress, man dated by constitutional law,  to make  the tough decisions that we were elect ed to make, to take that bold action.  We cannot  avoid our  responsibility  any longer; we must raise revenue and  we must cut spending.  Finally, I remember in an election 6  years ago where one candidate called  the other as having policies of voodoo  economics. If we fail now to do what is  mandated by the Constitution, we will  put another $500 billion of debt on the  backs of the people of this country.  WAS IT THE CONGRESS' FAULT?  ABSOLUTELY YES  <Mr. MACK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
17,House,99,0.466,223,1,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker,  to speak  about flaws, I think the question that  is  going  through many Members'  minds today or yesterday is how did  we get from the $171.9 billion deficit  that we claimed was going to occur as  a result of the budget resolution that  was passed just last August? $171.9 bil lion, and the projection today is $220  billion. How did we get there? Was it  the President's fault? I do not think  so. Was it the Congress' fault? Abso lutely yes.  When you  look at what occurred,  there is an increase in the size of that  deficit of roughly $45  to $49 billion.  Where did it come from? Yes. Part of  it came from the fact that we grew at  a  level slightly  lower  than what we  had projected  in  the budget  resolu tion; about $13 billion.  But the balance of it, $32.7 billion,  came because the Congress failed  to  carry out its own budget resolution.  Flaws? You better believe  there are  flaws. Flaws in our ability to live with  the practices that we have established  in saying that we are going to live with  our own budget resolutions.  I mentioned lower economic growth,  but how about failure to enact the rev enue increases called for in the budget  resolution itself? How about the allo cation of $6.3 billion  in unobligated  funds for pay raises for the military?  Failure  to enact military retirement  reform called for in the budget resolu tion of $2.8 billion. Faster payout in  the defense budget. Enacting the farm  legislation which  actually  increases  outlays in 1986 of $4 to $5 billion over  the budget resolution. Lower prices re quired higher payouts under the bill.  The end result is that we failed to  pass a  reconciliation bill; about an other $8 billion. The point that I am  making is that Congress failed to carry  out its responsibility last year, and if  there is one major argument that says  that the Gramm-Rudman bill should  have been passed, it is this data that I  have now placed into the RECORD.

39,Senate,99,0.52,262,1,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, it is  my pleasure to take this opportunity  to  congratulate  the University  of  Oklahoma  football  team and coach  Barry Switzer for winning their sixth  national championship on New Year's  Day.  The Sooners won by beating previ ously-unbeaten and No. 1 Penn State,  25 to 10, in the Orange Bowl.  Coach  Switzer  certainly  deserves  special recognition as this win brings  to three the number of national cham pionships he has won. He has brought  great distinction to the Sooner foot ball team, the University of Oklaho ma, and our State. He is the winning est coach in college football.  Coach Switzer also won the national  title in 1974 and 1975. The University  of Oklahoma also secured the national  title  in 1950,  1955, and 1956 under  Coach Bud Wilkinson.  Of course, the credit must be shared  with  the  fine  young  athletes who  make up the Sooners' team. Their bril liant teamwork and dogged determina tion  against  a  tough Nittany Lion  team made the national championship  possible.  Among  some  of  the  Orange Bowl statistics:  noteworthy  the best  Lydell Carr's rushing total was  against Penn State in a Bowl game;  Tim Lasher set an Orange Bowl record for  most field goals kicked, he was successful on  four attempts;  Tim also set a record for most points ever  kicked against Penn State, 13.  I would  also  like  to congratulate  Penn State and Joe Paterno for their  excellent season. They are a good foot ball organization with a  lot of pride  and tradition. Knowing that they are  an outstanding  team makes  the OU  victory that much more significant.  My  compliments  to Coach Barry  Switzer and the best football team in  America: the University of Oklahoma.  UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  ",1986
40,Senate,99,-0.262,262,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  today,  January 22, 1986, marks the 68th anni versary  of Ukrainian  Independence  Day. To millions of people in Ukraine,  and  to  the  thousands of Ukrainian  Americans  in Ohio  and  across  the  Nation, it is a day of special signifi cance. On January 22, 1918 the inde pendent republic was proclaimed. And  while it endured but 3 short years, it is  extremely important that this day and  what it represents never be forgotten.  Ordinarily,  the commemoration of  an independence day is a cause for joy  and celebration. But in this particular  instance, there can be no such joy, and  no such celebration.

42,,99,0.196,288,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  Senator GLENN has m~de a most com prehensive statement. I do not agree  with  it, of course, but I do want to  compliment him for the care and the  attention he has given  this  issue.  I  would take exception to several of his  conclusions.  Repeatedly, the Senator from Ohio  characterized what we are doing as a  rush to judgment. I do not believe that  that is a  reasonable characterization  of this bill. In fact, it is the very oppo site of a rush to judgment. The proc ess of selling Conrail did not begin a  month or two ago and it did not begin  a year or two ago. It began in 1981  when Congress  decided,  in  the  so called NERSA bill, that we would sell  Conrail. That set in motion a process  which led us to where we are today.  As part of that process, the Depart ment of Transportation first hired a  consultant, Goldman Sachs, then so licited bids from over 100 possible bid ders for Conrail, then received 15 dif ferent bids and screened them.  The Norfolk Southern proposal was  put  together approximately 2 years  ago and was submitted to the Depart ment of Transportation on June 19,  1984. It has been studied and restudied  by the executive branch and by the  Congress not for a few weeks or a few  months, but since June 19, 1984.  The Department of Transportation  has studied this question comprehen sively,  the Treasury Department has  studied it, and the Justice Department  has studied it. The Assistant Attorney  General in charge of the Antitrust Di vision, Mr. Ginsburg, testified before  the  Judiciary  Committee  that  no  other acquisition of this type, no other  acquisition that he knows of, has re ceived the kind of comprehensive at tention and the kind of time that the  Conrail proposal has received.  That is what the Assistant Attorney  General tells us.  With respect to whether or not this  is premature, the Justice Department  has studied  this, and  they say  that  they do not see  the antitrust prob lems. Their concerns have been satis fied. The Assistant Attorney General  in charge of the Antitrust Division has  said to the Congress go ahead. Do not  delay any further. Yes, we have a con sultant hired. What is the reason for  the consultant to be hired? To review  the factual bases on which the Justice  Department reached its conclusion in  the nature of, as Assistant Attorney  General Ginsburg put it, dotting the  i's and crossing the t's.  It is the nature of a closing at the  end of a transaction to make sure that  all the facts are as represented.  Furthermore, we have provided  in  the legislation, and also in the memo randum  of  intent  between Norfolk  Southern  and  the Department  of  Transportation, that if at the end the  Justice Department turns out not to  be satisfied, then the Department of  Justice has veto power over this trans action-veto power.  Mr. President, I do not know of any  other case  in history where the De partment of Justice has been given  veto power for a  railroad merger. It  does have it in this case.  If we act-if we pass the legislation still  the Department of Justice has  veto power if its antitrust concerns are  not in fact met by the technical review  that will be made.  The Senator from Ohio, senior Sena tor from Ohio, said, well, why rush?  There  is  no  hurry. Mr. President,  there  is a hurry. There  is a hurry.  What is the hurry?

Section 3. Subsection (c) of § 3332 reserves  for the Senate and the House their existing  authority to issue their own regulations to  implement the direct deposit program.

A bill to eliminate or change  statutory requirements preventing the  reduction of paperwork burdens and  regulatory simplification; to the Com mittee on Governmental Affairs.  PAPERWORK AND REGULATORY SIMPLIFICATION  ACT  This bill is intended to eliminate or  change a number of statutory provi sions requiring executive branch agen cies to impose information collections  on the public and to issue regulations.  The  Office  of Management  and  Budget advises  that these provisions  are now either obsolete or no longer  serve useful purposes. This bill is Gov ernmentwide in scope in that statuto ry  provIS1ons  administrated  by  a  number of departments and agencies  are  being processed  for  change or  elimination. The bill  represents  the  administration's first attempt to seek  such changes on a Governmentwide  basis. According  to OMB,  the provi sions contained in the bill will, if en acted, result in improvement in overall  Government efficiency and will elimi nate  unnecessary  burdens  on  the  public. As the administration contin ues its activities under the Paperwork  Reduction Act, it expects to identify  statutory  requirements  that  impose  unnecesary burdens on the public, and  will bring these to the attention of the  Congress.  Examples of existing statutory pro visions affected by this legislation in clude a decennial census of drainage,  the establishment of a standard barrel  of apples, restrictions on for-profit or ganization receiving Federal grants or  contracts,  and  a  requirement  that  wholesale  liquor dealers post a  sign  outside their business premises.  I  request unanimous consent  that  the bill and accompanying section-by section  analysis  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  ",1986
44,,99,-0.502,353,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last week,  Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev indicated  that the Soviets will continue Moscow's mora torium  on  underground  nuclear  tests  until  April, and perhaps longer if the United States  also stops testing.  The Reagan administration quickly indicated  that it has little interest in joining this moratori um. It wants  to keep on  testing, contending  that continued nuclear warhead  testing is re quired for the United States to assure strate gic ""deterrence.""  I find  it somewhat  incredible  that a Presi dent who repeatedly says his ultimate goal is  the elimination of all nuclear weapons  from  the  face of  the earth keeps ducking out of  comprehensive  test ban  talks.  If he  really  wants  to eliminate all nuclear weapons,  the  President should be willing to talk about halt ing  the  tests needed  to develop new war heads.  When the Soviets first announced their uni lateral testing halt, the administration said that  we wouldn't join because it was just a propa ganda stunt.  But the Soviets have stopped testing. That's  not just a stunt; they aren't testing their nucle ar warheads and we're continuing to test ours.  351  As the attached chart indicates, the United  States conducted 16 underground  tests  last  year, 7 of  them  following announcement of  the Soviet test moratorium. The Soviets con ducted seven  tests  in 1985 prior to  the an nouncement of  their moratorium  last  July.  They have not tested since that time.  I am convinced that the primary reason the  administration refuses  to enter into a testing  moratorium is not its concern with the preser vation of strategic deterrence nor its concern  about verification. The United States has kept  on  testing chiefly because of the administra tion's desire to accelerate a key part of star  wars program-the x-ray laser.  The most  recent U.S. nuclear  test, code named Goldstone, was reportedly a test of the  nuclear-driven x-ray laser. Maintaining a rigid  and accelerated  test schedule  for  this pro gram is so important to this administration that  it denied a request from Representative BILL  GREEN, myself, and  28 other Members of  Congress  to  temporarily delay  this  test until  technical problems with  the design of these  experiments had been rectified.  Star wars  is  not  only  an  obstacle  to  progress in strategic arms reduction; it is hold ing up talks on a comprehensive test ban. The  administration would better serve our national  security  interests  if  it stopped  reaching  for  harebrained technological panaceas like the x ray laser and committed itself to negotiations  to end nuclear testing.  I would  like to call  to  the attention of my  colleagues a recent article by Fred Kaplan of  the Boston Globe, which analyzes the admin istration's decision to reject a test ban.  The article follows:  [From the Boston Globe, Jan. 19, 19861  WHY U.S. REJECTED NUCLEAR TEST BAN  <By Fred Kaplan)  WASHINGTON.-ln  the  package  of  arms  control  proposals  offered  last week  by  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, there is  one element that could instantly be put into  effect-a ban on nuclear weapons tests.  Yet the Reagan administration has reject ed this idea. The reason is simple. It has  nothing to do with whether such a ban can  be verified or whether it would make the ex isting U.S. nuclear arsenal less reliable. It is  because the administration wants to develop  new types of nuclear weapons, and this re quires nuclear testing.  Last July, Gorbachev announced that, as  of Aug. 6, the Soviet Union would suspend  nuclear testing. The moratorium would last  until the end of the year, and could be ex tended if the United States reciprocated.  Reagan  spokesmen declined  the  invita tion. They said a test ban could not be veri fied, and called  the offer a  propaganda  hoax. They said the Soviets had just com pleted tests of a new series of nuclear weap ons, and had  indeed accelerated  the  test  schedule so it could be finished before the  suspension began.  One of those rationales for refusal was  false, and the Soviets would soon make the  other a moot point.  The falsehood was that the Soviets had  just accelerated a  series of new weapons  tests. The data-gathered by the Swedish  National Defense Research Institute, whose  Hagfors Observatory has seismometers ca pable of detecting underground nuclear ex plosions in the Soviet Union down to the  level of one kiloton-indicates otherwise.  71-059 0-87-12 (Pt. 1)  ",1986

46,Senate,99,0.196,379,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  some time ago I made an inquiry to  the Treasury Department as to the ef fects on  tax revenue  to the Federal  Government of a  sale of Conrail  to  Norfolk Southern. Clearly, as has been  recognized by everybody, there is a tax  consequence. The fact of the matter is  that the proposal that was made by  Norfolk Southern to the Department  of Transportation forgoes  loss carry  forward, net operating loss carry for wards and the carry forward of invest ment  tax credit unused  from prior  years because Conrail has not been  paying  taxes. These carry  forwards  would otherwise be available. Howev er, it was agreed by Norfolk Southern  to forgo carry forwards of the net op erating losses and of the investment  tax credit.  However, there are some tax conse quences  to any business  transaction.  Why? Because anytime a corporation  that generates tax losses files a con solidated  tax return with a business  that  is making money  and  paying  taxes, one offsets the other. So, in the  future, there are tax consequences.  The Treasury Department,  along  with a  lot of other people, including  Morgan Stanley and the Joint Com mittee on Taxation and the Congres sional Budget Office, have made anal yses of what happens to tax revenues  by virtue of the acquisition of Conrail  by Norfolk Southern. The Treasury  Department has written me. Mr. Presi dent, I ask unanimous consent that a  copy of a letter that I have received  from J. Roger Mentz, Acting Assistant  Secretary of  the Treasury  for Tax  Policy, be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,  Hon. JOHN c. DANFORTH,  Washington, DC.  Chainnan, Committee on Commerce, Sci ence, and Transportation, U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to  your request for an analysis of the Federal  income tax revenue effects of the proposed  sale of Consolidated Rail Corporation <Con rail) to the Norfolk Southern Corporation  <Norfolk Southern>. Our analysis  is based  on the proposed sale transaction as reflect ed in S. 638, the Conrail Sale Amendments  of 1985, and in the Memorandum of Intent  signed on February 8,  1985,  by Norfolk  Southern and the Department of Transpor tation. Pursuant to your further request, we  also have analyzed the tax revenue effects  of an alternative proposal for a sale of Con rail  to a syndicate of  investors organized  and headed by Morgan Stanley & Co., In corporated  <Morgan  Stanley). We  have  relied for the details of a sale of Conrail to  the Morgan Stanley syndicate upon Morgan  Stanley's written description of the proposal  dated May 14, 1985, as subsequently amend ed.  OVERVIEW  Subject to the uncertainties and qualifica tions noted below, we estimate that a sale of  Conrail to Norfolk Southern, in comparison  with a continuation of the Federal govern ment's ownership of Conrail, would result in  a present value revenue loss of $125 million  for  the 1986-1990 budget period. Without  adjustment for the time value of money, the  nominal loss in Federal tax revenues over  this period is $174 million. Alternatively, we  estimate  that  a  sale of Conrail  to  the  Morgan Stanley syndicate, again in compar ison  to continuation of Conrail's current  ownership, would result in a present value  increase in revenue of $18 million over the  same 1986-1990 period. This positive reve nue effect  represents a nominal  revenue  gain of $24 million.  As discussed in further detail below,  the  difference in estimated revenue effects of a  sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern and a  sale to the Morgan Stanley syndicate is at tributable primarily  to differences  in  the  rate at which losses and credits generated  by Conrail after the sale would be utilized  under the alternative sale proposals.1 Thus,  our estimates  reflect period and present  value differences in the revenue effects of  the alternative proposals, even though their  revenue effects on a long-run, undiscounted  basis would be very similar.  In addition, we must emphasize that the  difference  in estimated revenue effects of  the alternative proposals in highly sensitive  to a number of legal and factual issues as to  which there is substantial uncertainty. We  have,  for purposes of our estimates,  at tempted to resolve these issues on a basis  that  reasonably  reflects  the comparative  revenue effects of the sale proposals. Alter native assumptions concerning a number of  these  issues would have been defensible,  however, and could have significantly al tered the absolute and relative revenue ef fects of the proposals. We also must empha size that our revenue estimates do not rep resent an analysis of the relative merits of  selling Conrail to Norfolk Southern or to  the Morgan Stanley syndicate. In particu1 Both the Norfolk Southern and Morgan Stanley  proposals contemplate  that existing Conrail  loss  and credit carryovers would be extinguished in the  sale transaction.  ",1986
47,Senate,99,-0.443,392,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  a  recent article  in  the Boston Globe  praises my  longtime friend and con stituent Tom Mcintyre as a man who  gets the job done.  Tom, who lives and works in South  Boston, is the international vice presi dent of Local No. 3 of the Bricklayers  Union. He is known for his ""can do""  attitude and his direct approach  to  any issue or problem. But more impor tantly, he is known for his unflagging  support and loyalty to his friends from  all walks of life. All you have to do is  join him for a sandwich and a beer at  Arn.rhein's on West Broadway and you  know that here is a man you want on  your side.  For those folks who have grown up  on Andrew Square,  off Dorchester  Street, who have married and raised  children  there, Tom Mcintyre  is  in  their corner. As  the Boston Globe  story of November 24,  1985,  shows,  Tom Mcintyre has worked to provide  affordable housing  for many young  families during a  time when inflation  has put housing out of reach. During a  time of high unemployment for union  members  in  the construction  trades,  Tom Mcintyre has created jobs. This  is a man who gets things done. I am  proud to call him my friend.  I ask unanimous consent that David  B. Wilson's article  from  the Boston  Globe of November 24, 1985, be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Boston Globe, Nov. 24, 1985]  BARGAIN HOUSES-NO SPECULATORS NEED  APPLY  <David B.

No such ad will appear in the Globe be cause,  by  spring, when  the BLNPHC  is  ready to sell these 18, sunny, special places,  the word will be around and they will all be  taken.  And  if you don't live  in  the neighbor hood-that's  the  key word-of Andrew  Square, forget it. Tom Mcintyre didn't  lay  up all that brick for yuppie speculators. He  did it for what he calls ""the two-dollar bet tors.""  You do not mess with Tom Mcintyre. He  is international vice president of Local No. 3  of the Bricklayers Union. You do not get to  be that and stay that by avoiding or losing  fights. He is Mission Hill Irish, silver-haired,  black-browed,  tough, decisive,  the kind of  man other men will follow. He also  is an  idealist with a  creative  imagination,  lan guage to which he would no doubt object.  Like  the wheel, great  ideas are simple.  Mcintyre's was, is, this: Boston is desperate ly short of housing. Housing costs too much  because land costs too much. People can't  afford to live where they grew up, formed  families. The city owns a lot of land, aban doned schools, burn-outs, tax-title takings,  vacant lots strewn with rubble and broken  glass, going to waste.  The way to produce housing that neigh borhood people can afford is to build it on  city land conveyed for $1 to a nonprofit de veloper. A bank that enjoyed the union's  pension business ought to be interested in  financing.  Union  craftsmen,  paid  scale,  working for a union-backed outfit, could do  the work. And  the buyers would get  a  double discount-the land cost and the de veloper's profit.  This is pretty radical stuff, you know. No  federal funds. No limited partnerships. No  sales commissions. No syndicated tax shel ters. No complex gimmickry, publicity cam paign, extended planning procedures, envi ronmentalist  tedium,  hearings,  seminars,  workshops, committees, reviews. Just do it.  But you need an architect.  Bill Rawn is an architect. Matter of fact,  he is The Architect in Tracy Kidder's best  seller, ""House."" Through Ed Lashman, a  mutual friend, Mcintyre found Rawn. One  night last January they had dinner at Amr hein's on West Broadway and discovered  that they liked each other's style and ideas.  It helped-a lot-that Mcintyre had been  with Ray Flynn early in the 1983 election. It  helped that Arthur Cola and Pat Walsh of  the Laborers Union were willing  to get  aboard.  It helped  that Billy Bulger had  gone to the Andrew School. It helped that  Dave Mirabassi was willing to take charge as  general contractor and that attorney Valer ie Swett was fascinated by the legal issues.  Bill Rawn delivered plans a month after  the Amrhein's dinner. A month later, Mcin tyre had cost estimates from Mirabassi. In  May, the city issued requests for proposals  for the old Andrew School site. In June, to  the surprise of almost no one, the BLNPHC  was chosen.  It took  title  in August and  broke ground Sept. 9. In May, people will be  living in the houses.  Boston is not supposed to work that way.  In Boston, people love to fight, brood upon  ancient wrongs,  to  chew over  issues,  to  debate important principles, to punish and  reward old foes and friends, to convene and  consult and pick nits. Instead, Tom Mcin tyre, the Mission Hill kid, and Bill Rawn,  the post-modernist 1 Yalie, Harvard Law  graduate and oncoming national celebrity,  and  their friends, went out and built 18  houses.  You can see them today, framed in and  rough-plumbed, their bay windows shining  out on Dorchester street, with  the  fine,  clean smell of new lumber blending with the  sour scent of mortar. It is the fragrance of  progress and growth. Thousands of empty  lots in this city could use a little of it.  Valerie Swett has written deed restrictions  designed  to prevent speculation, and she  thinks  they will work. The  houses,  of  course, are worth on the open market two to  three times their expected price.  Tom Mcintyre may have discovered a no lose game. The union gets work and jobs for  apprentices and badly needed public rela tions. The neighborhood gets some protec tion against gentrification. A development  model  has been  established. Ray Flynn  looks great. The city gets taxes and neigh borhood stability. Bill Rawn gets an excit ing commission. Valerie Swett breaks new  ground  in her profession. And people get  places to  live. Each new unit,  just about,  creates a corresponding vacancy.  If it all does not work out exactly as  planned, well, somebody tried. Right away.  Now. Tom Mcintyre's way.  AN INVITATION TO MR.

49,Senate,99,0.641,418,1,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President, I  inserted  into  the RECORD  an article  from the Air University Review from  the  September-October  1985  issue,  which dealt almost entirely with the  subject of military reform.  I intend to continue to insert these  various articles because of the coming  legislation  that  the Armed Services  Committee is preparing, to accomplish  some of the reforms discussed by Sen ator SAM NUNN and me on the floor  last year.  Today,  I have  removed  from  that  publication an editorial entitled, ""Indi viduals, Institutions, and the Impulse  for Reform."" This rather short editori al pretty well summarizes the needconstant need-for the observation of  reform.  I ask that it appear at this point in  my remarks.  The article follows:  [From Air University Review, September October 19851  INDIVIDUALS, INSTITUTIONS, AND THE IMPULSE  FOR REFORM  surge  Like  individuals,  institutions ossify with  age. Goals and objectives become part of  the warp and woof of corporate personality,  enforcing conformity and demanding unity  of purpose from those who are part of the  institution. When service  to  institutional ized goals becomes an objective unto itself, a  bureaucratic  rigidity develops  that stifles  initiative and, ultimately, causes atrophy  and impotence. That is when the invigora tion of reform is needed.  Only  the  strongest  establishments  can  reform  themselves. Those  that  seek  to  foster change from within must, in most in stances, be prepared for the lot of martyrs.  On the other hand reform from without can  be unduly abrasive, destroying rather than  improving. The successful reformation usu ally results when insiders work with inter ested outside parties  to bring about con structive changes.  The  Protestant Reformation  and  the  Catholic Counter-Reformation provide good  examples of successful reorientation and re constitution. In 1520,  the Papal Bull Ex demanded  that  the monk Martin  Luther either recant his position on reform ing  the Church or be branded a heretic.  Luther became an unenthusiastic  revolu tionary.  Martin Luther loved the Church. He did  not seek to destroy it, but he was a deter mined advocate for redirection and reform,  particularly in the area of finances. When  Luther criticized the sale of indulgences, he  did more than probe at a lucrative practice  that was vital to financing Europe's Most  lavish court: he ultimately raised questions  about doctrines basic to the Church's exist ence,  including that of papal  infallibility.  However  limited  Luther's  impulse  for  reform was initially, the consequences were  dramatic.  The Air Force, like the medieval church,  is subject to the vicissitudes of institutional  life. As the Air Force matured, particularly  after it attained its independent status in  1947, goals and objectives were incorporat ed, and air doctrine was defined and devel oped.  Such  processes  are  proper  and  common for any military service. However,  if doctrine has become dogma, reformation  may be needed. Like Martin Luther, today's  military  reformer seeks  to correct rather  than to destroy. In Luther's day, it was the  Infidel Turk that actually sought to destroy  Christiandom. Today, it is the Soviets who  wish to obliviate the American way of life,  with all of our institutions. Military reform ers are neither infidel to our military ideals  nor Communist, and it would behoove us  not to use the terms heretic or adversary  too freely.  Even  the most  facile  study of history  teaches that the impulse for reform is virtu ally  irresistible  to  all but  the very  en trenched. If accommodated, reform can im prove  the  institution,  strengthening  it  through evolutionary  rather  than  revolu tionary  development. The United States  government is an example of an institution  in a continuous state of reformation. Impe rial Russia's tsarist autocracy, on the other  ",1986
50,House,99,0.635,457,1,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Chairman, while  I'm cer tainly  aware  of  the  problem  of excessive  ""holds"" on financial instruments which certain  depository  institutions  impose,  I must rise  in  opposition to H.R. 2443, the Expedited Funds  Availability Act.  Quite simply, there is not a need for Federal  legislation of this sort. Unnecessary delays in  clearing  checks and  other  financial  instru ments  is  a  localized  problem,  one which  varies from State to State and which  is best  dealt with by State authorities. Six States have  already enacted check hold funds availability  legislation best suited  to  their particular con cerns and another dozen  legislatures have  discussed possible legislation. Moving forward  with this legislation will only preempt State ef forts to construct the best possible means for  addressing this problem.  In addition to preempting the State's right to  regulate this matter, I also believe this legisla tion would ultimately raise costs for consum ers. H.R. 2443  imposes rigid, unrealistic time  schedules  on  depository  institutions.  In  a  system where 40 billion checks are written on  40,000  financial  institutions yearly,  this bill  would require depository institutions to invest  hundreds of millions of dollars in processing  systems capable of meeting these rigid, feder ally imposed payment schedules.  This legislation is also lacking in that it does  not contain a ""good faith"" exemption for pro tecting  depository  institutions  from  losses  where there is an honest and legitimate belief  that a check is uncollectable.  Who pays for this massive investment and  for uncollectable checks?  It's the consumer,  of course.  Access  to  funds  in  a  timely manner  is  something we're all  interested in, and  I don't  just mean as  legislators. Clearly, different  nancial  institutions have different policies on  the availability of  funds. But why should we  treat banking services differently  from other  goods and services in the marketplace?  As most depository_ institutions already real ize,  providing  prompt access  to  deposited  funds is good business.  If there are a few in stitutions who aren't clearing checks expedi tiously, why not  let consumers exercise  the  most persuasive and compelling sanction of  all-let them move their business elsewhere.  Along  these  lines, disclosure  requirements  would be much more effective in dealing with  ""a few rotten apples,"" as opposed to mandat ing  rigid,  unrealistic,  and  costly mandatory  availability policies.  fi ",1986
51,House,99,-0.351,457,1,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Chairman, first  let me salute our chairman for  the  leadership that he has shown on this  issue. Hopefully, this year will be the  year of the consumer in banking law.  Hopefully,  this will be  the  first of  many pieces of proconsumer  legisla tion to emerge from the Committee on  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs  to pass this body and pass the other  body.  Without the leadership of our good  chairman, this year of the consumer in  banking law might well not happen.  I would like to say to my colleagues,  I think many of you have laid out very  cogently the reasons for this legislaIt,  tion. Let me just try to put them in  context.  We are living in a world of banking  deregulation.  This  Congress  may  choose not to act, but the regulators  and  the  economy move  along  and  banking has become deregulated.  Consumers are hit with fees of every  kind, changes in rules, and changes in  laws, changes in policy. It is very hard  for a consumer who would spend all of  his or her time keeping track of these  changes  to adapt  to  those  laws,  let  alone a working man or woman who  has a family to raise.  therefore, behooves  this body,  this Congress, to do things that will be  helpful to the consumer to make sure  that a modicum of fairness exists in  this wild and wooly world of deregula tion. Elemental fairness  in saying  if  you have deposited money and  the  banks  have  taken  credit  for  your  money, you should have access and in terest. That is all this bill does. It de serves passage in an unamended form.  The CHAIRMAN. All time for gen eral debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the committee  amendment in the nature of a substi tute now printed in the reported bill  shall be considered as an original bill  for  the purpose of amendment, and  each  section shall be  considered as  having been read.  No amendments  to said substitute  are in order except pro forma amend ments and amendments printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at least 1 legis lative day prior to consideration.

Mr. Chairman, I  ask unanimous consent that the com mittee amendment in the nature of a  substitute be printed  in  the RECORD  and open to amendment at any point.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Rhode Island?  There was no objection.

52,House,99,0.556,470,1,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I appreciate  the gentleman's raising  the question. It is a very good point  and one that needs to be understood  by Members.  As  I understand  it,  there are now  five States that have similar laws to  this one governing the subject of avail  ability of deposited funds. In four of  those  States,  those  being  Rhode  Island,  Connecticut, Massachusetts,  and New York,  there is a goodfaith  exception which can be utilized by  banks to put a hold upon checks pre  sented for deposit.  The fifth State, California, as I have  mentioned in an earlier colloquy, has a  law which very closely parallels my  amendment which I have offered here.  It outlines three specific areas and re  quires on the part of the bank a rea  sonable belief  in  those areas, rather  than just an unfettered grant of dis  cretion, before one of the exceptions  could be invoked.  D 1455  So there is a patchwork quilt being  developed, because not all States have  the same kind of law.  ",1986

Mr. Chairman, I am not a member of  this  committee,  but  I  have  been  watching the debate and attending to  the debate. I have some comments I  would like to make.  I think the Shumway amendment is  wellintended,  wellsupported  and  ought to be added to this bill.  The gentleman from Georgia CMr.  BARNARD]  started out by saying that  the bank has an alternative. The bank  simply can refuse to accept payment  of a check. They can refuse to put the  check in the process of collection. We  ought to expose the fallacy in that.  Tellers do not have the knowledge,  the information with which to intelli  gently make that particular decision.  That decision is going to have to be  made, if it deals with check kitingMr. ST GERMAIN. Mr. Chairman,  will  the  gentleman  yield  on  that  point?  ",1986

56,House,99,0.46,483,1,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and  I  rise  in support of  the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I know the hour is  late on Thursday afternoon, but the  Shumway substitute which he offers, I  call  to  the attention of  the entire  House,  in fact,  resolves  the problem  that has been discussed by this commit tee during the debate on the amend ment in committee and subcommittee  and by the Committee of the Whole all  afternoon. What the Shumway amend ment does, and it is quite a courageous  amendment to offer, it is against the  tide  on  the House  floor;  it  an  amendment  that I  think speaks for  the consumers of this country to give  the consumers a  choice. The differ ence between the Shumway substitute  and the committee bill  is very, very  plain. The Shumway substitute would  leave the choice as to what type of ac count, what type of hold, if any, and  what type of interest rate, and what  type of cost to the consumer. And the  consumer then is allowed to be a rea sonable and  reasoned and  informed  shopper. I would say to the gentlemen  on the other side, the sponsors of the  main bill,  that  there  is  a  problem.  There  is a problem  in  this country  with deposits  that are held  for  too  long. But the problem is the frustra tion of consumers who are not  told  about those holds and do not have an  informed  choice.  The  Shumway  amendment resolves that problem be cause it ensures that consumers would  then be  informed when  they open  their account at every day subsequent  to that opening with each deposit as  to what their choices are. So a con sumer then goes to their financial in stitution and is told, without having to  ask under the Shumway substitute, is  told what the policies are and what  the costs would be and what the inter est rate is for that account. Then if  the consumer decides that that is not  their  package,  they  go  across  the  street or down the street or across the  is  way and  find a  financial  institution  that meets their specific needs.  Let me be very specific: This substi tute provides for an informed choice  so that a  financial  institution under  this substitute could off er a higher in terest rate with a longer hold, tell the  depositor about it, and if that fits the  depositor's needs,  the depositor will  accept that account, or the financial  institution could offer no hold, offer  immediate credit on all deposits with a  lower interest rate to account for the  additional cost. And  if that fits  the  consumer need,  then  the consumer  chooses that kind of account.  With  the Shumway substitute  the  depositor is the king, the consumer is  the king. With the committee bill the  Government  is  the king,  the regula tors, as the gentleman from New York  said, and I admire him a great deal,  but he said it. He said he wanted to  help the regulators make the decisions  for the consumers of this country. I do  not  think when  the Congress  really  examines this problem that they will  conclude that that is the right way to  solve it because it is not a solution. It  creates a bigger problem. It says we  are going to return to the days of no  choice, that the Government is going  to decide what rate, what date, hours  of service, what accounts, what type of  accounts. I know the gentleman would  not add all of that, but that is the di rection.  So  I would  implore  the House  to  avoid  the  fashion  of  being  heavy handed, voting just for the title of the  bill, to vote for the consumer, for the  consumer choice, and for a disclosure  substitute.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment in the nature of a sub stitute offered by the gentleman from  California [Mr. SHUMWAY].  The question was  taken;  Chairman announced  that  appeared to have it.  and  the  the noes  RECORDED VOTE  ",1986
57,,99,0.378,522,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, on De cember 11, 1985,  the House approved  the  Compact of Free Association between  the  United States and  the constitutional govern ments of the Federated States of Micronesia  and  the Marshall  Islands. On December 13,  1985, the Senate also passed the joint resolu tion approving  the compact. That  legislation  has also now been signed by the President,  and  the compact will  take effect  in accord ance with  its  terms and  in conjunction with  termination of the U.N. trusteeship.  The compact  is a comprehensive govern ment-to-government agreement. Because of  the exhaustive  record created  in connection  with congressional  review of  the compact,  I  will not  take  the  time on  this occasion  to  review all of its elements or implications.  However,  there  is one aspect of the com pact which I would like to address. I am refer ring to section 177 of the compact and the re lated provisions for settlement of all claims of  Marshallese citizens arising from the U.S. nu clear testing program  in the Marshall  Islands  following World War  II. Upon personally  re viewing the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD with re spect to the compact,  I discovered  that last  minute questions were  raised  regarding pur ported  ""constitutional  issues"" which  some  parties may seek to raise with respect to the  section 177 settlement agreement.  If the section 177 agreement is challenged  in the courts, it is the view of the Department  of  Justice  and  the Department  of State,  whose representatives testified on the section  177 agreement during our hearings on  the  compact,  that  the United States will prevail  and that the constitutionality of this agreement  will be affirmed. I tend to agree with the state ments on this subject made in the section-by section analysis of  the compact offered by  Senator McCLURE, chairman of the committee  which had jurisdiction over the compact in the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Senate. In the December 13, 1985, CONGRES SIONAL RECORD  at page S17651, Senator  McCLURE makes it clear that the section 177  agreement  is  intended by Congress  to be a  ""full and final settlement of all nuclear effects  claims."" He goes on to remind us that those  who are generating questions about the con stitutionality of  the settlement,  including  the  espousal provisions, may be promoting pro tracted litigation rather than compensation for  the victims.  Senator McCLURE also refers to Senate and  House agreement  to expressly endorse  the  espousal provisions  in section 103(g) of  the  resolution  approving  the  compact.  As  a  member of both the Foreign Affairs and Interi or  and  Insular Affairs Committees  of  the  House, the two committees which had original  jurisdiction over the compact and section 177  agreement in the House,  I participated in the  agreement to which Senator McCLURE refers.  I can confirm  that  it was  the  intent of Con gress that the section 177 be fully implement ed strictly  in accordance with  its  terms, and  that the final version of section 103(g) of the  resolution represents our rejection of the earli er versions of that provision.  In response to some of the questions that  have been raised I would like to make the fol lowing statements:  As Congress prepared for review of the ne gotiated  compact,  the  Congressional  Re search Service was asked  to  take a critical  look at the document. That study was for the  purpose of  raising every conceivable ques tion-in some cases even  if somewhat  far fetched or  implausible-about all aspects of  the compact, so that the members would be  aware of all  possible  issues and potential  problems. The GAS study done on  the com pact was useful, in that the document assisted  the members  in  formulating questions  that  were submitted to the administration. Howev er, it is a distortion to rely upon the GAS study  of the compact without also looking at the ad ministration's responses, as well as the tran scripts of our hearings and the committee re ports which also contain administration views  on these matters. In the end, the Members of  the Congress who were most actively involved  with  these  issues, and  I am  included  in  that  category, were satisfied that the administration  had answered those questions. We came  to  the conclusion  that  the section 177 agree ment is consistent with  international  law and  U.S. constitutional practice. The  fact that we  recognize that courts may be asked by plain tiffs in some of the court cases to review the  validity of  the compact and  the section 177  agreement does not alter the clear meaning of  the settlement provisions or the provisions of  section 103(g) of the resolution approving the  compact.  There is one point that is seldom mentioned  by those who purport to be concerned about  the rights of the Marshallese claimants.  I am  referring  to  the  fact  that  the percentage of  people voting for the compact and the section  177 agreement was significantly higher in the  atolls and  islands of the Marshall  Islands in habited by claimants than it was in the Mar shall  Islands generally. The  lawyers involved  in these lawsuits visitied these atolls regularly  and especially just before  the vote and  told  the people to reject the compact and the secJanuary 23, 1986  tion 177 agreement so that they could pursue  their remedies in court. The choice presented  to the claimants as voters was clear, and the  U.N.  report on  the plebiscite  finds  that  the  people voted freely. The people knew exactly  what their implications of their vote were, and  they voted to approve the settlement as part  of the compact. Again, most of the claimant  groups voted to approve at a higher rate then  the genreal population. Thus, there is no basis  for the argument that the rights of the claim ants were subsumed in the vote of the gener al population on the overall agreement. In the  major population centers where claimant pop ulation is smaller, the vote for the agreement  is  lower  than  in  the claimant atolls and  is lands. But even  in the Marshall  Islands as a  whole  the vote was decisive  in  favor of the  compact and the section 177 settlement. This  fact is too often ignored by those supposedly  speaking on behalf of claimant rights.  There have been a lot of questions about  the validity of espousal. The arguments we  have heard questioning the espousal mecha nism seem to have  little connection with the  factual and  legal bases of  the section 177  agreement. After considering  the views ex pressed by all sides, it seems clear that when  the people of the Marshall  Islands,  including  the  claimants,  exercise  their  sovereignty  through  their  constitutional  government  to  enter  into  a  settlement,  and  then  these  people, who retain  their  inherent sovereignty  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they are  in a  transition  from  non-self-governing  status  to  self-government,  expressly  and  specifically  affirm  that exercise of sovereignty  in a free  vote, then any conceivable test of internation al  law with respect to the rights of the claim ants has been met. I am referring generally to  fairness and equity here. The espousal proc ess  itself  is a government-to-government ar rangement that is well-established and recog nized under international  law and U.S. prac tice. The Marshall  Islands Government made  its decision  to espouse  these  claims,  the  United States recognized the authority of the  Marshall  Islands to make that decision within  the context of its constitution and the state of  affairs as the trusteeship is drawing to a close  and the transition to self-government is nearly  complete. The section 177 agreement meets  all the legal tests I know of-and then some by providing a tribunal for adjudication of addi tional claims, as well as recognizing the possi bility of ""changed circumstances"" and  future  ex gratia measures. Anyone who studies the  agreement, instead of listening only to the ar guments of those who thrive on litigation, will  recognize why Congress approved  this very  fair and comprehensive settlement.

The Rehabilitation Act is very important, Mr.  Speaker.  It provides the mechanism by which  the States and the Federal Government have  maintained  a  successful  partnership  for a  number of years. This partnership has worked  to  the benefit of our economy by providing  employment-related assistance  to  individuals  who are disabled, thereby increasing the con tributions by such individuals to our economy.  It also helps some persons with disabilities  maintain a  level of  independence  that adds  immeasurably to the quality of their lives, and  thus, enr:ches us all.  The Subcommittee on Select Education has  held five hearings around  the country and  in  Washington. We have heard  from many wit nesses, representing individuals, governments,  and rehabilitation organizations. Out of these  many helpful discussions have come the sug gestions that are now incorporated in this pro posed reauthorization bill.  I referred to the changes as ""modest."" Wit nesses  pointed  out  a  variety  of  problem  issues that minor statutory changes could re solve. For example, this bill modifies the defi nition of local agency in order to ensure that  Indian organizations are included in this defini tion. Other examples of such modest changes  would  include adding a requirement  that the  annual  report go  to  the Congress simulta neously with its delivery to the President and  making the language gender-free.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Several management changes are also pro posed in this legislation. Currently, the Office  of Special Education and Rehabilitation Serv ices consists of three units, the Office of Spe cial Education, the Rehabilitation Service Ad ministration,  and  the National  Institute  for  Handicapped Research. The heads of these  units  report  to  the Assistant Secretary. The  head of special education is appointed by the  Secretary; the remaining two are appointed by  the President.  In  this  legislation  all  three  would become secretarial level appointees to  a Presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary.  The changes would become effective upon a  vacancy in the current slots.  Examples of other management changes in clude increasing the public membership of the  Architectural  and  Transportation  Barriers  Board, to balance an increase in the Federal  agency members  that occurred when HEW  became HHS and DOE, and specifying  that  the chairman of that board is elected from the  public members.  This legislation would require that the Direc tor of  the National  Institute of Handicapped  Research, working with the lnteragency Com mittee, come up with recommendations for es tablishment of some type of agency or mech anism  for ensuring  the development of cost effective production and marketing of techno logical devices and the efficient distribution of  such to persons with disabilities.  However,  there  is one change  that  is not  modest and I would be remiss in not pointing  it out  to my colleagues. Presently, and  for  sqme time, the Rehabilitation Act contains an  80-20 match requirement. The Federal share  is 80 percent. Repeatedly, we have heard  from State directors of rehabilitation agencies  and from others that the system is not serving  anywhere close to the true number of individ uals who might be eligible for such services. It  is equally clear that  investment  in  rehabilita tion  is a sound  investment;  the returns out weigh the costs. Therefore, it is time that the  States begin to take a greater role in this part nership that is so beneficial to all our citizens.  I am proposing  in  this  legislation  to change  the match  to 75-25, and at the same  time,  ensure  that  the States' contributions do not  drop below their fiscal year 1985 levels.  Finally, the bill also includes language to re authorize the Helen Keller National Center Act  for 3 years and would authorize  funding  for  that center at current levels.  533  Mr.  Speaker,  I  believe  the  proposed  changes reflect sound policy. The Subcommit tee on Select Education will soon hold hear ings on this bill, and we welcome the input of  everyone concerned about  rehabilitation as  we move  to  finalize  this  legislation  in  the  coming months.  LEGISLATION THAT PROHIBITS  THE PURCHASE OF SOVIET EN RICHMENT  SERVICES  FOR  UNITED  STATES  NUCLEAR  POWERPLANTS  HON. MARILYN LLOYD  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 23, 1986  ",1986
60,,99,-0.058,535,1,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I have today in troduced a bill which prohibits nuclear electric  power utilities in the United States from pur chasing uranium enrichment services from the  Soviet Union.  The United States operates a uranium en richment program through the Department of  Energy, and it is intended to be fully self-suffi cient through the revenues  it generates from  the customers  it serves.  In  the recent past,  the demand for uranium enrichment services  has been substantially reduced causing a sig nificant  retrenchment  in  the Government's  program and  the closure of one of the Gov ernment's three uranium enrichment plants in  the United States.  Soviet Union sales of enrichment services  to domestic utilities  impair  the ability of  the  United States to continue its uranium enrich ment program, which the United States oper ates without a profit for the benefit of electric  ratepayers.  The Soviet Union does not operate its ura nium enrichment business on the principles of  a free market society. They offer this enrich ment services at a discount  from whatever  level is established as the price of enrichment  services in the United States.  The Soviet Union  is an unfair competitor  and enrichment service sales to U.S. citizens  detract  from  the national energy security of  the United States.  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this leg islation.  ",1986
61,,99,-0.552,587,1,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to call to the attention of the House  of Representatives the National Cancer lnsti tute's  [NCI]  ""Community Mobilization  for  Smoking Cessation Project."" NCI should be  applauded  for both  its  research  focus and  community approach  to smoking prevention  and cessation in the general population.  NCI has distinguished itself among the Na tional Institute of Health by introduction of re search initiatives in black and Hispanic popu lations where there eixsts a higher incidence  of  smoking.  These  large-scale  community  based smoking prevention and cessation ef forts are major stepping stones toward NCl's  goal of 50 percent  reduction  in  the cancer  rate,  and  the Surgeon General's goal  of  wiping out smoking by the year 2000.  Richmond, CA., a city I am privileged to rep resent, has been chosen as one of the model  research sites. Having witnessed the commu nity effort prior to the actual funding, I am de lighted to have aid in securing this recognition.  The Richmond community's preliminary activi ties brought  together smokers, nonsmokers,  public and private sector representatives alike  to work on this public health concern.  NCI has now provided the vehicle to assist  their efforts and validate  their effectiveness  with a $2 million grant.  Mr. Speaker,  I am honored and privileged  that  the Seventh Congressional District has  become one of the beneficiaries of this part nership. The  results will help reduce  the  in creased  incidences of cancer, of related  ill nesses, and of the needless deaths which ac companies smoking. The efforts of our citi zens, together with NCI, will serve as a model  for other communities which want to provide  similar services to their residents.  I also want to call attention to the four lead ers of one Richmond project who have come  to Washington  this week  to  inaugurate  the  anti-smoking effort: Enid Hunkeler, project di rector,  Bess Anderson-McNeal,  community  participation coordinator, Dr. Leonard Syme,  principal  investigator, and Larry Hill, project  coordinator.

DAVIDS. SPERBER  HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 27, 1986  ",1986
63,,99,-0.473,587,1,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, on March 2,  1986, David S. Sperber will be honored as  ""Man of the Year"" by Chabad of the Valley  for his outstanding contributions to the com munity.  David Sperber, a well-known attorney  in  southern California and  former deputy attor ney general of the State of California, has de voted much of his time to a multitude of civic  and humanitarian causes. Among his affili ations are membership to the Lawyers Club,  Los Angeles County Bar Association, San Fer nando Valley Criminal Bar Association, Feder al Criminal Indigent Defense Panel, Los Ange les Trial Lawyers Association, and California  trial Lawyers Association.  Mr. Sperber's community activities  include  participation in the Junior Barristers Parble Aid  Program; president of the Board of Trustees  of Hear Center; member of  the Board of  Trustees Hillel Hebrew Academy; associate  chairman of the United Jewish Welfare Fund  (metropolitan division); member of the City At torney's Criminal Procedure Committee; co chairman of the Chabad Bar Mitzvah Celebra tion; chairman of the Legal Committee, Yeshi va University Holocaust Center.  Of Mr. Sperber's many philanthropic and  civic activities, the one which has received the  lion's share of his attention has been Chabad  of the Valley. This organization is the San Fer nando Valley branch of the worldwide Luba vitcher movement which is under the leader ship of the renowned Lubavitcher Rebbe Men achem Mendel Schneerson.  The work  of  Chabad ranges from elementary Jewish edu cation  to senior citizen activities. Chabad of  the Valley maintains four synagogues, a coun seling service, and an extensive outreach pro gram to bring the moral and spiritual values of  Judaism to the unaffiliated.  David S. Sperber reflects  in his character  and community activities the values manifest  in  the  Hebrew  acronym  which  ChaBaD  spells-chochma  (wisdom),  binah  (knowl edge), and daas (understanding).  I ask the Members to join me in congratulat ing David S. Sperber, his wife Jeanine Rose marie, and children, Toby, Elliot, Joshua, and  Mara on this special occasion. May the years  ahead continue  to be filled with happy and  meaningful experiences and pursuits.  ",1986
64,House,99,-0.479,600,1,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to  revise and extend their remarks on the  resolution now under consideration.  The SPEAKER. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  California?  There was no objection.  ",1986
65,House,99,-0.37,600,1,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join with millions of Americans-young and  old-in expressing our sorrow and grief over  the  tragic  loss of  the seven astronauts  this  morning aboard the space shuttle Challenger.  My  thoughts and prayers go out  today  to  the  families and  loved ones of  these seven  heroes. We mourn them in death and we vow  never to forget the lessons they taught us in  life-that we must  reach  for  the stars and  seize . all the opportunities and challenges we  can.  As we grieve today for the six professional  astronauts who were on board the Challenger,  we each share special sorrow at  the  tragic  death of Christa McAuliffe who was to be the  first teacher in space.  While I did not know Mrs. McAuliffe person ally, I certainly knew of her.  I knew that she  and her husband once lived in Maryland and I  knew  that she came back  to our State  this  past fall to speak to students and teachers in  Prince Georges County where she once lived  and taught.  During her remarks last fall, Christa McAu liffe told the teachers and students of Prince  Georges County how proud she was to have  been selected to represent her profession and  her Nation on a space shuttle flight. She chal lenged teachers and students alike to ""reach  for the stars"" in everything they do; she urged  them to always do the best they can and  to  be true to themselves.  Christa McAuliffe said she is in  touch with  the future every day because she is a teacher,  touching the lives of the very people who rep resent our future-our students.  These seven heroes died today not as indi viduals but as a team. They represented the  best America has to offer; they embodied the  same spirit, energy and  life  that President  Kennedy saw in all of us when he called us to  reach for new frontiers.  President Kennedy wasn't  just calling on  our astronauts to seek these new frontiers, he  was calling on all of us. He would have been  as proud of these seven heroes as all of us  are,  he would  have mourned  their  tragic  deaths, and he would have urged us to contin ue to ""reach for the stars"" and so do I.  ",1986
66,House,99,0.346,600,1,Mr. STANGELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  I share  the  shock and  sadness  felt by  the entire  Nation over  the  loss of  the space shuttle  Challenger and  its crew of seven astronauts.  The men and women who go into space are  special people.  I have met with former astro nauts in Washington, and they are motivated  by a special sense of mission.  Today we  lost seven adventurers,  seven  heroes. In many ways, they represent the best  America has to offer. They were conscious of  the danger, but eager to push back the limits  of human knowledge.  Our prayers are with  the souls of the  crew and with their families.  lost  There should be a comprehensive NASA in vestigation of  the  fiery explosion which de stroyed  the spacecraft. But  I emphasize  the  need to continue the space program.  We must mourn our dead, take care of their  families,  learn from  the tragedy, and turn our  eyes to the stars again.  ",1986
67,House,99,-0.404,600,1,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, the tragic death  of the space shuttle astronauts touches each  of us  in a very personal and emotional way.  As a nation, we share a great sense of loss.  These pioneers carried with them the hopes  and  dreams  of  all  Americans. We  draw  strength from their courage.  ",1986
68,House,99,-0.438,600,1,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, at  11 :38  this morning, a group of seven astro nauts on the space shuttle Challenger, includ ing  the  first private citizen,  teacher Christa  McAuliffe, lost their lives in a terrible accident  some 9 miles above the coast of Cape Canav eral. Words cannot express  the grief  that  I  and all Americans  feel  for  these  individuals,  and their loved ones.  After 24  successful  shuttle  flights, many  Americans took the frequent flights as routine.  I can guarantee you,  the men and women  who participated in every one of the previous  24 missions understood the dangers involved,  and they proceeded undaunted.  As we have become accustomed  to  their  successes, we tend to forget that these astro nauts risk  their  lives each time they step on  board. Our Nation has reaped the benefits of  their courage. We owe it to  those lost today  that every effort be made to understand the  circumstances behind the events of this morn ing.  ",1986
69,House,99,-0.407,600,1,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker, along with all of  my colleagues,  I am deeply saddened at the  loss of the Challenger crew members in  this  morning's tragic accident. Our Nation will long  mourn the passing of these brave and coura geous young Americans who  lost  their  lives  serving their country's space exploration pro gram.  ",1986
70,Senate,99,-0.329,613,1,Mr. MELCHER.," Madam President,  next week on February 7 the people of  the Philippines go to the polls to vote  in  the  first Presidential election  in  years to determine the future of their  republic.  I believe it is clear to Americans and  Filipinos alike that the time has come  for changes  in  their government  to  turn  around  the  growing  economic  hardships,  the military  abuses,  and  the use of extraordinary constitution al powers  to restrict  individual free doms.  For the past 18 months or longer, re lations with the Philippines have been  misguided. The State Department has  blocked sales of wheat, dairy products,  and other goods while orchestrating a  chorus of charges of corruption about  the election process and the principals  involved. Further,  the State Depart ment,  in pursuit of  their  ill-defined  policy  of  goals  and objectives, has  alienated  Filipinos  and  damaged  United States producers. This course  loses sight of  the objectives of  the  election  itself. We are  focusing  too  closely on February 7 and not enough  on February 8 and beyond.  While the end of the Marcos 20-year  regime appears to be desirable, it is a  decision for the Filipinos to make-not  for the United States to dictate. We do  have a vital stake in the outcome of  the  election. Paramount  in United  States vital interests are the strategic  location of the Philippines for United  States  trade and military bases and  neither of these interests is served by  the nitty-gritty of political partisan ship.  Retaining  our  strategic  military  bases at Subic Bay  and Clark Air  Force Base  is essential regardless of  who will  lead  that Pacific  nation.  There are no worthy substitute base  locations in any other islands of the  far western rim of the Pacific.  For trade, the United States domi nates the Pacific rim and the gateway  to Southeast Asian trade in the Philip pines. With 54 million persons,  it is  the leading market for U.S. agricultur",1986
71,Senate,99,-0.435,639,1,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, we  are stunned and deeply saddened by  today's event at Cape Canaveral.  The  loss  of  the  seven men  and  women aboard the shuttle is a tragedy  which  touches  all Americans. They  were individuals of vigor, accomplish ment, and hope, who represented the  best of America.  Mr.  President,  those  who  have  sought to advance the frontiers of our  knowledge, to expand our understand ing of science and our environment,  have always undertaken extraordinary  risks. The Challenger team followed in  that tradition of courageous  individ uals dedicated to a better world and a  brighter future.  Mr. President, as the Nation honors  these  brave men  and women,  our  thoughts and prayers are with their  families  and  their  communities  to  whom they gave so much.  ",1986
72,Senate,99,0.185,639,1,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr.  President,  today all of us are extremely moved by  the tragedy at Cape Canaveral. The  Shuttle Program has been fate  free  for 24 flights. But today, on perhaps  the most  highly  publicized  flight,  seven of America's finest have  lost  their lives.  What was projected to be a coup for  the educational community, our chil dren, and teachers nationwide, has re sulted in the fate of a  teacher from  Concord, NH, Sharon Christa McAu liffe. Christa was selected from among  over  11,000  applicants  to  represent  teachers nationwide. She had been  studying since September 1985, to de velop the lesson plans for two classes  that she was  to have  taught  from  space. Thousands  of  schoolchildren  nationwide  eagerly  anticipated  this  new dimension in their learning.  When Christa was selected last year,  educational  associations  nationwide  banded together with pride to encour age  teachers  and  children  alike  to  keep their porch lights on from 7 p.m.  on Thursday evening until 7 a.m. on  Friday morning-the morning  that  Christa was scheduled  to  teach her  first lesson. In memory of the entire  crew, Americans are being encouraged  to keep those lights on. A tragic turn  of events.  Christa  represented  our Nation's  teachers extremely well. She exuded  confidence and a tremendous love for  learning. Her training, which included  instruction in weightlessness and con finement  in a black bag  to simulate  conditions in space, was a constant ad venture. And she was not willing  to  put herself in the limelight. Rather,  she gave constant credit to her fell ow  educators and astronauts.  I ask Americans nationwide to pray  for  the  immediate  families  of  the  seven  shuttle members. America  is  stunned by this event, and I hope and  pray that we would band together in  support of one another.  ",1986
73,Senate,99,-0.095,639,1,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, like all  Americans and all people around the  globe who  recognize  the  value  of  human life, I was filled with complete  and total shock when I first learned of  the horrible tragedy which struck the  space shuttle Challenger and its seven member crew. The memory of this dis aster will remain with us always, as  will  the dreadful, sinking, emotional  feeling I am sure we all experienced as  we learned of the explosion.  We have not yet learned all the de tails of the tragedy. We still do not  know what caused  the explosion or  what could have been done to prevent  it. We can be certain, however,  that  the incident will be probed and investi gated until we have learned all that  can be learned. I have always been a  fervent supporter of our Space Pro gram, but,  in our quest  for  further  learning about the Moon, the planets,  and the stars, we cannot lose sight of  the necessity of taking every possible  safety precaution.  Just a little more than 19 years ago,  on January 27, 1967, three Apollo as tronauts were killed during a  test of  their spacecraft. In the wake of that  tragedy, which was the only previous  loss of life during training or perform ance of a NASA  flight, we basically  placed  the Space Program on hold  while  instituting greater safeguards.  Today, it is just as necessary that we  gain even greater strength from this  tragic occurrence, and I am fully confi dent  that NASA will  become  even  more determined than ever to fulfill  the greatest possible role in exploring  our  last  frontier  in  the  absolutely  safest environment possible.  The Space Shuttle Program  has  been one of the greatest technological  achievements  in the history of man kind,  and  all Americans have been  proud of the growth of the program.  We must not look at this tragedy as a  betrayal of the Shuttle Program, but  as a turning point for even greater ef forts.  In spite of this calamity, NASA has  had a remarkable record of safety and  efficiency.  One  cannot  witness  a  launch without  realizing  the danger  from  the  fire,  the  thrust,  and  the  power. Nevertheless, this horrible ex plosion should renew and strengthen  our efforts to protect human life as we  continue to explore the unknowns of  space.  The seven patrotic Americans who  lost their lives during this tragic acci dent-Francis <Dick) Scobee, Michael  Smith, Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik,  Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and  Christa McAuliff e-will always live in  our memories. Their efforts on behalf  of our Space Program must not go un noticed or unrewarded; it would be a  fitting legacy, one of which I am sure  they would be proud, for us to learn  from and grow because of their loss,  for then they will surely not have died  in vain. To  their  loved ones,  their  friends,  their  coworkers,  go  our  thoughts and our prayers.  ",1986
74,Senate,99,-0.293,639,1,Mr. HOLLINGS.,"  Mr.  President,  today is a sad day in the U.S. Space  Program. The tragic explosion of the  shuttle orbiter Challenger this morn ing has shocked the Nation and has  dealt a  severe blow  to  the Nation's  Space Program.

Dick Scobee,  Michael Smith, Judith Resnik, Ronald  McNair,  Ellison  Onizuka,  Gregory  Jarvis, and Christa McAuliff e will not  be forgotten, nor will their dreams and  aspirations.

77,House,99,0.168,678,1,Mr. MILLER of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise in support of this bill.  I want to congratulate my colleague,  the gentleman from Washington CMr.  SWIFT], for his fine work in addressing  a very difficult problem.  Mr. Chairman, throughout the his tory of this Nation, we have battled to  preserve the right of every American  citizen to cast his or her ballot freely  and without any undue  interference  on election day. The battle started  back in the l 700's at the Constitution al Convention. Then  in  the  early  1800's  there was  a  battle  against  having property rights interfere with  voting. And  then  the battle against  having race interfere with voting. And  then  the battle against having  sex  interfere with voting.  Well, those were battles against too  little knowledge, ignorance, prejudice.  Today we have a new obstacle to the  right to vote. Instead of knowing too  little, today we know too much. New  techniques have created a technologi cal global village where there are in stant error-free election predictions,  where the news media competes with  each other to put out the news so that  we know instantly across the Nation  who is going to win, and the would-be  voter on the west coast is very discour aged from voting, from exercising that  franchise that we have fought for.  My colleague, who not coincidently  is himself a former broadcast journal ist, has found a cure for the problem,  and it is a cure that is not as bad or  worse than the disease. This bill, by  extending daylight savings  time and  modifying poll closings is a thoughful  and effective answer to our dilemma.  I believe this bill deserves our sup port and it continues that fight that  started hundreds of years ago to make  sure that all of us have a right to vote  without interference.  ",1986

Indeed, the season was an especially  cold  one  for  an  estimated  workers  nationwide-about  1,000 in New York alone-who had lost  their jobs to foreign competition and  until last month were receiving cash  assistance under  the Trade Adjust ment Assistance Program.  On December 19, the Department of  Labor ceased paying the extended un employment benefits-trade readjust ment allowances-available to workers  under the TAA Program.  The result of the cutoff is clear. For  those who had failed  to  find a  job  using their existing skills or had not  completed training to learn new skills,  and had exhausted their regular un employment benefits, paying the rent  and putting food on the table became  a much more difficult proposition.  I might also note, Mr. President,  that technical and financial assistance  for firms that are trying to adapt and  adjust to import competition, by im proving their production processes or  changing  their  line  of work,  also  ceased on December 19. The Depart ment  of  Commerce-International  Trade Administration-notified the 13  regional  trade adjustment assistance  centers-the administrative vehicle for  delivering  aid-that  no  additional  funds or technical assistance could be  granted, no new applications accepted,  and that phaseout plans must com mence as of February 7, 1986.  The arguable basis for the two de partment's actions can be found, if one  looks carefully, in the final days of the  first session's legislative bog. In order  that we might all have a clear under",1986
92,Senate,99,-0.395,977,1,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, on Janu ary 20, we honored the memory of a  great fighter for  justice and human  rights,  the Reverend Martin Luther  King, Jr.  It so happened  that that  same day marked the 38th birthday of  another brave  champion of human  rights,  Anatoly  Shcharansky,  the  Soviet dissident. Mr. Shcharansky  is  serving a 13-year prison term because  of his outspoken defense of fundamen tal human freedoms.  Shcharansky had become the unoffi cial spokesman of the Jewish emigra tion movement in the U.S.S.R. when  he was arrested on March 15, 1977,  and charged with treason. Held incom municado for 16 months, he was tried  for alleged anti-Soviet agitation and  spying for the CIA in April 1978. In  July  of  that  year,  he  received  a  sentence of 3 years in prison and 10  years of forced labor.  After surviving the first part of his  punishment-a 3-year stint in the no torious  Chistopol  Prison-he  was  transferred to the Perm Labor Camp  where he continued to suffer official  abuse. At Perm in 1981 Shcharansky  was subjected to 185 days in a punish ment cell <where prisoners are  fed  once every 2 days) for a series of ""in fractions,"" including attempts to prac tice his  religion. This maltreatment  culminated  in October 1981 when a  three-man  kangaroo  court  decreed  that  in  retaliation  for  refusing  to  ""admit his guilt,"" Shcharansky be sent  back to Chistopol Prison for another 3  years.  To protest the cutting off of all com munication with his family, Shchar ansky went on a prolonged hunger  strike  in 1982. As a  result of  this  hunger strike and  the generally de plorable  conditions  of  his  confine ment, he has suffered serious health  problems.  Shcharansky is back in Perm Labor  Camp now, and his health continues  to deteriorate. Information received by  his wife early this year indicates that  he has been given an additional 5month sentence to be served in an iso lation cell within the labor camp. The  fact that he is still being punished for  ""infractions"" seems  to  indicate  that  his spirit has not been broken. The cir cumstances Shcharansky  has  faced  over the past 9 years would have de stroyed many other people. He  is  indeed an individual of rare courage  and strength of conviction.  Anatoly Shcharansky's only desire is  to be allowed to join his wife Avita! in  Israel. Since his imprisonment, count",1986
93,,99,0.269,1003,1,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, we are all fa miliar with  the wry saying:  ""Everybody com plains about  the weather but nobody does  anything about it."" The same might be said for  military reform. Many Senators and Congress men,  including myself,  have been working  hard in this area for several years now, but I  still have a nagging sense that we have failed  to get to the root causes of many of our mili tary difficulties.  I am today introducing two bills which, in my  view,  represent  the  first steps  toward  the  eventual dismantlement of what has been  called  the  ""military-congressional complex"";  that is, the collection of interconnected execu tive branch and congressional national securi ty entities which,  to a  large extent, dictates  how America will be defended. The following  is an overview of the problems caused by the  ""complex"" and an explanation of how my leg islation would attack the problem.  Over  the  last  two decades, we have wit nessed a well-intentioned series of efforts to  reform our military apparatus and increase its  combat effectiveness and peacetime efficien cy. Some of these reforms have succeeded;  others have not. The cumulative result, how ever, has been  the creation of a huge bu reaucracy  that  is slow, cumbersome,  ineffi cient, and frequently unaccountable to political  control. In the realm of defense procurement,  the disturbing examples of overpriced  items  result not from perturbations  in  the procure ment  system,  but,  paradoxically,  from  the  system  functioning according  to plan. When  simple procurement decisions are made by  dozens of Government officials  in different  agencies, we should not be surprised when  long  delays and  exorbitant  costs  are  the  common result.  The bureaucratic proliferation has occurred  on both sides of the Potomac. For its part, the  Congress has vastly expanded  its Pentagon  oversight activities since shortly after the Viet nam war. Congressional military  oversight  panels have ballooned from four committees  ",1986
94,,99,0.43,1016,1,Mr. KRAMER.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  long  been a supporter of a strong synthetic fuels  program. During my first term  in Congress,  I  was honored to be the only Republican Rep resentative  from  the Rocky Mountain States  asked  to serve on  the  joint House-Senate  Energy Committee, which developed the legis lation that set up the Synthetic Fuels Corpora tion.  Following a commitment  from  the Federal  Government, western Colorado invested sub stantial  time and money  in an  infrastructure  which would support the needs of the Union  and Cathedrahl Bluffs oil shale projects.  Last month,  the Government  broke  promise to these Coloradans.  I would like to share with you an article from  the Dallas Morning News which accurately re flects my sentiment  in support of synthetic  fuels and the hard work of the SFC Chairman  Ed Noble. I ask that this information be print ed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  CFrom the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 15,  1986]  SYNTHETIC FuELS ENDEAVOR LEAVES  UNDETERMINED LEGACY  <By Jim Landers)  WASHINGTON.-Like a great elephant re peatedly wounded by hunters, Synthetic  its  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Fuel Corp. stayed on its feet for a long time  before a  final  javelin blow from Congress  last month brought it down.  The corporation was born in the 1980 Ira nian oil crisis and killed five years later by a  Congress more worried by budget deficits  than oil imports. It may take another five  years to discover how much of a contribu tion the corporation made to the country's  energy security by backing  four projects  with about $1.5 billion in federal funds, be cause that contribution is dependent on the  future course of oil prices.  If oil prices keep  falling,  the synthetic  fuels campaign of the 1980s will seem like a  waste of taxpayer money. The Reagan ad ministration under  the urging of Energy  Secretary James Herrington, adopted  this  view at a December Cabinet meeting.  ""The administration no  longer believes  continued funding of the Synthetic Fuels  Corp. serves any useful purpose,"" Budget  Director James Miller wrote Congress on  Dec. 12. The letter doomed the efforts of  some senators to keep the corporation alive.  If oil prices soar, then the four projects  backed by  the corporation could provide  energy companies with a quick means of de veloping plants  that  turn coal and shale  into oil and gas. Project sponsors and the  outgoing directors of the corporation have  taken  this view and expect  the country's  gratitude will be apparent  in another 10  years.  Together, the four projects backed by the  corporation are designed to add the equiva lent of 22,000 barrels a day of oil production  <current domestic projection is 8.9 million  barrels a day) to the nation's energy base.  The corporation spent far less money and  backed far fewer projects than its support ers envisioned. Six years ago, Congress and  the Carter administration talked of an $88  billion synthetic fuels effort. About $19 bil lion actually was appropriated by Congress,  and the corporation was given $15.3 billion  of that.  Synthetic Fuels Corp. chairman Edward  Noble acknowledged that falling prices un dermined the corporation, particularly the  initial  congressional mandate  to  finance  500,000 barrels per day of synthetic fuels  production by 1987 and 2 million barrels per  day by 1992.  But Noble said the corporation was able to  provide the country with a ""national securi ty insurance policy"" by fostering synthetic  fuels technologies.  One of those technologies is coal gasifica tion. When Synthetic Fuels Corp. was start ed, gas derived from coal was attractive be cause of pessimism about U.S. natural gas  reserves. Now that the pessimism about gas  reserves has dissipated, the technology used  in coal gasification is being viewed as a pos sible solution for acid rain.  And after Congress and the Reagan ad ministration last month decided the federal  government had no business spending bil lions of dollars on synthetic fuels, a  top  presidential adviser last week recommended  a $5 billion, five-year federal effort to devel op  technologies  to  reduce acid  rain  that  have many  similarities  to  the  synthetic  fuels effort.  Former Transportation Secretary Drew  Lewis, President Reagan's special represent ative on acid rain, made the recommenda tion on Jan. 9 at the conclusion of a year long U.S.-Canadian study of the problem.  Two of the four projects funded by Syn thetic Fuels Corp. are designed to transform  coal into energy-rich gas that can be burned  with a fraction of the air pollution generat ed by coal-fired boilers.  January 29, 1986  Dow Chemical Co. in Louisiana and a col lection of firms in California led by South ern California Edison Co. received $740 mil lion in Synthetic Fuels Corp. price guaran tees for two coal gasification projects. The  Dow Syngas project is expected to start op eration in 1987, while Southern California  Edison's Cool Water project has been turn ing coal into gas-and then gas into electric ity-for 18 months.  ""Cool Water is demonstrating the cleanest  way yet devised for burning coal,"" Noble  said. Several utilities have approached the  Cool Water consortium about licensing their  technology for other plants, he noted.  In  the bill  that killed Synthetic Fuels  Corp., Congress saved $400 million for clean  coal  technologies  development  by  the  Energy  Department  while  eliminating  nearly $7 billion in spending authority.  ""We  got  about  two-thirds  of  the  job  done."" Noble said. ""We still lack projects to  show us how to use Eastern coals and tar  sands, and we could have done more on  shale oil. If we'd had those other two or  three plants, we could have added all our  coal and oil shale to the nation's petroleum  reserves-five times the oil reserves of the  Middle East. As it is, we should be able to  add two or three times all the reserves in  the Middle East.""  John Howard, President of Greenwich Oil  Co. of Dallas, said the $60 million in loan  and price guarantees awarded to his compa ny by Synthetic Fuels Corp. in September  could add 10 billion barrels of thick, tarry  oil to the nation's useful oil reserves.  Greenwich Oil injects oxygen into a deep,  sandy oil formation in Wood County, Texas,  to produce an underground ""fire flood"" that  makes the oil fluid enough to pump to the  surface. The company hopes  to produce  about 1,600 barrels a day of useful crude oil  extracted with fire flooding.  Synthetic Fuels Corp. agreed to guarantee  Greenwich $40 per barrel for the first half  million barrels of oil lifted from the field by  fire flooding. The price guarantee is $22 per  barrel more than the current market price  for such heavy oil. But withoug the finan cial assistance, Howard said, Greenwich's  Forest Hill heavy oil project probably would  limp along  for several years, waiting  for  prices to rise, without ever demonstrating  the commercial feasibility of fire flooding.  ""I believe the day will come in the not-too distant future when we'll be back in a simi lar situation to what we went through in  the 1970s and 1980,"" Howard said. ""By 1990  or so, the United States once again will find  itself a massive importer of crude oil, vul nerable to offshore disruptions. Our tech nology will be available  then to anybody  who wants it.""  Noble  and Cantrell Exploration Co.,  a  Dallas oil firm competing with Greenwich  for heavy oil development, wrote Synthetic  Fuels Corp. objecting  to  the Greenwich's  use of federal finances, but Howard called  Forest Hill ""the best project ever brought to  the Synthetic Fuels Corp.""  ""This is an insurance policy and nothing  else,"" Noble said. ""If we don't need it, we  didn't spend that much money on it.""  ",1986
95,,99,0.468,1029,1,Mr. COBEY.," Mr. Speaker, Americans  for  President Reagan's Foreign Policy have called  to my attention three articles from The Truth,  a New Hampshire newspaper officializing  in  foreign affairs matters. All Americans are af fected  for better or worse by U.S.  foreign  policy decisions. I believe that we all need to  be well informed about these policies in order  to protect not only our Nation, but our individ ual lives and property from the costs and perEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  sonal  dangers  generated  by  the  Soviet  Union's expansions and Soviet sponsored ter rorism.  Over the last 5 years, the Reagan adminis tration has demonstrated that it is committed  to  turning back  the Soviet-takeover  tide  in  Central America, Afghanistan, and southern  Africa.  I believe the two great foreign policy  problems confronting President Reagan today  are the Soviet efforts to expand their influence  in  the world and  the Soviet strategy enunci ated by  late Soviet  leader Krushchev, who  said ""* * * our aim  is to gain control of the  two great treasure houses on which the West  depends * * * oil  from  the Persian Gulf and  strategic minerals from southern Africa.""  Today we are seeing this dream become a  reality. Currently,  there  are around 35,000  Cuban troops occupying Angola on behalf of  the Soviet Union. These troops not only con trol  the Soviet-puppet government, but  they  also support the Soviet backed terrorist group  known as the Southwest African People Orga nization  [SWAPO].  This  organization  uses  Soviet military equipment under the guidance  of Soviet military advisers in a campaign of vi olence to gain control of the country of Na mibia before  the  recently  formed Namibian  Government can achieve  internationally ac cepted independence.  Within the broad framework of U.N. Resolu tion 435, the people of Namibia have chosen  their own political  leaders and have estab lished the Transitional Government of National  Unity. This democratic government assures all  powers of local self-determination by success fully negotiating a transfer of total local gov erning authority to the Namibian people from  South Africa.  I believe the United States should lend polit ical and economic support to this new govern ment in Namibia because it offers a responsi ble anti-Soviet Government, supported by the  people of Namibia, as a democratic alternative  to a puppet-state set up by SWAPO.  I recommend  the  following articles  to my  colleagues and other Americans who have an  interest  in  the  foreign policy of  the United  States.  [From The Truth, Winter 19861  STATE DEPARTMENT UNDER FIRE FOR NAMIBIA  POLICY  OPPOSES SELF-GOVERNMENT  WASHINGTON, DC.-The U.S. State Depart ment has come under direct attack by two  respected forces  regarding its handling of  Namibia, an African country  larger  than  Texas immediately south of Angola. Sena tor Steve Symms CR-ID) and Carl Shipley,  President of  the U.S.-South West Africa/  Namibia Trade and Cultural Council, both  lambast the State Department as ""archi tects of disaster""  for  their ""head  in  the  sand'' thinking regarding Namibia.  In articles below,  they present the true  picture of this virtually important, sparsely  populated  country, whose  people  desire  their own government, free of the Commu nist  influence  which  threatens  them  through SW APO <South West Angola Peo ples Organization>, backed by the Soviets  and the United Nations.  While the State Department encourages  U.S.  business  to  locate  in Communist  Angola, entrance into Namibia is discour aged. The State Department is still seeking  to effect U.N. Resolution 435, under which  1027  the U.N. would supervise an election of an  assembly  in Namibia. However, control of  this assembly would be seized by SW APO,  with  its U.N. backing. Shipley points out  that it is a blueprint for U.N. sponsorship of  a Soviet-puppet SW APO government in Na mibia.  FuRTHERS RED AIMS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA  <By Senator Steve Symms)  As a member of the Senate Subcommittee  on Economic Resources, Competitiveness  and Security Economics, I have long been  concerned with the fact that since 1970 the  U.S. Department of State has discouraged  investment in Namibia, at a time when po litical  leaders within  that Territory have  been trying to negotiate their independence  from South Africa.  Namibia has been administered for  the  past 65 years under a 1920 League of Na tions Mandate as a former German territory  conquered by the British (using South Afri can colonial  forces>  in World War  I. On  June 17 of this year, the Multi-Party Con ference of Namibia's internal political lead ers, all of whom have been elected or desig nated by  their political parties and  their  various population groups to represent their  interests,  persuaded  the Government  of  South Africa to transfer to the MPC all leg islative,  judicial  and  executive  functions  theretofore exercise in the territory by the  Administrator-General appointed by South  Africa.  The South African government voluntari ly,  and on  the basis of non-violent and  honest negotiations, agreed to the MPC re quest. Thus,  the people of Namibia now  enjoy all powers of  local self-government  <except foreign relations and defense, which  they voluntarily left in South African hands  because of  their own  lack of capacity  in  these areas)  for  the first  time since  the  original German colonization of South West  Africa in the 1800's.  However,  the same  type of head-in-the sand thinking that seems to be a congentia.l  affliction of bureaucrats in the U.S. Depart ment of State, and which has given us such  catastrophic  diplomatic  losses  as North  Korea, East Germany,  the Berlin Wall,  Soviet occupied Vietnam, Soviet occupied  Afghanistan,  and  Soviet-puppet  govern ments in Angola, Ethiopa., Mozambique and  North Yemen, now turns a blind eye on the  TGNU <Transitional Government of Nation al Unity) in Namibia..  Thus, our State Department is once a.gain  lending its indirect support to Soviet empire  expansionism in Africa by opposing recogni tion of the political reality of the TGNU,  opposing the right of self government of the  people of Namibia., and closing its eyes to  the fa.ct that the United Nations, the U.N.  Council  for Namibia., and  its subordinate  agencies all strongly support, both finan cially and politically, the Soviet-backed ter rorist forces seeking to seize control of Na mibia and bring it under the domination of  the Kremlin  before  that Territory  can  achieve  internationally  acceptable  inde pendence.  H.R. 2589 would apparently subject all  Americans, individual as well as corporate,  to five years in jail and fines ranging from  $50,000 to $1 million for using or dealing in  any product which might contain a ""natural  resource"" originating  in Namibia without  permission of the U.N.

97,House,99,0.691,1055,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman  and Members,  in the opinion of the  American  people,  a  public  health  menace of severe proportions  is now  facing the country, namely, the AIDS  crisis. In a recent poll, the AIDS epi demic in America ranks very close to  being the No. 1 public health problem  in the Nation. This amendment seeks  to address one of the policy options  that we can take in Congress to deal  with diminishing the transmission of  this fatal disease, namely, by saying to  any city  in America that chooses to  continue to receive its revenue-sharing  funds that it is going to have to shut  down its bathhouses.  These AIDS factories exist essential ly in three cities of the country: Los  Angeles,  San  Francisco,  and New  York. Those  three  cities  combined  produce about two-thirds of the AIDS  cases,  some  16,000,  so  far,  in  the  Nation, half of whom have died.  In my State of California we have  close to 100 bathhouses now operating.  We created this bathhouse culture in  this country in 1975  in the State of  California through the medium of re pealing  the  law proscribing sodomy,  and bathhouses proliferated after that  time when our culture said  to  the  people of the State of California, con doning  sodomy  and  such  activities,  that that is where the bathhouse cul ture came.  Medical experts tell us that AIDS, a  fatal disease for which no cure has yet  been developed, is transmitted sexual ly by anal intercourse, and we know  that that is what is going on at bath houses. There was a time in this coun try when you went to a bathhouse to  get a bath. But that is a very limited  activity  that goes on at bathhouses  today, and we all know it.  This just says, very simply, in order  to reduce the incidence of this fatal  disease, we will shut down the bath houses in the country. This Member  from California has  introduced  five  bills. One of them relates to this sub ject matter. It has been assigned to a  committee.  In writing,  I have asked  the chairman of this committee, the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations, to give a hearing on the bill,  but we are still waiting for when the  hearing will  take place.  Indeed,  this  Member from California is still wait ing for a response when a hearing will  take place.  So  I  have  no  other  alternative  except to watch for a health care vehi cle being processed through the House  of Representatives so that I will have  an opportunity of offering an amend ment to such a bill,  to give my col leagues an opportunity of voting on a  matter on which I know they yearn to  vote, because every Member  in  this  House, of course,  is  interested in re ducing the incidence of a fatal disease  and  improving  the  health  of  the  American people. I cannot think of a  better way to do both of those objec tives than to adopt this amendment.  POINT OF ORDER  The CHAIRMAN.

I refer, Mr. President, to Mr. Forrest  Kilmer,  editor  of  the  Quad-City  Times, who is highly respected in our  State  for his commitment  to excel lence in journalism.  Forrest Kilmer's dedication  to his  profession and to his community have  extended over his entire adult lifetime.  He began as a cub reporter at the age  of 18 on  the staff of  the Morning  Democrat in Davenport, IA. In 1955 he  became managing editor of the Morn ing Democrat. In 1964, he was named  executive editor of the Times-Demo crat, which resulted from a merger of  the Morning Democrat and the Daily  Times. In 1970, he became editor of  the  Times-Democrat,  which  later  its name  to  the Quad-City  changed  Times.  For nearly half a century Forrest  Kilmer has  striven  to  improve  the  quality of journalism in Illinois. In his  last assignment, as editor of the Quad City Times, he established a bureau in  the State capital  to report on State  government in a probing and insight ful manner. His  redesign  of  story  layout  led  to  numerous  national  awards and his courage and encour agement  have  resulted  in  several  awards for investigative articles.  His dedication to his profession has  also been matched by his dedication to  his country and community. As a vet eran of World War II he received the  Bronze Star and is an active member  of his Lutheran congregation.  Forrest Kilmer is a man of both per sonal and professional  integrity. We  will, indeed, miss his journalistic lead ership, but his contributions  to  the  profession will always serve as an ex ample for all reporters and editors.  Mr. President, the Governor of Illi nois has proclaimed January 31, 1986,  as Forrest Kilmer Day in Illinois and  Senator SIMON and I would like to join  all Illinoisans in wishing him and his  wife, Jeannette, all of the best in the  future.  ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL CON SULTATIONS ON REFUGEE AD MISSIONS: 1986  ",1986
101,Senate,99,0.322,1159,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I ask  that the following materials be print ed  in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  as  the substance of the annual consulta tions between the representatives of  the President and members of the Ju diciary Committee on refugee admis sions for fiscal year 1986, as mandated  by section 207 < d) of the Refugee Act  of 1980.  Mr. President, in order to conserve  the printing costs of the CONGRESSION AL RECORD, I am submitting only rele vant correspondence and selected ex cerpts from  the much more detailed  and lengthy hearing record compiled  by the Senate Judiciary Committee's  Subcommittee  on  Immigration  and  Refugee Policy entitled ""Annual Refu gee Consultation,"" September 17, 1985  <Senate Hearing 99-320). That record  should be considered to be incorporat ed by reference  in full  in  these re marks. Should any of my colleagues  wish to read this, or should they have  any questions about it, I would refer  them either to the staff of the Sub committee on Immigration and Refu gee Policy, which I chair, or the Office  of the U.S. Coordinator for Refugee  Affairs, Department of State, Wash ington, DC.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  REFUGEE ADMISSIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1986  Mr. Chairman and distinguished members  of the Committee, it is a pleasure to consult  with you on  the U.S.  refugee admissions  ceiling for fiscal year 1986. This annual con sultation affords  the Administration and  the Congress an opportunity to discuss the  refugee situation in the world and the hu manitarian response to this situation by the  United States.  Since the end of the Second World War,  the United States has provided haven to lit erally millions of refugees. They have ar rived in waves: first from Eastern Europe,  then from Cuba, then in the 1970's, from  the Soviet Union, and most recently, from  the countries of  Indochina. All of  these  countries and regions continue to produce  refugees,  and  the United States  accepts  more of them than any other resettlement  country. We are a nation founded by refu gees, and our national life has been reinvig orated throughout our history by recurring  waves of refugees. I think it is well that we  remember this as we consider the question  of how many refugees we should admit to  the United States in the coming fiscal year.  This  is  the second consecutive year  in  which I have been privileged to present the  President's refugee admissions proposal  to  the Congress. In doing so, I would again like  to thank the members of this Committee  for  their continuing support for  the U.S.  refugee program-which includes both the  admission of refugees to the United States,  and  the  important overseas assistance ef forts  to which the United States contrib utes.  PROPOSED REFUGEE ADMISSIONS IN FISCAL YEAR  1986  Mr. Chairman, I  turn now to the Presi dent's proposal  for  refugee admissions  in  fiscal year 1986. The President proposes to  establish a ceiling of 70,000 for refugee ad missions to the United States in the coming  fiscal year. This total will be broken down  into 3,000 for refugees from Africa; 40,000  for East Asia first asylum; 8,500 for the Or derly Departure Program  from Vietnam;  9,500 for refugees from Eastern Europe and  the Soviet Union; 3,000 for refugees from  Latin America and the Caribbean; and 6,000  for refugees from the Near East and South  Asia.  The President  is proposing a ceiling of  3,000 for Latin America and the Caribbean  in the hope that Cuba will end its suspen sion of  the U.S.-Cuban Migration Agree ment of December 1984. If, however, Cuba  does not terminate its suspension of the mi gration agreement, a portion of the num bers will be transferred on a quarterly basis  to other regional ceilings to accommodate  unforeseen  increased admissions needs. If  these numbers are not needed elsewhere,  they will be allowed to lapse.  As was the case last year, the President  wishes to maintain a separate ceiling for ad missions under the UNHCR's Orderly De parture Program <ODP> from Vietnam. This  separate ceiling serves two purposes. It reas sures the ASEAN countries that an expand ing ODP will not mean a decrease in reset tlement from the first asylum camps; and it  sends  a  clear  signal  to Hanoi  that  the  United States is prepared to make good on  its offer to accept a large number of Amera sians and ""re-education camp"" prisoners.

104,Senate,99,0.072,1224,1,Mr. WEICKER.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce legislation to create  an additional Federal district  judge ship for  the district of Connecticut.  Accepting  this much-needed position  would bring the total number of dis trict judges in Connecticut to seven; a  number supported by the Administra tive  Office  of  the United  States  Courts' Subcommittee on Judicial Sta tistics  in  its 1984 biennial survey of  judgeship needs. I am joined in this  legislative endeavor by my colleague  from Connecticut, Senator DODD, and  by the entire Connecticut congression al delegation, which has cosponsored  similiar  legislation  introduced  today  by Representative. STEWART McKIN NEY.  I recently had the opportunity to ad dress many of our State's judicial and  legal community in Bridgeport, CT. At  that time I commented on the great  pride the citizens of Connecticut take  in the integrity and experience of the  State's Federal judges. The men and  women fulfilling the awesome respon sibilities of the bench in Connecticut  apply not only their substantial legal  scholarship to the task, but also long  hours of hard work; hours  that  in crease each year.  Despite this dedication, Connecticut  is faced with a dilemma as illustrated  by the 1985 U.S. district court judicial  workload profile compiled by the Ad ministrative  Office  of  the United  States Courts. The district of Con necticut's overall workload  has  in creased by 40 percent since 1980. In  formulating  its recommendations for  new judgeships, the Subcommittee on  Judicial Statistics considered the level  of new case filings, the case mix, the  level  of weighted  filings,  pending  cases, and  the  length of  trials. The  subcommittee employed 400 weighted  filings per  judgeship as  the  level at  which a court deserved consideration  for additional judgeships.  Weighted filings are those deemed  to involve unusual complexity, requir ing substantial court  time.  In Con necticut, weighted  filings per  judge  were 512 in 1985; 633  in 1984; 569 in  1983; and 560 in 1982. So the district of  Connecticut has well  exceeded  the  level of 400 for all of the past several  years. Trials have risen corresponding ly as have the number of triable de fendants  in pending criminal  felony  cases. Therefore, at all levels consid ered by the subcommittee, the conclu sion reached was that the district of  Connecticut  fully  deserves  an addi tional judgeship.  I urge the Committee on the Judici ary to expeditiously consider this leg islation. I am confident the committee  and later the full Senate, will grant  Connecticut's district  judges and our  fine courts  the additional  judgeship  they need to sustain the outstanding  record of administering justice that we  have come to expect.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of this legislation be printed in  the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.2027  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives  of  the  United States  of  America  in Congress  assembled, That (a)  there shall be appointed, pursuant  to sec tion 133 of Title 28, United States Code, an  additional district judge for the District of  Connecticut.

Up to this point, she is not that  different  from many Filipinos who  have found their way into this coun try. However,  there  is a  special hu manitarian need in her case.

106,Senate,99,0.115,1237,1,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, today DAN EVANS and I are intro ducing a bill to establish a new pro gram of ""targeted  fiscal  assistance""  for local governments. Representatives  BOB McEWEN'  JOHN  CONYERS,  and  a  PETER VISCLOSKY  are  introducing  companion bill in the House.  Over  the years, our failure  to use  the Federal grant system effectively to  address disparities in State and local  fiscal capacities has been a basic fail ing in our intergovernmental partner ship. This  is  a  responsibility which  central  governments  have  long  as sumed in every other major Federal  system. Today, as we stand on  the  verge of a fundamental restructuring  of our budgetary priorities, the need  to assure a minimum  level of basic  public  services  nationwide  can  no  longer be ignored.  Over the next few years, State and  local governments will confront a tre mendous challenge: To provide basic  and essential services to their citizens  during a period marked by limited and  declining resources. Deficit reduction  has a price, and I'm afraid that price  will include eliminating or drastically  cutting many of  the programs  that  have formed the basis of our intergov ernmental partnership over the past  decade.  These are programs that have en abled  the national, State and  local  governments  to work as partners  in  the delivery of important public serv ices  such  as highways and bridges,  schools and hospitals, health care for  the poor and elderly, education and  job  training  for  the disadvantaged,  cleaner air and water, and public hous ing-to name  just a  few.  I'm afraid  that many of these programs will re ceive deep reductions in the next few  years.  And the fact of the matter is, these  programs have already taken it on the  chin. Since 1981, a  ""De Facto New  Federalism"" has been occurring as the  national Government has struggled to  get a hold on the deficit by reducing  domestic spending. Federal aid as a  percentage of State and local revenue  has been declining since its highpoint  in 1980.  In  that year, Federal  aid  equaled 31. 7 percent of all State and  local own-source revenue. By 1984, this  figure had fallen to 23.7 percent and  in 1986 it is expected to be around 20  percent-a decline of 38 percent since  1980.  Put another way, defense expendi tures have increased 43 percent over  the past 5  years,  and entitlements  have grown by 24 percent. Meanwhile,  Federal aid to State and local govern ments has been cut more deeply than  any other  segment of  the Federal  budget: Down 25 percent  in current  outlays;  down  25  percent  in  the  number of programs; down 15 percent  as a proportion of GNP; down 20 per cent as a proportion of  the Federal  budget. And this is only the beginning.  As  the President has said, ""you ain't  seen nothin' yet.""  Budget cuts are not the only chal lenge confronting State and local gov",1986
107,Senate,99,-0.397,1289,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, the bar rage of questions and complaints we  are  all  receiving  about  Gramm Rudman-Hollings  undoubtedly  will  grow as its impact becomes clearer. I  voted  for  the budget balancing bill  with the conviction that if we do not  get hold of our mounting fiscal prob lems now, we may face economic chaos  later. In a weekly column I write for  newspapers  in my State,  I have at tempted to answer some of the ques ~ons I am  frequently asked.  I  also  offer what I think will be the ultimate  result of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings-a  combination of revenue increases and  spending cuts that will move our coun try in a sounder financial direction. I  ask that the column be printed in the  RECORD,  The column follows:  PAY-As-You-Go PATH WILL PINCH ALL TOES  <By U.S. Senator Paul Simon>  There is a near-panic developing over the  enactment of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  plan to reduce the deficit. Otherwise ration al people-like columnist George Will-seem  to have come unglued.  People who should have been  in near panic about the deficit now are in that state  over this response to the deficit.  Let me comment on two of the statements  I hear:  ""We should deal with the deficit but not  in this way!""  Any way that steps on toes-and that is  required-will have some unpopularity. But  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings <GRH> does not  require any specific formula. It simply says  if Congress and  the administration don't  come up with better answers, we're not  going to continue this indefinite drift.  GRH calls for percentage across the board  cuts if Congress and the White House fail to  respond to specific targets in reducing the  deficit. GRH is  invoked only if better an swers are not found. But it is a recognition  that we  cannot  indefinitely  continue  to  spend roughly one-fourth more money than  we take in without causing economic chaos.  GRH leaves plenty of room, for those with  better ideas to solve the deficit, to propose  them. But I find that most of those who call  GRH the wrong answer have proposed no  solution at all.  ""But a program I believe in strongly may  get cut.""  It may indeed!  Programs a  lot of us believe in strongly  may be cut.  But the day is past when groups favoring  education programs, health research, and a  great many other things I favor can simply  hold out their hands and ask for money.  Now, people interested in money are also  going to have to be interested in revenue.  That is a dramatic change and a needed  change. If you want more support for educa tion, for example, which I happen to favor  strongly, then those of us who favor that  will also have to come up with ways to pay  for it. Whatever the program you favor, you  have to also propose means of getting the  revenue  for  it  if you  are  talking about  spending increases.  My guess is that we will come up with a  combination  of  revenue  increases  and  spending cuts that will move our country in  a sounder financial direction.  Indefinite  drifting  toward  bigger  and  bigger deficits is a course toward economic  disaster. That threatens not only our econo my, but our free system.  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings will force us to  face reality. I hope Congress and the White  House will act responsibly so that there will  be none of the horrendous cuts some people  have talked about. We won't go  to GRH's  automatic pilot unless Congress and  the  President give up the controls.  We know that the course we were on prior  to GRH courts disaster. Whether GRH will  force us to a responsible course we will know  within a few months.e  HEALTH CARE: QUALITY AND  CONSTRAINT  e ",1986
108,Senate,99,0.498,1289,1,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, Dr.  Otis Bowen has taken on one of the  toughest  jobs  in the country as  the  new Secretary of Health and Human  Services. But he has also taken on one  of the most important-touching the  lives of millions of Americans in pro grams ranging from Social Security to  Medicare.  One of Dr. Bowen's biggest chal lenges was outlined recently in an Op Ed in the Indianapolis Star by Frank  E. Samuel, Jr., president of the Health  Industry Manufacturers Association.  Mr. Samuel argues  that Dr. Bowen  must see to it that quality, access, and  compassion remain  top priorities for  administration health programs.  As Mr.  Samuel  points  out, Dr.  Bowen has the opportunity  to show  that the administration's commitment  to fiscal commonsense is matched by a  social  commitment  to  quality  and  access. I am sure that Dr. Bowen will  keep this important message in mind  as he carries out his new duties. I ask  that Mr. Samuel's Op-Ed be printed in  the RECORD.  The article follows:  HEALTH CARE: QUALITY AND CONSTRAINT  <By Frank E. Samuel, Jr.)  A country doctor  from  Indiana  is now  taking control of the third largest budget in  the world-the Department of Health and  Human Services. And Otis R. Bowen enters  the scene at a historic juncture for federal  health policy. A two-decade spending binge  in health care has been followed by a strict  Reagan spending diet. And although that  diet seems to be bringing costs under con trol, it is not doing so without sacrifices in  the  tremendous advances  in quality and  access that accompanied the high spending.  So Bowen has a unique opportunity  to  stop the pendulum in the middle, and bring  federal health policy  into a new era that  balances quality with cost constraint. To  succeed, he must rekindle a commitment to  compassion, and progress without pushing  aside the Reagan emphasis on fiscal control.  Cost control was scarcely on the agenda  when Medicare  and Medicaid  legislation  passed in 1965. Nearly all political factions  eventually agreed with a need to invest re sources in improving health care for the el derly and poor.  The investment paid dividends not only  for the beneficiaries of these programs. The  infusion of new resources into the health  care system helped bring about a technolog ical boom that has benefited all of society.  Advances  in diagnosis  and  treatment of  heart  disease,  cancer,  blindness,  infant  death and scores of other conditions and  diseases,  to some degree, are part of  the  Medicare/Medicaid legacy.  But  the  investment was costly. And as  health costs grew, the political support for  unabated growth in federal health spending  waned.  If the 1960s and 1970s were the years of  technological  advancement and expanded  access, the 1980s are the decade of cost con trol. President Reagan came to office with a  mandate  to  do  something  about health  costs. So since 1981 the administration and  Congress have made changes  in Medicare  and Medicaid that will yield $35 billion in  cuts by 1987. What's more, Medicare's hos pital payment scheme was overhauled  to  save costs. Rather than reimbursing hospi tals for whatever costs they incur, Medicare  now pays a set price for each of 476 diag noses-regardless of how much it costs the  hospital  to  treat a  patient. The private  sector has also clamped down on health  costs.  The results are striking. In 1984, private  and public sector health care spending grew  by only 9.1 percent-the slowest rate in 20  years. Hospitals share of those costs grew by  only half their 1983  rate. But evidence is  mounting that we may be paying for this  cost-cutting fervor in the form of reduced  health care quality.  About 35 million people-15 percent of the  population-are  estimated  to  be without  health  insurance. While Medicaid-the  main  federal-state  health  financing  pro gram for the indigent-covered 65 percent  of the poor in 1976, it now covers only 52  percent.  Changes and cutbacks  in Medicare pay ments have led hospitals to release elderly  patients too soon. At recent Senate hear ings,  doctors  reported  increased pressure  from hospitals to release Medicare patients  when  their treatment costs reach the set  price for their illness. And public hospitals  report that other hospitals are ""dumping""  more patients onto them only because the  severity of their condition makes them un profitable to treat when bumped against the  set Medicare price.  Medicare changes have also led hospitals  to use treatments that may run up higher  long-term costs. Newer pacemakers, for ex ample, cost more  initially  than the older  models. But  for  some patients  they can  reduce long-term costs because they can be  adjusted for changes in the patient's condi tion without follow-up surgery. Medicare's  payment system, however, often discourages  use of the more expensive model because  Medicare pays a  set  rate  for pacemaker  cases,  regardless of the actual pacemaker  used. So the hospital is money ahead using  the cheaper version,  especially  since pa tients may well .have to return for follow-up  surgery-in which case the hospital again  collects the total fee from Medicare.

109,,99,-0.483,1315,1,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, those  of us who have been active in Congress on  the  issue of Soviet Jewry have  in  large part  relied on accurate and complete  information  about specific cases of Soviet Jews who have  been denied permission to emigrate and who  have encountered harsh treatment because of  their desire to emigrate. It is due to the efforts  of two of my friends and constituents, Margery  Sanford and Adele Sandberg of North Miami  Beach  that  congressional  offices have  re ceived and made use of 12 volumes docu menting the case histories of more than 1 , 100  refuseniks.  When my office became  involved  in  the  case of refusenik  llya Essas back in 1976, it  was one of these volumes that provided the  information we needed. Now, 10 years  later,  the Essas family finally received permission to  emigrate and arrived in Israel just days ago. I  would  like  to place  in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD an article from  the Miami Herald of  January 2, 1986, paying tribute to this very im portant project. The difficult challenge we face  in  trying  to  improve emigration prospects for  Soviet Jews is made so much easier than  it  would otherwise be-thanks  to Marge and  Adele.  The article follows:  THEIR CRY Is, ""Lrr OUR PEOPLE Go""  <By Bea L. Hines>  For more  than 10 years now, Margery  Sanford and Adele E. Sandberg have collect ed tidbits of information about thousands of  Jewish families still seeking their freedom  from the Soviet Union.  ""It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle,"" said San ford. ""A line from a story . . . a paragraph  from a letter ... things we have put togeth er to help tell their story.""  The result of their  labor  is 12 volumes  documenting  the  case  histories of more  than 1,100 Refuseniks-Jews who have ap plied to leave Russia but have been refused  permission by the Soviet government.  Their latest volume, ""Soviet Jews: Hos tages All,"" was published in September.  ""Our simple message to the Soviet Union  is, 'Let our people go,' "" said Sandberg.  Sandberg and Sanford, both married  to  doctors,  live  in  the same block  in North  Miami Beach. They both attend Temple  Sinai there. They became best friends after  they began volunteer work with the South  Florida Conference on Soviet Jewry.  They started documenting  the cases of  Refuseniks after each had traveled to the  Soviet Union.

I would like to concentrate first on  the qualities that made John an ex ceptionally  fine  press  secretary,  as  well as a policy advisor. Above all, he  is a clear thinker. I always recommend  to my staff the slim volume entitled,  ""Elements of Style"".  In  that book,  E.B. White teaches us to use the sim plest words to most clearly express an  idea. Even if one adopts all of those  rules,  the writing  on  complicated  issues will never be clear unless the  person who pens those words thinks  clearly. John Flink does.  Moreover, John is a steady hand. He  is incapable of overstatement. He has  a quiet presence and an institutional  memory  that made him  trustworthy  for the rest of my staff and the press  corps in Montana and in the Capitol.  In short, John Flink had good  judg ment and integrity that people trust.  A few final personal thoughts about  John. His interest in running emerged  at the same time as mine, and both of  us helped each other when neither of  us really wanted to run.  There  is an old saying  that ""still  waters run deep,"" and I can think of  no one who better depicts that descrip tion than John Flink. When he goes  home at night, I know that he spends  hours listening to fine music and con suming a wide variety of good litera ture. He is a deep thinker about many  things; theology, world issues, and per sonal freedoms. He is a good listener,  and he was a wonderful and  loving  husband to his late wife, Kathy.  I will miss John, and I thank him for  the service he has rendered to me and  to the people of the State of Montana.  TO  JUDITH  CHRISTA  SOVIET  GESTURE  RESNIK  AND  McAULIFFE  ",1986

112,Senate,99,-0.18,1393,1,Mr. LONG.," I thank the Senator.  Mr. President,  I  am delighted  to  hear the Senator say that he thinks  the rules should be changed. I agree  that they should be changed. I frankly  think that if television in the Senate is  to come, we ought to insist if we can insofar as this Senator is concerned, I  would certainly insist if we were going  to have television in the Senate-that  we make some changes in these rules  to accommodate certain pressing mat ters such as  those discussed by  the  Senator from West Virginia, which, in cidentally, were in the resolution. I see  a  line  to strike them out. But they  were there. I heard the Senator from  Tennessee say he favored every one of  them.  Some of those sugestions, may I say,  are some that the Senator from Lou isiana had on occasions suggested to  the Senators,  including  the Senator  from West Virginia. For example, this  matter by which you would not have  to invoke cloture to impose germane ness. You could just make a motion  for germaneness, and with 60 percent  vote for germaneness. You could do  this rather than have a limitation of  time, if all you really wanted to do was  have the benefit of a germaneness rule  rather than try to  limit everybody's  right to speak.  But, in any event, there are certain  things that need to be done. And you  wonder why. Why,  Senator,  is  a  motion to proceed still subject to un limited debate? A motion to proceed to  consider a bill? I am like the Senator. I  gave unanimous consent to bring this  bill up today. I did not object. But I  have many times debated the motion  to proceed purely as a dilatory tactic. I  ought to feel, well,  that gives me a  better chance to make more speeches  because you can make the motion to  proceed.  Has the Senator debated a motion to  proceed? I know I have.  ",1986

Consider the following:  In February 1985, an emergency  famine  relief and recovery in Africa bill appropriating  $1 billion was passed by voice vote.

Again, huge sums of money are being  spent and constituents can only guess as to  how they are being represented.  In December, passage of the Tax Reform  Act of 1985  left constituents  in  the  ""dark""  once again. The tax measure alone was esti mated to affect over $141 billion in taxes from  individuals and corporations over the next 5  years.

133,Senate,99,0.257,160,6,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr.  President,  schizophrenia strikes 1 percent of the  American people. It is devastating dis ease. Of the hundreds of thousands of  homeless Americans, from one-third to  one-half are mentally ill, most of these  afflicted with incurable schizophrenia.  The costs of this disease to this Nation  annually exceed $20 billion. We are  now spending $27 million annually on  research.  Science tells us it is a brain disease,  that is does not come about from bad  parents or ""toxic"" families. Nor is it  necessarily character flaw  in the af flicted person, as it was once believed.  Because of psychotropic medication,  schizophrenic citizens are no  longer  hospitalized for endless years. They  are stabilized and returned to the com munity. Unfortunately,  communities  are poorly prepared to receive  them  and to provide the rehabilitation serv ices  that  can  and will  help  them  achieve their potential for independ ence and self -care.  The care givers today are, in the ma jority of cases, the families. They need  help in understanding the illness,  in  providing a  therapeutic environment  in the home, in financial support, and  in  respite  from  the  day-in-day-out  regime of care.  Mr. President, these remarks are to  introduce an excellent four-part series  on schizophrenia that appeared in the  New York Times, March 16-19, 1986. I  offer them because there is a lot of ig norance across this land about schizo phrenia,  as well  as  other  serious  mental  illnesses  such  as major or  manic depression. The Times  series  gives an up-to-date report of the state  of scientific research on this disease. It  details the emerging family movement  that is achieving historic growth as a  force  in  the Halls of Congress, our  State capitals, city halls, and court house. It describes the treatment and  rehabilitation needs of these mentally  ill citizens. It describes the gaps in our  mental health system.  I commend the editors of the New  York Times for focusing on this im portant topic at a  time when policy makers must face the consequences of  mental illness in our society, particu larly among the homeless whose num bers continue to grow.  I ask that the articles from the New  York Times be printed in the RECORD.  The articles follow:  SCHIZOPHRENIA PuZZLE: TOLL RISES AMID  HOPE  <By Philip M. Boffey)  WASHINGTON.-Schizophrenia  is emerging  as the worst mental health problem facing  the nation. Yet it has long been the most  neglected.  Never before in American history have so  many  schizophrenics  been  seen  on  the  streets of American cities, screaming aloud  to voices only they can hear, proclaiming  themselves God, warning passers-by  that  the Central Intelligence Agency has bugged  their brains, or simply sitting, mute and  withdrawn, sunk in an apathy so deep that  no emotion crosses their faces.  But street people are only a part of the  problem. Far more victims of this shattering  disease are now in the homes of their fami lies,  in  the nation's hospitals,  in nursing  homes, halfway houses or seedy hotels either forgotten or given care that, health  experts  agree, has brought only  limited  relief of their suffering.  SIGNS OF NEW UNDERSTANDING  But  there are now  important signs of  change.  Interviews  and an extensive  review of  medical journals and scientific papers reveal  that the nation is moving toward a new era  in both understanding and treating schizo phrenia. The new insights are paradoxical,  the news,  to some degree, both bad and  good:  Not only are more people suffering from  schizophrenia than ever, but medical and  behavioral scientists believe that the disease  itself is far more complicated and resistant  to treatment than had been realized. More over, though much has been learned about  its manifestations, the basic cause remains a  mystery.  On the other hand, for the first time in  decades, scientists are expressing cautious  hope that progress can now be made toward  unraveling  the  inner mysteries of schizo phrenia and finding more effective  treat ments.  ENORMOUS COST TO SOCIETY  All  told,  two million  to  three million  Americans,  1 percent of  the population,  either have the disorder or will develop it at  some point in their lives, according to the  National Institute of Mental Health.  The cost to society is enormous, with au thoritative estimates ranging from $20 bil lion annually, as calculated by the N.I.M.H.,  to $48 billion reported by the Institute of  Medicine of the National Academy of Sci ences. The estimates are of expenses  in curred  in providing  treatment and social  services, as well as the staggering amount of  ",1986

Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat baffled  by the intensity of the opposition to  this rule, and I will tell my colleagues  why. Everyone on that side of the aisle  understands that we voted last year to  provide a special vote on the Contra  aid issue when we voted the so-called  $27 million.  The President submitted his request,  it came up before the House, and it  was defeated. It was defeated. There  were no obligations to provide another  vehicle. There were no obligations to  provide other accelerated procedures.  But the Speaker, in fairness to the ad ministration, said on the next vehicle  that moves through this House, that  will become law-and I disagree with  the gentleman from Illinois; he knows  that  the  supplemental  is  going  to  become  law because  there  are  too  many  important issues  in this thing  that the President will not veto-the  Speaker said, in all fairness, that he  would give the opponents who had al ternatives a chance.  Quite frankly, there was a hue and a  cry from many on my side of the aisle  who said, ""Why are you giving them  another chance? Let them go through  the  regular  legislative  process,  the  committees, the Committee on Rules,  and then to the House floor."" But the  Speaker said, ""Let us be fair.""  So we went up to the Committee on  Rules and we  allow  the gentleman  from Oklahoma, who has an alterna tive, we allow the gentleman from Illi nois, who has an alternative, and we  allow  the gentleman  from  Indiana,  who has an alternative,  to express  their will in this first part of the sup plemental.  In addition, we separated out  the  Contra aid from the supplemental appropriation. We think that is fair, and  I think the Members of this body will  respond that this rule is a fair one.  The gentleman  from  Illinois  sug gests,  in  the great  tradition of  the  Democratic Party, that we stand with  Harry Truman. I would point out to  the gentleman from Illinois that when  Harry Truman involved himself in the  Marshall plan and  the containment  doctrine, he had the American people  with him. You do not have the Ameri can people with you on this issue.  The latest polls today that came out  in the gentleman's own State, the Chi cago Tribune, pointed out by a 2-to-1  majority the American people oppose  this administration in aiding militarily  the Contras in Nicaragua. And those  same findings were found in the New  York Times poll.  0 1710  There  is  a  distinct difference be tween what Harry Truman did and  what you are trying to do here in this  bill.  ",1986

137,,99,0.393,212,6,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Speaker, our cattle men have been suffering from years of eco nomic stress and  it  is  time  that we send a  signal  to the Canadians that their ""backdoor  brokering""  import policies are placing the re sults of an unfair trade practice right at the  front door of the United States producer.  A major concern of America's cattle indus try is Canada's import policy, particularly sub sidized imports from the European Communi ty. This can cause a disproportionate amount  of  imports  into  the  United  States  from  Canada. The extra imports into Canada from  the EC  displaces Canadian  beef  into  the  United States. We are essentially a safety  valve for anything Canada cannot consume.  Subsidized beef imports from the European  Economic Community to Canada may be dis placing  the Canadian market  to  such  an  extent that Canadian beef products are being  imported  in  the United States  in  increased  quantities. This substitution or ""backdoor bro kering"" needs immediate attention.  For example,  in  1983, Canada  imported  around 13 to 14 million pounds from the EC.  In 1984, this rose to almost 50 million pounds.  The Canadian  cattlemen  have  fought  this  practice.  April15, 1986  The irony of this situation is that the Canadi an  livestock producers commissioned Can ada's equivalent of our  International Trade  Commission  [lTC]  to study whether EC beef  being imported into Canada is subsidized. The  preliminary findings by  the Canadian  tribunal  have determined the EC beef is subsidized.  Today  I am  introducing  legislation to stop  ""backdoor brokering"" from Canada. The legis lation places a moratorium on Canadian beef  products. This moratorium  includes both  live  cattle and fresh, chilled, or frozen beef.  The moratorium remains in place while the  lTC  undertakes  and  completes  within  6  months a study under section 201  of  the  Trade Act of 1974 to determine if beef prod ucts are being imported from Canada in such  increased quantities as  to be a substantial  cause of serious  injury to America's industry  producing  live cattle and  fresh,  chilled, or  frozen beef.  Upon completion of  the study,  if  the  lTC  does not find serious injury to the livestock in dustry, the moratorium will be lifted. If, howev er, serious injury is found, the moratorium will  remain  in effect. The  lTC will  periodically  update  the study-not less  than  twice each  year.  If, as a result of any study update, the  lTC finds that the injury is no longer serious,  the moratorium will be lifted.  The EC's export subsidies have brought  some cheap beef into Canada, which has dis placed local production. Ultimately, the surplus  ends up in the United States.  Unless Canada does something about  im porting subsidized EC beef, we will bear the  brunt of it in the long run.  SHEET-METAL JUSTICE  HON. ROBERT T.

139,,99,-0.61,225,6,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today, as  chairman of the House Select Committee on  Aging, to call the members' attention to an im portant  report  released at  the committee's  April 8 hearing on the interdependence of the  generations.  This  report,  ""The  Common  Stake: The Interdependence of Generations,""  is  the definitive statement on  the common  bond of generations  in  the health and eco nomic security of Americans of all ages. Yes terday,  I distributed copies of this  report  to  each member of the House on behalf of its  author-the Gerontological Society of America  [GSA]. Today, I urge the Members to carefully  review the report's findings.  The results of the committee's April 8 hear ing and the GSA report highlight the emotional  and  economic  interdependence of  families  across generations and their common stake in  programs for both young and old. They also  alert the Nation to the serious problem of pov erty among children  that threatens their and  America's  future. Most  important,  they warn  against the divisive and destructive notion of  ""intergenerational conflict"" that has been re cently popularized in the media.  Clearly, we  face a  serious  challenge  in  meeting the needs of today's and tomorrow's  children, young  families and elderly-a chal lenge that calls for a reassessment of current  funding  priorities. Where  some,  however,  would pit the generations against one another  in  funding decisions, the GSA report offers a  responsible framework for public policy based,  instead, on the interdependence of young and  old within the family and i'l society at large.  Few would deny  the common bond  that  exists among family members of all ages and  the benefit to older generations of investing in  their own  children and  grandchildren. Few  would deny  the  relief  that programs  for  the  aged provide  families on whom  the elderly  would otherwise depend. Yet, after 5 years of  cutbacks in programs for America's vulnerable  citizens,  rising  inflation and a deplorable  in crease in poverty among children, a notion of  ""intergenerational inequity"" has emerged.  This is a frightening notion  that defies the  strength of traditional family bonds and draws  an artificial, simplistic parallel between poor  young and ""well-off"" elderly. The issue is not  whether one generation has been assisted at  the  expense  of another,  but whether  the  needs of all vulnerable Americans will be met  now and  in the future. To the extent that we  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  have made progress in improving the econom ic security of older persons-the Nation can  be proud. To  the extent  that older persons  and their families remain unprotected against  the catastrophic costs of long term  illness the Nation must move quickly to provide pro tection. To the extent that children are being  driven into poverty-the Nation must move im mediately to pull them out.  The GSA report provides us with the means  for educating ourselves and the public on the  common bond of generations. With this report  in hand, it is my hope that we can redirect the  notion of  ""intergenerational conflict""  toward  what, in reality, are serious problems of pover ty and health-related financial destitution that  strike Americans of all ages and carry a heavy  toll for the entire family.  I urge you, as Mem bers of Congress and as spokespeople  for  Americans of all ages, to join with me in this  effort.  Mr. Speaker, the attached summary of the  GSA's report follows:  ""THE COMMON STAKE: THE INTERDEPENDENCE  OF GENERATIONS""  PREPARED BY THE GERONTOLOGICAL  ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [GSA]  Released April 8, 1986 at House Select Com mittee on Aging hearing ""Investing  in  America's Families: The Common Bond of  Generations""  This fact sheet outlines four key  issues  that are covP-red in the Gerontological Soci ety  of America's  <GSA)  report,  ""The  Common Stake: The  Interdependence of  Generations"", and that the Society consid ers essential to a proper framing of the up coming policy debates on the growing needs  of an aging society.  Responsible use of data  It is undoubtedly  tme that the elderly  population of the U.S. is growing and will  continue  to  increase. This  leads some  re searchers and policy makers  to question  whether there will be sufficient resources to  support a retired baby boom generation and  whether  future  taxpayers will  have  to  shoulder  unreasonably  heavy  burdens.  These fears are being used to justify short sighted policies and are helping to create  the very conflict between generations that  this group hopes to avoid. However, these  arguments  are based on  ""voodoo  demo graphics ' and ignore a significant part of  the picture. Specifically:  Their assumptions do not  take  into ac count the effects of economic growth. Given  a  realistic  assumption  of  two  percent  growth, the real costs in 2030 of supporting  each dependent could be 5 to 6 times greater  than in 1960 without increasing the burden  on society.  This view also ignores the fact that the  aged dependency ratio is only part of the  overall dependency ratio. According to the  Census Bureau,  the dependency burden which includes underage dependents as well  as the elderly-will remain below the levels  of the mid-1960's, even at the height of the  retirement of the baby-boom generation.  Lastly, this view fails to account for the  increasing proportion of  the elderly who  work. The aged dependency ratio assumes  that the elderly do not contribute to  the  economy and that all persons 18-64 are pro ductive-obviously not true. One-quarter of  men aged 65  to 69 worked in 1984 and, in  the future, a larger proportion of the elder ly will continue to work.  7575  Interdependence of generations  Fifty years ago the framers of our Social  Security Act understood that the genera tions are interdependent. They realized that  ""old age pensions are in a real sense meas ures in behali of children,""-that societally  guaranteed benefits to the elderly benefit  children and young adults because  those  public dollars relieve younger generations of  heavy financial burdens. The elderly like wise benefit from programs aimed primarily  at the young. Each generation has a stake  in social policies targeted at those in other  age groups:  Younger generations have two important  stakes in programs which assist the elderly  maintain a decent quality of life. First, pro grams which assist their grandparents and  parents to remain as autonomous as possible  in old age relieve younger families of finan cial burdens and intra-family stresses. And  second, they will be served by those pro grams when they become old.  By providing cash benefits to older family  members, Social Security frees up younger  and middle-aged family members to concen trate more financial resources on their chil dren to help them become productive mem bers of society.  Social Security stabilizes family and com munity life by enabling family members to  partially protect themselves from major fi nancial risks.  Social Security provides disability and sur vivors protection to young families.  The elderly benefit directly and indirectly  from education,  training, and health pro grams which help increase the productivity  of  the workforce. The eventual contribu tions to economic growth and tax revenue  will benefit current workers as they age.  A July 1985 Harris poll  indicates  that,  given  a  choice  between  cutting defense  spending or cutting Medicare, more than 70  percent of adult Americans  respond  that  they would prefer to see defense cuts.  Family care  Contrary to myth, the elderly have not  been deserted by their families. However,  current public policies are putting extreme  pressure on already overburdened caregiv ing families. If the government does not re spond to these growing pressures many fam ilies will be overwhelmed by the stress of  providing care to relatives. This could effec tively undermine the family and ultimately  add to the economic and social costs to the  nation.  Families, not  the government or social  agencies,  provide  80-90  percent  of  the  health/social supportive services: medically related care and home nursing, hands-on  personal  care,  household  maintenance,  transportation, and shopping.  Only 4.3  percent of  the daily  services  needed by older people are provided by Gov ernment or social agency workers. The rest  is either purchased or given by the family.  Families nowadays provide more care, and  more difficult care, over longer periods of  time to more older people than ever before.  They also strenuously avoid placing older  people  into  institutions, often exhausting  themselves emotionally, physically, and fi nancially before taking that step.  When adults aged 18-64 are asked to indi cate which public programs they would sup port, even if an increase in taxes were re quired,  they overwhelmingly favor  income  security and health care for the old.  71-()59 0-87-8 (Pt. 6)  ",1986

As patriarch of a hockey  program that could have catered to outstand ing  foreign  talent, Snooks always  looked  to  this country's youth first for hockey talent and  then taught them as much about life as he did  about skates, slap shots, and forechecking.  This man, a New England sports  legend,  was the first college hockey coach to win 500  games. He did  this while compiling an as tounding record of 501-243-15 during his 36  years at Boston College. Only three other col lege hockey coaches can boast of 500 or  more wins.  This was  not  the  only  record  Snooks  achieved. During his distinguished career, he  coached nine teams to the national champion ships and  that  record  stands  to  this day.  Snooks, a BC alumnus himself, coached his  first  team  to victory and continued winning  from that point on.  Snooks Kelley was also a founding father of  the now famous Bean pot Tournament and led  eight of his own teams to victory in the cele brated New England hockey fest. The awards  and distinctions he received during and after  his career are  far  too numerous  to  list but  bear testament to the commitment he made  to a sport that is truly part of New England.  His  record  is not one  that will  soon be  matched and I have no doubt he will long be  heralded for his accomplishments by the stu dents and athletes whose lives were changed  by his persevering optimism.  Beyond hockey, Snooks Kelley stood  for  education and development of sound, well rounded American youth. He taught at Cam bridge High and Latin School  for 30 years,  giving young scholars  the same encourage ment and  insight he  instilled on  the hockey  rink. This was a man who cared about people,  a man who  developed  young minds and  bodies to their fullest potential while maintain ing the good heart that his friends and associ ates will remember him by.  Snooks Kelley, member of  the National  Hockey Hall of Fame, member of the Boston  College Hall of Fame, friend, coach, pioneer,  and above all Great American, will be sorely  missed.

Before we know it, June 1 0, the deadline for  all appropriations bills to be through the Ap propriations Committee, will  be past. Then  June 15, when the Congress is to have com pleted action on budget reconciliation, will be  gone .. June 30, when all appropriations bills  are to have cleared the House, may slip by. If  we miss those last deadlines, we may miss an  extended  Independence Day  district work  period, because technically we cannot adjourn  for more than 3 days until we have cleared all  reconciliation and appropriations legislation.  The purpose of the accelerated deadlines  for  consideration of budget  legislation  this  year was to insure that everything was done  by mid-August, when  the economic agencies  are  to  take  the economic snapshot that will  show whether we are within the required defi cit reduction target and can avoid sequestra tion on necessary programs.  Every deadline we miss brings us closer to  the sequestration we wish  to avoid. Let us  start meeting the deadlines instead of ignoring  them.  A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO DR. H.

146,House,99,0.343,264,6,Ms. FIEDLER.," I  thank the gentle man.  Mr. Chairman, we spend billions and  billions of dollars on our national de fense, and yet when there  is a  real  threat in our own back yard, we refuse  to acknowledge that it exists.  Now in just the past couple of days  we have seen what happens when we  recognize a threat. The threat in this  case was Qadhafi's support of terrorI  thank  ism, and Congress saw the effective ness with which the United States can  respond when it is necessary.  After all, he armed, supported, and  trained terrorists in another part of  the world. Yet we  see  a  situation  taking place in Nicaragua with many  of the same terrorist groups that are  involved with Libya and some liberals  propose that we do nothing to stop  them.  0 1050  The threat of terrorists working out  of Nicaragua is compounded by a tre mendous buildup of troops by the San dinista government that did not exist  prior to their taking over.  In 1979, there was only 16,000 troops  in the country of Nicaragua; yet today,  there are 120,000  troops  there. The  Soviet Union has invested, along with  the Cubans, more than $500 million in  military  equipment  for  Nicaragua.  They have provided military hardware  in the form of tanks, artillery, helicop ter gunships, patrol boats, a whole  host of other  things,  to help work  toward exporting terror in that part of  the world. In Nicaragua we are dealing  with the issue of the Sandinistas ex porting  terrorism  to  a  neighboring  country, El Salvador, which is trying  to stabilize a democracy. They have  also put their arms around and dealt  closely with the PLO, the Libyans, the  Iranians, all of whom comprise  the  greatest elements of opposition to the  United States and its citizens. They all  advocate World terror.  Terrorist activities are taking place  within Nicaragua  itself. They have  slaughtered numerous Miskito Indians  in Nicaragua;  they have burned the  only synagogue in Managua, and the  entire Jewish community had to leave  Nicaragua because  it was no  longer  safe there. There is also a tremendous  level  of  religious  repression  taking  place there today.  These are the people who have con trol over the Nicaraguan Government.  These are the same enemies that we  were dealing with in Libya. And for  this Government not to recognize the  enormous threat that exists, not thou sands and  thousands of miles away  from our shores, but right here in our  hemisphere, is a  terrible mistake for  us and the American people.  I urge  this body to support aid for the Con tras so that they can establish a de mocracy in Nicaragua, instead of per mitting the continuing expansion of  influence by the same terrorist groups  we are dealing with in Libya.

150,House,99,0.49,277,6,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I have just signed up for  two special orders, one tonight-! hope  it  is not a  postmortem on a  vote  against ~-reedom-and one for tomor row rughr., oecause 1.. cannot cover in 2  minutes the major human rights viola tions going on in our hemisphere at  this moment.  Here  is  the report which I signed  and put out together with my distin guished colleague from the majority  side,  the  gentleman  from  Texas,  CHARLEs WILSON, the gentleman from  New York [Mr. SoLOMON] and myself  on the prison system in Nicaragua.  At the height of Somoza's cruelty to  his own people, the deposed and mur dered dictator, he had a high-water  mark of 500 people  in his prisons.  There are now between 11,000 and  13,000 people in prison in Nicaragua.  I had the opportunity to debate a  nun of my faith by radio in San Anto nio. She told me that she has a friend  who visits all of these political prison ers and that they are getting sensitivi ty training on their crimes against the  people under Somoza.  The fact  is  the majority of  people fought against Somoza.  The map, which cannot be seen too  well by Members in the back of the  House, shows 10 major prisons and 4  suspected prisons. We do not yet have  all the intelligence we need on Nicara gua-a country which is closer to my  district in southern California than we  are here in the Capital City.  But here is a graph that no one on  the majority side who votes against  the President has  refuted.  It says  there were 20,000 square feet of prison  footage under Somoza. It is now way  over 100,000 square feet,  locking up  people who fought with the Commu nists who were part of the Sandinistas  to free that country.  Look at these pictures. This is hard  evidence.  I have offered several times in this  to resign from  well  the Congress  if  somebody can show me this is a mas sive conspiracy between the leadership  on both sides of the aisle, the CIA, the  Defense Intelligence Agency, and that  somehow or other it is a coverup.  0 1225  Without sufficient time to adequate ly cover this issue I urge, Mr. Chair man, my colleagues  to please watch  my special order, following that of the  gentleman from Georgia  [Mr. GINGthese  RICH] tonight, where I talk individual ly about each prison camp.  ",1986
151,House,99,-0.514,277,6,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Chairman,  this  is  the fourth time within a year that the House of  Representatives  is considering  the  issue of  aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. A year ago last  April the House decided that assistance to the  Contras was wrong. Today, such aid still  is  wrong, and  I urge the House to support the  substitute to the Senate resolution offered by  our colleague  from  Indiana, LEE HAMIL TON,  which does not provide any aid  to the Con tras.  There is no political, strategic, moral, or in tellectual value in supporting the Contras. The  administration's policy of seeking a military so lution  to our differences with Nicaragua  is  wrongheaded and it is doomed to failure. Yet,  the administration persists in its efforts to pro mote the Contra cause. The administration is  pressuring Honduras and Costa Rica to coop erate with our backing of the Contras. Recent  news reports have now informed us that the  CIA has given the Contras several million dol lars during  the past year  for various Contra  political projects.  Notwithstanding this enthusiastic support by  the administration  for the Contra cause,  the  hard  truth  is  that  the Contras do not have  popular appeal  in Nicaragua. Many of  the  Contras are viewed, correctly, as being former  members of the hated Somoza national guard.  The Contras have repeatedly engaged in ter rorist campaigns against Nicaraguan civilians  and their atrocities have been well document ed  by  various  human  rights organizations.  Even President Reagan,  last June, belatedly  acknowledged the acts of brutality committed  by the Contras.  The Contras have no political legitimacy in  Nicaragua. They are fighting a losing cause.  There  is no popular uprising on  their behalf.  They have not been able  to hold a single  town in Nicaragua, and, by themselves,  they  cannot dislodge the Saninistas.  The President has told us that our credibility  will collapse and our alliances will crumble if  we fail to aid the Contras and prevail in Cen tral America. But,  it is the President, and no  one else, who has made our credibility and  our alliances an  issue. None of our major  allies throughout the world support the Presi dent's promotion of the Contras. In particular,  our friends and allies in Central America, who  know this region best, do not back the Presi dent's policy. On the contrary, heads of state  throughout Central and Latin America have  called  the Reagan  administration's military  support  for  the Contras wrong. The newly  elected President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias,  has stated his desire to prevent the Contras  from using Costa Rica as a base, and he has  said  that the President should use the $1 00  million that Mr. Reagan is seeking in military  aid to the Contras for economic aid to United  States-allied  governments  in  that  region.  President Reagan, however, with  the wrong  kind of farsightedness,  ignores the advice of  our neighbors to the south.  The $1 00 million which the President asked  for the Contras is nothing more than an addi tional downpayment to try to keep the Contra  cause alive. I doubt that anyone in this Cham ber seriously believes that this $100 million is  going to help topple the Nicaraguan Government The administration has failed to tell us  what the upper limit is of financial aid to the  Contras. It is inevitable that we will see addi tional  requests  in  the  future  for escalating  amounts of money  to prop up  the Contra  forces.  Mr. Chairman, the President's policy toward  Nicaragua is also very dangerous. It is danger ous because it permits the Reagan adminis tration  to  inexorably push  the United States  deeper and deeper into a Central American  quagmire. For those of us who remember the  steps which  led  to our  involvement  in Viet nam,  the parallel with Nicaragua  is striking,  and  the  lessons of our tragic experience  in  Vietnam must not be ignored.  If this request  for $100 million is approved, the President will  interpret such support as a blanket congres sional endorsement for whatever he seeks to  do against Nicaragua. This, I fear, will eventu ally result in the involvement of our Nation in  a military action against Nicaragua once it be comes obvious to the administration that the  armed aggression by the externally financed  Contras cannot succeed. At  that point,  this  war by proxy against Nicaragua will cease  being a war by proxy.  There, however, is an alternative to the ad ministration's policy of unleashing the dogs of  war in Central America.  It is a process for a  negotiated peace  in Central America which  has been proposed by the Contadora group of  eight Latin American states. This Contadora  peace process offers  the best prospect  for  obtaini1:1g a  long-term commitment  to peace  and stability in Central America and we should  become a willing partner in the diplomatic pur suit for peace.  ",1986
152,House,99,-0.145,277,6,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Chairman,  I would  like  to  make a brief observation about our policy  toward Nicaragua and  some  recommenda tions.  In a representative democracy it is impera tive  that  foreign policy  in particular  receive  broad support if it is to work. This is especially  important when  it involves a long-term com mitment, such as in the case of Nicaragua.  That the American people are split on  in creasing aid  to  the Contras  is clear. Most  polls, in fact, show that the majority of Ameri can people oppose increasing aid to the Con tras.  While the American people may not agree  on a policy toward Nicaragua, Mr. Chairman,  they are united on policy goals. The American  people, by and large, would like to see Nicara gua decrease  reliance on  the Soviet Union  and Cuba; they want Nicaragua to reduce the  size of its armed forces so that it no longer  would in any way threaten its Latin neighbors;  and, Mr. Chairman,  they want Nicaragua  to  move  toward  a  representative  government  that respects the rights of its citizens.  How do we accomplish our shared goals,  Mr. Chairman? Well, I do not believe there is  any policy guaranteed to work. I am convinced  that continuing the current policy or escalating  U.S. military support for the Contras will not  do  the  job.  The  administration's  policies  toward Nicaragua have only worsen the situa tion. Compared  to 1980, Nicaragua  today  is  far more  reliant on  the Soviet Union and  Cuba,  its military force is double in size and  ",1986

154,House,99,-0.359,316,6,Mrs. BOGGS.," I  thank the Speaker  so much.  As the House of Representatives pre pares to consider the supplemental ap propriations bill and the disapproval  of a number of proposed deferrals,  many related to housing assistance for  lowand moderate-income Americans,  I thought it a most appropriate time  to call our colleagues' attention to the  very real success story of BUD's Sec tion 202 Loan Program, which assists  nonprofit organizations or sponsors in  providing housing for the elderly and  handicapped who are of low or moder ate income.  I am deeply concerned that the ad ministration has requested rescission  of funds for the Section 202 Program  in fiscal year 1986 and has requested  no funds for the program in fiscal year  1987. Along with many of our col leagues, I continue to subscribe to the  goal,  first expressed  in the Housing  Act of 1949, of decent, safe and sani tary housing for all Americans. Good  quality,  affordable housing  for our  growing elderly population is in short  supply, yet the kind of housing provid ed through the Section 202 Program  over 1,800  has often been found to help the el derly live independent lives, avoiding  the need for confinement in nursing  homes.  There  are  many  202  projects  throughout  the Nation  that deserve  our praise. I  should especially like to  compliment the initiative and leader ship of the archdiocese of New Orle ans in making use of the Section 202  Program to provide fine housing for  elderly and handicapped  area residents. The kinds of projects  developed  in  the New Orleans area  and operated by  the Sisters of  the  Holy Family and other religious orders  and nonprofit organizations offer in spiring examples of  the great gains  that can be made with a little Federal  help and encouragement.  I would like to share with you some  excerpts  from an article which ap peared in the March 8, 1986 issue of  America Magazine written by Joseph  H. Fichter, S.J., a sociologist at Loyola  University  in New Orleans. Father  Fichter tells the story of the success ful  archdiocesan  effort  to  provide  housing  for  the elderly and handi capped  in  the New Orleans  area  through the Section 202 Program. He  highlights  a  residential  community  known as St. John Berchmans Manor,  operated by the Sisters of the Holy  Family.  In addition,  I would  like  to share  with our colleagues a  letter  to  the  editor of America submitted by our es teemed colleague, the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. GoNZALEZ] chairman of the  Banking Committee's Housing Sub committee. Chairman GoNZALEZ notes  the many accomplishments of the Sec tion 202 Program and urges that we as  a nation make certain that we can pro vide more St. John Berchmans Manors  for Americans.  I certainly share his  views.  St. John Berchmans Manor in New Orle ans, La., is a high-rise, 150-unit residence for  elderly persons of low income, built with a  Department of Housing and Urban Develop ment <H.U.D.> loan and managed by the sis ters of the Holy Family. The tenants must  be at least 62 years of age and have an  annual income of no more than $9,650. The  sisters have been approved for another 40year Federal H.U.D. loan, this time to build  a 50-unit high-rise next door to their Lafon  Nursing Home. All plans and blueprints  have been completed, but the specific allo cation of funds has been delayed. The pro portion of needy elderly is increasing in the  New Orleans population, while the Federal  commitment to such housing appears to be  gradually eroding.  The 1971 White House Conference on  Aging had recommended the construction of  120,000 units of housing for the elderly an nually. In no single year since then has Con gress appropriated sufficient funds to pro vide more than 30,000 such housing units.  In 1984, the Federal Government approved  only 12,000 units of Section 202 housing for  the elderly. For 1986, the allocations across  the country are for only 14,000 units of el derly housing, but there was  included on  the agenda of the Appropriations Committee an item to freeze all section 202 alloca tions. While the need is immense and grow ing, the Federal retrenchment of funds for  elderly housing is exacerbating the problem.  Nevertheless, the long-term loans and rental  subsidies  from H.U.D. made possible  10  archdiocesan  housing  projects  providing  1,835 apartments for the elderly poor and  handicapped in the New Orleans area. The  Archdiocese now boasts one of the largest  privately  sponsored housing programs  in  the United States.  The sisters undertook this venture  into  congregate housing for the elderly poor at  the  inspiration of Archbishop Philip M.  Hannan, who was alerted to the shortage of  housing from his first days in New Orleans.  On his arrival in 1965, he was greeted with  the  devastation wrought  by Hurricane  Betsy, especially on the homes of the poor.  He was met by Eugene McManus, S.S.J., a  trained  sociologist with  long  experience  among the local black parishes, who urged  application for Federal loans under Section  202  of  the  1959 Housing Act.  Father  McManus, a member of the Mayor's Hous ing Committee and local chapter president  of  the Urban League, contacted Michael  O'Keefe, William Guste, Clarence Jupiter,  Louis Reed and others to organize Christo pher Homes, Inc., a nonprofit corporation to  develop housing for low-income people.  The  residents of St.  John Berchmans  Manor are among the fortunate minority of  low-income senior citizens able  to obtain  such housing accommodations. Sister Rose  de Lima Hazeur, S.S.F., manager of  the  Manor, reports increasing numbers of frus trated  applicants.  St.  John Berchmans  Manor exemplifies the ingenuity and cour age of the Holy Family Sisters who own and  staff the facility that was built on land be longing  to  their religious community. All  the other Federally financed projects under  diocesan sponsorship were built on land ac quired by the Archbishop for this purpose.  Assuming the administration of these hous ing complexes constituted a new and addi tional apostolate for the religious sisters of  six different communities.  The  residents of St.  John Berchmans  Manor are among the fortunate minority of  low-income senior citizens able  to obtain  such affordable housing accommodations.  They are the envy of thousands of similarly  qualified  ""outsiders""  looking  for  similar  housing that simply does not exist.  There are positive benefits  that accrue  beyond  the  routine of moving  into safe,  comfortable,  affordable  living  quarters.  James Broder points out that such nonprof it housing  for  the  elderly can  increase  healthy  lifespans. He states: ""Because of  social involvement, emotional and physical  security, and the services that can be pro vided, people occupying such housing tend  not to deteriorate in many of the ways asso ciated with aging. Residents of such housing  tend to live more active, healthier lives and  require less institutionalization.""  The promotion of this expanding social  ministry may provide apostolic opportuni ties for other Catholic dioceses and religious  communities.  In response to this splendid article,  Mr. GoNZALEZ wrote  the  following  letter to the editor of America.  CONGRESSIONAL VOICE FOR THE POOR  I wish  to commend Father Joseph H.

Since it was formed a quarter century ago,  the Pelham Parkway Citizens Council and the  fine fraternal, civic, religious, political, educa tional, and professional organizations it repre sents have been a major catalyst in stabilizing  the Pelham Parkway area and making  it a  great place to live.  As  the  Congressman  who  represents  Pelham Parkway, I am proud of the determina tion, perseverance, and community spirit of  those citizens who serve on the council and  work  to  provide  the  80,000  residents  of  Pelham Parkway with improved physical, cul tural, educational, and  recreational  facilities  and activities.  Many talented and creative people serve or  have served on the Pelham Parkway Citizens  Council. One of  those citizens  is Mr. Henry  Yuspeh, who has been a catalyst for commu nity  improvement  through  his  position  as  president of  the council. Through patience  and hard work, Mr. Yuspeh and his colleagues  on  the council have overcome bureaucratic  redtape  time after  time  to  rack up a  long  string of success stories that have contributed  greatly  to  the quality of  life  in  the Pelham  Parkway community.  Soon after it was formed, the council joined  forces with Public School No. 1 05 to push for  a new centrally  located  library for the area.  That building now stands as a symbol of what  organized community action can accomplish.  The council currently  is  fighting  to  force  major changes in the conditions at the Bronx  Psychiatric Center. So  far,  the council has  succeeded in seeing a new director appointed  and improvements in the center's facilities.  In other areas, the council: serves as a liai son between  the community and  the police  force;  is a driving force behind cultural offer ings in the area; and has been responsible for  numerous neighborhood cleanup and graffiti  removal campaigns. On a far-reaching  level,  the council is the catalyst behind a letter writ ing campaign to insure that our Nation's pris oners of war and those missing in action are  accounted for and not forgotten.  The Pelham Parkway Citizens Council  is a  wonderful example of civic responsibility that  should serve as a model for other grassroots  community  organizations  throughout  our  Nation.  I congratulate the Pelham Parkway Citizens  Council for their 25 years of outstanding serv ice to their community and I know I speak for  INTRODUCTION OF THE  INTERNATIONAL DEBT, TRADE, AND  FINANCIAL  STABILIZATION  ACT  HON. STAN LUNDINE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April16, 1986  ",1986
158,,99,-0.31,459,6,Mr. LUNDINE.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday I in troduced on behalf of  the majority of  the  members of the International Development In stitutions Subcommittee, which I chair, legisla tion to address the serious problem of devel oping  country  debt.  This  legislation  has  evolved after detailed oversight and legislative  hearings C!'l  the  ideas contained  in  the bill.  Our proposal  is aimed at strengthening and  expanding  the  Baker  initiative  on  debt  launched last October in Seoul, South Korea.  We have taken timely action on this matter so  that it can become part of the Speaker's trade  bill scheduled  to go  to  the House  floor the  week of May 12.  The effect of  the debt crisis on  the U.S.  trade deficit is clear. Since the onset of the  debt crisis  in 1982,  in order  to earn badly  needed foreign exchange to pay their interna tional debt, debt ridden developing countries  have closed  their economies to imports and  concentrated on boosting their exports. Over  one-third of the 1985 U.S.  trade deficit was  with developing countries. The United States  has experienced a 32 percent decline in ex ports and a 13 percent  increase  in  imports  since 1981 with  the key 15 debtor countries  recently identified in the Baker debt initiative.  The  trade deficit with  these same countries  has grown from $3.3 billion in 1981  to $21.3  billion  in 1985. The Overseas Development  Council has estimated  that 1.4 million U.S.  jobs have been lost due to the trade ramifica tions of the debt crisis.  The United States also has other reasons  to seek a solution  to  the debt crisis. Our  banks are dangerously overexposed to devel oping countries who will continue to have seri ous difficulties paying their debts unless they  can secure some breathing  room  from  their  debt burdens. Effectively addressing the debt  crisis  is  critically  important  to  preserving  United States foreign policy and security inter ests around  the world, particularly  in Latin  America where infant democracies are strug gling to maintain the support of their people.  The bill proposes steps to increase the ef fectiveness of the World Bank and other multi lateral development institutions. It is our belief  that the World Bank must play the key catalyt ic role in bringing about a satisfactory resolu tion to the debt crisis. The World Bank must  help increase the flow of capital into develop ing countries. To help achieve  this we urge  the World Bank to propose that a temporary  adjustment be made in its disbursement prac tices to forward World Bank capital to devel oping countries in an accelerated, but still re sponsibly monitored,  fashion.  In addition, we  call  for steps  to help developing countries  ",1986
159,,99,-0.28,472,6,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased  that  the House of Representatives  passed House Joint Resolution 234, a resolution I introduced designating the week of May  18 as National Food Bank Week.  This resolution, which commemorates food  banks across  the country,  could not have  been possible without the help of my distin guished colleagues on the House Post Office  and Civil Service Committee: Chairman BILL  FORD and Chairman ROBERT GARCIA as well  as  the  distinguished Representatives,  the  Honorable GENE TAYLOR and  the Honorable  JAMES HANSEN. I would also like to point out  that my office  received countless hours of  support and hard work from Mr. Scott Broock,  during his service as a Washington Work shops student intern. Scott did an outstanding  job in helping us sign up over 220 cosponsors  of House Joint Resolution 234.  Mr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution 234  designates May 18 to 24, 1986 as ""National  Food Bank Week."" These dates coincide with  the National Conference to be held by Second  Harvest, Inc., the largest food bank network in  the country.  Food banks play an  increasingly important  role  in our communities across  the country.  Food banks collect surplus  food  that would  otherwise be wasted and distribute it to soup  kitchens, day care centers, homes for the el derly, halfway houses, church-operated  food  programs, and needy  individuals. These are  nonprofit organizations who obtain their food  primarily from private-sector sources.  In recent years, we have witnessed an ap palling increase in poverty and hunger in this  country. Over 35.5 million people are poor,  and estimates are that over 20 million people  in our country periodically go hungry.  Food banks work with private-sector com panies,  including our food and  transportation  industries,  to respond  to that need.  In 1985,  the Second Harvest network worked with over  250  private-sector  companies  to  distribute  over 1 00 million pounds of food products. This  is an excellent example of private sector re sponse to a serious need.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe that these nonprofit  food banks deserve to be commended. They  work quietly in communities across the coun try  to eradicate hunger and poverty.  I am  pleased that my colleagues in  the House of  Representatives joined me in passing National  Food Bank Week.  THE LOSS OF CAPT. FERNANDO  A.

160,,99,-0.269,472,6,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay tribute to the 15th Street Elementary  School in San Pedro, CA, which will be cele brating its 85th year of continuous service to  the community at a  luncheon on April 25,  1986. Coincidentally, the observance also falls  during the Public School Month celebrations.  Built at a cost of just $25,000 on the origi nal site of the San Pedro High School,  the  15th Street Public School has achieved a  number of  tremendous successes  in  its 85  years. The San Pedro community is indebted  to  this great school  for the  fine work  it has  done  in educating  its children. The school,  which is the second largest of the 13 elemen tary schools in San Pedro, however, has done  more than merely educate our young people.  The 15th Street Elementary School has  the  oldest existing parents-teachers association in  California, which is the second oldest such or ganization  in  the entire country. Additionally,  the  school,  through  its  various  programs,  brings about $500,000  in State and Federal  funds into the community.  My wife, Lee,  joins me  in  recognizing  the  achievements of the 15th Street Elementary  School on its 85th anniversary, and in recog nizing the many contributions that its students,  staff and graduates have made to San Pedro  and other southern California communities.  I  would also like to take a moment to recognize  the staff and  faculty of the 15th Street Ele mentary School on  the  fine work  they are  doing under the  leadership of their principal,  Stanley Bunyan.  HON. JAIME B. FUSTER  OF PUERTO RICO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April16, 1986  ",1986
161,House,99,0.169,485,6,Mr. ROWLAND of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, my colleague from Missouri  [Mr. SKELTON] and I have introduced a  resolution today putting Congress on  record as giving its highest praise and  thanks  to Great Britain and Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher for aiding  the United States against Libyan ter rorism.  When  the  time came  to confront  ruthless terrorists, Britain stood with  us. No other ally wears that badge of  courage.  Mrs. Thatcher took enormous per sonal political risks  to do what was  right. By taking a stand in support of  free people everywhere, Mrs. Thatcher  risked criticism  from political oppo nents. She chose a courageous moral  path rather than political expediency.  Her actions will fortify and inspire us  to continue our fight against terror Ism.  The United States and the United  Kingdom have long been allied in the  great World Wars against tyranny and  are joined in the North Atlantic alli ance to deter aggression.  A loyal ally understands that coun tries have interests beyond their own  borders, and our British friends recog nize  this. And  for  that,  they have  America's enduring gratitude.  Mr. Speaker,  I  urge  all my  col leagues to join us in cosponsoring this  very important resolution.  AMERICA NEEDS A SENSIBLE  OIL IMPORT POLICY  <Mr. TAUZIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
162,House,99,0.03,485,6,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Speaker, following  the United States air strikes against  Libya, Colonel Qadhafi sent his minis ter to the OPEC meeting in Geneva  demanding an oil embargo against the  United States of America.  It is, of course, history now that the  Geneva meeting denied and, in fact, ig nored that request We should not be  surprised by that.  The fact is that the United States is  only about 10-percent dependent upon  OPEC oil today. We should, however,  be reminded that in the late 1970's,  when we were approximately 30-per cent dependent upon OPEC oil, a simi lar request for a U.S. oil embargo was  not only heeded, but adopted, with  awful effects on this economy.  Now my  father when  I was very  young gave me a good piece of advice.  He assured me that through my life I  would make a number of mistakes, but  he cautioned me not to make the same  mistake more than once. We in Amer ica ought to consider my father's good  advice as we approach the end of this  decade. Should we allow ourselves to  become so dependent upon OPEC oil  that the next request by the minister  from Libya for an oil embargo against  the United States would not only go  unignored, but in fact heeded, and the  United States might find itself in that  same awful position  It is time now, America, to wake up,  to guard against that type of depend ence on foreign oil. It is time now to  adopt a sensible oil import policy for  America.  0 1200  ELDERLY VETERANS CARE ACT  OF 1986  <Mr. RIDGE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
163,House,99,0.186,485,6,Mr. RIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, ensuring  adequate health care for our elderly  veterans is fast becoming one of the  most  critical  issues of  the decade.  With the average age of the veteran  population steadily rising, steps must  be  taken now  to prepare  the VA  health care delivery system for the in creasing demand for services. Conse quently, I am introducing the Elderly  Veterans Care Act of 1986.  This legislation provides a tax credit  to the families of elderly veterans who  need  home-based health  care. The  credit covers such expenses as home  health aids, adult day care,  respite  care, nursing  care,  and medical or  health-related  equipment  and  sup plies.  Credit amounts will be determined  by a  sliding scale based on annual  income, similar to the dependent care  tax adopted by Congress in the Eco nomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Fam ilies with $10,000 or less in income will  receive a credit for 30 percent of the  home health care expenses they incur,  up  to a maximum credit of $1,050.  Low-income families who do not pay  enough taxes will have any unusable  credit refunded directly to them. The  maximum amount of credit would be  gradually  reduced based on  income  over  $10,000, with  families  having  $50,000  or more  in  adjusted  gross  income  ineligible  for  credit. Conse quently,  the most needy families re ceive the greatest relief.  This legislation is important because  it represents a practical solution to the  VA health care problem without for saking our longstanding commitment  to  the men and women who have  served this country. This measure pro motes a compassionate alternative to  institutionalized medical  services by  providing for care in the most natural  environment-the veteran's own home.  Moreover, by granting the tax credit  directly  to  the family,  the proposal  recognizes  the  temendous  sacrifices  they make as the primary caregiver to  elderly veterans. It also recognizes the  need for Congress to relieve the con tinuing  financial  pressure  on  the  health care delivery system of Medi care and Medicaid.  The Veterans' Administration pre dicts that there will be more than 7  million veterans over the age of 65 by  1990. The VA itself has recommended  the creative development of program  initiatives  to help meet  the health care needs of our maturing veteran  population. My bill meets  this chal lenge by providing more flexible care  for veterans, while making more hos pital beds available for critically ill pa tients.  Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to  intro duce this important legislation, and I  invite my colleagues to join in support  of the Elderly Veterans Care Act.

170,House,99,-0.429,537,6,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, on Feb ruary 26, as you may recall, the House  voted in favor of two resolutions citing  Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, the di rectors and managers of the New York  Land Co. in New York, for contempt  of Congress as a result of their refusal  to cooperate with the Subcommittee  on Asian and Pacific Affairs, which  was then in the process of conducting  an  investigation  into  the  hidden  wealth  of  Ferdinand  and  Imelda  Marcos, of the Philippines, here in the  United States. Those resolutions were  adopted, in the case of Ralph Bern stein, by a margin of 352 to 34 and, in  the case of Joseph Bernstein, by a  margin of 343 to 50.  The -Bernstein brothers had refused  to answer a whole series of questions  put to them by myself and other mem bers  of  the  subcommittee  on  the  grounds that it would require them to  violate the attorney-client privilege if  they were to divulge the information  we were seeking.  It was  the opinion of  the House  counsel and the minority counsel of  the House, whose judgment we solicit ed,  that  in  fact  the attorney-client  privilege was not being properly  in voked.  For that reason, the subcommittee  voted to cite the Bernstein brothers  for contempt. The full Foreign Affairs  Committee then voted overwhelmingly  to cite them for contempt and, as I  just indicated, the full House voted to  cite them for contempt as well.  A few months later, after the resto ration of democracy in the Philippines  and the flight of Mr. Marcos and his  wife, Imelda, from Manila to Honolu lu, documents were discovered at Ma lacanang Palace clearly linking Joseph  Bernstein,  at  least,  to  President  Marcos and some of the real estate  owned by the Marcoses in New York,  which our subcommittee was investi gating.

173,Senate,99,0.467,602,6,Mr. DENTON.," Mr. President, I bring  to the attention of my colleagues an  article which appeared on March 5,  1986, in the Independent Advertiser in  Clanton, AL,  about Marion Wesley  Easterling.  The article, written by Advertiser  correspondent Madge Mullins Wil banks, chronicles  the  life of one of  Chilton County and Alabama's most  outstanding citizens.  As most of my  colleagues know,  gospel music has held a special place  in southern life for decades. The arti cle  titled,  ""Gospel Legend Lives  in  Clanton,"" pays tribute to one of Amer ica's most beloved gospel song writers.  The songs composed by Marion Eas terling have been recorded by Ameri ca's most famous gospel quartets and  have been published in countless song books since 1937 when he composed  his first gospel song, ""Lord, Lead Me  On.""  Marion Easterling's contributions to  America have contributed to our one  nation under God concept.  I ask unanimous consent to insert in  the RECORD  this beautifully written  salute to Marion Easterling.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Independent Advertiser  <Clanton, AL>. Mar. 5, 19861  GosPEL LEGEND LIVEs IN CLANTON  <By Madge Wilbanks)  On October 25, 1973, the Chilton County  Chamber  of Commerce  honored Marion  Wesley Easterling ""for his accomplishments  in the field of gospel music and prestige and  dignity brought to our county."" The wooden  plaque complete with gold mounting is  in  the home Marion W. Easterling shares with  his wife, ""Mi..c;s Agnes"", in Clanton. It is a  warm house filled with tributes momentoes  of years, pictures of children and the four  grandchildren  and  there  is  also  golden  records by the Thrasher Brothers singing  songs written by this gospel giant of a song  writer who has a part of the Chilton County  scene since being born on March 12, 1910,  on a  farm near the Sunshine Community  ""Out Refuge Road"" to General Francis and  Dora Johnson Easterling.  In thinking back over the years, it seems  Marion was simply born to gospel music. He  attended  the  public  schools  in Chilton  County and  then attended various music  schools  including the Vaughan School of  Music. He studied with a number of famed  and excellent private  teachers of gospel  music schools as Adgar M. Pace, O.L. De Vaughan, W.B. Abert  and  ""Dad Speer""  <G.T. Speer> of the famed Speer Family. He  also took correspondence courses from New  York and Chicago to further his own musi cal education. With Marion W. Easterling, it  was not hard work nor hard study, it was all  part of his lifelong goal. . . . to bring gospel  music through the media of radio to his be loved Chilton County and to his cherished  homefolks . . . and he had done just that in  a most exemplary fashion!  He has realized his goal to bring gospel  music programming via radio to the people  of his home county. He has realized his goal  and yet he continues to write and dream . . .  an ever-working mind of a composer whom  gospel music ranks right up there at the  top.  How does he write his songs? ""Well, I get  a melody or words . . . most often the words  first . . . and it may be as long as two years  before I write it down, have it copyrighted  and send it to the publishers."" He is repre sented by SESAC. Year and years ago he  told me that he often sold his songs <all  rights and everything!) for as little as $10. I  reminded him of that the other day and he  remembered. He sold two of his all time big  hits for $10 ""and I might not even get that""  ... songs like ""Standing By the River and  Rainbow of Love."" Somehow you know how ever, without him even saying it, that he  never has written a song with the hope of  making money. He has written songs simply  becaue he had the God-given talent to do  ",1986
174,Senate,99,-0.163,641,6,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, S.  2333  is an important bill, a bill that  will take us a long way toward improv ing  access  to  health  services  for  women and infants at risk. For several  years,  I  and a  number of my col leagues have worked to improve tar geting of Medicaid services  for  this  population.  I am pleased today to be a part of  yet  another  step  in our  effort  to  extend needed care  to a vulnerable  and often overlooked population. Gov ernor Riley of South Carolina and the  Southern Governors Task Force on  Infant Mortality are to be congratulat ed both for developing a set of policy  goals and  for  the educational cam paign which  they undertook  in an  effort to improve public understanding  of the need for these changes.  It is now general knowledge that sig nificant savings-financial as well as  social-are associated with early inter vention  through good prenatal pro grams and preventive care for infants.  As most of my colleagues are already  aware, numerous studies have shown  that an expenditure of $1 in prenatal  services can yield as much as $12  savings through reduced costs of in tensive neonatal care and  the  long term  institutional expenditures  that  often accompany the handicaps associ ated with premature birth and  low  birth weight.  As Governor Riley's task force has  shown, 10 of the 11 States with the  most severe infant mortality rates are  in the Southern region of the United  States. In the South, it is estimated  that 1 of every 15 mothers is likely to  have a child with a discernible mental  or physical handicap. While the na tional average is 6.8 percent, 7.6 per cent of all babies born in the Southern  States are low in birthweight-which  is, of course, closely correlated with  high rates of infant mortality, and the  incidence  of  lifelong  handicapping  conditions.  Technically, S. 2333  assumes  that  States will be offered the option of exin  tending coverage to those women and  infants whose incomes exceed the cur rent eligibility threshold for Medicaid,  but who, nevertheless, are below 100  percent of the poverty level. While I  am hopeful that we will be able to pro vide services to this entire population  on enactment, it may be necessary to  adjust eligibility to comply with final  Congressional Budget Office cost esti mates. However,  if such a change is  needed, I hope that members of the  Finance Committee will  join me  in  support of implementing this change  as quickly as costs allow.  In sum, Mr. President, passage of S.  2333 will permit States  to  improve  access to health care by restructuring  eligibility and benefits under the Med icaid Program according to local prior ities.  I  invite my colleagues  to  join  with us in support of that goal.e  ",1986
175,,99,-0.435,667,6,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I am strongly op posed to the President's request for $100 mil lion  for the Contras who seek  to overthrow  the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. This  is a huge, nearly fourfold increase in funding  for the Contras since the first request 5 years  ago for $19 million. If this request is granted, it  will surely not be the last.  It will be a down payment of hundreds on millions more.  There is no doubt that the Sandinista gov ernment is repressive and has a dismal record  of human rights violations, and  I certainly do  not want continuation and strengthening of a  Marxist-Leninist regime in Central America But  the Contras have also committed brutal atroc ities and do not represent a viable or accepta ble alternative to the Sa.ndinistas. Just yester day we saw reports on dissension among the  top  civilian  leaders  of  the Contras  amid  charges of mishandling of funds, criminal ac tivity, and human rights abuses. They do not  inspire a popular, democratic movement inside  Nicaragua  but  instead  spread  terror  and  hatred among the innocent campesinos.  I firmly believe that the only effective and  realistic solution  is  through negotiation. De spite the recent setback, the Contadora proc ess is the policy we should pursue. It has not  really had a chance to succeed since the ad ministration has given only lip service to sup porting  it.  It  is  time  that we wholeheartedly  support it. We would have the support of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  rest of Central America to vigorously pressure  Nicaragua to reduce  its armed  forces, expel  its  foreign advisers, honor  its borders and  cease support for insurgencies in neighboring  countries.  Apart from the need to cease aid to an inef fective group of men who spread violence and  terror, it is appalling that aid should be sought  at a  time when  the President  is proposir.g  deep cuts in vital programs providing nutrition,  health, education, job training and other vital  services to our disadvantaged and vulnerable  citizens. It is inconceivable to me that we can  consider sending funds to support a suspect,  no-win  terrorist  group while  contemplating  budget  reductions  that would endanger  the  health and welfare of so many of our own citi zens. Continued funding of the Contras would  be counterproductive both to our national se curity and  to  the domestic stability of our  country.  CONGRATULATIONS CARROLL  BEAVER  HON. GENE CHAPPlE  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  Mr. CHAPPlE. Mr. Speaker,  I'd like to take  this  opportunity  to  recognize Mr.  Carroll  Beaver who will be retiring from the California  Department of Forestry. Throughout Carroll's  35 years of service in northern California, he  is best known for his leadership as captain of  the air attack base in Grass Valley. Due to his  spirit of compromise and adaptability, Carroll  successfully engineered  the merging of  the  California Department of Forestry with  the  Grass Valley Fire Attack Base. In doing so, he  helped to provide the most effective air attack  fire protection service in the State.  In addition to Carroll's active duty with the  forestry, he is respected in his community as  a model citizen and as a supportive  father  who has reared 1 0 children.  As Carroll approaches retirement this May, I  congratulate him on his many contributions to  northern California and wish him the happiest  of years to come.

176,,99,0.3,667,6,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, America's historic  destiny has been to raise freedom to its fullest  expression not just  in  the United States but  throughout  the world. This  is  the greatest  hope of oppressed peoples  throughout  the  world. Thankfully, since 1981, America has ex perienced a resurgence of confidence  in  its  ideals, and not surprisingly,  the tide of free dom is now just beginning to overwhelm and  overcome  the  forces of tyranny and  repres sion in many areas throughout the world.  Yet we are  in danger of undercutting  the  military strength that strengthens and embol dens the new march of freedom. Some are  8017  OKLA.-This  THAT  GRAMM u.s.

The  following article warns  that America's  defense preparedness and combat readiness  efforts are beginning to be sacrificed in some  significant ways as a short-term expedient to  reduce the deficit. I commend the following ar ticle to my colleagues, and earnestly urge that  this year and beyond Congress provide a de fense budget adequate to our weighty respon sibilities and historic destiny.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 8,  1986]  LoGISTICS  OFFICERS  FRET  RUDMAN  MAY  HINDER  COMBAT READINESS  <By Tim Carrington>  TINKER  AIR  FORCE  BASE,  sprawling archipelago of parts warehouses  and aircraft workshops is the military's big gest logistics center, keeping thousands of  warplanes and  related systems  ready  for  combat. But officers here are fretting that  Washington will scrimp on the funds needed  for military readiness.  The  source  of  apprehension  is  the  Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The  fear is that the Pentagon, as it did during  past budget crunches, will squeeze funding  for maintenance, repair, training and trans portation  in order  to  insulate big-dollar  weapons programs from cuts. Already there  are some early signs  that today's budget  pressures will hurt military readiness. More over, the threat that the U.S. arsenal will be  less ready comes at a time when the presi dent is using the military more often as a  diplomatic and political  tool around  the  world.  The fears appear to be well-grounded: Al though the overall Air Force budget would  grow by 7% under the Reagan administra tion's request for fiscal1987, proposed fund ing for Air Force spare parts would drop  40%  from  the levels planned a year ago.  Lloyd Mosemann, Air Force deputy assist ant secretary for logistics, says, ""I anticipate  that we won't fund spares as completely as  we did.""  ENGINE EXHAUSTION  ""When you have a reduction in logistics  money, you can't buy the spare parts tore place fuel controls, etc.,"" says Maj. Gen.  William Bowden, commander of the Tinker  logistics operation. ""At some point, you end  up with engine exhaustion.""  Others offer more dire prognoses. ""The  U.S. faces the real prospect of entering the  1990s with  shiny,  new,  high-technology  forces that look impressive but cannot roll  or sail or  fly  to where  they might be  needed,"" says the Committee for National  Security, an independent research group, in  a recent budget study.

177,,99,0.391,693,6,Mr. DAUB.," Mr. Speaker,  the Consolidated  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985  was signed into law by the President on April  7, 1986, after considerable delay in the House  and in the other body. Section 13208 of that  act generally provides  that  the  transfer of  farmland by an  insolvent farmer to a creditor  in cancellation of indebtedness, or to a third  party under threat of foreclosure, will not give  rise  to alternative minimum  tax  liability. The  amendment is effective for transfers of farm land after December 31 , 1981 .  The normal 3-year statute of limitations for  timely filed 1982 calendar year returns expired  on April 15, 1986.  Insolvent farmers seeking  the protection of the new amendment with re spect  to calendar year 1982 were  required,  therefore, to file an amended 1982 return on  or before April 15, 1986, just 8 days after the  Budget Reconciliation Act was  signed  into  law. This obviously was not enough time for  those insolvent farmers seeking the protection  of  the amendment  to react to the new  law.  The  repeated delays  in passing  the Budget  Reconciliation Act has, practically speaking,  undermined  the clear  intent of  the act  to  assist insolvent farmers beginning with calen dar year 1982 transfers of farmland.  In order to more fully carry out the original  intent of the Budget Reconciliation Act,  I am  introducing a bill that would extend the statute  of limitations for a short period for purposes of  taking advantage of the insolvent farmer pro vision  in  the Budget Reconciliation Act. The  bill provides  that  if a  taxpayer  is prevented  from claiming a refund or credit resulting from  the  insolvent farmer provision  in  the Budget  Reconciliation Act at any time before October  16, 1986, then the refund or credit will never theless be allowed  if claim  therefor  is  filed  within 6 months of the date of enactment of  the bill.  I would urge my colleagues to join with me  in supporting this small but important change  to the Budget Reconciliation Act. Thank you.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  INTERNATIONAL  COOPERATION  NEEDED TO COMBAT TERROR IST THREAT  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  ",1986
178,,99,0.227,693,6,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  it is  truly  regrettable  that  the French Government  re fused to allow United States aircraft to overfly  that country.  Margaret  Thatcher  of  Britain,  however,  stood firm. She is to be commended for taking  a brave stand. She held out her hand when  America needed her help.  In this age of terrorism,  international coop eration  is  needed  to  combat  the  terrorist  threat. The  free world cannot afford  to  turn  and run from terrorist dictators.  Although  the French Government had  re cently indicated a growing resolve to confront  terrorism, that Government refused a request  for overflight  rights  for  the U.S.  bombers.  When they were put on the spot, the French  blinked.  Their ambiguous attitude caused our pilots  to fly an extra 2,500 miles to skirt the coast of  Europe on their way to Libya. They were ex posed to possible detection by being in the air  that long. They arrived on target fatigued and  stressed.  No wonder the Libyan Ambassador in Paris  congratulated  the  French Government  for  turning down America's request. Fortunately,  America does have a friend over there.  When  the going got tough, Prime Minister  Thatcher stood firm. She defended our deci sion  and  said  that  those  bombers were  needed for the task at hand. Among our Euro pean allies, she kept the course.  In the fight against terrorism,  there can be  no weak hearts or partial commitments. Either  we confront this problem together, or we will  all pay the price of not acting against c:: grow ing  threat. We must all shoulder  the heavy  burden of fighting terrorism.  BUSINESS LIABILITY INSURANCE  CRISIS  HON. DAVID DREIER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  ",1986
179,,99,0.478,693,6,Mr. DREIER.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  there  exists an acute crisis in the availability and af fordability of liability insurance for businesses  and municipalities  throughout the country.  In  fact, most of the State conferences leading to  the 1986 White House Conference on Small  Business cited the liability insurance crisis as  the most  threatening  to  the continued well8043  being of our economy. The crisis is so encom passing  that it has been  the focus of major  media coverage in recent months.  The extent  to which  the  lack of available  and affordable liability insurance has damaged  the economy underlies the need for immedi ate Government action, both at the State and  Federal level. In the last 2 years alone, liability  insurance premiums have increased by 50 to  900 percent. Between 197 4 and 1984,  the  number of product  liability suits  filed  in U.S.  district courts increased from under 2 million  to almost 11 million. The number of million  dollar awards for compensatory and punitive  damages in liability suits increased from under  50 in 1977 to over 400 in 1984.  As a  result,  thousands of companies are  abandoning their lines of business, operating  without insurance, or increasing the prices of  their products  to cover  insurance premium  costs. Municipalities  fare  no  better. Many  competent  and  effective  city  officials  are  second-guessing their decisions to seek mu nicipal positions out of fear of being sued.  In  California alone, as many as half of the cities  will  function without  liability  insurance cover age should nothing be done  to address  the  current crisis.  Unfortunately, the origin of the current liabil ity insurance crisis is undetermined. Some crit ics blame the tort justice system, particularly  the principle of joint and several  liability and  the increase, during the last 1 0 years,  in the  number  of  negligence  lawsuits  and  the  amount of  the awards made  in connection  with those lawsuits. Others view the account ing and management decisions of insurance  companies over the past decade, and the un stable cyclical nature of the industry, as being  responsible for the crisis.  In response, Mr. Speaker, to this uncertain ty, I am today introducing legislation to estab lish a commission on  the  liability  insurance  crisis. As you know,  the collection of data to  determine the cause of, and suggest a solu tion  to,  the  liability insurance dilemma poses  significant difficulties. The Commission  I am  proposing would examine  the system of tort  law  in  the United States, and  the  financial  structure of the insurance industry. The com mission would consist of representatives of in dustry, Government, and consumer groups,  who would be appointed jointly by the Presi dent, the Speaker of the House, and the ma jority leader of the Senate.  The commission would provide Congress,  the President, and State governments with a  list of recommendations for resolving the crisis  in the availability and affordability of liability in surance. Such a commission would not  re quire any appropriated money  from  the  tax payers.  It would draw upon  the existing  re sources of the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker,  the current  liability insurance  crisis warrants immediate action. I believe my  proposal offers the best vehicle to determine  what  legitimate actions can be  taken at all  levels of government to address this crisis.  I  urge my colleagues to consider the merits of  this legislation, and join me in moving forward  to solve what is potentially one of the most  critical dilemmas to face business and munici palities nationwide.

180,Senate,99,-0.322,797,6,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President,  the  cover of the April 15, 1986, issue of Fi nancial World has a picture of Mr.  Sam M. Walton of Bentonville, AR.  Recently, he was named ""Chief Execu tive Officer of the Year.""  Starting from scratch, Sam Walton  built Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., into one of  the Nation's most profitable retailers.  His leadership has boosted Wal-Mart  Stores, Inc., to a whopping $8.4 billion  industry. There  is no question  that  Sam is one of the most innovative and  successful  businessmen  in America  today.  I congratulate Sam and his team of  over 110,000 loyal employees for work ing together to make Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc., a giant in today's business world.  It is my pleasure to submit for the  RECORD the Financial World article on  Sam being named ""Chief Executive  Officer of the Year.""  The article follows:  GOLD WINNER-SAM M. WALTON OF W AL MART SToREs TAKES THE ToP PRIZE  <By Stephen Taub>  Sam Walton's savvy, homespun success  probably hasn't fazed  his old Zeta Phi  brothers at the University of Missouri. In a  1940 profile entitled ""Hustler Walton,"" a  fraternity newspaper cited  the year's Big  Beta on Campus for numerous club mem berships, athletic prowess and a knack for  recruiting top-notch frat leaders. For good  measure, the story hailed his friendliness in  knowing virtually every janitor by name and  his community spirit in passing the collec tion at church services. ""There is little limit  to the number of things Sam has done,""  added the bedazzled writer.  More than four decades later, it is obvious  that ""Hustler"" Walton's fans were selling  him short. The 68-year-old chairman and  chief executive has parlayed  that energy  ""and those human skills""  into something  unique: Wal-Mart Stores, now the nation's  second largest mass merchandiser and one  of corporate America's greatest successes.  Today,  the  company  boasts  sales  that  exceed $8.4 billion and a staff of more than  110,000 employees. It is one of the nation's  most profitable retailers.  Perhaps inevitably, such accomplishments  inspired a panel of judges to elect Walton  FW's 1985 CEO of the Year. The recogni tion stems not from a single year's achieve ments, but from his company's long, unin terrupted, dizzying growth rate, particularly  in view of the economic problems afflicting  the farm belt and oil patch served by the  bulk of his stores. Over the past 10 years,  Wal-Mart's compounded  annual  revenue  growth has been 37 .5%, and its compounded  earnings growth has been 39.8% per year.  ",1986
181,House,99,-0.311,810,6,Mr. WEAVER.," Mr. Speaker,  last  year,  I  introduced a bill, H.R. 1396,  that would have levied an import fee  on imported oil. I did so for two rea sons: One,  to raise money to reduce  the deficit, and two, as a conservation  measure.  Now, because of the convulsions in  the oil markets, I believe that such an  oil import fee would not be timely. I  also fear that it might be used not to  reduce  the deficit, but to accommo date other spending or tax loopholes,  and therefore, I withdraw my support  of this bill and ask my cosponsors to  find another vehicle to show their sup port for the bill because I no longer  support it.

183,House,99,0.505,810,6,Mr. NIELSON of Utah.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in opposition to H.R. 4392, legis lation that authorizes appropriations  for grants to States to eradicate the  plague.  My opposition is not based on the  dismissal of plague as  a  legitimate  problem, but rather a recognition that  the Department of Health and Human  Services  already  has  authority  to  make  the grants authorized by  this  legislation. The Centers  for Disease  Control at HHS establish priorities for  those public health problems which  require Federal assistance. Congress  has already authorized appropriations  for the Centers for Disease Control ac tivities.  It is inappropriate for Congress to be  authorizing a million dollars for one  particular  public  health  problem,  when the experts at the Centers for  Disease Control have not even request",1986
184,House,99,0.254,823,6,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Speaker, between now  and 1990, over 170 hydroelectric projects will  come up for relicensing.  I have a deep con cern that the relicensing process be conduct ed  in a  fair and  responsible manner, and  I  have joined with over 180 of our colleagues  who share this concern in cosponsoring H.R.  44, the Electric Consumers Protection Act.  This legislation provides a simple solution to  the dilemma caused by conflicting Federal  Regulatory  Commission  decisions  handed  down on  the question of preference on reli censing. H.R. 44 would assure that any utility  which has properly built and operated a hydro electric project in the public interest and dem onstrates that it will continue to do so, will be  able to keep running it in the future.  H.R. 44 clarifies how relicensing questions  should  be  fairly  decided.  This  legislation  makes the all important distinction between a  utility which is applying for a license and the  original  licensee. During the relicensing proc ess under H.R. 44,  if FERC concludes  that  both applicants will do an equal job of using  the  public water  resource,  simply  fairness  would dictate that FERC break the tie in favor  of the original licensee who built the generat ing project and its customers who have paid  for it.  I believe H.R. 44 keeps  the consumer's  best interest in mind, by allowing the electric  customers who have paid  in their rates over  the years for construction, financing, operation  and maintenance of the project to continue in  the  future  to  receive  the  low-cost electricity  which is generated.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  vital, pro-consumer bill.  Mr. LEHMAN of California, Mr. Speaker, this  week  the House will consider H.R. 44,  the  Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1985,  legislation  clarifying discrepancies  regarding  the relicensing of hydroelectric power projects  by  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis sion.  As a Member whose district includes both  public and privately-owned utilities,  I applaud  the efforts of the House Energy and Com merce Committee, my California colleagues  who were a part of the compromise efforts,  and the representatives of the utility industry  for this important consensus legislation. I am  pleased to join a majority of my colleagues in  supporting H.R. 44 on the floor of the House.  While H.R. 44 clarifies FERC's role  in  the  relicensing process, includes a number of im portant environmental  safeguards,  and  ad dresses the role of the Public Utility Regula tory Policies Act [PURPA] in hydroelectric de velopment,  I would like to bring to the atten tion of the House my continuing concern re garding the issue of small hydro development.  In response to the energy crisis of the late  1970's, Congress passed legislation to foster  the development of renewable and alternative  energy sources. With  regard  to small hydro  development, Congress  intended  that  these  incentives were to apply only to existing facili ties or on facilities that would not have a neg ative  impact on  the natural qualities of a re source.  However,  the  subsequent  implementation  by FERC broadened the definition to include  new facilities and the number of small hydro  applications which were  filed with FERC  in creased dramatically. The most dramatic  in crease occurred  in  the West where  literally  thousands  of  small,  free-running mountain  streams became the target for energy devel opment.  Though many of the projects were for retro fitting  existing dams or on  streams which  posed only marginal threat to fish and wildlife,  a large majority were proposed on scenic or  environmetally  sensitive  streams. At  these  sites, speculators were  taking advantage of  both  tax incentives and  law requiring utilities  to pay  for the power at ""avoided costs"" of  generating electricity with  oil.  Furthermore,  many of these projects were clustered in one  area or in a watershed region which already  had serveral large hydroelectric projects. If al lowed to be constructed, many of these small  hydro projects would provide further deteriora tion of  the natural  resources and aesthetic  values of a watershed region.  Unfortunately, FERC has been consistent in  its role in facilitating the development of new  small hydro projects by providing little, if any  administrative  relief  in meeting  the environ mental concerns relating to the proliferation of  small hydro development. Only court actions  and  intense  congressional  pressure  has  forced either delays of comprehensive studies  of cumulative impacts on watershed regions.  H.R. 44 does provide some  relief  in  this  regard by requiring FERC to prepare a study  analyzing the need for PURPA and other ben efits on new facilities, as well as the environ mental impacts of both new and existing facili ties on watersheds.  However,  the  legislation grandfathers cer tain projects that have ""committed substantial  resources"" during the  licensing proceeding.  I  would  like to remind my colleagues that the  problems associated with small hydro devel opment have been  the result of the blatant  disregard  for congressional  intent by FERC  and further exacerbated by FERC's steadfast  unwillingness  to address  this problem  in an  early and equitable manner.

197,,99,-0.088,875,6,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, I read the fol lowing editorial  from  the Detroit News which  succinctly says  that evidence  indicates  that  there is no substitute for old fashioned parent ing and that ""somebody has to be crazy about  the kid"" as an antidote  for teenage suicide.  There is great common wisdom in that editori al, but even more important is the early con viction  by  young  people,  from  whatever  source, that no one has the right to take his  own  life and no one  is an  island to himself,  and  that  the people who are most hurt  in  teenage suicide are people who are most  caring,  affectionate, and  loving  toward  the  people who take their own  lives.  If a person  can see that his body, his life, and even his  mere existence are things that are disposable  without thought of others, this can be a trage dy not only to the person who takes his or her  life but to people who are indeed loving and  concerned and trying to the best of their abili ty to be good parents or friends. This sort of  knowledge needs to be deep in the heart of  all young people, and similarly, they must feel  the same about the partial suicides that are  occurring throughout the country by the taking  of dangerous drugs and addictions therefrom.  The article follows:  [From the Detroit News, Thursday, Mar. 13,  1986]  WHY ARE KIDS KILLING THEMSELVES?  Last month, Omaha was shocked by three  suicides in a single week involving apparent ly  well-adjusted  teen-agers  from  solid  homes. Exactly why they did so  is still a  mystery. Yet Omaha is merely the latest  city to experience what has become a two decade long, 140-percent spiral in the rate of  teen-age suicide. This sad trend suggests we  may need to rethink how we as a society  raise our children.  Some  of  that  rethinking  already  has  begun. In an important article in the winter  issue of Public Interest titled The Declining  Well-Being of American Adolescents, soci ologists Peter Uhlenberg and David Egge been of the University of North Carolina,  question the conventional wisdom that life  would improve for kids as their ""environ ment"" improved.  ""The 1960s and 1970s should have been a  golden era for the development of American  youth,"" they write. ""After all, indicators of  what mainstream  social  scienstists  and  policy-makers regard as the important de terminants of child welfare <smaller family  size,  rising parental education  levels, and  higher family income> were all going in the  'right' direction.  . . . However, comparison  of youth in 1980 with youth in 1960 reveals  that what 'should' have happended, did not  happen.  Indeed most  indicators of well being show a marked deterioration.""  White teen-agers aged 16 and 17, the most  advantaged group, saw their family poverty  rate reduced from 25 percent in 1960 to less  than 10 percent in 1980, for example, while  the number of children  in  large families  (four or more siblings) fell from 21  percent. The poverty rate for those with fa thers and mothers without high school eduto 14  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cations fell from about 60 percent to about  25 percent. Overall. the researchers found  that  the percentage of white  teen-agers  with none of these ""disadvantages"" soared  from 32 percent of their population group  to 63 percent.  They also  found  that the per-pupil ex penditures on public education had doubled,  after inflation was  taken into account, as  had  the percentage of  teachers with ad vanced degrees. Class size, meanwhile, had  actually fallen by nearly 18 percent.  Yet all  this ""good news"" produced only  ""bad news."" Standardized test scores fell by  about 10 percent. Juvenile delinquency rates  rose by 131 percent, and illegitimate birth  rates jumped 141 percent. Drug and alcohol  use exploded, and white teen-age violence  soared, with homicide up 232 percent and  suicide up 140 percent.  Messrs. Uhlenberg and Eggebeen argue  that we must now question the traditional  social science view that ""environment"" is at  the root of youth problems, a view they say  has ""diverted attention from what may be  the most critical determinant of all;  the  bond between child and parent.""  In this area, we have seen a disturbing  breakdown as evidenced by the 140-percent  rise  in divorce rates and the  increasingly  self-centered attitudes of parents. As Daniel  Yankelovich found  in a 1981 poll, ""nearly  two-thirds of all American parents reject  the idea that parents should stay together  for the children's sake."" A similar majority  feel  that ""parents should be free  to  live  their own lives even  if it means spending  less time with their children.""  IDtimately, the only solution to troubled  teen-agers may well lie in what Cornell psy chologist Urie Bronfenbrenner calls the ""es sential prerequisite"" for healthy human de velopment:  ""Somebody  has  to  be  crazy  about the kid. . . . "" Crazy enough to super vise and nourish his or her development,  and to demand higher standards.  We don't suggest that the clock can be  turned back, or that ""a woman's place is in  the home."" Teen  suicide  no  doubt has  deeper and more complex roots than we can  suggest here. But the evidence does indicate  there's no substitute for old-fashioned par enting. How we come to grips with that in  our modem,  two-wage-earner  economy,  should be a priority issue.  BEST WISHES, FRANK  YANKOVIC  HON. WILLIAM F. CUNGER, JR.

In this regard, I recommend to all of my col leagues the following op-ed piece, written by  our colleague, HENRY HYDE of Illinois, on the  United States past experience with a testing  moratorium-a moratorium which the Soviets  broke unilaterally in 1961.  There are many lessons to be learned from  this  experience.

Identified by the freeze movement as a  priority arms control issue in 1986, this in fatuation has resulted in a proliferation of  bills and resolutions in both the House and  Senate calling for everything from the im mediate negotiation of a Comprehensive  Test Ban Treaty <CTBT> to instant partici pation in a nuclear-testing moratorium with  the Soviet Union.  Perhaps  sensing  that arms control-an  issue jealously guarded by the Democratic  Party as ""its own""-was slipping through its  fingers and gradually becoming the proper ty of President Ronald Reagan, some Demo crats have been scrambling to devise a new  Democratic  arms  control  strategy. As  a  result, nuclear strategy and the Strategic  Defense  Initiative  have  emerged  as  the  major targets of the Democratic arms con trol arsenal.  The Democratic leadership in the House,  urged on by liberal activists, is once again  considering bringing legislation to the floor  of the House of Representatives that will  direct the president to begin immediate ne gotiations with the Soviet Union on a Com prehensive Test Ban Treaty.  In the quixotic hope that some of my lib eral colleagues may recall Sen. Henry Jack son's advice that in matters of national se",1986
200,Senate,99,-0.033,914,6,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President,  the  reaction of both Americans and Euro peans toward one another since  the  raid on Libya has been of great con cern to many of us. Our alliance with  our  NATO  partners  in Western  Europe is vital to our security as well  as to theirs. There is no reason for the  bond  to weaken  now.  Indeed, we  should  be  strengthening  our  ties  rather than loosening them.  But some in the United States argue  that many European countries have  not cooperated fully with efforts  to  identify  and deport  terrorists. And  many Europeans counter that NATO  is set up for the purpose of defending  the Atlantic community against Soviet  aggression, not  to conduct activities  ""out of area.""  The time has obviously come for all  of us to sit down and iron out our dif ferences and reaffirm our close friend ship. In an excellent article in the New  York Times of April 20, 1986, Flora  Lewis outlines the problem and warns  of the consequences if the allies fail to  resolve their differences.  I ask unanimous consent that ""Time  to Agree,"" the column by Flora Lewis,  be inserted in the REcoRD.  There being no objection, the article  printed  in  the  was  ordered  to  be  RECORD, as follows:  TIME TO AGREE  <By Flora Lewis>  MILAN,  ITALY.-Sitting  in  the  T.W.A.  lounge at Kennedy Airport waiting for the  overnight flight to Italy induced a dull fa talism. Passengers watched the news in si lence while Dan Rather  told about  the  warnings, the fears,  the precautions being  taken by the U.S. Government.  When the newscast was over, one young  woman blurted out, ""If my livelihood didn't  depend on  it,  I wouldn't  take  this  trip.''  Later another said with a nervous giggle:  ""There's  always been  terrorism  in  Italy,  hasn't there? We'll keep a low profile, not  let on that we're Americans.""  The night before, skimming the intensity  of American reaction, television had shown  a schoolchild grinning, no doubt because of  the camera trained on him, and asking, ""Are  we going to have a nuclear war new because  Russia  is a part of Libya?"" And  then it  showed  a  parent,  an  earnest,  heavy-set  woman with short brown hair, saying grave ly,  ""The kids are worried,  really worried  that there's going to be a war.""  Then there was a psychiatrist in a white  smock, identified as a stress expert, explain ing that people with high blood pressure, or  ulcers, or bad backs, were likely to feel a lot  worse in this period because they'd be tight ening up under the tension and that would  aggravate their maladies.  I wondered what we were doing to our selves. One day Americans were puffed-up  supermen, proudly telling each other that  nobody can push them around. The next  day people were quivering, not at terrorism  but in self-induced terror,  to a degree 'no  Libyan leader could possibly achieve.  The flight was uneventful and the arrival  tiring but routine. The conference here is  about East-West relations, attended mostly  by Europeans from both sides but also a  number of  prominent Americans  and  a  couple of Soviet officials. The atmosphere is  cordial, as usual, but there is an undercur rent of serious disturbance among the West erners.  Italian Labor Minister Gianni de Michelis  noted unhappily that thousands of students  were demonstrating against the U.S. in the  middle of Milan, the first big anti-American  demonstration since the period of the Viet nam War. ""We're all against terrorism, cer tainly in Italy,"" he said, ""but bombing that  kills women and children . . . ""  Another Italian said that may be the ex pression of youth, but older people were get ting fed up and were wondering why this  country, which finally took very stern meas ures to defeat its own decade of terrorism,  hadn't been readier to cooperate in isolating  Libya. A senior German expert on interna tional affairs said he was personally embar rassed at the allied refusal to show more sol idarity with the United States.  There was clearly concern that the depth  of angry feeling on both sides would do seri ous damage to the alliance, far beyond what  Moscow,  let alone Tripoli, could possibly  have provoked. That is the real issue now,  much more important to the future of all in  the West than the random, occasional inci dents of terrorism. It is harder to dramatize,  but it is a far greater danger.  The  recriminations and  the analysis of  who should have done what at which step  have to be set aside. The spilt milk must be  cleaned up. The urgent need now  is  for  clear, public show of allied solidarity so that  the peoples of the West and the opposing  regimes can see that the dispute has been a  limited one about methods, not about pur pose and determination.  The deadline for action is probably the  Tokyo summit  in a  fortnight. Otherwise,  the wounds will fester and take a long time  to heal. It shouldn't really be so difficult for  the major Western states to agree on some  political  and  economic  sanctions  against  Libya  to  show  they can and do  take a  common stand.  If the measures go further than Europe ans might really wish and not quite so far as  Washington would like, that won't matter.  That is the meaning of friendship and ac commodation. The point  is  to show  that  there really is basic agreement.  The immediate problem is weak govern ments in Europe. France, is virtually para lyzed by its internal politics, and Germany's  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, normally indeci sive,  is  in  added  personal  trouble. The  French-German axis which underpins the  European Community probably isn't up to  an initiative. Britain's Margaret Thatcher is  out on a shaky limb. Italy and Spain are  talking about taking a  lead  together, but  they're afraid of seeming inconsequential.  Leaders must stop dithering. The passions  they have stirred can fracture the bulwark  of the West on which they all rely.  SOUTH AFRICA AND ETHIOPIA  ",1986

202,Senate,99,0.301,953,6,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to join with my colleagues Sena tor MITCHELL, Senator PROXMIRE, and  Senator HUMPHREY in support of legis lation which would amend Public Law  97-425, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act  of 1982.  The act instructed the Department  of Energy to develop guidelines and an  agenda by which the Federal Govern ment would study, select, construct,  and operate a high level nuclear waste  repository that will safely hold radio active waste for 10,000 years or more.  Congress deliberated for 5 years on  this critical issue before passage of the  Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The law au thorized the Department of Energy to  build a first repository site in either  salt basalt or tuff medium with a ca pacity for holding up to 70,000 metric  tons of radioactive waste. While the  law  instructs DOE  to  recommend a  second repository to be located in crys talline rock, Congress did not author ize the construction of a second reposi tory site.  I  The bill  have cosponsored  today  would require DOE  to proceed with  the selection of one  repository site,  removes the 70,000-metric-ton cap on  the first repository sites storage capac ity, and prohibits DOE from consider ing a second unauthorized repository  site. In addition, the current law re quires  the Federal Government  to  take title to all commercial spent fuel  by 1998. If the DOE is unable to meet  the 1998 operational deadline for the  first repository site, all DOE activity  under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act  would stop until an independent scien tific commission reviewed available op tions for the safe permanent disposal  of high level waste.  In 1982 the Department of Energy  projected  that  the  accumulated  amount of spent fuel from commercial  nuclear  powerplants  would  total  146,000 metric tons by the year 2020.  DOE's latest estimate, included in the  December 1985 document, ""Spent Fuel  and Radioactive Waste  Inventories,  Proje~tions, and Characteristics,"" con cludes that the amount of commercial  spent  fuel would be 126,000 metric  tons by the year 2020. We can already  see a substantial reduction in the esti mated amount of nuclear waste to be  generated in the next 35 years.  I believe we will see  lower projec tions in the years to come for several  reasons. First, it seems highly unlikely  that new commercial nuclear power plants will be ordered in this century  due to their expense and the availabil ity of other energy resources. In 1985,  16 percent of electricity used in the  United States was generated by nucle ar powerplants. Second, utilities are  extending the use of their fuel rods,  thus producing  less spent fuel. Cur rent law limits the first repository's  storage capacity to 70,000 metric tons.  I believe technology can be developed  to safely store an increased capacity in  one repository with an increased ca pacity, while saving billions of tax dol lars.  The future will demonstrate no need  for construction of a second repository  site. However, while our waste projec tions are declining, DOE expense for  the repository program  is escalating  dramatically. The current projected  costs for developing two repositories is  approximately $26.7 billion, up 36 per cent from the July 1983, cost estimate  of $19.6 billion.  DOE's schedule for  the crystalline  project, the siting of a second reposi tory  in granite, would  cost  in  the  range of $500 million to $1 billion for  each of 5 sites DOE will characterize  in detail between the years 1991-95.  Before five sites are selected, DOE will  spend up to $1 million on each of the  12 sites DOE is considering as poten tial candidates. It is quite illogical for  billions of taxpayers' dollars to be in vested in the analysis of a second re pository site when current data demonstrates that one repository may be  sufficient to hold all of the Nation's  nuclear waste projected at this time.  Mr. Chairman, I have serious doubts  about DOE's interpretation and imple mentation  of  the  Nuclear Waste  Policy Act. I believe DOE has deprived  the State of New Hampshire of a  meaningful role in the siting process,  and has acted contrary to congression al intent as expressed in the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act. DOE's arbitrary de cision to choose 12 potentially accepta ble sites for a second repository site  when by its own analysis the top 9  sites are clearly superior to the next 3  is an abuse of the agency discretion.  We are all very aware that the act re quired that the Federal Government  consult with affected States during  the siting process. This requirement is  supported by a rich legislative history  which make it abundantly clear that  Congress intended that the opportuni ty for public and State participation in  the siting process must be meaningful,  not merely theoretical. Because DOE  has failed to properly consider many  important factors in evaluating the ac ceptability of a second repository site,  the agency has cast doubt on  the  credibility of the entire site selection  process.  The  only way DOE  can  restore  public confidence in this process is for  Congress to swiftly put a halt to the  waste of millions of  tax dollars  in  siting a second repository. We should  instruct DOE to focus its energy and  personnel  on  one  repository  site,  expand the capacity of that site, and  have an  independent scientific com mission evaluate DOE's implementa tion of the guidelines set forth under  the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  This  legislation  is not  intended  to  remove one State from the selection  process. It is to get the DOE program  back on track and within the intent of  Congress. We must be fiscally prudent  and careful to ensure the public's con fidence with DOE's repository pro gram. I believe it is in the best interest  of the American public to revisit this  issue  to ensure the safest and most  cost-effective disposal of our Nation's  high level radioactive waste.e  e ",1986

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of this legislation, H.R. 4420-a  bill to amend title 10, United States  Code  to revise the retirement system  for ~ew members of  the uniformed  services,  and  for other purposes.  I  compliment our distinguished chair man, Mr. AsPIN  and his  leadership  ability in bringing this measure to the  floor today. I find it a distinct privi lege to participate with my hard-work ing colleagues of the committee and  with such a truly professional staff, to  preserve the commitment we have to  our servicemen and women who have  honorably served this great country of  ours in the past, to those now serving,  and to those who will serve America in  the future.  Additionally, the chairman, commit tee, and staff are to be complimented  on the manner in which this matter of  unauthorized  appropriations  have  been resolved. I believe, in this time of  fiscal constraints and efforts to reduce  the  deficit,  that  this  bill  provides  those resources so necessary  to pre serve and improve both our deterrent  and defense capabilities, as well as the  infrastructure  necessary  to  support  these weapons systems and quality of  life for  those service personnel who  defend our free Nation.

Before delivering my remarks which  will be certainly less than 5 minutes, I  would  like  to commend  the distin guished gentleman from Indiana and  the ranking member of the Subcom mittee  on Military  Personnel  and  Compensation who by his choice will  be retiring at the end of this session of  Congress. We will certainly miss him.  He is one of the grand and dedicat ed, conscientious, and effective Mem bers of this body.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to echo  the comments made by the gentleman  from Alabama about the quality of the  people who are serving  in  the uni formed services of the United States  of America at this time.  The quality has never been higher,  and it is a credit to the Congresses  which provided  levels of compensa tion, quality of life benefits and retir~­ ment benefits which have made this  possible.  We  should be  extremely nervous  about changing  it  in any way  that  would denigrate the quality of those  people.  .  I have visited  them on  the flight  lines,  in  their  submarines,  in  their  tanks, and I  just could not be more  proud of  the quality of  those who  serve us.  With reference to this bill today, Mr.  Chairman, I rise in support but most  assuredly in reluctant support of the  measure. We are, when we face up to  it, legislating a reduction in retirement  benefits for those who serve from 20  to 30 years in the military service, a re duction at least in terms of what they  would now receive under present law.  Why then do I support this bill? I  support it because in our last session  we enacted legislation which in effect  says to the Department of Defense:  Unless you make suggestions of changes  in the retirement system which will reduce  appropriations to the retirement a~c.r;uai ac count, we are going to take $2.9 bllllon out  of the personnel account of the Department  of Defense. We have got to enact something  that you recommended to us or a modifica tion thereof before May 1, 1986.  thank the  Well, we are near that date, we must  act or otherwise some very draconian  things would have to happen to the  personnel account and literally thou sands  and  thousands  of  qualified  people  in  the  uniformed  services  would have to be released from serv ice.  We cannot permit that to happen.  This bill, when passed, will prevent it  from happening.  For that reason it is entitled to my  support and, I believe, the support of  the full membership of the House. I  do however, utter my regrets that it is ne~essary for us to reduce these retire ment benefits. I certainly hope that it  is going to be possible that this be im plemented in a way that is going to  give  the maximum  encouragement  within these financial parameters for  people remaining in our services for  longer than 20 years.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1986
209,,99,0.017,1005,6,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," I  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  this legislation and thank my chair man for giving me this opportunity.  But I will offer an amendment at the  proper  time which  should be very  soon. I would like  to briefly explain  this amendment and  say  that  this  amendment which I will offer today  has the total support of all the Re serve  forces  in  this  country. This  amendment would add for the Army  National Guard $100 million, for the  Army Reserve $100 million,  for  the  Naval Reserve $25 million,  for  the  Marine Reserve $10 million,  for  the  Air Force Reserve $10 million, and for  the Air National Guard $40 million,  which totals out to $285 million.  Yes, that is a lot of money, but we  get a lot from our Reserve forces and  National Guard.  Let me point out to my colleagues  that this amendment I will offer con tains no big-ticket items, no purchase  of big airplanes, tanks, or ships; items  like simulators for the Marine Corps  Reserve back at the armories, training  aids for the Army Reserve, modifica tion kits for the A-7's in the Air Guard  and Reserve  to make  these planes  safer for our reservists flying  them;  and devices to improve safety on our  equipment.  The money will not go, Mr. Chair man  just  to 1 or 2 States  in  this  ame~dment, but the money will go to  all 50 States. It is a good possibility  that some of the equipment purchased  under this amendment will end up in  the armory in your hometown or your  municipal airport where the Air Re serve units are located.  ",1986
210,House,99,-0.32,1018,6,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, we have worked on  this issue of the amount of money to  be authorized and appropriated under  this bill for a long time, and it seems  to me that if we start making excep tions here and there, we are going to  end up with a  lot more exceptions  than we have rules. So I rise in reluc tant opposition to the gentleman from  Mississippi  [Mr. MONTGOMERY]  be cause he is a good friend, and a good  friend of the Guard and the Reserve,  and the Guard and the Reserve de serve some support.  I would like to point out to the mem bers of the committee that the Guard  and Reserve have gotten a lot of sup port in the fiscal year 1986 authoriza tion bill. In fact we approved $658 mil lion more  than  the  administration  asked for in 1986. So before we do any thing with this bill, we are already at  $658 million higher than the adminis tration's request in fiscal year 1986 for  the Guard and Reserve.  The  gentleman  from Mississippi  would like to add another $285 million,  which in fact puts us a billion dollars  over  the Reagan administration  re quest for the Guard and Reserve for  fiscal year 1986. I am not saying that  there are not things that you can find  to spend that kind of money on, but it  does seem  to me  that in a  time of  fiscal austerity everybody has got to  take part of  the  cuts. When  the  Gramm-Rudman provision took effect  in 1986, the Guard and Reserve lost  probably about $250 million through  It seems to me that that is not right,  the Gramm-Rudman cuts  for  1986.  What we are doing here in effect is  saying  that  the Guard and Reserve  should be exempt from the Gramm Rudman cuts. The gentleman  from  Mississippi is adding a little bit more  money back than the Gramm-Rudman  cut.  that if you are going to have Gramm Rudman cuts-and a lot of people who  voted  for  the Gramm-Rudman cuts  certainly  understood  what  those  Gramm-Rudman cuts were going  to  mean to every line item in the budget,  and that meant the Guard and Re serve  line  items  in  the budget-it  seems to me that we ought to not now  go back and restore  the money  for  those things that were being cut under  Gramm-Rudman.

JOE ADDABBO worked endlessly on behalf  of his Sixth District in New York during his 25  years  in  the House. But his district was not  the only one to benefit from his public service.  To every American who wanted a guarantee  that tax dollars were being spent wisely, JoE  ADDABBO was the one person we could count  on to scrutinize defense spending. To Ameri cans who pursued the dream of owning their  own small business, JOE ADDABBO was one  Member who played a key role in making that  dream become a reality. And  to Americans  grateful that no more young men died in the  jungles of Vietnam, JoE AoDABBO was one  person who deserved thanks because he was  the  first  to successfully sponsor an antiwar  resolution.  The quality I remember most about JOE Ao DABBO  is his courage. When he was  faced  with his painful illness never once did he ask  for sympathy. He carried on his duties with  dignity and of course, still possessing a big,  warm smile.  The void left by JOE's departure will be diffi cult to fill. However, his legacy will remain with  us. We are all richer because JOE ADDABBO  touched our lives.  ",1986
214,House,99,-0.007,1057,6,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, JOE ADDABBO will  be missed not only by his  loved ones and  friends but also by the Congress of the United  States. JoE was a very effective representa tive of his people, and his impact was felt well  beyond the borders of his New York district.  Although  there were many who disagreed  with JoE on certain issues, especially defense  spending, I do not know of anyone who per sonally disliked JOE ADDABBO.  I came  to know Congressman ADDABBO  very early in my first year in Congress. It was  with fear and trepidation that I went to see the  distinguished chairman of Defense Appropria tions about a problem in my district. From the  first moment  I met JoE,  I felt completely at  ease. The warmth of his smile and his friendli ness helped me emerge from the meeting not  only with a commitment to help with my prob lem but also with a good feeling of having met  a true friend.  During the 7% years I had the privilege of  serving with JOE  in  the House,  there were  many times when I found it necessary to talk  over issues with JoE. I always found him to be  understanding, concerned and  responsive  to  my needs.  I know that other Members found  JOE  to be the same way with  them  in  their  problems.  JoE ADDABBO was  a  friend  to  everybody.  The funeral service at St. Patrick's Cathe dral in New York City, which many of us had  the privilege  to attend, beautifully expressed  the affection that thousands of people had for  this man. Yes, JoE was a great American who  served his country well. He will be greatly  missed.  I add my sincerest sympathies to his family  in  their loss. May God comfort them  in  their  bereavement.  ",1986
215,House,99,-0.258,1057,6,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to join  my colleagues in paying tribute to JoE ADDAB80. JOE was a leader of the House in every  sense of the word, and he was a man of great  courage. We will truly miss him.  In  this institution, with  its committee struc ture,  there is enormous pressure on each of  us  to conform  to  the accepted attitudes of  those who have  the greatest  interest  in our  Specific committees. As chairman of the Ap propriations Subcommittee on Defense, JOE  was always under enormous pressure not just  to work  for a strong defense but to provide  the Defense Establishment-both the Penta gon and defense  industries-with everything  they asked  for, which was generally  far too  much in a time of $200 billion deficits.  JoE resisted that pressure. He fought for a  strong defense, but he opposed waste and he  opposed excess. He won as often as he lost,  and when he won, it was the American people  who were the true victors. He was a thought ful,  tenacious battler for his constituents and  for the broader public, and he did the same  for the House  in  its disputes with  the other  body. The House and the entire Nation owes  him a debt of gratitude for his work.  Of course, we cannot define JOE only by his  role as a Member of Congress. His life, and  particularly the latter years of his life, stand for  more  than  just  integrity and competence  in  Government. They stand for human courage,  the will to live, and the will to make one's life  meaningful to the end. We are all aware now  that JOE  struggled with cancer  for several  years.  It became obvious only recently. JOE  never wanted  to be  treated differently; he  never wanted sympathy. He wanted to contin ue to be effective and to make a significant  contribution. He succeeded  in  that. And  in  doing so, he was an example to all of us of  human courage and strength. We will never  forget his bravery.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the New York  delegation for taking the time for this special  order.  I also want to extend my sympathy to  JoE ADDABBO's  family.  I am proud  to have  known him, and I hope that their grief is eased  at  least a little bit by  the genuine emotions  being expressed by his colleagues today.  ",1986

It is necessary to have this legisla tion to achieve a more balanced repre sentation of  religious  faiths  among  Armed Forces chaplains. When we ask  our men and women to serve in the de fense of our country-they in truth  are serving in our stead. And, in that  service  they should have  the  ready  availability of  religious counsel and  guidance-and  the comfort which  it  brings-from a representative of their  own faith.  I think that this is the least we can  offer  these men and women  in  the  Armed  Forces-this  as  a  religious  nation, we owe them this much when  we are asking so much of them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my col leagues to join me in supporting the  military chaplains bill, H.R. 1875. We  should all be working for its passage.

227,House,99,-0.362,1096,6,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, yester day the House of Representatives by  unanimous consent passed House Res olution 427. The effect of House Reso lution 427 was to amend the rules of  the House and to increase the limit on  outside earned income for Members of  the House from 30 percent of their  salary to 40 percent.  In addition, while  it increased the  limit on honoraria income, it effective ly repealed the limit on other forms of  outside earned income.  This morning I filed with the Clerk  of the House, House Resolution 431,  which would have restored rule 47 to  exactly the same language that exist ed before  the House's action yesterday. It would have continued to limit  outside earned income to 30 percent of  a Member's salary and all other limita tions that were in existence yesterday.  There  is an orderly procedure for  changing the rules and Members' sala ries. Those of my colleagues who agree  with House Resolution 427, which I do  not, can approach the Rules Commit tee requesting the change contained in  House Resolution 427.  Unfortunately, this morning when I  made a unanimous-consent request to  consider my resolution, which would  have rescinded the action of the House  yesterday,  there was  an  objection  heard from the minority whip.  I do not believe this matter should  be considered by unanimous consent,  and I have taken the Speaker's advice  to take this matter to the Rules Com mittee later today. I am hoping we can  undo and rescind  the action of  the  House yesterday.

228,House,99,0.379,1109,6,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I  rise  in support of the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, first to all, I would  like  to  begin  by  commending  the  people who were responsible for nego tiating out the bill that is before us. It  is a very good bill, and I urge commen dation of this House for them finally  breaking a logjam which we have had  in this area for quite a while, and get ting it behind us.  Mr. Chairman,  the author of  the  amendment, our beloved friend from  Iowa, Mr. BEDELL, has decided to retire  at the end of this session, his amend ment will improve this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the gentleman's amendment.  I am aware that penalties for sur plus  commodity  production  are  al ready in the bill. However, I have my  doubts  that  the bill's penalties are  severe  enough  to  ensure  that  the  newly irrigated lands won't be used for  surplus crop production. There is no  reason  the  Federal  Government  should provide any irrigation subsidy  to farmers who use  these  lands for  producing surplus commodities.  Farm programs are costing the tax payers billions of dollars a year.  It  seems  to me  that we  should make  every effort to make sure that other  Government programs don't result in  increased production of commodities  that are already in surplus. This genIt  to  the gentle If a  Chairman,  I  for his state tleman's amendment gives us the op portunity to do just that.  The new farm bill established a huge  conservation reserve under which we  will pay farmers  to  take 40 million  acres out of production over the next 5  years,  in addition to the millions of  acres of annual set-asides under the  wheat and  feed grains program.  would be  ridiculous  for us  to  turn  around and pay irrigation subsidies to  farmers in North Dakota for bringing  new land into production of those sur plus crops.  farmer still wants to produce  these crops, let him pay the full costs  of production  as  farmers  in other  States do. Let's make sure we aren't  spending the taxpayers money to add  to the surplus with these newly irri gated lands when we're already spend ing their money to reduce it. I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment.  0 1205  ",1986

230,Senate,99,-0.374,1161,6,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to oppose an amendment to the  Senate budget resolution which would  eliminate the 44 programs the Presi dent recommended for termination in  his budget proposal.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that a  list of  these programs  appear at this point in the REcoRD.  Let me mention just a  few of the  programs  slated  for  elimination by  this amendment. The General Reve nue Sharing Program would be elimi nated, despite the fact that this impor tant means of Federal-local coopera tion helps towns and cities in my State  of Vermont provide essential services  without raising already high property  taxes.  The Work Incentive Program [WIN]  would be canceled. Yet, WIN  is  the  only Federal program with the specific  charge of removing Americans  from  welfare rolls and placing them in jobs.  WIN has been especially important in  helping single parents on welfare find  employment and a means of support  for  their children. Not only  is WIN  well-intentioned; but it works and it  works  in Vermont, where our WIN  Program was rated first in the Nation.  Federal support for libraries would  also end as a  result of  this amend ment.  I  cannot  think of a  greater  threat to an enlightened America or  an  informed electorate  than ending  support for  libraries-very often the  center of knowledge and information  in rural communities.  Passage of  this amendment would  also mean the end of passenger rail  service in Vermont. Since 1979, I have  fought  to maintain and  strengthen  Amtrak's Montrealer service  to Ver mont. This amendment would not only  put an end to the Montrealer; it would  eliminate Federal support for Amtrak.  These are just a few examples of the  ill effects of the proposed amendment  eliminating 44 Federal programs.  But, what  is worse-what  is more  compelling-is the fact that canceling  these programs would only save $4 bil lion. There is no doubt that $4 billion  is a great deal of money, but there are  far more  sensible and  less painless  ways of raising those funds than cut ting important programs wholesale.  Earlier  this year,  the General Ac counting Office reported to me that  more than $7.5 billion could be saved  in the Pentagon budget simply by cor recting incorrect inflation assumptions  in major defense contracts. That is,  GAO found $7.5 billion in padding and  waste in defense contracts.  It is beyond me, how the administra tion could ask us to gut programs that  help people-that help people in Ver mont-to reduce the deficit by $4 bil lion, when almost twice that much can  be  saved by  teaching Pentagon ac countants to add.  For  this  reason, Mr. President,  I  urge my  colleagues  to  defeat  this  amendment soundly.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the  in  list  the  PROGRAMS To BE TERMINATED  Work incentive program <WIN).  General revenue sharing.  Conrail.

232,Senate,99,0.241,1174,6,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with Senators ANDREWs  and HOLLINGS in sponsoring this very  necessary amendment  to  the budget  resolution <S. Con. Res. 120).  Mr.  President,  I  am,  no  doubt,  viewed as one of the more fiscally con servative members  of  this  distin guished body. I do not apologize for  being  concerned  about  the Federal  deficit. We must work  together  to  ensure  that our  children  and our  grandchildren are not burdened with  our debts.  We must also provide our children  with a quality education. As a former  schoolteacher,  I  can assure my col leagues that a dollar spent wisely on  the education of our youth is an in valuable  investment  in our Nation's  future.  Mr. President, in my State the vast  majority of those who puruse a post secondary education rely upon Federal  financial aid. Without adequate funds  for  these important programs, many  students in South Dakota and across  the Nation will be denied access to a  college education or vocational train ing.  Additionally,  programs  which  serve to assist disadvantaged students  [TRIO]  and developing  institutions  will suffer  if we  fail  to adopt  this  amendment. Surely we cannot deny  our young people the opportunity to  realize their hopes and dreams for a  bright and promising future.  As my colleagues know, I have long  been an outspoken proponent of the  impact aid program. Our Nation's fed erally  impacted schools, particularly  those which are heavily impacted with  military dependents or Native Ameri can children, whose parents do not  contribute to the local tax base, can ill  afford any reductions in funds. Cer tainly the Federal Government has an  obligation  to  reimburse  local school  districts that are unable to generate  sufficient revenues due to Federal ac tivity.  Mr. President, there are a number of  other vital education programs which  are provided for through this amend ment, including Chapter 1 compensa tory education, chapter 2 ECIA [Edu cation Consolidation  and  Improve ment Act], vocational education, and  handicapped  education.  I  commend  the distinguished Senators from North  Dakota and South Carolina for devel oping this sensible and well-balanced  amendment. I urge our colleagues to  join in supporting the amendment.  ",1986
233,,99,-0.267,1200,6,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr. Speaker,  an  informed electorate is vital  to democracy.  And to keep people informed, they must have  access to as much information as possible.  I'm sure you'll agree that the information ex plosion we've  experienced  in  the United  States in the past decade has been important  to our free society.  But I am disturbed at what  is becoming a  serious problem in rural America. Many people  have bought home satellite dishes so  they  can  receive  television signals  they wouldn't  otherwise have access to in rural areas of the  country.  Now they are  faced with  losing access to  those channels. Many channels have already  begun  scrambling  their signals and  others  plan to start scrambling in the near future.  There  are  thousands  of  satellite  dish  owners in my State of North Dakota. They're  not asking for a free ride. They are willing to  pay a fair price for the signals they receive,  but  they are  threatened with being denied  those signals unless Congress acts.  Congress has an opportunity  to put some  sanity into this chaos.  That's why  I am urging other Members of  Congress to join me in cosponsoring the Rural  Satellite Dish Owners Protection Act, H.R.  3989. The legislation, introduced by Congress man MAC SWEENEY of Texas,  is a sensible  approach.  The legislation would place a moratorium on  the scrambling of the signals until several im portant protections are available  to satellite  dish owners.  First, the Federal Communications Commis sion would set uniform standards before any  signals could be scrambled.  This means a single type of decoder would  have  to be available  to descramble all pro grams. This would ensure  that satellite dish  owners are not forced to buy 3, 4 or even 10  decorders  to  receive all  the programs  they  want.  Asking the FCC to set technical standards  so that a dish owner would only have to buy  one type of decoder is the fair approach.  Back in the 1960's, the FCC was faced with  a similar task.  It set standards for television  sets,  for example, so  that consumers didn't  have to buy two television sets to receive all  broadcast programs.  Second, a decoder must be available  for  sale or lease to any person within 60 days of  an order. This will prevent dish owners from  waiting months and months for decoders.  Third,  decoders  should  be  reasonably  priced  in relation  to the cost of manufacture  and distribution. This is an attempt to prevent  price gouging.  Fourth,  this  legislation aims at providing a  fair marketing approach to allow dish owners  to buy program subscriptions at  reasonable  prices. There are modifications being  pro posed to this legislation so cable companies  April 23, 1986  would not have a monopoly on marketing pro grams to dish owners.  Right now, satellite dish owners are faced  with confusing choices. The rules of the game  are being changed. They are being  told that  more and more channels will soon be scram bled and will be faced with buying several de coders-which  cost  hundreds  of  dollars  each-to unscramble signals.  At this point, we can't depend on the mar ketplace to straighten out this mess.  I urge other Members of the House to co sponsor this legislation.  AMBASSADORS TO THE SOVIET  UNION  HON.

I want to point  out that as the preeminent moral force in the  world today, the United States is obligated to  vocally  support Soviet Jews-a community  confronted by rampant anti-Semitism and sub jected to mass humiliation.  The fact that pressure has been successful ly brought to bear on the Soviets in an effort  to gain the freedom of Russian Jews, tells us  that the U.S.S.R. is not impervious to interna tional opinion.  It  is precisely for this reason  that we must not let up on our rhetorical, dip lomatic, and economic support at  this  time.  We can be certain that the Soviet authorities  would  love  to have our support die a quiet  death by effectively ignoring the issue. Howev er,  to do  this would be  to condemn Soviet  Jewry to a future of immobilizing despair and  would encourage the KGB  to continue com pletely undeterred in their objectives of cultur al genocide.

242,House,99,-0.514,1408,6,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker. I rise in support  of H.R. 4600, the ""Indian Health Care Amend ments Act of 1986."" As  chairman of  the  Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and  Control, I would like to focus my remarks on  title VII, section 702,  ""Juvenile Alcohol and  Drug Abuse.""  Drug and alcohol abuse among our adoles cent population has reached epidemic propor tions. The National Institute on Drug Abuse's  annual survey of high school seniors indicates  that more than 60 percent of the students sur veyed had used drugs. While only a few studies have  focused on subgroups of minority  students, the available evidence indicates that  drug involvement among Indian youth is very  high, particularly for marijuana, alcohol, inhal ants and stimulants.  Moreover, although the treatment admission  information available is also very limited, indi cations are that the ratio of treatment in the  Nation per 1 00,000 population  is greater for  American Indians than whites. The most com monly  reported drugs of abuse are heroin,  marijuana, PCP, and  ""other""-usually desig nating inhalants.  The need  for drug abuse prevention and  education programs-now commonly referred  to as ""demand reduction"" strategies-across  the Nation  is generally accepted.  I have at tempted to address this problem in H.R. 4155,  the ""Drug Abuse Education Act of 1986.""  In  order  to provide such programs  for  Indian  youth, several additional obstacles must be  addressed. Section 702 begins to address the  problem of providing drug and alcohol educa tion  and  prevention  programs  for  Indian  youths by responding  to some of those bar riers.  First, no agency is designated to provide al cohol and drug abuse education  for  Indian  youth. Rather,  the  responsibilities are  dis persed among  three agencies-the Depart ment of Health and Human Services (Indian  Health Service), the Department of the Interior  (Bureau of Indian Affairs), and the Department  of Education. Section  702,  addresses  the  problem of coordination by mandating that the  Secretary  of Health  and Human Services  enter into an agreement with the Secretary of  the Interior and the Secretary of Education to  coordinate the efforts of their Departments re lated to alcohol and drug abuse among Indian  juveniles. The agreement will provide for the  identification and coordination of available re sources and programs to combat Indian juve nile alcohol and drug abuse through preven tion, education, counseling, and referral.  A second barrier to drug and alcohol educa tion and prevention programs for Indian youth  is the lack of teachers and counselors trained  to deal with these problems. Section 702 also  requires  the  three Secretaries  to develop a  program to provide training in preventive edu cation, identification of abusers, and counsel ing  techniques. This training would be made  available  to  teachers and counselors  in BIA  schools,  schools  under BIA  contract,  and  public schools on or near Indian reservations.  Third, essential  to good programming and  an effective response is an understanding of  the problem and an awareness of what has  worked. Accordingly,  section  702,  requires  that  the BIA,  in consultation with  the  Indian  Health Service review  the relevant  literature,  including  the  literature on  school  curricula.  This  information would  then be made avail able to the appropriate schools.  Fourth, section 702, addresses the problem  of implementation. It provides  for the estab lishment of an Office of Alcohol and Drug  Abuse within the Service. This office would be  responsible for all Indian Health Service alco hol and drug abuse programs.  I would, however, emphasize  that section  702 is just a first step in the fight against drug  and alcohol abuse among  Indian youth. Ac cordingly,  it does not eliminate the need  for  comprehensive legislation such as H.R. 1156,  the ""Indian Juvenile Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Prevention Act."" This  legislation, which  I am  proud  to cosponsor, was  introduced by  the  gentleman from Nebraska. It provides not only  for drug and alcohol abuse education  for  Indian youth, but for treatment and rehabilita tion, family services, and crisis intervention. By  addressing  the problems of resource coordi nation, teacher training, and the assessement  of available information, section 702 lays the  groundwork  for such a comprehensive ap proach.  At this time, I would like to endorse strongly  section 702 of H.R. 4600. Drug and alcohol  abuse education and prevention programs for  Indian youth are a special and critical need.  Section 702 provides the necessary founda tion from which we can begin to confront this  problem.  I would urge my colleagues to sup port this measure.  0 1250  ",1986

244,House,99,0.503,10,14,Mr. HARTNETT.," Madam Speaker,  today we will be faced with the deci sion as to whether or not to override  President Reagan's veto of a very im portant piece of legislation.  President  Reagan's  philosophical  consistency is  laudable, but it is ex tracting too great a  toll from a very  important American  industry. We  have been at a disadvantage in this  country, and we are quickly and rapid ly  losing  the craftsmen,  the skilled  workers, and those workers who work  in this vital industry every year.  In the event of an all-out national  emergency, we will need thill vital in dustry, and I am afraid that it is going  to be too late.  I would say that there are very few  of my political persuasion who do not  stand shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan and admire the great suc cesses which he has enjoyed during his  term and a half in office. But I would  say to the President in this case, ""I  think that your political consistency is  wrong, Mr. President, and I, who have  considered myself to be one of your  most loyal soldiers, will leave you and  urge my colleagues to vote to override  your veto on this most important piece  of legislation.""  OVERRIDE PRESIDENTIAL VETO  OF TEXTILE AND APPAREL EN FORCEMENT ACT  <Mr. NICHOLS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
245,House,99,-0.042,10,14,Mr. NICHOLS.," Madam  Speaker,  today, those of us in this body who are  alarmed with the ever-increasing trade  deficit of the United States, especially  relating to textile and apparel imports,  have a tough row to hoe in overriding  President Reagan's veto of the textile  bill.  I stand before my colleagues today  as one person whose entire  life has  been surrounded by textile mills. As a  schoolboy growing up  in Sylacauga,  my first  job was in the textile mill.  When I served in the Alabama Legisla ture,  I  represented a county whose  major livlihood depended on the tex tile  and  apparel  mills  scattered  throughout  the  area. And  today,  Madam Speaker, I am proud to repre sent, in Congress, one of the largest  textile districts in our entire country.  My words today are not just my own,  but come from the some 25,000 textile  workers who live and work in my dis trict. From the northern part of my  district in Calhoun County, I speak for  the residents of Eastaboga, Piedmont,  Oxford,  and  Anniston.  southward  toward Randolph County, I speak for  those textile and apparel workers in  Roanoke, Rock Mills, and Wedowee.  Madam Speaker,  the valley area of  Alabama's Third Congressional Dis tt:Jct includes the towns of Shawmut,  Langdale, Lanett, and Lafayette, and  in this area is one of the largest con centrations of  textile workers  to be  found anywhere  in America.  In the  southern part of my district, I speak  for those textile workers in Opelika,  Tallassee, Phenix City, and Alexander  City. And, Madam Speaker, I would be  indeed remiss today if I did not men tion my home county of Talladega and  the hundreds and hundreds of friends  who are employed in textile cut-and sew plants. All of those who live  in  these communities are represented on  this floor today and the message they  are sending is loud and clear, ""Foreign  imports are taking our jobs-we need  relief.""  Madam Speaker,  in  the  last  few  dreds of handwritten letters pointing  weeks, I have had hundreds and hun out that Alabama has lost more than  10,000 textile and apparel employees  just  in  the past 12 months due  to  plant closings, and they have all called  my attention to the recent trade fig ures released ,by the Commerce De partment showing that textile imports  from Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and  China have increased this year more  than 20 percent over last year's figure.  I beg of my colleagues, in the name  of saving American jobs and protect ing our industrial base of these United  States, to vote with me today in over riding the Presidential veto of our tex tile bill.

246,House,99,-0.237,10,14,Mr. FOWLER.," Madam Speaker,  it  seems to me that if the goal of Ameri can military security and the national  security  of  our  country  is  peace  through strength, it is no less a chal lenge to the national strength of our  country that we have competitiveness  through strength.  The national strength of this coun try is not only in its missiles and its ar maments and its men and women who  defend  our  shores;  the  national  strength of our Nation is made up of  the ability to clothe ourselves and feed  ourselves. Agriculture,  textiles, steel,  rubber-basic industries of the United  States of America-make up the na tional strength of our people. If we  lose a part of that national strength,  we lose an overall part, a key part, of  the national security of our Nation.  This is an important vote today be cause it is a vote for national strength  and national security. I am extremely  pleased with the bipartisan efforts of  my friends on both sides of the aisle to  make the case for overriding this Pres idential veto for the national strength  of this Nation.

My colleagues should remember the grain  embargo and  the pipeline embargo, and  re member how long it took us to shake the label  of ""unreliable supplier,"" to earn our way back  into the confidence of the international commu nity, because we had unilaterally abrogated  contracts.  Today we consider unilaterally abrogating  not contracts negotiated by  individuals, but  international agreements negotiated by our  Government.

It is a statement about how this House,  this Congress,  views  international  commit ments. Do we believe ourselves bound by the  tradition of diplomacy and negotiated agree ments that has governed trade and internation al  relations historically?  Let  us  reject  the  temptation to deal with our failure and frustra tion  through an erratic, destructive gesture  which is called here on this floor of the House  ""overriding the President's veto,"" but which is  the real world, in the international community,  levies a body blow at bilateral negotiations who  alone can bring order to trade relations, protec tion  for all American  jobs, and peace  in a  nuclear age.

Mr. Chairman, it is rather easy for  any Member to take the floor to rec ommend that a budgetary request be  reduced by any particular amount.  The truth of the matter is that in this  instance the maker of the motion has  exempted, and to his credit, some very  important agencies, the Internal Reve nue Service and the Customs Service,  and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  Bureau. These are revenue-producing  departments, and I think they should  be exempted.  On the other hand,  if his amend ment were to prevail, we would also  find ourselves  in a  situation where  other departments would  suffer se verely. For example, he would reduce  the funding for basic law enforcement  training. This is training that is defi nitely necessary, not only for our law  enforcement  agencies,  ATF  and  others, but it is also training that is  needed so that we can combat the ter rorism that is going on not only here  in the United States but throughout  the world. Training would be reduced  under this amendment by 54 percent  of the necessary cost. This is a tremendous reduction.

254,House,99,0.416,75,14,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to say to  you, and the ranking minority member,  Mr. SNYDER,  that I am pleased with  both the content of this legislation, and  the fact that we are bringing it before  the Members of the House at this time.  This bill extends the basic programs  of  highway  construction,  highway  safety, and public transit for 5 years.  The funding  levels  included  in  this  measure are consistent with what will  probably emerge from the budget con ference. For the outyears of this bill,  the  funding  levels  reflect  the con straints of Gramm-Rudman, and the  projected revenues into the trust fund.  These reauthorizations constitute by  far the bulk of this measure.  The work on this legislation began  months ago. Using as a base, H.R.  5504, which died during the final days  of the last Congress due to the other  bodies in action, the committee fash ioned H.R. 3129. Last week at the sub committee markup, it was my pleasure  to  introduce  the substitute  to H.R.  3129 which is before you today.  The timing of this legislation is of  great importance. We must not fail to  reauthorize  these  programs  during  this Congress. The authorizing legisla tion expires on September 30, 1986. It  would be unthinkable to not extend  these programs and the trust funds  which back them up; unfortunately,  the  unthinkable  does  sometimes  happen. We must not leave anything  to chance, nor should we leave any ex cuses out  there  for anyone on  the  other side of the Capitol to delay this  process. We must move ahead quickly  and forcefully.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to identi fy with the sponsor of  this amend ment. I think it is an excellent offer ing here today. It seems to me that it  is important for our friends who live  in the more congested parts of  the  country  to  remember  the enormous  differences that exist on the interstate  system.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania,  [Mr. SHUsTER], made the point that it  is a Federal system; it is funded by the  Federal Government;  it  is an  inter state system that moves from State to  State. But there are enormous differ ences between circumstances, for ex ample, in eastern Pennsylvania or in  the Washington, DC, metropolitan  area and a State like Wyoming.  In Wyoming we have half a million  people  living  in an area of almost  98,000 square miles where we are ap proximately  the size of the Federal  Republic of Germany. The notion that  somehow we should operate the same  way on our  Interstate System  that  States do in far more congested areas,  it seems to me, is extremely unwise.

259,House,99,-0.306,114,14,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, one of the original  authors of the 55-mile-per-hour speed  limit in the other body was a former  senior Senator from my home State of  West Virginia, Jennings Randolph. He  acted at that time with good reason  and based on what has proven to be  sound fact.  I shall not go into all those facts and  figures and polls. My colleagues from  Pennsylvania and California have very  adequately done that as have others  who are in opposition to this amend ment. Those facts indeed do show that  55-miles-per-hour does save lives and it  is working.  My good  friend  from Oklahoma's  amendment, as I understand it. is di the  rural  interstate  rected  toward  highways of  this Nation as he has  stressed in his opening remarks. In a  mountainous State such as  I  repre sent, we do have rural interstate high ways, particularly in my congressional  district, and upon the completion of  Interstates 64 and 77, we hope to have  even more rural interstate highways in  the years ahead of us.  One of those is currently the West  Virginia Turnpike for many of my col leagues  that may have  transversed  that road in going to their congres sional districts from Washington. We  have severe curves on many of our  rural interstate highways in a moun tainous State such as West Virginia.  For us to allow the speed limit to be  increased to 65-miles-an-hour on these  curves I say creates a very dangerous  and unsafe condition.  If we  allow  the  65-mile-per-hour  speed  limit  to  take effect, my col leagues must remember that we are  talking about in reality 70 or 75 miles  per hour because we know the leeway  that  law  enforcement officials give  when the speed limits are set at cer tain limits.  I  realize,  and  the gentleman will  come back and say that the State has  the option not to raise the speed limit  to  65-miles-per-hour  on  such high ways. But that, in my opinion, is only  going to create a very crazy-quilt pat tern of different speed limits through out our States. It has been referred to  that we are  talking about interstate  travel; we are talking about interstate  highways  funded 90 percent by  the  Federal Government.  I believe what  we need here  is consistency  in our  speed limits.  Motorists coming from the western  part of the United States, accustomed  to traveling perhaps 65, 70, 75 miles  per hour are going to find it, are not  going to be concentrated enough to re alize  the dangers  they are entering  into when they start driving on these  rural interstate highways in a moun tainous State such as Pennsylvania,  Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, West Vir ginia and the neighboring States  in  the Appalachian region of this coun try.  I submit that it is going to create  very uncertain and unsafe conditions,  and why should we even open the door  and that is what this amendment does  really, is to open the door for future  increases in the speed limits to a 70miles-per-hour speed limit.

279,Senate,99,0.1,218,14,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I  join  my colleague in offering this amend ment.  We have a serious problem in haz ardous waste disposal throughout the  country.  This does, as Senator MITCHELL indi cated, simply restore the funding level  requested by  the President and the  Department of Defense.  I hope the amendment will be ac cepted.  Mr. President, the amendment I am  jointly offering with my  colleague  from Maine  simply  restores  to  the  levels requested by the President the  funding  for  the Department of De fense hazardous waste cleanup pro grams. It is crucial that DOD partici pate in the on-going nationwide clean up of hazardous waste sites, and I be lieve it is important that we provide  the Department with adequate fund ing to carry out this mission.  The amendment at the desk will add  $15.3 million to DOD's environmental  restoration fund and $5 million for the  construction of hazardous waste stor age  facilities. The  funding will be  taken from the Operations and Main tenance accounts for the Army, Navy  and Air Force, a cut of about three hundredths of 1 percent. We have not  directed the services to make specific  cuts within their O&M accounts, but  rather leave it to their discretion, so  that the reductions will be as painless  as possible.  Mr. President,  the Department of  Defense is one of this Nation's largest  In a  530,000  producers of toxic waste, yet its record  at meeting State and Federal environ mental protection laws is deplorable.  This fact has become quite obvious to  citizens in Maine, where each of the  defense installations in the State has  been  found  to  be  in  violation  of  Maine's waste disposal  laws,  to  the  detriment of the health and safety of  nearby residents. In fact, one site in  northern Maine,  the result bf  inad equate dumping  techniques, has  re cently been cleaned up with the help  of Superfund money, and another is  on  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency's list of  this Nation's worst  known hazardous waste sites. I suspect  that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  A recent report by the General Ac counting Office indicated that the De fense  Department  generated  over  tons of hazardous waste  in  1984, but  its  information collection  system is so faulty that it does not  know how many installations might be  in violation of the law.  The  Defense  Department  itself  admits  that the problem of defense  waste is a large one which demands at tention.  report  to  the Depart ment's inspector general, it was found  that:  First, hazardous waste programs are  fragmented and ineffective.  Second,  there are  inadequate haz ardous waste storage facilities at most  military bases.  Third, DOD's management of haz ardous waste storage is unsatisfactory.  Fourth, cleanup costs are escalating  more  rapidly  than money  is made  available to meet them.  Without adequate storage facilities,  the DOD tends to look for the easy  way out, finding ""hidden"" dump sites  or storing the waste inadequately for  a~ indefinite period of  time.  It is,  therefore, essential that funds for the  construction of storage facilities not  be reduced just at the moment that  DOD has begun to recognize  its re sponsibility  to act according  to  the  law.  The  administration  requested  $21.4 million  for  such construction,  and our amendment will ensure that  this amount is authorized by adding $5  million to the committee's authoriza tion level.  The bulk of the funds in our amend ment, $15.3 million, is earmarked for  the Department's environmental res toration account, which pays for the  cleanup of military hazardous waste  funds. A portion of this account will  also go toward hazardous waste reduc tion, recycling and reuse efforts. The  administration  request  for  this  ac count was $385.9 million, but the bill  before us reduces that request by $15.3  million, leaving the program with $8.5  million less than last year.  It is quite clear to me that this is an  extremely serious issue which deserves  our immediate attention. In light of  our recent hard work on the issue of  safe civilian hazardous waste disposal  and cleanup, I think that to cut these  defense waste cleanup accounts at this  time will leave a gaping hole in our  effort to ensure a clean environment  for ourselves and our children.  I urge the passage of this amend ment.  ",1986
280,Senate,99,0.261,218,14,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I think  this is a very important amendment  and I hope it will be agreed to.  Protecting the public's health and  safety is one of the primary functions  of Government. Our children's future  is too valuable to allow any delay in  facing up to nuclear waste problems.  Delaying action will only cause more  extreme and difficult problems later.  The Federal Government should not  be excused from its responsibility. In stead we should be setting an example  for the rest of the country. I support  this amendment which deals with the  serious problem of nuclear waste gen erated  by military  facilities.  This  amendment will restore $15.3 million  for the Department of Defense's Envi ronmental Restoration Fund. It will  also provide $5.0 million for construc tion of waste storage facilities. Unfor tunately, much of the waste disposed  of at military  installations has been  done in ways which create health and  environmental hazards.  Our Nation needs  to move ahead  with all due speed on this challenge.  By taking this action we help to pro tect our Nation's natural heritage and  the health of generations to come.  ",1986

282,,99,-0.321,283,14,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, Fidel Cas tro's atrocities often go unnoticed. Here is an  illustration that should rate Mr. Castro along side Mr. Pinochet and Botha as one of the top  despots.  CASTRO, FAIR GAME  <By StephenS. Rosenfeld>  Each year on July 26, Fidel Castro cele brates the anniversary of the launching of  his revolution in Cuba. This year the festivi ties can be seen in a different light. The  price paid by Cuba's legions of political pris oners, who have made Castro the leading  jailer in the world, is finally becoming clear.  The  person most  responsible  for  this  change  is  Armando  Valladares,  whose  memoir of his 22 years as Castro's prisoner  came out here in May, following publication  in Europe. ""Against All Hope"" is a book and  a  political  event. For Valladares  is  the  Cuban Solzhenitsyn, another writer whose  report from a revolution's heart of darkness  burst through the haze of propaganda, inat tention and state debate and brought the  West's consciousness to a new place.  As happens, ""Against All Hope"" has pro voked reviews extending beyond the book  into the political culture. Many ask how the  phenomenon of  innocents held  in bestial  prisons could have existed into the third  decade of Cuban communism, yet only now  does the general political community start  to see it truly.  And only now does the mass of Cubans  become concretely aware of the unjust inEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  carceration and inhuman torture of their  fellow citizens, thanks to the 10 programs  based on the book broadcast to Cuba earlier  this year by  the American government's  Radio Marti.  The American right,  to account for the  broader public's ignorance of Cuban prisons,  pounces on what it sees as the propensity of  American liberals to view Castro  through  rose-colored glasses-for considerations of  sympathy,  ""peace,"" guilt,  radical chic or  whatever.  The left, which is embarrassed but per haps not as much as it ought to be, cites cir cumstances. For  instance,  it is suggested  apologetically  that when  the American  human rights movement got up steam in  the 1970s, its necessary priority was the im mediate and gory outrages of right-wing re gimes. Others suggest that the few releases  of prisoners Castro has recently made, and  the current possibilities of negotiating the  emigration of other Cuban prisoners, finally  sensitized our public to the issue.  It is evident that Ronald Reagan has pre sided over changes in the political atmos phere  that  have  finally made Castro's  crimes both fair and necessary game-and  not only  for Americans  concerned with  human rights but perhaps increasingly for  Latins, whom Castro is otherwise so ready  to instruct in anti-Yankee ways. But there is  another consideration, one that goes to the  peculiar relationship between politics and  literature.  I had lunch with Armando Valladares in  1982 a few weeks after Castro released him  in response to an appeal by French Presi dent Francois Mitterand. Valladares had  written prison poems; the French are good  about appealing for poets. Valladares was  thin and gaunt, a man of sad eyes and halt ing speech, quiet and rather calm, strangely  dispassionate: a victim of a terrible system,  but-how unfair it is to say this about him not a compelling figure or one with what  seemed to me a compelling story.  recall  thinking he was still sick and tired and in a  strange place;  translation added another  veil.  Only his book made plain that here was  one of the enduring works of prison litera ture, the century's distinguishing genre: a  record of state violence and individual re sistance, authentically told, inspiring, unfor gettable. Television may be the medium of  contemporary politics, but literature con veys the dimension of individual character.  The  one  creates  celebrities,  the  other  heroes, like Armando Valladares.  Some in the West still regard Castro as  the fun dictator, bask in the glow of six hour talks with him, consider him someone  we all need to understand better. Valladares  seems to me to understand him perfectly,  and closes his book with a lie Castro told in  1983, while Valladares was rotting: ""From  our point of view, we have no human-rights  problem-there have been no 'disappeareds'  here,  there have been no  tortures here,  there have been no murders here. In 25  years of revolution, in site of the difficulties  and dangers we have passed through, tor ture has never been committed, a crime has  never been committed.""  I  19615  EMERGENCY DROUGHT RELIEF  BILL  HON. BUTLER DERRICK  OF SOUTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 5, 1986  ",1986
283,,99,-0.215,283,14,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, tomorrow  the  House of Representatives will vote on  the  emergency drought relief  legislation. I rise  in  strong support of H.R. 5288, and would like to  take this opportunity to commend the chair man of the Agriculture Committee as well as  the other committee members for  their fine  leadership in bringing this measure to the floor  in such an expeditious manner. I would also  like  to express my appreciation to Chairman  DE LA GARZA for allowing me to have input  into  the  recommendations  reported by  the  committee.  The Southeast  is  experiencing  its worst  drought  in 1 00 years. Rainfall  in my home  State of South Carolina  is  some 15  to 20  inches below normal  since  the first of  the  year. Compounding this situation are the rec ordbreaking temperatures.  These conditions are expected  to cause  $200 million  in crop losses in South Carolina  alone. Our cattle and dairy  producers are  facing a very critical time. Pastures have dried  up, feed is scarce, and the livestock is starv ing. As a result, the State's livestock markets  are being flooded with cattle as farmers take  to slaugther those animals they can no longer  feed.  The Southeast is  truly suffering, and  it  is  heartwarming to note the voluntary assistance  that  is being offered. Over  the  last several  weeks, our farmers have seen and felt  the  generosity of others all  across  the country  through donations of hay, money, and man power. Governors, State agriculture depart ments, and transportation companies have all  joined together in the relief effort. This help is  greatly appreciated.  Just last week the Secretary of Agriculture  declared  that all but  two counties  in South  Carolina have sustained sufficient  losses  to  warrant a disaster designation,  triggering  the  general disaster relief laws. While low-interest  FmHA loans will help, the fact of the matter is  many of our farmers are in such dire straits  that they just can't afford to take on any more  debt. The Secretary has also announced that  USDA will  take some additional steps to aid  the drought-stricken farmers, but it is my firm  belief that we can do more.  H.R. 5288 will expand on existing authorities  to meet the needs of our farmers. The bill will  provide for an emergency livestock and poul try  feed program, disaster payments and a  delay  in payments of  the dairy assessment  program. This measure will go a  long way in  addressing  this desperate situation.  In addi tion, it will insure that we have in place emer gency steps should other areas be hit by simi lar drought conditions or by floods.  I wish to stress to my colleagues the seri ousness of  this matter  in my  region of  the  country. H.R. 5288 is vital to the livelihood of  all of our Nation's farmers, and I urge my col leagues to join me in  the bipartisan adoption  of this legislation.  ",1986
284,House,99,-0.336,309,14,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker,  last  evening NBC nightly news carried a  special report on medical insurance for  the elderly. It found that the Ameri can elderly are not getting the kind of  insurance they need. Indeed, they are  paying dearly for the wrong coverage.  Last week the Department of Health  and Human Services said total spend ing  for health care  in  the United  States  rose  8.9  percent-S  percent  higher  than  the overall Consumer  Price  Index of 3.9 percent. Benefit  payments under  the Medicare Pro gram increased even faster than over all health spending-12.2 percent..  By 1984, health spending not paid by  Medicare again equaled 15 percent of  the  average  old  person's  income almost equal to the share by the elder ly prior to the enactment of the MecU care Program.  For all too many Medicare benefici aries, the cost of an acute and serious  illness has once again become cata strophic.  Mr. Speaker, last week I introduced  legislation to expand Medicare by of fering its beneficiaries two additional  supplementary medical insurance op tions. The bill is primarily designed to  protect the elderly from  rising cost  requirements  that have  in creased rapidly over the past decade.  The proposal will reduce out-of-pocket  costs  for  the elderly and eliminate  much of the confusion for both con sumers and providers. And it will not  result in any additional costs to the  Federal Government.  The time has come for Congress to  address this problem and restore the  health benefits  they were promised  under Medicare.  sharing  THE  SUPPORT A DELAY IN THE PRO DUCTION  OF  BIGEYE  BOMB  <Mr. PORTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)

285,House,99,-0.4,309,14,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, the No.1  or No. 2 killer of women is still breast  cancer. One out of 7 to 10 women in  this country will acquire breast cancer  this year. I have introduced legislation  in Medicare to deal with prevention.  We do not have cancer screening, let  alone free physicals as part of  the  Medicare Program. I want to join my  colleague, Mr. BoNKER,  in addressing  this problem.  This week we have a unique oppor tunity in Washington to bring atten tion to the situation. The Benjamin  Franklin IJterary and Medical Society  will sponsor a mammobile which will  provide free breast cancer screening  by mammography for women over 35  years of age.  0 1020  This mobile unit will be parked at  the Senate  trolley car stop at  the  north end of the Capitol Plaza all this  week from 8:30  to 5:30 and at  the  House trolley car stop at the south  end of the Capitol Plaza during the  week of August 11 from 8:30 to 5:30.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all women who  work on the Capitol grounds and all  women who are visiting Washington to  take advantage of this mammography.  We need to know that it is free, it is a  simple  treatment, and  it can detect  cancer at its earliest stages and save  your lives.

286,House,99,-0.385,322,14,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  BlAGG I].  Mr. BlAGG!. I thank the gentleman  for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I would first like to  thank the ranking minority member,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. GooDLING]  for his kind remarks  with relatio:::l to this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, as author of H.R.  3263,  the Gifted and Talented Chil dren and Youth Education Act, I rise  today in strong support of this impor tant education legislation.  I  am pleased  to note  that  I  am  joined in this effort by 89 of my col leagues on a strong, bipartisan basis.  They have joined me in this effort for  they beleive, as I strongly do, that the  Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that the best and bright est of our Nation's students are ade quately, effetively, and more specifi cally  served  by  our  educational  system.  This legislation will  target Federal  assistance to support State and local  programs that address the unique and  pressing needs of gifted and talented  children and youth. It is certainly leg islation that is long overdue.  A report issued in 1983, ""a Nation at  Risk,"" by the National Commission on  Excellence in Education, noted, ""over  half the population of gifted students  do not match their tested ability with  comparable  achievement  in  school""  and ""both the number and proportion  of  students  demonstrating  superior  achievement in the scholastic aptitude  test have also dramatically declined.""  One clear recommendation emerged:  ""The Federal Government in coopera tion with States and localities, should  help meet the needs of key groups of  students such as the grifed and talent ed.""  Until 1981, the Federal Government  provided for gifted and talented pro grams under the Gifted and Talented  Children's Education Act, authorized  by my distinguished former colleague  from New York, Senator Jacob Javits.  Until its demise, this program annual ly provided $6 million for these educa tional efforts. Today, programs for the  gifted and talented can be operated by  States through the chapter 2 educa tion block grant, funding this and 29  other programs, But it is clear that  under this funding method, gifted and  talented  programming  is  suffering  from acute educational neglect.  Consider for example, that only 13  percent of the school districts current ly receiving funds under chapter 2 al locate any money at all for gifted edu cation.  Consider that 36 States require no  certification or special coursework of  any kind for teachers of gifted and tal ented children.  Consider that there are only 56 full time gifted and  talented consultants  employed by State education agencies  across the entire Nation; 56 people to  serve 2.5 million of this Nation's most  promising students.  And consider that at this time, we  spend only $5 per child  in Federal  funds to support the best and bright est of our Nation's students. In addi tion, we are unable to serve 1% million  of these students who have been iden tified as gifted, but receive no special  education at all.  We must provide a national program  to specifically serve  these particular  students in need. If there is to be a  reasonable response to promote qual ity in the classroom, we must adopt  H.R. 3263.  This  legislation will authorize $10  million in fiscal year 1987, and such  ",1986
287,House,99,0.253,361,14,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in strong support of H.R. 3129,  the Sur face Transportation and Uniform Relocation  Assistance Act of 1986. Passage of the bill  will provide  for a 5-year continuation of  the  Nation's highway and transit programs.  The bill, as reported out of committee, will  provide Arkansas over $100.4 million in fiscal  year  1987  for  highway  formula  programs  which include the interstate resurfacing, resto ration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction  [4R],  primary,  secondary,  urban,  bridge,  hazard  elimination, and railroad highway crossing pro grams. The State would also get $28.8 million  under the minimum allocation program, which  provides States with at least 85 percent of the  amounts they contribute to the highway trust  fund.  This means that Arkansas would receive a  total of about $129.2 million under the basic  Federal-Aid Program, exclusive of demonstra tion projects and any discretionary grants the  State may receive. Funding  in each of fiscal  years 1988-91 would be roughly the same.  The bill  contains a provision, authorizing  $45 million over the next 5 years to accelerate  construction of Highway 71  as a  four-lane  highway, with another $45 million provided for  U.S.  71  in Missouri. About one-half of  the  funding for the Arkansas portion would go for  design and preliminary right-of-way acquisition,  while the other half would go for construction.  The State would receive $5 million for the  project in fiscal year 1987; $5 million in fiscal  year 1988; $10 million in fiscal year 1989; $10  million in fiscal year 1990; and $15 million in  1991. The $45 million total is over and above  what Arkansas  received under  the  formula  and minimum allocation programs.  Another provision would allow Arkansas to  use interstate construction funds for planning,  design, and construction of Highway 71. Al though the State's interstate segment is com plete and normally  interstate  funds must be  used for 4-R work, the bill gives Arkansas the  option of using its interstate funds for Highway  71.  Also provided  in  the bill  is $8.5 million  in  fiscal year 1987 for a highway demonstration  project at Fort Smith, which involves widening  a segment of the highway connecting Westark  Community College and the New Central Mall  and improving signalization on the segment.  The bill approves $13.3 million funding for  construction of four grade separations on a  four-lane bypass route at Jonesboro to dem onstrate methods of improving highway safety.  The project would receive $2.5 million in fiscal  year 1987; $3.2 million  in  fiscal year 1989;  $2.6 million in fiscal year 1990; and $3.2 mil lion in fiscal year 1991.  It should be noted that all of these funds  come out of the highway trust fund and there fore do not add to the Federal deficit.  The legislation also directs the Secretary of  Transportation, in cooperation with Louisiana,  Arkansas, and Missouri, to study the feasibility  of constructing a highway  from Shreveport,  LA, to Texarkana. Fort Smith, and Fayetteville,  AR, and Carthage and Kansas City, MO. A  report on the study's results is to be submitted  to Congress within a year after the bill's en actment.  Arkansas would also be given  the option,  under the bill's provision, to utilize part of its  bridge replacement  funds  to replace existing  ferryboat service with a highway bridge, and  the Federal share for the cost of that replace ment would be 80 percent.

288,House,99,0.478,361,14,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr. Chairman,  any of us who has had occasion to use Wash ington's Dulles Airport in the 2 years since the  Dulles access  road was completed, knows  that the most modern airport is of little use  unless passengers can reach it easily. Before  Dulles had a fast, direct access road,  it was  an empty barn virtually ignored by most major  airlines and passengers. Since  then,  it has  quickly become the air travel hub it was first  envisioned to be two decades ago.  As quickly as Dulles is expected to grow, it  will not even come close to the explosion in  passengers which will be experienced by On tario  International Airport near Los Angeles.  The airport is expected to grow from a current  3 million passengers per year to 11 million by  the year 2000. To accommodate this increase,  Ontario  is undergoing a $300 million  facelift  which will give it the capacity to handle double  that number.  Unfortunately, Ontario faces the same prob lem which once plagued Dulles: space age  airport  facilities  coupled  with  stone  age  access. We are  fortunate  that  the  land sur rounding the airport is still relatively inexpen sive; it will not always be so. That is why the  $4 million contained in this bill is so crucial. If  we do not begin  to solve Ontario's access  problem, we will soon be talking about sums  far in excess of the current cost estimate.  Despite having  the second  largest popula tion and  the greatest surface area of any  major metropolitan area, Los Angeles  is still  basically served by one major airport, Los An geles  International. Meanwhile,  those who  travel  to New York have a choice of  three  major airports, as do travelers to the Nation's  Capital. Ontario International will soon be able  to provide  the much needed alternative  for  those who  fly  to Los Angeles, but only  if  ground access is  improved. This provision  in  this bill  is  the  first  step  in  this  important  project, and  I am delighted to see it moving  ahead.  0 1645  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. STENHOLM  ",1986

These are two giants from Iowa that  are  leaving us, and I have had  the  privilege to serve with these two gen tlemen on the House Agriculture Com mittee,  and  I  believe  that CooPER  EVANS and BERKLEY BEDELL have not  just served farmers and their respec tive districts, but I  feel that CooPER  and BERKLEY  have  served  farmers  throughout the State of Iowa.  COOPER EVANS and BERKLEY BEDELL  frankly have served production agri culture in America and across Amer ica, because of the giants they are.  Now,  the time that I have had to  spend with these two gentlemen has  been brief; it has just been one term.

There is a card that I  think every  one of us has either looked at in the  Hallmark shops; we have purchased it,  we have given it or we have received it.  It starts out to a man or to a lady and  one opens the card and on the inside it  says, ""who is out standing in his field""  and it has this lonely person in this  wide field of oats or hay or whatever  the case may be.  You think of the sprawling fields of  Iowa. You  think of  these  two men.  You quickly think of these two men,  you quickly  think of  two gentlemen  who are  truly outstanding  in  their  many fields; in the fields of Iowa and  in the fields of government.  I have had the unique opportunity,  like so many of those who preceded  me, to work with these gentlemen on a  very close professional basis.  I came to the Congress with CooPER  EVANS and had the opportunity to sit  next to him in the House Agriculture  Committee. So unlike anyone who has  spoken  thus  far,  I have been  right  there;  through  the  1981  farm  bill,  through the 1985 farm bill,  through  all of the legislation in between, to sit  and  listen  to CooPER and his anec dotes, his insights, his perspectives, his  mountains of amendments.  The chairman of the Ag Committee  would want to know how long it was  going to take to finish a bill, and the  first  thing you would do  is  look at  CooPER EvANs to figure out how many  amendments he had today, and that  would probably give him the signal of  exactly what was going to occur.  CooPER, I think, will be remembered,  as my  distinguished  colleague Mr.  RoBERTS said, for probably his legisla tive expertise, and the guy who says it  does not matter who gets the credit as  long as we do it correctly. He was the  guy who, time and time again, would  tell us how we could implement what  we wanted to do.  In particular, I think we are going to  look at him in the area of the agricul ture budget, because he loved to serve  on that budget task force of the House  Agriculture Committee, and go over  the minute details of those numbers  and make recommendations.  Then I think we are going to remem ber him for his absolute commitment  to conservation, which was such an  overriding  concern with  him,  that  many have mentioned before, and I  think is indicative of his long insight  into where we want to go as a society.  Third, I  think we are going to re member him  in  the area of Farm  Credit Administration, for his exper tise in financial matters for that legis lation and what was involved in it; and  Fourth, I think we are going to re member him not only for those three  areas, but we are going to remember  him for the commodity futures legislation; something which is very compli cated and has only probably three or  four people in the entire House who  can be considered experts on  that.  CooPER is one of them.  CooPER was able to, constantly back  in 1981 and again this year when we  reauthorized the futures trading legis lation, to provide the kind of expertise  and insight our committee needed.  CooPER also  is very special  in the  fact that for me, unlike the rest of  you, he has family as his constituents.  My sister and brother-in-law and their  family happen to be constituents of  COOPER.  I think they put it best. It was my  sister who said, ""You know, CooPER  grows on you. You get to know him  initially and you  say he's a  rather  quiet,  reserved man. The next  time  you  talk  to him you  realize  there's  some depth there and as you talk to  him, your appreciation, your respect  and your good will  to this guy only  continues to grow and grow.""  That  is  really what CooPER  about.  He has been there, he has been out standing, he has been credible to each  and every one of us, and I am going to  miss that guy just to the left of me on  the Ag Committee; I am going to miss  his expertise; I am going to miss his  counsel.  is all  0 2235  The other gentleman  that we are  saying ""thank you"" to and ""good-bye""  to today is everybody's friend, BERK LEY BEDELL. BERKLEY, if he has any en emies, I do not know who they are. He  may have some opponents but I do not  think he ever had an enemy.  PAT ROBERTS suggested, and I think  ""ToM"" TAUKE suggested as well, that  we know BERKLEY for his efforts first  and  foremost  in  the plight of  the  farmer. Whether you agree or disagree  with BERKLEY's commitment as to how  you are going to raise that money, this  guy and I wish the rest of you, and I  wish every farmer in this country had  been  in  that Agriculture Committee  not just in 1981 but since then, last  year as we fought and agonized over  the 1985 farm bill, to watch the abso lute total commitment of mind, body,  and soul to the plight of the American  farmer which BERKLEY  BEDELL  ex pressed and articulated so eloquently.  Somehow or another the farmers of  this country would feel a lot better of  what this Government was trying to  do if they knew and realized the com mitment  that  people  like BERKLEY  bring to that.  Second,  though,  I,  too,  remember  BERKLEY not only for his work on the  Agriculture Committee because we all  have districts with particular parochi al needs and we try to represent those  to  the best of our ability. BERKLEY  went well above and beyond his com",1986

308,,99,0.372,556,14,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, every now and  then we come across a magazine article that  eloquently and memorably  illuminates some  important aspects of our lives. In a recent arti cle in Newsweek, Vickie L. Sleiman, who hap pens  to work  for  the House of Representa tives Select Committee  Narcotics  and  Abuse and Control, has reminded us all of the  link between the hard work of parents and rel atives and a college student's ability to pursue  his or her studies. Ms. Sleiman with her calcu lations of how many hamburgers have to be  flipped and how many lube jobs have to be  done  in garages  to pay  for college  tuitions,  has done a really great job. As a father who  has sent four of his children  through college  and as a son who has benefited from the hard  work of his father and the rest of his family, I  deeply appreciate Ms. Sleiman's  tribute  to  those who work so others might learn.  At  this  point  I wish  to  include  in  the  RECORD,  ""A Salute  to  'Burger Flippers'"" by  Vickie L. Sleiman, Newsweek, June 30, 1986.  A SALUTE TO ""BURGER FLIPPERS""  <By Vickie L. Sleiman>  Last month I was awarded the honor of  being escorted to the first row of seats at  my university's graduation exercises. I  lis tended to the guest speaker talk about our  responsibility as citizens of the world, and I  listened, too, as our valedictorian informed  the class of '86 that it was better to be here  than out ""flipping burgers."" The ceremony  finally ended,  I  returned my  rented cap,  hood and gown;  then, when I was back in  my parent's house, I began to calculate the  number of burgers that had been ""flipped""  by my family so that I could attain the title  of ""doctor of philosophy."" After hours of  working with means and medians, my calcu lator  indicated  the  total was nearing  the  number  illuminated beneath  the Golden  Arches.  For example, at $3.35 an hour, it took my  mother almost 10 hours of flipping burgers  to buy ""Moral Development and Socializa tion"" <$31.43, plus 6 percent sales  tax), a  textbook she purchased to help me study  for my Ph.D, qualifying exams in education.  Simply stated, Mom flipped 2,984 burgers  working the grill in a bustling coffee shop to  buy me this one book <5 burgers per minute  x 10 hours= 3,000 burgers).  I then estimated that if she had paid for  only  three books a  semester for  the last  seven years, at an average cost of $25 per  book. she would have flipped over 94,030  burgers. However,  by  also  counting  the  money she gave me to ""put towards"" my car  insurance, school supplies, registration fees  and dissertation expenses, I know she had  to turn an additional 250,746 patties. Thus,  my mother's total contribution during those  seven years was 344,776 rare, medium and  well burgers.  The larger these numbers grew, the better  I understood the cause of the chronic bursi tis  in her right shoulder and elbow  hashslinging has its own rewards. As  the  hours passed, I became entranced by the  magnitude of the numbers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  My fingers danced across my calculator as  I computed how many burgers were flipped  by Aunt Micky so she could present me with  a graduation bouquet <2,100>; by my godpar ents and Aunt Marlene so they could buy  me  the gold bracelet I promised to wear  when I accepted my diploma <13,500>.  GRADUATION CEREMONY  I had entered a  state of mathematical  frenzy.  It ""cost"" my  brother-in-law  900  burger flips for a  tank of gas so he could  drive from his job at a McDonald's in Los  Angeles to my graduation ceremony in San  Diego, and a total of 1,800 burgers for the  graduation cards cousins, uncles and aunts  had sent to me.  As graduation day turned into graduation  night, I calculated the number of lube jobs  and oil changes my dad, a mechanic, per formed at his job at Sears so he could help  pay for my lunch tickets at the university  cafeteria.  I added  to that the number of  buckets I  filled with wings,  legs and side  breasts at Kentucky Fried Chicken,  the  number of dog kennels I scraped and the  number of fish fillets I dunked in vats of oil  at Mr. Fish and Chips-all to pay the per sonal and educational expenses that student  loans, fellowships and scholarships did not  cover.  The following morning I inserted new bat teries  into my  calculator,  paused  for  a  moment and thanked God for the privilege  of having so many burgers flippers in my  family-an honor the valedictorian at my  university did not have. For if she had, she  would have expressed her graditude to each  and evey one of them sitting in that stadi um on graduation day;  she would have  thanked them for the moral and financial  support that allowed so many of us to be in cluded in the class of '86.  INSENSITIVE AND FLIPPANT  Now, as the self-proclaimed president of  the Children of Burger Flippers of America,  I say ""thank you"" to all the parents, broth ers, sisters husbands and wives who stood  over smoky grills and hot ovens. Through  your labor we gained insight into the rigors  of life on a minimum wage, we learned the  value of a dollar and, given your support, we  are now able to make more money in one  year than you were able to make in five.  I hope other college students will become  honorary members of my  club.  If they  would  take  time and  look up  from  their  books, they might learn that their position  of privilege is sustained, in part, by burger  slingers-taxpayers who help support  the  nation's public-university  system. Future  valedictorians would then salute the contri butions of the blue-collar employee instead  of making insensitive and flippant remarks.  In the end, though, the flippers may have  the last laugh. Theirs  is  the face of  the  future,  according  to  some  labor-market  studies. If 1 out of every 3 meals consumed  by Americans will  be  eaten  away  from  home, as projected for the next 10 years,  then flipping burgers may become a source  of employment for those college graduates  unable to secure a ""professional"" position.  But do not fret, dear students. As Ralph  Waldo Emerson once wrote: ""The differ ences between men in natural endowment  are insignificant in comparison with their  common wealth. Do you think the porter  and the cook have no anecdotes, no experi ences,  no wonders  for  you?  Everybody  knows as much as the savant.""  As the proud daughter of a flipper, I know  how to say thank you. To everyone in my  family who ever swung a spatula so that I  August 7, 1986  could ""succeed,"" your generosity made my  graduation so much sweeter and so much  more appreciated.  A TRIBUTE TO AMERICA AND  THE STATUE OF LIBERTY  HON.BERNARDJ.D~  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, August 7, 1986  ",1986
309,,99,-0.373,556,14,Mr. DWYER of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to share with my colleagues the el oquent  thoughts of one of my constituents  from Ed1son, NJ, Mr. Louis Fuzak, Sr. Mr.  Fuzak,  the son of an  immigrant couple, who  was so inspired by the Liberty Weekend Cele brations that he has written two very moving  and touching essays on America,  the Statue  of Liberty, and what being an American citizen  means to him.  AMERICA  As I watched television this week I was  very thrilled to be an American. I was born  in the twenties to a hardworking immigrant  couple, as were my buddies and friends with  whom I grew up with in the streets. World  War II broke and all of us joined the differ ent branches of the service. It was time for  our generation to stand up and keep the  torch lit-it was passed down to us from the  previous generation. As I listened to some of  the comments made about the next genera tion I said ""Thank God we have them to  pass the torch on to!"" If we all walk with  God and keep His truth alive we will always  be able to celebrate tributes to our Lady. In  our generation  there were  all  kinds  of  ethnic backgrounds  and  colors;  it never  bothered us. In all, I  think we did a good  job-as long as we never took our freedom  for granted. It is not easy to come by.  I  know for I miss some of my friends who  gave their lives for our country. For them I  say ""Keep the Peace."" If you are forced to you must fight to protect our country and  our lady, the symbol of our freedom. Free dom never comes cheap. Every generation  paid the price, heavily at times. So when  your time comes do not be afraid. Stand up  and be counted-but make sure that God is  along side you.  God Bless America!  The  sun  always  brightens the way after the darkness.  The  immigrants  gave  of  themselves sweat and many tears shed for their boys,  who are buried on plots in the South Pacific  and Europe. Their white crosses mark the  landscape of the earth where they now rest  in peace. They were sent  to protect our  safety and gave their lives for our freedom.  The ultimate sacrifice that protects our lib erty and freedom.-Louis Fuzak, Sr.  THE LADY  What a wonderful party! What stands out  most in my mind:  The children-the future guardians of the  Lady.  The young black boy who sang the Na tional Anthem.  The young Vietnamese girl who recited  what freedom and liberty and becoming an  American meant to her and her family.  The young ones who took up collections of  pennies, nickels and dimes.  The young boy who collected thousands  of dollars.  ",1986

311,House,99,0.314,569,14,Mr. KASICH.," Mr. Chairman, let me  just say very quickly that there are  two methods  that are used  in  the  Aspin-Spratt amendment to try to get  down to the budget authority /budget  outlay numbers.  We have  two additional ones; one  that delays progress payments; those  are payments that we make  to con tractors, and second, we prohibit the  early delivery of systems so that we do  not have to pay money out up front.  What does that allow us to do? Well,  when we combine  the  two methods  that the Aspin-Spratt amendment uses  along with our two methods, we are  able to hit $292 in authority and $279  in outlays.  0 1115  Let me tell you, last year we had a 6percent reduction in budget authority.  Last year's budget represented a nega tive  6-percent  growth. The Spratt Aspin amendment will give us another  additional 4-percent negative growth.  And those people who have been the  most critical and the most analytical  about what we ought to do within the  Department  of  Defense,  including  former members of  this administra tion who  have  come  forward with  plans  to cut defense spending, have  told us that if we consistently move to  reduce the outlay figures or to reduce  the authority figures for defense, we  are going to roll back all the gains we  made for the last 4 or 5 years.  So what do we do in our budget? We  simply  take  the  two methods  that  Aspin-Spratt  take, we add  to  them.  One is prohibit early delivery. We do  not need  to  take early delivery on  these  systems  because we  end  up  having to have storage space problems  and everything else until the systems  can be  joined  together and we also  delay  the payment  for  10  days of  progress  payments  to  contractors.  Contractors have been getting 90 per cent  progress  payments  for  longer  than what they needed. It is now down  to 80 percent. We do not reduce  it  below 80. \Ve just simply say we delay  the payments for 10 days and are able  to meet $292 in budget authority and  $279 in outlays. So it gets us right on  our target and also assures that we  ",1986
312,,99,-0.4,582,14,Mr. FASCELL.," I  man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  last February,  the House of  Representatives passed, by an overwhelming  bipartisan vote of 268-148, House Joint Reso lution 3, legislation urging the President to re quest  the  ratification of  two nuclear  testing  limitation  treaties signed  in  the 1970's and  urging the President to propose to the Soviet  Union  the  resumption of negotiations on a  comprehensive  test ban  treaty. The other  body just yesterday passed House Joint Reso lution 3 as an amendment to the fiscal year  1987 Defense authorization bill by a vote of  64 to 35.  .  In passing  this  legislation,  the House and  Senate have sent a very clear message. A bi partisan majority in Congress firmly supports  an end to the arms race fueled by the unlimit ed continuation of nuclear testing. By continu ing to add new nuclear weapons to our arse nals, both  the United States and  the Soviet  Union cancel out the effectiveness any reduc tions might make in their nuclear arsenals. We  are saying what every President since Eisen hower has been saying: We must put an end  to this escalation through a mutual, vertifiable,  and comprehensive test ban.  As a follow-on to House Joint Resolution 3,  this amendment calls  for continued action  toward  that arms  control  policy objective.  Under  this amendment, effective January 1,  1987, we would engage  in a moratorium on  nuclear testing above a certain level-1 kilo ton-unless the President certifies to the Con gress that the Soviets have tested above this  level.  If the Soviets choose to resume their test ing, funds are immediately released for the re sumption  of  United  States  testing.  This  amendment reflects a grave concern on  the  part of  the American people and  the world  community that something desperately needs  to be done to stop the proliferation of nuclear  weapons and the nuclear arms race between  the superpowers. One way to begin this proc ess  is  for the United States and  the Soviet  Union to limit tests of their high yield nuclear  weapons.  For almost a year now,  the Soviets have  not tested. They are sending us a ""message.""  Some view  this as a propaganda move on  their part I say we should question their seri ousness by calling their bluff. Let's send them  a signal that we are serious. By continuing to  test, as we have since the Soviet moratorium,  we send the wrong message. In my judgment,  there is very little time to reach an agreement  with the Soviets in this area. Mr. Gorbachev is  being  pushed  just  as  hard  as President  Reagan is being pushed by certain elements  in  their defense establishments who oppose  any  agreement  at  all  in  this  area.  The  ""window of opportunity"" is closing fast. Let's  see if the Soviets will negotiate a genuine and  effective nuclear test ban.  The Soviets have pledged  to accept en hanced verification arrangements in the nucle ar testing area.  In fact, as part of an agree ment with  the Natural Resources Defense  Council,  a private organization,  the Soviet  Union has accepted and has  in place  right  now equipment onsite to monitor nuclear tests  and earthquakes. This could be expanded to  incorporate a wider network of monitoring sta tions on  their  territory which would provide  even greater monitoring confidence. At issue  is not the technical ability to monitor testing,  but the political will  to reach an agreement.  The onus should be on the Soviet Union not  the United States to deliver.  What this amendment does is to call for a  moratorium on testing above 1 kiloton as long  as the Soviet Union doesn't conduct such a  test. If they test, we are free to test.  We have much to gain and nothing to lose  by limiting the addition of new nuclear weap ons into the Soviet arsenal.  I urge my colleagues to support this reason able and effective arms control amendment.  ",1986
313,House,99,-0.058,595,14,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Chairman, Dr. Richard  Perle, Assistant Secretary  of Defense  for  PU  tions because  JOHN C. WHITEHEAD,  Acting Secretary.  International Security Policy,  is generally not  known as a master of  the understatement.  However, Dr. Perle  recently commented on  the role of the private United States monitor ing group for Soviet Nuclear tests in which he  dismissed  the group explanations as  ""not  useful"" and expressed a view that we ought  to have a government  to govern arrange ments that provides for adequate verification. I  believe that is a classic understatement.  As  I understand  it,  the scientists from the  National Resources Defense Council, an envi ronmental group which  I believe has quite  suspect nuclear credentials, comprise the test  monitoring team.  It is worth nothing that Dr.  Thomas Cochran, the NRDC team leader, has  spent the past 15 years of his life in an effort  to kill civilian nuclear power  in  the United  States.  It hardly seems  to me good public  policy to have an avowed zealot against the  atom for peaceful purposes be involved in a  critical monitoring function where the govern ment has such tremendous concern.  Dr. Perle went on to point out that the pri vate arrangement with NRDC does not consti tute adequate verification and I must confess  that I am alarmed that this body would seri ously consider having critical monitoring activi ty performed by the National Resources De fense Council. This is why I am supporting Mr.  DICKINSON's amendment. This is why I believe  the Aspin-Gephardt-Schroeder substitute must  be defeated.  We are being asked to have amateurs with  a documented conflict of interest regarding ci vilian nuclear power and a weapons phobia do  the  job of highly skilled professionals who  would have U.S. national security at the fore front of their concerns. I also understand that  Dr. Cochran insists that we send vax comput er systems to the U.S.S.R. and presumably let  Dr. Perle worry about the technology transfer  consequences.  I urge my colleagues to vote  for the Dickinson version and reject the other  amendment which to me represents a terribly  naive approach to nuclear test monitoring and  United States Soviet technology transfer rela tions.

314,House,99,-0.298,595,14,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in  strong support of the amendment now pend ing. August 6  is  the  first anniversary of the  Soviet Union's unilateral ban on the testing of  underground nuclear weapons.  General Secretary Gorbachev announced  last August that the Soviet Union would refrain  from underground  tests until  the end of the  year. His proposal  for a ban on  testing, of fered in the hope that the United States would  soon comply, was extended  to March 31,  1986. When the Soviet ban ended on March  31  without a  favorable United States  re sponse, Gorbachev extended  it again, until  the next United States test explosion, which  occurred on April 9. The Soviet leader then  extended the ban by his nation until August 6,  despite the fact that more than a dozen nucle ar tests were conducted by the United States  during the year long ban.  The Soviets have not yet announced wheth er  they will now renew  testing. The United  States has not only continued a schedule of  nuclear testing, but we have actually acceler ated our program. The Soviets now fear we  will advance even further ahead than we al",1986

316,Senate,99,0.271,816,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I am  introducing legislation today on behalf  of the Tulalip Tribes of Washington  that will first, authorize the tribe to  lease its valuable residential, commer cial, and industrial lands for longer pe riods of time; and second, permit the  tribal leadership to exercise a higher  level of self -determination in the area  of leasing.  The Tulalip Reservation  is  located  30 miles north of Seattle and is adja cent  to a major  interstate highway.  This  is  a  high-growth  area where  prime sites for leasing purposes are at  a premium. The tribe's 22,000-acre res ervation includes the largest tract of  undeveloped lands in the area. Over  the years, the tribe has derived sub stantial  income from residential and  industrial leasing programs. Given the  strategic location of the reservation,  the best use of most of its lands lies in  the area of  residential,  commercial,  and industrial leasing.  Under existing law and policy,  the  Secretary of the Interior must approve  a variety of  leases entered  into be tween Indian tribes and private indi viduals or entities. The Tulalip leader ship has discovered that the existing  authority is  inadequate to accommo date major developmental leases that  require a long period of time for debt  retirement  purposes. Although  the  tribe has been granted authority  to  lease its lands for terms not to exceed  99 years, such leases require Secretari al  approval  for  every  transaction.  Moreover,  the  regulations governing  this authority are overly cumbersome  and contrary to Indian self -determina tion and tribal self-governance.  I am pleased to support the progres sive Tulalip tribal leadership by intro ducing  this  legislation.  Specifically,  my bill amends Public Law 91-274 to  permit the tribe to enter into leases  not to exceed 75 years, with no option  to renew. The tribe, however, would be  required to develop a new regulatory  scheme for the extended leasing au thority. This  legislation will permit  the tribe to pursue its goal of econom ic self-sufficiency.

317,,99,-0.564,855,14,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, after 6 years of  war and over $2 billion in United States aid,  elements of the Salvadoran Government con tinue to kill, kidnap, and abuse citizens of El  Salvador. Though the absolute number of vio lations has declined since the mass killings of  the early 1980's, some 20 to 25 Salvadoran  citizens per month continue to die in targeted  killings  by Government  security  forces  or  death squads  linked with  the Government.  Salvadoran workers and trade unionists have  been particular targets of this repression. The  situation in El Salvador therefore deeply con cerns many trade union members here in the  United States.  I commend to my colleagues' attention the  attached resolution, which was passed on July  14, 1986, by the New York Area Labor Com mittee in Support of Democracy and Human  Rights in El Salvador.  RESOLUTION ON EL SALVADOR  Whereas, the living standards of Salvador an workers has dropped 54 percent in the  last five years, inflation this year is rising at  the rate of 36 percent, and workers have not  seen real wage increases,  Whereas,  the Duarte government, with  U.S. aid, continues  to conduct saturation  bombing in civilian area in El Salvador,  Whereas, Amnesty International has con tinued  to receive  reports of arbitrary ar rests, death squad killings and disappear ances,  Whereas, unions such as ASTTEL <the  Salvadoran  Telecommunications Workers  Union> have faced firings, military occupa tion of their worksites, takeover of their of fices, and the management of ANTEL has  set up a company union, ASTA, and has af filiated it with the Communication Workers  International <PTTI> in an effort to derail  international support,  Whereas, garment, electronics and other  plants continue to be closed down here as  U.S. companies flee  to Latin America and  other areas where they can exploit cheap  labor,  Whereas, the Salvadoran labor movement  has formed a broad labor federation-UNTS  <Unidad Nacional de Trabajadores Salvador enos> and recently organized a demonstra tion of over 80,000 people to call for a settle ment of the civil war through negotiations,  20187  Whereas, under the government of Salva doran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, re pression of trade union rights continues de spite his promises of democratic changes,  Whereas,  a  free,  democratic  society  cannot exist without trade unions and re spect for human rights: Therefore, be it re solved that trade unionists in the United  States:  Continue to oppose U.S. military and eco nomic aid to the Salvadoran government,  Call and write their Congressional repre sentatives urging them to discontinue such  aid,  Send  letters  immediately  to President  Duarte urging him to respect trade union  rights and to pressure the government-run  telecommunications agency <ANTEL> to ne gotiate with the ASTTEL workers, re-hire  the fired workers and respect trade union  rights, and release the sons of union leader  Centno from prison.  Pass  resolutions  ASTTEL workers,  Urge the sending of a Congressional-Labor  delegation  to El Salvador  to  investigate  trade union repression and human rights  abuses,  Call upon PTTI to disaffiliate AST A and  recongize ASTTEL as the legitimate union,  Escalate pressure on the Duarte govern ment for a peaceful, negotiated end to the  war.  support  in  of  the  SUPPORTING ASAT TEST BAN  STILL THE BEST COURSE  HON.LAW1ENCECOUGHUN  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, August 7, 1986  ",1986
318,,99,0.204,855,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, for the last 2  years the House has supported a moratorium  on the testing of antisatellite [Asat] weapons  against targets in space. Last year, after tough  negotiating with  the Senate,  the House-sup ported ban on this testing finally became law.  Since  that  time, a de  facto United States Soviet moratorium on Asat testing has worked  exactly as planned.  It will continue  through  October 1 , 1986-but it must be extended  through 1987 if we want to ensure reaping the  benefrts of this arrangement in the Mure.  All of  the arguments  that persuaded  the  House to support the Asat ban last year and  the year before are just as compelling today.  We continue  to be more dependent on our  military satellites that the Soviets are on their  satellites. The Soviet Asat weapon is a year  older and a year closer to total obsolescence.  Allowing United States  testing of  the F-15  launched MHV Asat will more than ever mean  all bets are off on any future United States Soviet negotiations to end the Asat arms race.  In addition to these compelling reasons to  preserve the Asat test moratorium, there are  several  important new  factors  to consider.  First, we now have no way of launching re placements  for our most important satellites  into orbit. With  the Challenger disaster and  the grounding of our Delta and Titan heavy lift  rockets,  it  is dubious whether we could  re spond effectively to a crisis requiring the de ployment of new military satellites.  It is un clear when any of these key launch systems  will be on-line again.  ",1986

320,Senate,99,-0.314,1076,14,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I have  read with great interest an August 5  article  in  the New York Times by  Todd Purdum and an article printed  this morning in the Washington Post  by William Raspberry on a program in  New York City that has sent a  loud  and clear message to drug traffickers  and users throughout New York City.  This program utilizes the civil and  administrative forfeiture provisions of  a law which I introduced as part of the  Comprehensive Crime Control Act of  1984. In April1980, as chairman of the  Senate  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Criminal Justice. I chaired hearings on  the subject of the Government's efforts to seize and forfeit the assets of  those involved in the drug trade. Since  that time, I have been actively pro moting  the use of  forfeiture  as  a  means of attacking the drug trade, and  I am still convinced that the use of  forefeiture laws remains the most ef fective and the most underutllized law  enforcement tool in the Federal nar cotics control arsenal.  I am encour aged to see that the Department of  Justice is beginning to recognize the  versatility and usefulness of the for feiture provisions enacted in the 1984  crime bill.  Under  the New York  program,  which I might add is less than 2 weeks  old, 43 persons arrested for buying il licit drugs have also had their cars  confiscated. This is permissible under  the provisions of the 1984 crime bill, in  which we sought to make the use of  forfeiture of assets a more viable tool  for law enforcement.  The effectiveness of New York City's  forfeiture policy cannot be overstated.  New York, like so many other cities  who have taken a strong stand against  the drug  trade.  faces a voluminous  court calendar and scarce prison space.  In  these  times of public skepticism  about our criminal justice process, the  value of this program lies in the imme diate message  it  sends  throughout  New York City. As Sterling Johnson.  New York City's special narcotics pros ecutor, has commented: ""Under this  program a $10 vial of crack can cost  upward of $10,000  to $15,ooo:   This  program also sends another message:  The drug trade, both buying and sell ing, will not be tolerated. As William  Raspberry noted:  Drug abusers aren't victims; they are co conspirators  in crime, and its about  time  they were treated as such.  I applaud the efforts of the mayor  and police commissioner of New York  City, the city's district attorney and  special narcotics prosecutor and the  U.S. attorney for Manhattan in this  program, and I hope other cities will  look to this program as an example of  the effectiveness of laws aimed at the  assets of the drug trade.  Mr. President. I ask unanimous con sent that the two articles I mentioned  previously be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the arti cles were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Aug. 5, 19861  NEW YoRK PoLICE Now SEIZING CARS IN  ARREsTS FOR POSSESSION OF CRACK  <By Todd S.

321,Senate,99,0.275,1115,14,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.,"  In that article  Dick Scammon, one of the leading po litical analysts. in the country, points  out  that PAC's are  fulfilling  some  roles  that parties used  to because  PAC's indeed have grown more rapidly  than parties and the party contribu tions are limited. He finds the shift to  the PAC's not to be as threatening as  my friend from Oklahoma believes. He  said. ""The idea that PAC's go out and  buy somebody is pretty far-fetched.""  He said, ""If I ran a PAC, I don't want  to go out and buy a fellow. If I can buy  him, somebody else can.""  It is silly to think that that happens  in the political process.  One additional proposal is to estab lish a bipartisan commission to review  campaign financing and make recom mendations. This is really perhaps the  most important proposal and hopeful ly  this will  survive  in  this whole  debate.  A commission would be formed, not  for the purpose of delaying, stalling or  doing anything else, but just as a rec ognition of  the  fact  that Senators  have a very hard time not only voting  on their own pay, but Senators have a  very difficult time voting constructive ly on campaign financing.

325,Senate,99,-0.319,1219,14,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, the re lationship  between  the  State  of  Hawaii and our Pacific territories and  commonwealth continues  to become  significantly important to these gov ernments and people. Because of Ha waii's close proximity to the islands,  the  unique  similarities  of  Pacific  Island cultures, and Hawaii's experi ences as a  former  territory, coupled  with existing cooperation in such orga nizations as the Pacific Basin Develop ment Council-these Pacific  Islands  governments tend to look to Hawaii as  a ""big brother"" for economic and polit ical cooperation and assistance.  The territories, while having nonvot ing representation in the other body  of Congress, have no representation in  this body and, the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands, Ameri ca's newest  territory, at the present  time  is not represented in the Con gress of the United States. I am there fore, privileged and very pleased  to  today  propose  legislation  for  the  Northern Mariana Islands.  The covenant  to establish a  com monwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands  in political union with  the  United States of America, U.S. Public  Law 94-241, established a Northern  Mariana Islands Commission on Fed eral Laws which  is  instructed  ""to  survey the laws of the United States  and to make recommendations to the  U.S. Congress as to which laws of the  United States not applicable  to  the  Northern Mariana Islands should be  made applicable and to what extent  and in what manner, and which appli cable laws should be made inapplica ble and to what extent and in what  manner.  The  Commission,  in  its  second  interim  report  to Congress,  issued  recommendations  for  changes to U.S Law.  Mr. President, I am pleased  to be  joined by Senators McCLURE,  JoHN STON, and WEICKER to introduce legis lation  to  enact  these  recommenda tions. I hope my colleagues will join us  in supporting this much-needed legis lation, and I ask unanimous consent  that the legislation be printed in the  RECORD.

328,House,99,-0.315,1297,14,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, I was  delighted to join Chairman HAWKINS,  Mr.  JEFFORDS,  Chairman MARTINEZ,  and Mr. GUNDERSON  in  introducing  amendments to the Job Training Part nership Act <H.R. 5185). This biparti san bill represents a consensus of opin ion on the Education and Labor Com mittee and should be adopted by the  House in expeditious fashion.  There are several issues that I would  like to call to the attention of my col leagues as we move from action today  to conference with the Senate: First,  with regard to a compromise on the  hold harmless provision, I would rec ommend that we look at a 2-year base  and at total availability or only pro vide the hold harmless to SDA's with  very limited carry in; and second, with  regard to a compromise on the educa tion component, I would recommend  that we encourage the effort with in centives that do not create a situation  where SDA's spend  less money on  youth.  One issue that this bill did not ad dress is the growth in the number of  service delivery areas  [SDA'sl under  the Job Training Partnership Act re sulting  in  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number of SDA's receiving relatively  small allocations under title IIA. With  limited resources, economies of scale  must somehow achieve a balance with  the wish of the Congress for locally  determined and managed delivery sys tems.  According to a study by Job Train ing Partnership, Inc., in program year  1986, there are now 62 SDA's receiving  allocations of less than $500,000, and  175 SDA's with allocations less than  $1,000,000. This is a marked increase  over the prior year, since in program  year 1985, 35 SDA's received alloca tions below $500,000, and 138 SDA's  received allocations below $1,000,000.  These facts are driven by the follow ing statistics. In fiscal year 1982, there  were 476 prime sponsors under  the  Comprehensive  Employment  and  Training Act  [ CETAl. Through pro gram year 1985 of JTP A,  there were  597 SDA's, while in program year 1986,  there are now 627 SDA's, an increase  of 151 over CETA or a dramatic 32percent increase. To be fair,  this in crease  is  somewhat overstated since  balance-of -state areas counted as one  prime  sponsor  under CET A, while  under JTPA, they were broken up into  SDA's.  The bill includes a provision encour aging the development of a remedial  education component in the Summer  Youth Employment Program [SYEPl.  This bill is a culmination of my efforts  to achieve recognition of this need. In  1985, I  introduced H.R. 1090 to man date  the  inclusion of a competency based remedial education component  in SYEP. Eighty-four Members of the  House  cosponsored  this  effort  and  hearings were held on the bill on May  22, 1985. This year I revised the bill in  light of these hearings and comments  we  received from all partners in the  JTPA system. On January 23, 1986, I  introduced H.R. 4050  to encourage a  remedial education component rather  than mandate it. Ninety-five Members  of the House joined me in cosponsor ing this bill.  The bill being debated today incor porates three components from H.R.  4050: First,  encouraging  a  remedial  education  component  within  the  Summer Youth Employment Program;  second, allowing programs to be con ducted during  the  interval between  the participant's regular school year;  and, third, providing a 90-percent hold  harmless for the SYEP allocations to  service delivery areas.  H.R.  5185  also  incorporates  a  number of the amendments that I in troduced in H.R. 4115 on February 4,  1986. These include: First, designating  of service delivery areas based on one  or more  labor market areas; second,  providing a 90-percent hold harmless  for the title II-A allocations to service  delivery areas; and, third, prohibiting  a matching  requirement on  grants  from  the  Secretary's  discretionary  funds under title III.  0 1415  ",1986

We  had also thought that we had finally  put this issue to bed several years ago  when we came down to the realization  that 50 Peacekeeper missiles would be  the number we would deploy.  Yet when we have a force of 50 mis siles, we have to keep in mind the fact  that we must have some test missiles. I  think  this amendment  to eliminate  those test missiles is the wrong signal  to send. The program is on its way,  and it has been doing extremely well.  The testing has to continue whenever  we have a program of this magnitude.  Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I  rise in  opposition to this amendment and I  urge others to support the position of  the committee, which was to provide  the funding for the test missiles.  ",1986
332,House,99,-0.384,1362,14,Mr. DOWNEY of New York.," Mr.  Chairman, we are here today not be cause the T -46 has some trouble. It  did, and we all admit  that. We are  here today because the senior Senator  from the State of Kansas found an op portunity to force the Air Force to say  that they did not want the plane that  the year before they were crying des perately for.  There are  a  number of different  ways to evaluate what is necessary for  the defense of our country. A trainer  should very simply be categorized in  very quick terms. It is needed.  The T-37, everyone knows, is 30-plus  years old. Its useful life is running out.  That is clear. The Strategic Air Com mand commander says so, former Sec retary of  the Air Force, Verne Orr  says so.  Will it cost more money if we cancel  this or will it cost less money? It will  cost more money, my colleagues, if we  go to the bait and switch scheme that  the gentleman from South Carolina  [Mr. SPRATT] has offered us. We will  also be killing the airplane.  0 1725  For the last year, the Fairchild Co.  has managed to swallow a year of not  having pro~ess payments, and  it  is  quite clear that if you want to kill the  plane, you can kill  it  the way Mr.  DICKINSON wants  to kill  it, by not  giving it the money, or you can kill it  the way Mr. SPRATT will do, by study ing it again. You can kill it with kind ness, but I would urge you, urge you to  recognize the fact that there is a re quirement for this plane and it is met  by the T -46, and it will cost over the  lifetime of the project, $1 billion less if  we build it now as opposed to later.  We are faced with an unhappy polit ical dilemma. The Air Force,  in at tempting to prove that it is against  something, has chosen this plane even  though  it has, up  to now, provided  $486 million  in developmental  cost,  and sung a siren song to the House  Armed Services Committee for the last  4 years that the plane was necessary.  It did not sing that song this year,  but the House Armed Services Com mittee  decided  that  young  pilots  needed new planes to train on. This  plane will save money in fuel, mainte nance;  it is more reliable. We know  that for a fact two prototypes have al ready flown.  So, my colleagues, this is not a ques tion of studying; this is a question of  whether you cancel it by cutting the  money out or canceling it by studying  it. Do not do either. Accept the House  Armed Services Committee recommen dation to build the plane.  ",1986

337,House,99,-0.194,74,18,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 5229  the Land Remote-Sensing  Commercialization Act Amendments  of 1986. This bill will ensure that the  intent of the original Landsat Act is  fully carried out. I believe this is legis lation we can all support.  In 1984, Congress took a bold step in  the commercialization of space by set ting  forth a  policy  for  transferring  land  remote-sensing  satellite  oper ations to the private sector. This was  an excellent piece of legislation and it  achieved widespread bipartisan  sup port. Now, 2 years later, we are in a  position to amend that act with any  changes that might clarify its intent  and improve its implementation.  Last  October,  the  subcommittee  which I chair and the subcommittee  chaired by the gentleman from New  York  [Mr. ScHEUER],  solicited  com ments from a great many parties on  what clarifying and technical changes  may be needed to the Landsat Act. We  held joint hearings on some proposed  amendments in early July. Witnesses  from both the administration and the  private sector supported our draft leg islation at that time. On this basis, I  introduced H.R. 5229 on July 23 and  the bill now has 19 cosponsors.  In addition to some minor clarifying  language changes,  this bill addresses  two types of comments we consistently  have heard from both the administra tion and the private sector. Both class es of comments pertain to the role of  research and development in this era  of commercialization.  First, H.R. 5229  enables both  the  Government and the private sector to  participate  in research and develop ment activities unencumbered by the  constraints  that are placed on com mercial activities. Essentially, the act  as amended would not allow licensees  to make data grants to researchers in  universities,  industry, and elsewhere  without charging commercial prices.  Second, H.R. 5229 would establish a  National  Remote-Sensing  Advisory  Committee whereby various parties in volved in remote-sensing can provide  input into  the Government's overall  research and development planning. If  we are to maintain our worldwide lead ership in this area, it is essential that  the Government maintain an active  research effort and be responsive  to  the needs of the private sector opera tors. We cannot afford  to let other  spacefaring nations, such as France  and Japan, dominate the remote-sens ing market by being the first to devel op and  take advantage of advanced  technologies.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5229 is a very val uable piece of  legislation  that will  create an environment whereby  the  Government and private sector can de velop  the working relationships that  will be necessary if commercialization  is to succeed. I ask my colleagues to  join me in strong support for this leg islation.  ",1986
338,House,99,-0.478,74,18,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker,  port of H.R. 5229.  As my colleagues from Florida, Mr. FuauA  and Mr. NELSON, have indicated, this bill con tains valuable provisions which will  fine-tune  the plan to establish an entire new industry in  space-the remote-sensing industry. We con tinue to face tough competition in this arena  from both France and Japan. However, favor I rise in sup able action on H.R. 5229 will send a strong  signal  that the Congress remains committed  to a commercial  remote-sensing program  in  the United States.  I would  remind my  colleagues, however,  that this new high-technology industry faces a  more immediate crisis than that proposed by  its international competitors. The crisis I refer  to is budgetary. The Challenger accident and  subsequent shutdown of  the Western Test  Range at Vandenberg Air Force Base have re duced launch options for the next generation  of  remote-sensing  satellites. However,  the  Earth  Observation  Satellite  Corporation  [EOSA T]-the entity charged with  commer cializing  land remote sensing-has proposed  an  innovative and practical plan for working  around the current problems associated with  scheduling of shuttle launches. EOSA T's plan  is contingent upon  the Congress providing a  level of funding  in fiscal year 1987 which ap proximates  the  funding  contained  in  the  House-passed Commerce appropriations bill.  I urge my colleagues  to keep  the United  States at the forefront of space commercial ization, both by supporting H.R. 5229  today  and  by  supporting  the House  position on  Landsat commercialization contained  in H.R.  5161.

339,House,99,-0.4,87,18,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 551,  unanimously passed by  the Foreign  Affairs Committee last Tuesday, com mends the Arms Control and Disarma ment Agency [ACDAl for its service to  the Nation and to world peace on the  occasion of the 25th anniversary of its  founding.  In establishing ACDA on September  26, 1961, President Kennedy and the  Congress sought to create a separate  authority to coordinate U.S. arms con trol policy as well as to integrate arms  control  into U.S.  national  security  policy.  The Agency grew out of a strong bi partisan consensus  in Congress  that  negotiated arms controls were an es sential element of our national securi ty policy. The Agency was entrusted  with the mandate of institutionalizing  the arms control process and ensuring  its presence in the formulation of U.S.  national security policy.  As a sponsor, along with the ranking  member of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee, Mr. BROOMFIELD, of this resolu tion,  I want  to commend  Control and Disarmament Agency for  the  important and vital  role  it has  played during its short existence for  promoting international arms control  and disarmament.  Every day that has gone by in the  past 25  years has pointed out  the  need,  the  desperate  need,  for  an  agency of this kind to coordinate U.S.  arms control policy.  While a strong bipartisan consensus  resulted  in  the creation of such an  arms control and disarmament agency,  such a consensus would not have been  reached, had it not been for the Presi dent of the United States, John Ken nedy, who saw fit to give and lend his  support to that measure. Ever since  then we have been struggling, but nev ertheless,  the Arms Control Agency  for 25 years has been  trying  to do  the Arms  Arms  what Congress has sought for it to do.  We have disagreed from time to time,  obviously, but nevertheless ACDA  is  the focal point and has the responsi bility for fostering an atmosphere of  peace and for integrating arms control  into our national security policy. The  Control  and  Disarmament  Agency deserves the commendation of  the Congress for the arms control ef forts of its current Director Ken Adel man and for the work of its past Direc tors,  including Paul Warnke, Gerard  Smith, Ralph Earle, Eugene Rostow,  George Seignious, Fred Ikle, and Wil liam Foster. Over the years these Di rectors and their staff have wrestled  with perhaps  the most  insurmount able problem confronting the world.  I therefore encourage my colleagues  to support this bipartisan resolution  and to express the hope that ACDA's  next 25 years of existence will be even  more productive than its first quarter  century of existence.

I think the organization is realistic,  tough and innovative.  I might also say, Mr. Speaker, that if  the proposals that were put forth by  President Reagan today at the United  Nations can be put into effect and the  Soviets will reciprocate, I think we can  go a long, long way in true verifiable  and realistic arms control.

350,House,99,0.325,347,18,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 4154, the Age Discrimina tion in Employment Amendments of 1986.  As  the sponsor of  legislation  to eliminate  mandatory retirement  for Americans over 70  and to prohibit the discrimination against any  worker because of age, I would urge the pas sage of this long overdue legislation. Accord ing to census information, I represent the dis trict with the highest concentration of Ameri cans over 65.  It  is no surprise,  then,  that  I  know firsthand of the valuable contribution of  older workers to our community and our local  economy.  Pinellas County businessmen  tell me  they  are anxious to hire older workers because of  the unique experiences and skills they offer.  For these employers, age  is not a factor in  hiring decisions. In fact,  I can cite case after  case of employees who make valauble contri butions to their companies while working into  their seventies, eighties, and beyond.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act,  enacted by Congress in 1967, prohibited age  discrimination in employment for workers be tween 40 and 65 years of age. Congress  wisely amended this legislation in 1978 to in crease the upper-age limit to 70. We should  take the final step today to end all age dis crimination in the workplace by eliminating en tirely the upper-age limit in this act.  Testimony presented to the Education and  Labor Committee  indicated  that  there  are  more than 800,000 Americans over 70 in the  current work  force. Undoubtedly,  this  figure  would be higher  if some workers were not  forced into mandatory retirement at age 70 or  left the work  force voluntarily because  they  were denied certain promotions or benefits.  Employment decisions should be based en tirely on a worker's skills, abilities, experience,  and qualification, not on age,  race, or sex.  Federal  law  prohbitis  the  discrimination  ",1986
351,Senate,99,-0.382,425,18,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  on April 18,  the Federal Emergency  Management Agency  issued  regula tions that would in effect deny Feder al disaster relief assistance to States  and localities in 61 of the last 111 de clared disasters. They would not have  been eligible. Under these regulations,  when a disaster is severe enough to  warrant Federal assistance,  localities  would be called upon to pay 50 percent  of the costs of replacing and repairing  public facilities, instead of the 25 per cent they pay under current practice.  I  oppose  the  implementation  of  these regulations. Denying Federal as sistance in time of need and increasing  costs to local governments when they  can least afford increased costs under mines the basic purpose of Federal dis aster relief.  As ranking member of the Subcom mittee on Regional and Community  Development with  jurisdiction over  this program,  I strongly oppose  the  imposition of  these drastic changes  through  the  regulatory  process.  sweeping changes are to be made in  the Disaster Relief Program,  those  changes should be made by the Con gress, not by the bureaucracy.  Prior to the August recess, I had in tended to offer an amendment to the  debt  ceiling  bill  to  prevent  these  FEMA regulations from taking effect  until Congress specifically authorized  changes to existing law. The commit tee leadership urged me to withhold  that amendment until this bill came to  the floor, so that an amendment could  be worked out which stopped the regu lations  and,  further,  authorized  changes  in  the Disaster Relief Pro gram. An important reason for choos ing this vehicle  is  that this amend ment will then go to conference with  the proper House committee.  Mr. President. it is time for the Con gress to exert control over the Disas ter Relief Program. Passage of author izing legislation is  the way to do  it.  With the exception of one provision,  this amendment has been adopted by  the Senate on two previous occasions  If  ",1986

353,Senate,99,0.263,451,18,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. President,  this  amendment to S. 2405 authorizes the  widening of U.S. Route 58 in the Vir ginia section of the Cumberland Gap  National Park from 2 to 4lanes.  The Federal Highay Act of 1973 au thorizes  the  reconstruction of U.S.  Routes 25 and 58 inside the Cumber land Gap National Park in the States  of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.  That project  includes  the abandon ment of U.S. Route 25 inside Virginia  and the construction of the Cumber land Gap Tunnel  linking Tennessee  and Kentucky. Only a 2-lane road is  now envisioned from this new roadway  through the National Park in Virginia.  This 2-lane road will not be adequate  to handle  the expected  traffic once  the tunnel is completed. The expan sion of Route 58 from 2 to 4 lanes is  essential to meet the demands of trav elers and commerce.  This amendment extends the exist ing  authorization  for  the  tunnel  project to include a 4-lane route 58 for  a distance of approximately 2.2 miles  from  the  relocated  tunnel  road  through the Cumberland Gap Park in  Virginia. This project has already been  approved in the House of Representa tives with the support of the Repre sentatives  from Virginia, Tennessee,  and Kentucky.  The  language of  the amendment  provides  that  this project will not  begin until after the tunnel and ap proach roads have been constructed. It  will not adversely affect  the  timely  completion of the tunnel.  Mr. President, this amendment has  been reviewed by the chairman of the  Committee  on  Environment  and  Public Works, the chairman and rank ing member of the Subcommittee on  Transportation and that they are will ing to accept this amendment.

355,Senate,99,0.084,659,18,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, we are  really playing with fire here. We are  not doing anything for the domestic  cement industry, as has been so clearly  pointed out. The total imports from  Canada amount to 4 percent of U.S.  consumption. So what we are doing is,  in an extreme  fashion,  irritating a  neighbor of ours and one of the great  customers we have. Listen to these sta tistics. Ontario  is  the  largest single  customer for American-made products  in the world. In 1985, U.S. exports to  Ontario were valued at $40 billion-19  percent of all U.S. exports.  Are these exports growing? We know  they are declining all over the rest of  the world. What  is happening with  Ontario? Between 1981 and 1985, U.S.  exports to Ontario advanced by 51 per cent, to the $40 billion. In 1985, Ontar io consumers purchased 20 percent of  all U.S.-manufactured exports. That is  where we are trying to do some good  in our sales abroad, with manufac tured exports. Twenty percent of all of  them went to Ontario; never mind how  many went to the balance of Canada.  But this is the principal province we  are dealing with. We are saying  to  Canada, ""No, we are not even going to  let you sell 4 percent of our  total  cement supply in the United States.""  Mr. President, I plead with my col league to reject this amendment be cause of the dangers it imposes on the  United States. Now, I would say that if  this amendment should be adopted, we  have word from the Office of Manage ment and Budget that they would rec ommend a veto to the President of the  United States.

Mr. Speaker,  I  want to just say to the leadership of  the Committee  on Education  and  Labor and the staff what a privilege it  has been for me to serve on that com mittee during this term that we are re authorizing such an important piece of  legislation.  Particularly  I want  to  thank  the  chairman, the gentleman from Michi gan [Mr. FoRD] and his staff, as well  as the ranking member, the gentleman  from Missouri [Mr. CoLEMAN] and his  staff, and the ranking member of the  full committee,  the gentleman from  Vermont [Mr. JEFFORDS], because they  have been of incredible assistance to  me and my staff as we have tried to  address problems that are specific to  Maine children who need the opportu nity for higher education.  Whether they are problems that are  unique to our own secondary market  where we are trying to give more op portunity to Maine children for higher  education; whether it is the problem  of rent subsidies being considered a  part of income for the nontraditional  students who need that help in order  to go back to school; whether it is ex panding the work-study programs  to  make sure that we can put more funds  into  job placement, so  that we can  make sure that we have the opportuni ties that are going to be essential for a  work-study  program  to  work;  or  whether it is just changing the oppor tunities the students have under the  Guaranteed Student Loan Program.  Maine has the lowest percentage of  students in this country who go on to  higher education, but the largest per centage who use guaranteed student  loans.  I believe the kind of changes that we  have made are going  to allow more  Maine  students  and more  students  throughout this country to have the  opportunity to use government assist ance to make sure that they have the  opportunity  to  get  the  education  which is going to be so important for  their futures.  Mr. Speaker, I think we have satis fied the goal that we started out with,  thanks to the leadership on our com mittee putting education ahead of par tisan politics. That is the way legisla tion ought to be crafted, and I am con vinced that will mean we are going to  have more opportunity for students in  this country within the limited dollars  that we have.

360,House,99,0.264,945,18,Mr. HENRY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the conference report on S.  1965,  the higher  education  amend ments of 1986. This  legislation  re sponds to the two overriding concerns  today when it comes to Federal stu dent  financial  assistance-making  more dollars available, both in grants  and in subsidized loans, for those stu dents unable  to pay  the  increasing  costs of higher education, while also  tightening eligibility criteria and col lection procedures, to insure that only  those students who need Federal aid  receive it, and that those who do re ceive loans repay them. The bill main tains the critical combinations of Fed eral grants and loans which have been  so  important in insuring educational  opportunity to our young people, and  increasingly, older workers who need  retraining and  further education as  well.  In addition,  the conference report  follows the House bill and includes a  new program  to address one of the  most pressing needs of higher educa tion today-the critical need for new  and upgraded research and education al facilities. By involving private cap ital in this new program of loan insur ance and reinsurance for educational  facilities, this program will allow us to  leverage a large number of. dollars for  college  construction with  relatively  few Federal dollars involved.  I want  to also commend  the out standing efforts of Chairman FoRD,  and of my ranking member of the sub committee, Mr. CoLEMAN, and to the  chairman and ranking member of the  full committee, Chairman HAWKINS  and Mr. JEFFoRDs for all of their work  on this legislation.

361,House,99,0.387,958,18,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Chair man, I  rise in support of H.R. 5495,  the fiscal year 1987 NASA authoriza tion bill. The Subcommittee on Trans portation,  Aviation,  and Materials  unanimously supported  the adminis tration's request for their aeronautics  program this year.  I know none of us are happy with  the huge deficits  that continue  to  plague us. However, we must resist the  temptation to balance the budget at  the expense of research and develop ment. I am sure every one of us would  be willing to borrow money to take ad vantage of an investment opportunity  with a guaranteed return greater than  the cost of borrowing. Those kinds of  investment opportunities  are  rarely  available to us as individuals, and yet I  believe that funding NASA's aeronau tics R&T program is as close to a risk free investment as any of us are likely  to see.  The U.S. aerospace industry contin ues to provide a positive trade balance.  This is directly related to the invest ments we have made in the past in  aeronautics research. There is tremen dous synergism in NASA's aeronautics  program; much of  it  is generic  re search that benefits all aspects of avia tion, and the resulting cost of requir ing each company to conduct its own  basic research program would surely  mean the end of our fragile competi tive advantage in aviation products.  I would also like to call attention to  a new line item in NASA's budget this  year-transatmospherics R&T. This is  the aerospace plane program which  bridges  the gap that now exists be tween  aeronautics  and  space. The  aerospace plane is the most exciting  program we've seen in decades-a hy personic  research aircraft  that will  demonstrate the technologies needed  for hypersonic transports, military air craft, and also a single-stage-to-orbit  space transportation system.  This is a  joint program with DOD,  and it is critically important to sup port a strong NASA role in this pro gram to ensure that it remains a re search program to support both civil  and military applications in both aero nautics and space.  And, now I would like to turn our at tention  to  the space program. The  NASA authorization bill directs NASA  to begin procurement of a replacement  orbiter; moreover, it provides for the  ",1986

He helped develop the  Child Development Center in Pontiac  in  connection with  the  Apostolic  Church. Through this center he has  helped shape the future of many chil dren in our area. He has served many  elected officials, and he has  in fact  served in the city government of Pon tiac giving of his time to further repre sentative government.  Mr. Speaker, he is my friend and he  is an inspiration to those of us in the  Pontiac area. I look forward to intro ducing him to my many colleagues.  H.R.  4142, THE GENERAL AVIA TION TORT REFORM ACT OF  1986  <Mr. WHITTAKER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
377,House,99,0.346,1101,18,Mr. WHITTAKER.," Mr. Speaker, for  roughly a decade the issue of product  liability reform has been debated  in  the Congress. While we debate  this  issue, American  industries are being  overwhelmed  by  product  liability  awards that are beyond reason. The  general  aviation  industry has been  particularly hard hit.  The U.S. general aviation industry is  experiencing its most severe recession  in history. The industry delivered only  2,033 airplanes  in 1985 compared  to  17,811 units in 1978. In 1985, the in dustry recorded a trade deficit of $481  million. These are not simply abstract  numbers; what they mean is a loss of  jobs for American workers.  The major general aviation manu facturers are currently experiencing  66 percent unemployment. Two-thirds  of the jobs in this industry have been  lost. Since 1980, 15,000 jobs have been  lost in Wichita, KS, alone.  According  to  the Department  of  Commerce, one of the primary causal  factors behind  the  industry's down turn is the cost of the product liability  system. In 1985, industry cost for prod uct liability exposure was $70,000 for  each airplane built and delivered. Pro jections for 1986  indicate this figure  will go over $100,000 per airplane. It  should be noted that for the general  aviation industry, this is not an insur ance problem. These manufacturers  are almost totally self-insured for the  primary layers of insurance coverage.  If action is not taken to reform the  product liability laws, the general avia tion industry could be totally devastat ed. Therefore, I am supporting H.R.  4142 which provides for sector specific  reform of product liability laws.  H.R. 4142 addresses, in an equitable  manner, the three areas  to  tort law  that have given the general aviation  manufacturers particular difficulties.  First, the bill provides a Federal uni form law on aviation product liability.  Second, it eliminates joint and several  liability, except for liability for defects  in airplanes or their parts. Finally, it  prohibits actions for injuries caused by  products that are beyond their useful  lives.  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is essential  that Congress act on this legislation  during this session. The general avia tion industry and its employees cannot  afford  to  listen  to Congress discuss  this issue for another 10 years.  MR. NAKASONE, AN APOLOGY IS  IN ORDER  <Mr. MITCHELL  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
378,House,99,-0.526,1101,18,Mr. MITCHELL.," Madam Speaker, I  would hope that my colleagues may be  able to hear me.  Madam Speaker, I am a black man  and Nakasone of Japan holds that I  am intellectually inferior because I am  black.  Madam Speaker, I hold that I am his  intellectual superior. I have a myriad  of facts and data stored in my mind. I  have a catholicity of interests.  I understand the Guaranteed Agree ment on Trade and Tariffs.  I know  what the law of diminishing returns  means in terms of economic productiv ity.  I have a knowledge that the medical  world no longer looks with favor on a  lobotomy, a lobectomy or leukotomy. I  know  that Brahms wrote  four sym phonies, Gustav Mahler wrote nine. I  know the difference between the Lie bestod and the Liebeslied, and I do not  think Mr. Nakasone knows that. I hold  that I am his intellectual superior. I  want  to use my superior  talents,  I  hope,  to persuade all blacks and mi norities to stop buying Japanese-made  the gentle cars. If he holds that we are inferior,  then we should not use his products.  I would also hope that this House  will not take that insult gratuitously  imposed on black and Hispanic people,  imposed by Mr. Nakasone of Japan.  Madam Speaker, I would hope that  this House would show its outrage, its  absolute outrage and do that which is  appropriate to protect the dignity of  those of us in this House.  Nakasone has got to remember that  it was the Black Caucus that support ed reparations for the Japanese-Amer icans in this country who were treated  so badly during World War II.  Mr. Nakasone, does that show intel lectual inferiority?  ",1986
379,House,99,0.194,1127,18,Mr. DUNCAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New  Hampshire  [Mr.  GREGG],  a  member of the Ways and Means Com mittee.  ",1986
380,House,99,0.429,1127,18,Mr. GREGG.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Tennessee  for recognizing me.  I think I should start by saying that  this bill clearly does not bottle light ning. It has some significant problems.  In my opinion, there are sections of  this bill which are going to create ex traordinary complexity in our tax law.  There are also, unfortunately, sections  of this bill which I would characterize  as staff-driven academic drivel; but on  balance, this bill accomplishes some of  our fundamental goals for tax reform.  First, it is fair. It creates a situation  where people of essentially the same  taxable income will pay approximately  the same amount of taxes.  Second, it dramatically cuts rates so  that people have a greater incentive to  be productive, so that people will go  out and earn that extra dollar because  they know they will be able to keep a  higher percentage of that extra dollar.  Third, it significantly  takes out of  the business of investment the policy  of  trying  to obtain  tax deductions.  One of the biggest problems we have  in  this  economy  today  is  that  too  many people invest for purposes of tax  deductions versus  investing  for pur poses of getting a real return on their  investments. This bill will go a  long  way toward correcting that. It is there fore in my opinion not an answer to  our dream, but rather a better bill  than what we presently have as reality  today. For that reason,  I endorse it  and I hope that it will pass.  ",1986
381,House,99,0.178,1140,18,Mr. ROEMER.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank my colleague for yielding to me.  There are many weaknesses of the tax  bill. There always are. Tax bills are  like catching fish: 5 days later, they  both stink.  We are going to find things in the  bill in a week or a month or so that we  do not like. Even now, I resent the ret roactive provisions, the investment tax  credit, and capital gains provisions in  I  the bill, but I like the heart of the bill;  the heart of  the bill  is  solid and  strong: Lower marginal rates for all  Americans. You make the last dollar,  you get to keep it. That is what Amer ica is all about.  like the heart of the bill: Every body pays their fair share. The only  thing wrong with this bill is that we  did not have it 20 years ago. I like the  heart of the bill. It is progressive.  The gentleman just got up and said,  well, the rich are going to get off free.  Wrong. The top 10 percent of the tax payers in America pay 51 percent of  the taxes now. After this bill, they will  pay a higher percentage. This bill is  progressive, fair, and with lower mar ginal rates. It is what America is all  about.  Bad  parts,  yes. Wish we  could  change  them. But  if  I have got  to  measure an animal, I will take the one  with a good heart. Vote ""yes.""  ",1986
382,House,99,0.375,1153,18,Mr. COATS.," Madam Speaker, let me  just say that while it is difficult in 1  minute to say all the things I want to  about this tax bill, I would like to ad dress one particular aspect of it.  This is a profamily tax bill. I intro duced, more than a year ago  in the  House of Representatives, H.R. 1551,  the Tax Fairness  for Families Act,  which doubled  the personal exemp tion. I am most pleased that the bill  before us today accomplishes the pur71...{)59 0-87-37 (Pt. 18)  poses of that bill. It raised the exemp tion  to $1,900 next year and up  to  $2,000 by 1988 and indexes it by the  year 1990.  This is the most significant, historic  piece of fairness for families  in this  country that we have ever achieved  through our tax law. I am proud of  the people who have worked so hard  to  support  this  particular  item.  I  thank them for including it in this his toric tax reform measure. The families  of America thank you and I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation  from  this very standpoint alone.  brings fairness to families.  ",1986
383,House,99,-0.506,1166,18,Mr. BROWN of California.," Madam Speaker,  we have before us the most comprehensive  piece of tax legislation in decades. If enacted,  as it appears that it surely will be, this legisla tion will affect nearly every segment of our so ciety. The sheer volume of the changes will  overwhelm Americans, many of whom have  already expressed their concern and dismay.  Unlike past ""reform"" movements,  this one  was unique for its very  lack of popular sup port.  It was as if we,  isolated in Washington,  forged  this  reform, but  forgot  to  inform  the  public. And what the public does know has  not been encouraging. Those of us who have  spent much of our time back  in our districts  since the conference report was agreed to in  mid-August have heard nothing but complaints  from our constituents.  Small businessmen don't understand  they  are  to afford  to understand  the extensive  changes in the Tax Code without the advice  and counsel of expensive accountants and  lawyers. Those people saving  for retirement  are bewildered by a government who, on the  one hand,  tells  them  that  they should  find  ways  to  supplement  their Social Security  checks, and at the same  time withdraws  in centives  to save. Parents wonder how  they  can afford  to send  their children  to college  without being able to deduct interest. Students  on scholarships are stunned to realize that the  same scholarship  this year as  last  is worth  considerably less because now it will be taxed  in part. And my constituents worry about a  provision which will give  favorable  treatment  to a proposed  tire-burning plant  in my dis trict-a district with some of the worst air pol lution in the Nation.  While these are troublesome areas, this bill  is not without its merits. In fact, such a com prehensive and extensive measure as this is  bound to have both positive and negative ele ments. On the positive side, it will take 6 mil lion  taxpayers off  the  tax  rolls. For  these  Americans  it may mean  the difference be tween  just barely getting by and getting by.  For millions more working poor Americans,  mostly women and their children, this tax bill  will substantially reduce their tax liability. For  the  first  time since 1980,  the  tax  threshold  (when one brings paying taxes) will be above  the poverty level.  For nonitemizers, nearly  two-thirds of all  taxpayers,  the changes in  the tax bill will be  significant. The personal exemption will be in creased from $1,130 to $2,000 by 1989. The  standard deduction, also known as  the zero  bracket amount and calculated  into  the  tax  tables, will be significantly increased. More im portantly, heads of households will be treated  more  like married couples with dependents  than as singles, as they are now. Finally, the  earned  income  tax  credit,  used  to  offset  Social Security taxes for the poorest taxpay ers, will be increased as well as have its eligi bility expanded. More  low-income  taxpayers  will benefit from the credit.  These benefits to the working poor will have  a significant impact on the majority of my constituents. The average  income  in  the 36th  Congressional District  is substantially below  the national average. Since the vast majority  of low-income individuals do not itemize, they  will surely benefit from these changes.  But though  they benefit in  the short term,  will they in the long run? This question is not  easily, nor unequivocally, answered. Given the  magnitude of the rate cuts at the top, main taining the present degree of progressivity in  terms of actual taxes paid is largely depend ent on several key reforms, most notably the  repeal of the capital gains preference and the  anti-tax-shelter rules. While the lobbyists con cerned with these issues seem to have more  or less accepted defeat in the current round, a  sustained effort  to  reverse some of the  re forms seems almost  inevitable next year.  If  these reforms are eroded, the main legacy of  the 1986 tax reform legislation will be a mas sive reduction in upper income tax rates.  Even if these reforms are not eroded, pro gressivity-an essential philosophical compo nent of our tax structure-may very well be.  Lost somewhere in the debate on tax reform  has been our concern for continued massive  budget deficits. One of  the primary goals  during this tax reform process has been reve nue neutrality. Meanwhile, our deficits contin ue to rise despite our efforts to reduce spend ing. The fact remains, however, that we simply  cannot reduce spending by $200 billion with out seriously damaging services to the Ameri can public and grinding our economy to a halt.  Eventually, in some manner, revenues will be  raised. But how?  This conference agreement has done an  excellent,  if not perfect,  job of closing  loop holes and eliminating many abusive tax shel ters. Yet its mistake is refusing to use the rev enue yield  from  this  to  reduce  the deficit  rather than reduce the tax rates. It will be ex tremely hard to raise revenues in future years  through  the  income  tax.  Instead, our only  other available options will be  increases  in  excise taxes or the imposition of new levies  such as energy taxes or a value-added  tax.  These options will be highly controversial and  highly unpopular, particularly since they tend  to place the heaviest burdens on those least  able to pay.  I am not opposed to wealth.  I could use a  little myself, as I'm sure we all could. But I do  believe that those well-off have an obligation  to pay  slightly more  for  the opportunities  which have been provided in our great Nation.  I would not want to see the concept of pro gressivity-those who earn more, pay more be abolished in the search for rate reduction.  I am also concerned about the possibility  that this tax bill could dampen the economic  climate. Not only does the bill shift $120 bil lion of the tax burden to business, it adversely  impacts educational  institutions-the  incuba tors of our economic future. Bond restrictions,  charitable contribution  limits,  taxation of the  nontuition portion of scholarships,  repeal of  the  interest deduction  for educational  loans,  pension reforms, and other items will all place  a financial stress on our higher education in stitutions. This administration has nickle and  dimed our education system  throughout  its  tenure. It has yet to understand its integral im portance to our Nation's well-being. I regret to  ",1986

Mr. Speaker, Don Fortier was  a  friend of mine, as  indeed he was a  friend of all of us, Republicans and  Democrats, who have come  to  learn  his  passionate  patriotism,  his  deep  commitment to public service, his im peccable scholarship, and his unique  qualities as a husband and as a father.  I have rarely met a person who was  more serious about his work.  In my previous incarnation as a uni versity professor, I had come to appre ciate scholarship. I do not think in all  the years I have spent here in Wash ington both as a Member of the House  and as a staff member on the Senate  side before I ever had the pleasure of  getting to know someone who was as  demanding of himself as a scholar.  President Reagan  could not have  chosen better than to have made this  brilliant, dedicated, outstanding patri ot his deputy national security adviser.  He loved his work. I have never seen  a person whose mind was as constantly  engaged as Don's and all of that engagement had the purpose of answer ing the one question: How best to pro mote  the  interests  of  the United  States.  He sat next to me at the Kremlin  one day when we met with the top  Soviet negotiator on arms control, Am bassador Karpov.  Now while we had a distinguished  and a strong bipartisan delegation, I  believe I am accurate in saying that all  of us combined did not have the depth  of understanding, the appreciation of  the nuances of arms control that Don  did.  He incessantly worked for the bene fit of our Nation and even when he  was on vacation he was churning forth  endless memorandums, papers, cables,  telegrams, to tell his home office what  is happening, with a degree of percep tivity and insight and appreciation of  other cultures that was extraordinary.  Don and Alison were a  team. They  were one of the finest teams in this  Capital. They shared the love and ap preciation of what this Nation is and  the skills of foreign policy experts. It  was such an infinite joy to see them  greet their little son when he arrived  some 3 years ago.  The last time Annette and I saw Don  was at Andrews Air Force Base when  he had a little boy in his arms greeting  Alison as he was returning from a dif ficult and arduous journey abroad.  The sparkle, the joy, the intelligence  in that little boy's eyes give all of us  hope that someday he will carry on his  father's, Don's, work.  To Don's grandmother, his parents,  brother, but particularly to Alison and  Graham and the little baby yet to be  born, my wife Annette and I are send ing our love and our affection.  ",1986

The consecration and Chrismation of  the  Assumption Greek Orthodox Church  is  a  joyous occasion  for  its parishioners, and  it  sends a powerful message of  faith  to  the  entire Flint area.  The church was founded in the late 1920's  by a group of 20  immigrant  families, whose  commitment and courage  laid  the foundation  for a holy place of worship  that now serves  240 families in the Flint area. The Assumption  Greek Orthodox Church, which  received  its  charter in 1928, has been a constant and un wavering source of spiritual strength  for  its  congregation.  In  its early days and after the  church building's construction in 1961, the vi brant spiritual  life of  this church has been  manifest through its sacred traditions of wor ship and its active service to the community.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In Flint, we are fortunate to have a strong  Greek  community,  whose members  have  made, and continue  to make, a tremendous  contribution  to  the quality of life  in  the Flint  area. The Assumption Greek Orthodox Church  has not only been a sacred place of worship  and spiritual guidance  for  its parishioners,  it  has provided them with a community of fellow ship that is rich in a shared faith and heritage.  The  formal dedication and baptism of  the  church on September 28  is an occasion  for  renewed  faith and appreciation of a church  that has met the spiritual needs of its congre gation for nearly 60 years.  Mr. Speaker, under the spiritual  leadership  of  its  pastor, Rev.  Athanas George,  the  church continues its tradition of religious com mitment and community service today.

The new house,  the  first  to be opened  in  Queens, Nassau, or Suffolk Counties in New  York,  is located on the grounds of Schneider  Children's Hospital, at the Long Island Jewish  Medical Center.  Mr. Speaker, 12 years ago, one family and  a doctor had a small idea. When Kim Hill was  stricken with  leukemia, her parents and Dr.  Audrey Evans realized how difficult it can be  for a mother and  father  to stay close  to a  child who has been hospitalized. They con ceived of a simple solution: special homes  away from home where parents and  families  could  remain near  the hospital without en countering often-prohibitive hotel costs. The  seed that they planted was sown generously  by McDonald's, a corporation that cares about  the communities  in which  it does business.  And today, that seed has become a network  of 1 00 Ronald McDonald Houses, providing a  warm atmosphere for families to stay together  when they need each other the most.  Fred, Fran, and Kim, as well as Dr. Evans,  will all be present at the dedication ceremony  on Monday. Their story, and the entire history  of the Ronald McDonald House movement, is  an  impressive  testiment  to  the  American  people. From the lone individuals who had a  dream,  to  the corporate caring  that brought  the dream to  life,  to the private sharing  that  keeps each house  in operation  to  this day,  this is a slice of America of which we can all  be proud.  The Schneider Children's Hospital is an ap propriate place for the 1 OOth Rondald McDon ald House. Specializing  in  treating cancers  that strike out at our young people, this institu26375  tion of healing helps children from the entire  New York metropolitan  area,  as well  as  youngsters from across the Nation and around  the world. Thanks to .the new facility, count less children will be able to receive the com fort and support that only a parent can bring. I  would  like to acknowledge Lyn Jurick, presi dent, and Irving Klein, chairman of the board  of this new Ronald McDonald House; and Dr.  Robert K.

394,House,99,0.646,1309,18,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr.  Speaker,  the Committee on Rules did a railroad  job on this rule. The effect of doing a  railroad job on this rule is to make a  bill loaded down with contentious and  divisive  issues even more contentious  and more divisive which will ensure  that a conference will not succeed.  The gentleman from Nebraska [Mr.  DAUB]  ticked  off  a whole host of  things that the Committee on Rules  did, including putting Moakley-DeCon cini in and sheltering it from a motion  to strike.  But in another instance, on the issue  of warrantless searches of fields,  the  Committees on Agriculture and  the  Judiciary have had a  difference of  agreement. The Committee on Agri culture supported the search warrant;  the Committee on the Judiciary, for  good reason, did not. Yet the commit tee on Agriculture's version is put in  this bill and sheltered from a motion  to strike.  So even when  there are disagree ments between 2 committees, this rule  prevents a vote of the House to deter mine which committee's viewpoint is  justified.  These kinds of issues are going to  make a conference almost impossible  to reach agreement in the few days  left of this session. This kind of rule, I  believe in effect, will kill immigration  reform vitally needed for 2 more years.  ",1986
395,House,99,-0.487,1309,18,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule on H.R. 3810. Im migration refotm is a complex and dif ficult issue. Addressing the many com peting interests is not easily achieved.  But I strongly believe that the rule we  are voting on here today represents a  fair  and  realistic  effort  to balance  these interests.  Two years ago, I voted against the  House immigration reform bill. I voted  against the bill because I believed that  employer  sanctions would  result  in  widespread  discrimination.  I  voted  against the bill because I believed that  the massive  guest-worker  program  that was adopted would lead to abuse  and exploitation of both foreign and  American workers. I voted against the  bill 2 years ago because I did not be lieve it represented fair or meaningful  immigration reform.  Because of our efforts to ensure that  immigration reform did not result in  discrimination  and  abuse, Hispanics  like myself have been accused of being  obstructionist. We have been criticized  for subverting the will of the majority.  When I opposed the rule on the immi gration bill in the last Congress, I was  told that although the rule was not  perfect-the  time  for  immigration  reform had come.  I  find  it ironic that some of these  same critics are now attempting  to  deny the House an opportunity to vote  for legislation that has been approved  by virtually every committee of juris diction. The rule is not perfect. But it  does attempt to maintain a  realistic  balance of competing interests. And to  borrow  a  line  from my critics-the  time for immigration reform has come.  If the rule we are considering here  today is adopted, I am not certain how  I will vote on final passage. I am still  troubled by  the discrimination  that  could result from employer sanctions.  I am also not convinced that any for eign agricultural workers should be  imported to pick our crops. I am cer-  tain, however, that if the rule is not  adopted, the opportunity for approv ing acceptable legislation will be lost.  If the House does not adopt  this  rule,  the delicate balance  that has  been crafted will be destroyed and im migration reform will once again be  left for another day.  I urge my col leagues to adopt the rule and provide  the House an opportunity to vote for a  fair and meaningful immigration bill.  ",1986
396,House,99,0.3,1309,18,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  strong opposition  to  this most un democratic rule.  Again,  we  find  ourselves  going  through the semiannual sadistic proc ess of trying to do something about  meaningful immigration reform in this  country. I am sick and tired of hearing  speaker after speaker come down here  and say that getting this bill out is  more important than the democratic  process.  The Committee on Rules has com pletely stopped the democratic process  from going forward and I will say to  the Members  that  democracy,  the  1  democratic process, is more important  than any statute, any change or any  bill coming through this Congress of  the United States.  It is sadistic and anybody who be lieves for 1 moment that we are going  to take this bill to conference and that  we are going to come back with a good  immigration bill before  the close of  this Congress next week or the follow ing week must have  come  in  this  morning's mail.  It is not going to happen and I urge  all of the Members that the only way  that we can really make our feelings  known and come up with a decent bill  that will give us any chance of mean ingful immigration reform this year is  to defeat this awful rule.

400,Senate,99,0.382,1374,18,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I would  like  to commend Senator HEINZ  for  the work he has done on Senate Con current Resolution 166, expressing the  sense of Congress in opposition to em ployment discrimination against indi viduals who have, or have had, cancer  based on such individual's cancer his tory. I would also like to express my  general support  for  the concept of  educating  the  public  about  the  progress we have made  in  treating  cancer.  Today, 1 of every 2 persons diag nosed as having cancer is cured. That  means that there are more than 5 mil lion people alive today who have had  cancer. And  there  is no doubt  that  many  of  them  are  discriminated  against when it comes to employment  or insurance.  The  solution  to  this  problem  is  public  awareness. People who have  had cancer historically had a much  shorter  life  expectancy.  Insurance  companies base their rate on historical  data. Today, because more people are  living with cancer,  insurance compa nies will adjust their rates for cancer  patients downward.  Likewic;e, employers have been reluc tant to hire and tra.ir. persons with a  history of cancer. who might have a  shortened life expectancy. In addition,  employers were concerned about fre quent hospitalization and its effect on  employees'  productivity  and  their  health care costs. But  today, many  cancer  patients  can  be  cured  and  return  to many years of productive  employment.  As I and other Senators have point ed out, it is important that the public  learns about  the progress we  have  made. Attitudes  toward  cancer  pa tients should and are changing. Most  of us now personally know someone  who has been cured of cancer.  But let me express a word of cau tion.  I am cautious about  trying  to  change these attitudes through legis lation. Among employee benefits, for  example, is insurance. Insurance rates  are generally determined by one's risk  of injury or illness. People who smoke,  are overweight, have high blood pres sure, or have been exposed to AIDS  an charged higher rates because they  present a greater risk. Those present ing a lower risk should and do pay less.  Thus  I  am not willing  to mandate  equality  in  the marketplace which  would amount to a forced cross-subsi dy, but I am willing to endorse a broad  policy statement opposing unfounded  disparate treatment.  Mr. President, having said  that,  I  would like to again commend Senator  HEINZ for his work and leadership in  this area. I hope that I can work with  him to increase the public awareness  of the progress we have made in this  area.  ",1986
401,,99,-0.308,1491,18,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, let us not overes timate  the agreement  reached  last week  in  Punta del Este. What has happened  is  that  GATT member nations have agreed to negoti ate for the next 5 to 1 0 years to explore solu tions  to  the many problems besetting  the  international trading system.  Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit is soaring  toward the $200 billion level for 1986-exact ing a staggering  toll  in American  jobs and  businesses. Yet,  the Senate refuses  to take  action on the comprehensive trade bill (H.R.  4800) that was passed by an overwhelming bi partisan majority last May.  The following article by Lane Kirkland, presi dent of the AFL-CIO that appeared in today's  New York Times underscores  the need  for  prompt action by the Congress and the Presi dent to reverse the alarming decline in Ameri ca's industrial base and the living standards of  many American families.  [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 19861  THE FREE-TRADE MYTH Is RuiNING Us  <By Lane Kirkland>  WASHINGTON.-America faces an economic  crisis caused by the Administration's infatu ation with the long dead  theory of ""free  trade."" To deal with that crisis, the Senate  must act quickly on trade reform legislation  passed last May by the House.  Scores of industries, thousands of compa nies and millions of workers are drowning  under a flood of imports generated by for eign government  initiatives and Washing ton's neglect. The effects are felt in every  sector of the economy through plant clos ings, farm foreclosures, bankruptcies and re cession-level unemployment.  Yet, President Reagan insists that ""free  trade and open markets . . . generate more  jobs, a more productive use of a nation's re sources, more  rapid  innovation and high  standards of living both for this nation and  its trading partners."" But free trade doesn't  exist except as an empty slogan. Not a prod uct, commodity or service, including money,  moves across any border except ours under  free trade conditions.  Much of  the world disavows a market  economy and practices the most brutal form  of protectionism: the protection of mercan tile power and profit. Most trade is not open  but directed-directed by governments  in  support of national policies and multina tional corporations that move  labor-inten sive production to countries with the most  exploitable workforce.  There are no open markets among our  trade partners in the European Community,  nor in Japan, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea  and Mexico-not unless ""free and open mar kets"" means import quotas, discriminatory  performance and  inspection requirements,  export subsidies and  incentives,  industrial  targeting programs, controlled currency ex change rates, and barter agreements.  There is no sign of the  jobs that ""free  trade"" supposedly generates. The Labor De partment reports that from 1979 through  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  1984, 11.5 million workers lost jobs because  of plant closings or  layoffs due  to slack  work.  Living standards have not risen. Real av erage weekly earnings for production work ers  fell by 9 percent from 1977  through  1985. Nearly half  the workers displaced  from manufacturing who were lucky to find  jobs were forced to accept lower pay and re duced living standards.  Their loss of jobs has not brought gains to  workers overseas. Too many less developed  nations enjoy booms because workers are  paid rock bottom subsistence wages, are for bidden to organize and bargain collectively  and have no health and safety protection,  no pension, no security.  If ""free trade"" benefits anyone, it is ma nipulators who depress wages in order to in flate profits. They are absolved of guilt by  the ""free trade"" evangelists who say that  our ""over-paid"" workers have ""priced them selves out of the market.""  What is going overseas are not only jobs  that sustain millions of families but the in dustrial  capacity  that  sustains America.  Company after company is no longer a pro ducer but a mere relabeler and distributor  of  imports. And  foreign  label goods sold  across the nation cost no less than products  once made here. The only difference is that  none of the money is returned as wages and  payroll  taxes  to communities where  it  is  spent.  It is wrong to label the Senate trade bill as  ""protectionist."" It is a response to virulent  protectionism, and  its goal  is  to expand  trade by making it a two-way street conduct ed on even terms. President Reagan prom ises to veto it. His supporters fear ""retalia tion."" They argue  that America has no  moral right to require trading partners to  adopt humane labor standards. If other na tions treat workers like dirt, they say, we  must accept ""cultural differences."" And if  our corporations make fat profits because of  those cultural differences, well, that's what  ""free trade"" is about.  Accept  that and you must accept  the  proposition  that  it  is  fair  to allow other  countries,  aided by business and govern ment, to slash American standards of living  and human decency  to the level  that ex ploiters growing  rich off  the  free  trade  myth praise as ""competitive."" Such think ing must be resisted. The labor movement's  historic mission  is not to lower American  standards but to raise them-and, as well, to  raise the world's standards to our level.

I want to congratulate the chairman  for ensuring that this funding was in cluded in the conference report. The  same amount was contained  in  this  year's House-passed  version  of  the  water projects bill and was also ap proved by the House last Congress.  The funding contained in this bill  will  fulfill  contractual  obligations  made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engi neers when the canal was turned over  to the State. Needed repairs on the  waterworks of the canal, long held up  by lawsuits and bureaucratic redtape,  can now proceed.  The Hennepin is a historically sig nificant and structurally unique canal  which was a  forerunner of the con struction techniques and waterworks  used in Panama. This canal, by defini tion, begins at the Mississippi River  and runs the breadth of the 17th Con gressional District. The  Illinois and  Michigan Canal, which starts in Chica go, meets the Hennepin Canal at the  Illinois River to form a waterway cor ridor across the entire State and can  potentially become  a  leading  recre ational area in our State and a draw  for tourists.  We in west-central Illinois who have  grown up with this canal, who swam  and fished in it as kids, and who recog nize its historical significance will fi nally be able to see this canal devel oped to its fullest for recreational pur poses.

The legislation before the  Senate  incorporates  the  agreement  reached by the committee of confer ence on H.R. 4613, except for a provi sion  transferring  certain  National  Forest System land to the Nebraska  Game and Parks Commission.  Under the legislation, appropriations  will be authorized  to carry out the  Commodity  Exchange  Act  during  fiscal years 1987 through 1989. Certain  improvements also will be made in the  current Commodity Futures Regula tory Program.  In addition, the legislation addresses  other matters that are important to  American farmers, ranchers, and con sumers. These matters include: First,  Federal meat inspection; second, extra  long staple cotton; third, 1986 Wheat  Program payments;  fourth, Valencia  peanuts; fifth, acreage eligible for the  Conservation Reserve Program;  and  sixth,  local agricultural stabilization  and conservation committees.  FUTURES TRADING PROVISIONS  The futures markets are an integral  part of the Nation's economy. They  have a direct effect on agricultural  producers, consumers, large and small  investors, financial institutions, manu facturers, Government, and business  of all types. One of the more impor tant roles of the Federal Government  is  to ensure that these markets are  free from fraud and manipulation.  The Commodity Futures Trading  Commission  is  the Federal  agency  charged with the primary responsibil ity of regulating the futures industry.  In addition, the industry's Registered  Futures Association supplements the  activities of  the Federal  regulatory  agency  through  its program of self regulation.  The CFTC was established as an in dependent regulatory agency in 1974.  The authorization of appropriations  for the CFTC was extended in 1978  and 1982. Under  the Senate-passed  bill, appropriations would have been  authorized for an additional 6 years.  Under this legislation, appropriations  would be authorized for 3 years. The  3-year  reauthorization  period  ensure Congress an early opportunity  to examine the changes made by the  pending legislation.  This legislation will make relatively  few changes in the Federal regulatory  program of the CFTC. Most of these  changes were included in the Senate passed amendment to the House bill.

413,Senate,99,-0.352,818,23,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, over  the past 6 years there are few areas of  national  policy  that have  suffered  more  than  our  national  housing  policy. After more than four decades  of national commitment to a develop ing decent and affordable housing for  all Americans-rich and poor alike the 1980's have seen a sudden reversal  of that goal. Housing has become the  forgotten stepchild of both Congress  and the administration, and a crisis in  housing is already the result.  The housing crisis is, ironically, felt  most acutely in those few areas of the  country that are currently experienc ing healthy economic growth-growth  that  is  directly  threatened by  the  labor shortages that follow from the  lack of affordable housing.  This linkage-between the supply of  affordable housing and the capacity of  continued economic growth-is a link age  that  is not well understood by  those in Congress and the administra tion who support the rentrenchment  of the Federal role in housing.  Therefore, I would like to call atten tion to a speech delivered this week by  David 0. Maxwell,  the chairman of  the Federal National Mortgage Asso ciation, and  the national expert on  this matter. As noted in today's Wash ington Post, Mr. Maxwell's speech pro vides a ""vivid account of the Nation's  housing dilemma and its implications  for local economies.""  Mr. President, I ask that the article  in today's Washington Post and Mr.  Maxwell's  speech  appear  in  the  RECORD.  The material follows:  HOUSING SHORTAGE CREATING A LABOR ONE  <By Rudolph A. Pyatt Jr.)  Twice during recent conversations, an offi cial from a Washington suburb expressed  deep concern about two potentially trouble some elements in her county's economy. A  scarcity of housing for low-income families  and an apparent labor shortage, the official  noted, have been  largely  ignored as  the  county's economy continues to expand.  The American Automobile Association's  recent disclosure that it is moving its head quarters and 650 jobs from Fairfax County  to another part of the country reinforced  the official's concerns. One of AAA's rea sons for moving, according to AAA officials,  is a shortage of workers.  A local television station highlighted an other concern of the suburban official when  it recently reported the plight of a young  couple from West Virginia. Unable to find  affordable housing after  finding  jobs  in  Northern Virginia, the couple took up resi dence in a camper.  The concerns of the suburban official are  the antitheses, nonetheless, of  the public  statements of several local officials in the  public and private sectors. AAA's decision  and the West Virginia couple's plight are  mere blips on the big screen of a booming  economy in metropolitan Washington.  Unemployment is an incredibly low 3 per cent or less in most suburban areas. Housing  starts remain strong. Commercial construc tion continues to soar. Personal income is at  record levels. Wealth abounds. All's well in  River City, land of prosperity, home of the  affluent. To hell with AAA and the home less, boosterism's leading voices seem to be  saying.  In the meantime, the concerned suburban  official appears to be part of a minority that  worries  about  growing  labor  shortages.  There is, she says, a direct correlation be tween a  shortage of  lowand moderate income housing near employment centers  and the labor shortage in suburban commu nities. The time has come, she implied, for  local officials to consider new housing poli cies.  The evidence suggests that housing poli cies deserve added attention in the private  sector as well. Indeed, transportation prob lems, which currently occupy the attention  of local business leaders, could be alleviated  through more enlightened housing policies.  Why should business leaders care about  housing policies? David 0. Maxwell,  the  chairman and chief executive officer of the  Federal National Mortgage  Association,  spelled out several reasons in a strongly per suasive argument this week. In remarks at a  Greater Washington  Research  Center  luncheon Wednesday, Maxwell called for a  strong national housing policy.  But it was Maxwell's vivid account of the  nation's housing dilemma and its  implica tions  for  local  economies  that suggested  why business should care.  Housing prices &.re  rising again, apart ments are  in short supply and  jobs are  moving to places where housing costs even  more. Maxwell was describing a national di lemma but executives who heard his  re marks must have recognized a very accurate  description of housing problems in metro politan Washington.  Whether they were  intended  to or not,  Maxwell's remarks had the effect of raising  the level of sensitivity among local business  leaders.  ""Our own metropolitan area exemplifies  this trend,"" he declared. ""First-time buyers  can find little affordable housing near these  jobs. They live so far away that transporta tion becomes an expensive and  time-con suming proposition.  ""This movement  of  jobs  creates  even  bigger obstacles for the working poor. New  suburban offices need cleaning; parking lots  need attendants; junk-food emporiums need  servers. How common it is these days, as an  article in The Atlantic Monthly recently ob served, to see affluent suburban executives  motor off to their nearby homes, while their  staffs wait for the first of several buses they  will have to board on their long journeys  home.""  Moreover, Maxwell  reminded  the  audi ence, ""The pernicious persistence of racial  discrimination continues  to  reinforce  the  barriers to accessible housing.""  In dozens of U.S. cities, including Wash ington, Maxwell continued, waiting lists for  public housing grow longer and longer. In  the Greater Washington area, he said, the  number  is  34,000  families.  ""'That's more  than 100,000 people! At any reasonable rate  of construction,  it would take 13 years to  build housing for those families. And there  is no housing being built.""  Working  families on  those waiting  lists  and others who can't afford housing near  their  jobs are  the ones who clean  those  shiny new office buildings, park cars, flip  hamburgers and,  indeed,  type  letters and  stock shelves. But they've having difficulty  that might  getting  from here-wherever  be-to there.  Maxwell's remarks were a timely reminder  to local business leaders that their support  for more enlightened housing policies can  enhance employment opportunities and the  growth of their businesses.  AMERICAN HOUSING: A VICTORY To BE  CELEBRATED ... OR STILL To BE WoN?  <Remarks prepared for delivery by David 0.  Maxwell)  When the Research Center began twenty five years ago, the American mood was one  of exuberant confidence that social prob lems would yield to the efforts of communi ty-mined organizations like yours. That was  a  time of high  idealism.  It's no surprise,  then, that the Center was founded during  that period.  What is surprising  is  that you survived  through the 70's, when the national mood  darkened, and emerged even stronger into  the 80's. Yours is no fair-weather idealism.  I'm convinced that the major factor dis tinguishing you from other public policy or ganizations that have either succumbed to  exhaustion, or trimmed  their views  to fit  current fashions, has been your insistence  on research. Research  is at the center of  your name and your mission.  Your strength has been your recognition  that  ideals without data are empty, and  data without ideals are blind. Your success  has come because you have combined both.  As a citizen of Washington, I am grateful  for your efforts. As a businessman, I depend  on them.  I've recently had a first-hand reminder of  how rigorous you are in searching out infor mation. I received from Atlee Shidler a list  of suggested questions I might answer in my  remarks today. The list runs for a couple of  pages and covers at  least  fifteen highly  challenging  issues. Most of  the questions  have three parts-some have five or six.  Indeed, if I were to try to deal adequately  with Atlee's questions, we'd be here through  the Spring semester.  But one of these questions in particular  caught my eye. It's a threshold question. If  we don't have a good answer for this ques tion, then the other questions become moot.  The question is, ""Why should the audience  care about housing policy?""  Why indeed?  Of course, as individual Americans, we cer tainly care about our own homes. Poll after  poll shows we put home ownership at the  top of the list of what constitutes the good  life"". This American  trait struck a  recent  distinguished visitor here with special force.  After only a  few weeks in America, Soviet  dissident Yelena Bonner wrote a moving ar ticle  this  title: Americans don't want war. Americans  want a house.""  But our own personal concerns aside, why  should we care about housing policy? After  all, American housing has by and large been  a notable success:  The proportion of Americans who own  their own homes was only about two in five  at the time of the Great Depression. Today,  two out of three Americans own their own  homes.  In  1960,  one dwelling  in  eight  lacked  plumbing facilities, by 1980, that ratio was  down to one in forty.  In  the  average dwelling had  rooms per person; today, the average dwell ing has  two  rooms per person, and  the  rooms are larger.  for The Washington Post, with  1950,  1.5  ",1986
414,,99,-0.339,857,23,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure  to rise before you today to pay special tribute  to a very special organization in my congres sional district of the Bronx. NY. On November  the Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center  will celebrate their 90th anniversary. This spe cial occasion will be observed in grand style.  but  I would  like to  take  this opportunity  to  share with my colleagues how very special I  think the center is to the people of the Bronx.  In my capacity as chairman of the House  Select Committee on Aging's Subcommittee  on Human Services, I have had the opportuni ty to witness firsthand the many different fa cilities available for care of the elderly, espe cially  the  frail elder1y. Daughters of Jacob,  which is recognized as one of the finest geri atric centers in this Nation and rates in the top  ten in New York. is a very unique institution.  Daughters of Jacob. a nonprofit. voluntary  nursing home, offers a positive alternative for  elderly people; it offers high quality. compas sionate medical care. a beautiful and secure  environment. and a stimulating fife with people  of common interests.  Caring for the elderly has been a tradition of  the people of Israel since Biblical days. It was  the motivation,  as well,  of Mrs.  Bertha  Dworsky  in  1896 when  she  founded  the  home. At that time her objective was to pro vide a haven for the elderly from homeless ness, loneliness. and hunger. A house at 40  Gouverneur Street on the Lower East Side of  Manhattan was  the  first establishment and  housed 19 residents. As the reputation of the  home spread. new quarters were opened at  East Broadway. As New York City's Jewish  population grew,  it became apparent  that  larger quarters were a necessity. A plot of  ground was purchased in the Bronx in 1913  and plans for a new home were made.  The new facility was opened in 1920 at a  cost of $1,250,000. In 1938 a floor was added  and the home and hospital of the Daughters  of Jacob was prepared to serve 600 patients  and  residents. The  present Daughters  of  Jacob nursing home was opened in 1973. It  consists of a modem, 13-story, 515-bed struc ture, 305 skilled nursing beds and 210 health  related beds. The  facilities also  include  the  Weintstein-Ratner Pavilion and Rndlay Plaza,  a senior citizen apartment complex designed  for the independent elderly over 65 years of  age.  A dedicated staff of more than 500, includ ing physicians. nurses,  therapists, and aides,  provides the highest standard of care. Some  of the special services available within  the  center  include audiology,  dentistry. dietary.  electrocardiography, occupational therapy, op tometry. pharmacy. physical therapy. podiatry.  pyschiatry, social work services. speech ther apy. and leisure time and recreation activities.  However, in addition to the staff. I would like  to pay special attention to the volunteers at  Daughters of Jacob who bring an additional  human dimension to the lives of the patients  and residents of the center. Among the volun teer services performed by volunteers are  feeding patients.  transporting  them  to clinics  and special events. assisting staff with nursing  occupational  therapy.  reading aloud. writing  letters and managing a gift shop. The volun teers  come  from  varied  backgrounds and  range in age from 14 to 80. Their participation  in  the daily  life of the center enhances  its  entire atmosphere. Of special note is the guild  and the mother's day group. These organiza tions  raise  funds  to provide gifts and such  amenities as art work to brighten the lives of  our elderly patients and residents.  There is no doubt whatsoever that Daugh ters of Jacob  fulfills a special need  in our  community  today.  Its expert staff. services,  and facilities and most importantly, its atmos phere of caring combine  to make  it a  real  horne  for  its patients and residents. At the  center,  it  is possible  for aging men and  women  to regain  their abilities and maintain  activity-in short. to continue life as independ ently as possible, with the greatest dignity and  to enjoy themselves in tho process.  I salute  the Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center,  its  staff, its president. Ms. Claire Vogelman under  whose leadership the center has flourished, its  volunteers, and its residents and patients. For  90 years. the frail elderly have been sustained  and enriched by the creative, meaningful, and  innovative work of this long-term care institu tion and for 90 years the center has helped  lead the effort to ensure quality of care and  continuing opportunity  for an ever-increasing  population of older men and women. May  I  take this opportunity to wish them many more  years of success and humanitarian service.  HONORING A PRO-LIFE  INDIVIDUAL  HON. JOE KOLTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 15, 1986  Mr. KOL TEA.

Mr. Ross Cosentino of Beaver County, an  Italian immigrant. has traveled to Washington,  DC. many times over the past 15 years  to  help protect the  life of the  innocent. Ross.  who is now 87 years old. is a fervent spokes man for the unborn and has coordinated over  15 bus trips to this city to bring thousands of  individuals here to support this worthy move ment  In  the last 10 years. Ross Cosentino has  formed one of the strongest Pro-Life organiza tions in Pennsylvania. distributing over 40,000  Pro-Life bumper stickers and selling more  than 20.000 ""Red Rose"" Pro-Life appliques.  His group has  sponsored more  than 250  Right-To-Life billboards and supplied every  Catholic Church in the Beaver Valley area with  a ""Respect-for-Life"" bulletin board.  Mr. Speaker. all of this and more has been  accomplished  through  the strength. energy  and selfless dedication of Ross Cosentino.  who deeply cares for the unborn.  That. sir. is why I am pround to stand here  today and honor  this outstanding  individual  who has committed a lifetime to promoting the  Pro-Life cause. His efforts should not go un noticed because of  the numerous  innocent  lives he has protected.  IN HONOR OF REPRESENTATIVE  JOHN SEIBERLING  HON. JJ.

415,,99,-0.218,857,23,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, every now and  then someone comes along who won't be de terred, kept quite. or pushed aside when he is  in pursuit of a good cause. JOHN SEIBERLING  is such a man. No amount of pressure, coer cion, intimidation ever deterred JOHN SEIBER LING from saying his piece.  JOHN SEIBERLING does not go around pick ing  fights  or  causing  trouble. He  always  speaks from principle. with a high sense of in tegrity. His legal training and other high quali ties made him  the perfect  ""watch dog"" of  human dignity.  Whether  the subject was a constitutional  question or about human rights, JOHN SEIBER LING could instantly and eloquently challenge  any statement of prejudice or bigotry.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Public  Lands, he has presided over the preservation  of more Federal  lands and  the creation of  more Federal parks and recreation areas than  anyone in this body-with the possible excep tion of Phil Burton.  Indeed,  I remember a story JOHN SEIBER LING passed along to me about a conversation  he had with Phil Burton. The question was  raised, why stay as chairman of the Subcom mittee on Public Lands. To which, Burton re plied, ""When yoLJ look back over your years of  e This .. bullet'' symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

416,,99,-0.318,883,23,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, the arts have tra ditionally played a very  important role  in  the  history and culture of my own State of New  Jersey.  In  recent years, however,  there has  been renewed growth and vigor within the arts  community of New Jersey due  largely to the  firm Federal and State support for arts pro grams.  The  artistic  revitalization  taking  place  in  New Jersey has grasped  the  interest of a  number of organizations and  it has not only  received  support  from  arts-oriented groups  and individuals but also from corporate spon sors such as Campbell Soup and RCA. Some  37,000 artists reside  in  the New Jersey and  play an active role  in  furthering New Jersey  talent and culture.  I am especially proud of the attention given  to the city of Camden, which I represent, and  the  transformation Camden  is undergoing  in  terms of historical preservation and a prolif eration of art.  In addition, I was proud to see  the  attention  given  to Camden's  Artistic  Design Program which seeks to elevate com munity pride by placing murals on graffiti-cov ered walls. I commend the efforts of Kimberly  Camp,  the visual-arts coordinator for the city  of Camden. in this area. As a member of the  Congressional Arts Caucus, I had the opportu nity of working with Kimberly as she helped  coordinate the 1985 First Congressional Arts  Caucus competition and was  impressed by  both her commitment to the arts and her mul tifaceted talent.  The  two articles on Camden's revitilization  and on the Artistic Design Program follow:  [From the Horizon, October 1986]  A CULTURAL MOVEMENT  <By Julia Lichtblau)  A grass-roots arts movement has  taken  hold in Camden, New Jersey, and is growing  vigorously in the city's new climate of pride  and determination. Professional artists and  the community both are eagerly participat ing.  There  are  outdoor  performances  throughout  the  summer.  The  Camden  County Cultural and Heritage Commission  sponsors performances, school programs, a  statewide Teen Arts Festival, and an annual  juried exhibition  featuring  the works of  over two hundred local artists. The Artistic  Design Program employs professional art ists to plan murals for the city's graffiti-cov ered walls, and the city's teenagers help to  execute them. Original research in music is  going on at the Rutgers-Camden campus,  while the visual-arts department has a com puter-graphics program  that  is attracting  students from throughout the region. And  in Walt Whitman's chosen city, it is only ap propriate to have an award-winning poetry  magazine-the Mickle Street Review-pub lished on the campus; as well as the Walt  Whitman Center for the Arts and Human ities. <The area code for all Camden loca tions is 609.)  ART AND HISTORY MUSEUMS  Last year,  some  ten  thousand viewers  made their way to the Stedman Art Gallery  33587  <Fourth  and  Linden  Streets,  Fine-Arts  Center of Rutgers, the State University of  New  Jersey, Camden Campus, 757-6245).  The only art museum  in southern New  Jersey, it has been exhibiting, educating the  public, striving for a more national profile,  and nurturing  the  local arts community  since 1975.  ""We  try for an experimental  focus,"" says gallery director Virginia Steel.  ""As a university gallery, we can afford to  take chances and we should."" The Stedman  is nationally known for its biennial works on-paper competition, established in 1975 to  encourage contemporary American artists  using paper in both traditional and experi mental ways. The  last competition drew  twenty-seven  hundred  entries,  of which  eighty-six were selected. The gallery holds  eight changing exhibits a year, including an  interdisciplinary one that focuses on an art  or craft of a different culture. Such exhibits  are often touring to several galleries around  the country and make their only New York/  Philadelphia-area appearances at the Sted man.  The National Endowment for  the Arts funded Visiting-Artist Lecture Series yearly  brings six nationally known artists from dif ferent disciplines to the gallery to discuss  their work. Past  lectures have  included  Philip Glass and Laurie Anderson.  The fall 1986 season opens with a  joint  show of rare works by Andr~ Kert~sz and  Lucien Aigner, on loan from the Polaroid  Corporation. The Kert~sz prints are his first  color series, begun at the age of eighty-four.  Aigner's works are from a collection of fifty  thousand negatives of prewar Paris, found  in an old suitcase in 1970.  Camden is the international headquarters  of  the Campbell Soup Company which  maintains the Campbell Museum <Campbell  Place, 342-6440). The plush, red-velvet inte rior cradles what museum president Ralph  Collier  describes  as  ""the world's most  unique collection of soup tureens"" -which  includes  life-size swans,  rabbits, chickens,  boars' and cows' heads, cauliflowers, and  melons  in  silver,  pewter,  porcelain,  and  earthenware.  The  tureens, which  date  mostly from the early-eighteenth and nine teenth centuries, come from two dozen Eu ropean countries and China. Of particular  note  is  a gilt-and-painted  tureen bearing  images of early-nineteenth-century Berlin part of a 350-piece set for the marriage of  Prince Frederick of  the Netherlands and  Princess Louise of Prussia in 1825. A film,  ""Artistry in Tureens,"" can be shown by ap pointment to groups of up to fifty people.  Not  limited  to  soup-related  objects,  the  Campbell Museum has small changing ex hibits of prints, photographs, and decora tive-art objects.  History buffs will find a rich assortment  of historic sites in the Camden area, dating  from its origins as a Quaker settlement in  the early-eighteenth century through the  Industrial Revolution. Pomona Hall <Park  Boulevard and Euclid Avenue, 964-3333),  home of the Camden County Historical So ciety,  is  an eighteenth-century Georgian  mansion built by  the Coopers-Camden's  founding family and restored for use as a  museum during  the Bicentennial. Eight eenth-century furniture, quilts, farm imple ments, and even clothing-including Wil liam Cooper's vest, which dates to the early eighteenth  century-are on  exhibit. Up stairs, you'll find craft shops for candlemak ing, weaving, and shoemaking.  The museum also contains objects of par ticular significance to Camden-such as lo cally made glass, Campbell Soup artifacts,  ",1986
417,,99,0.541,896,23,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker, on August 23,  1986, President Reagan signed House Joint  Resolution  529,  a  resolution  declaring  the  week of September 21-27, 1986, as ""Emer gency Medical Services Week.""  I was a co sponsor of that resolution.  In Houston, TX,  there  is an exceptional  emergency medical  service  resource called  Life Flight which is operated by Hermann Hos pital, a not-for-profit  teaching hospital.  Life  Flight will celebrate its 1Oth year of service to  southeast Texas and western Louisiana on  November 2, 1986.  Mr. Speaker, Hermann Hospital inaugurated  Life Flight 1 0 years ago as  the  first civilian  emergency air ambulance service in the State  of Texas. The event  is of national historical  importance, because since then more than 50  medical centers throughout the United States  have emulated the Life Flight Program.  Today Life Flight is the Nation's largest hos pital-based airborne emergency medical serv ice. During its first decade of community serv ice, Life Flight has  flown more  than 27,000  missions to the scenes of accidents and trag edies in its service area.  This vital service has provided  the quick  and decisive emergency treatment required to  save lives, thereby sparing patients and their  families  from needless suffering. Life Flight  has improved the chances of survival for vic -tims of serious injuries and illnesses.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Houston is a sprawling city with miles and  miles of freeways that at times are impassable  by emergency ground  transportation. On a  daily basis, airborne Life Flight makes the dif ference between life and death for individuals  injured  in  traffic or other types of accidents.  Additionally, Life Flight serves numerous outly ing rural communities when there is a need for  the specialized medical and surgical services  located in the Texas Medical Center in Hous ton.  Hermann Hospital's  Life  Flight  Program  staffs  its helicopters with  registered nurse/  paramedics and University of Texas Medical  School physicians. These health care profes sionals are competent and compassionate in  their delivery of medical services for any who  require them, on the ground or in the air.  On behalf of the citizens of the Eighth Dis trict of Texas who are served by Life Flight, I  extend our appreciation to Hermann Hospital's  Life Flight Program,  its creators and profes sional staff  for their dedication and commit ment.  I congratulate  the Life Flight Program  on  the occasion of its 1Oth anniversary and  wish its staff many years of continued success  in service to the Houston community.

420,,99,0.351,961,23,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  to the attention of my colleagues the story of  a U.S. military hero who has heretofore been  denied the credit and admiration he richly de serves. The centennial of one of the most in trepid acts of  the Apache wars  in Arizona,  New Mexico, and Northern Mexico, was ob served this past September, and  few people  outside  historians  know  the whole  story  behind the surrender of Geronimo to the U.S.  Army. History books often give credit to Brig.  Gen. Nelson A. Miles, while it was the cour age, hard work, and perseverance of 1st Lt.  Charles Baehr Gatewood  that  led  to Geron imo's bloodless surrender.  Mr. Daniel Thrapp, a respected Arizona his torian  and  author of numerous books on  Southwestern  and  Indian  history  recently  wrote me about this unsung American hero,  Lt. Charles B. Gatewood.  Lieutenant Gatewood, in poor health after 9  years of the most arduous duty and valuable  by Brig. Gen.  field  service, was  directed  Nelson A. Miles  in  the summer of 1886 to  take two Apache scouts, to endeavor to find  Geronimo,  and  talk him  into  surrendering.  Gatewood never gave a thought to declining  this service, although  for health reasons he  would surely have been justified in doing so.  Instead, after an exhausting search he did  locate Geronimo,  though 5,000  troops under  Miles had failed to do so. With his two scouts  and an  interpreter, he entered  the hostile  camp of the feared Apache. Over a period of  a  few days  the surrender was effected, ac complishing  through negotiation what 5,000  men failed to do by force.  33665  Many other soldiers  received Medals of  Honor for their parts  in  the several Apache  wars. Lieutenant Gatewood was denied, due  largely, in the words of one expert, to ""Army  jealousies and  the pettiness and vanity that  marred  the  really great soldierly qualities of  Miles."" Rather he was tucked away on Miles'  staff  in  Los Angeles where he  could  be  reached by neither media nor public.  The following excerpt is from Mr. Thrapp's  definitive  ""Encyclopedia of Frontier Biogra phy"":  Gatewood, Charles Baehr, army officer  <April 6, 1853-May 20, 1896). B. near Wood stock, Va., of a Secessionist family, he at tended West Point. Upon graduation he was  assigned in 1877 to the 6th Cavalry and em barked upon a singular career in the Apache  country as commander of Indian scouts. His  experience  in  the numerous Apache out breaks was perhaps more  extensive and  more indispensable than that of any other  officer. Gatewood took part in many actions  of the Victorio War of 1879-80,  including  the hard pursuit of the hostiles into Chi huahua in 1879; the heavy action in the San  Andres Mountains of New Mexico in 1880,  and several fights in the Black Range. He  accompanied Crook's great expedition into  the Sierra Madre in 1883 after the hostiles,  afterward being assigned to manage some of  the returned Indians on the Fort Apache  Reservation. Gatewood had an  important  role in the Geronimo campaign of 1885-86; .  it was he who was selected by Miles to enter  Mexico, locate the enemy and persuade him  to surrender, and Gatewood performed this  duty to the letter, although in poor physical  health at the time. His intrepid entry into  Geronimo's camp and arguing that Indian  to finally give hiinself up  is perhaps the  highlight of the last southwestern Indian  war, although Gatewood never received any  particular  recognition  for his  intrepidity  and devotion to duty on the part of Miles or  other officers of the Miles faction. This is  not only to Miles' eternal discredit, but also  to that of his country. Gatewood served as  an aide to Miles in Southern California; in  1889 he rejoined his regiment at Fort Win gate, N.M. He went with the 6th Cavalry to  the Dakotas for the 1890-91 Sioux trouble,  was on leave for some months because of  poor health, rejoined his regiment at Fort  McKinney, Wyo., where he was injured se verely in a dynamite explosion coincident to  the so-called Johnson County War. He was  forced  to  retire permanently from active  duty and died, probably at Denver. ""His  reward for services that have often been de scribed as unusual, was like that of many  another soldier who has given his all that  his country might grow and prosper:  for  himself a free plot of ground in Arlington  Cemetery, and to his widow a tardy seven teen dollars a month.""

422,Senate,99,0.495,1065,23,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, today we  are attempting to pass legislation deal ing with emergency measures designed  to provide regulators with tools they  need to deal with insolvent depository  institutions. While  the distinguished  Senator from Wisconsin has agreed  that these items are indeed emergency  measures, Senator PRoXMIRE would  extend that categorization to so-called  nonbank banks.  The issue of nonbank banks is not a  new one. It has been characterized by  some as emergency legislation but, as I  have said on many previous occasions,  the nonbank bank issue cannot be ad dressed by itself. That issue is the ""Si amese twin"" of the issue of additional  products and services for banks. While  I would have hoped to deal with those  issues  in comprehensive  legislation which I introduced earlier this year-it  became evident that the limited time  remaining would not permit this  to  occur.  I am encouraged, however that as a  result of this process many of the com peting industries members have begun  discussions  regarding  the  broader  issues of financial services reform.  I  attach as part of the RECORD  a letter  dated August 12 from many financial  service  providers which  indicates  a  commitment  to move  forward with  those broader issues in the lOOth Con gress.

423,,99,-0.496,1234,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, on October  17, 1986, the House passed H.R. 1790, the  Military  lands Withdrawal Act of 1986, after  adopting my amendment  in  the nature of a  substitute. On October 18,  the Senate also  passed  the bill and cleared  it for  the Presi dent.  H.R. 1790 was originally introduced by Rep resentative BYRON of Maryland on March 28,  1985, and was referred to the Committee on  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Interior and Insular Affairs. Within the commit tee,  responsibility  for  initial consideration of  the measure was assigned to the Subcommit tee on Public lands, which I chaired.  During 1986,  the subcommittee held four  hearings on H.R. 1790, at which we carefully  reviewed its significance with respect to each  of the areas of public lands which the bill pro posed for withdrawal. Members and staff also  visited all the areas.  Based on the information obtained through  the hearing process and inspection visits, the  subcommittee and full committee acted sepa rately on two military withdrawal bills. One of  those bills was H.R. 4351, which dealt with  the  two areas  in Nevada-the  ""Bravo 20""  Area and the Nellis Air Force Range-includ ed  in H.R. 1790. The other was H.R. 5389,  which dealt with  the areas  in Alaska-Fort  Wainwright Maneuver Area, Fort Greely Ma neuver Area, and Fort Greely Air Drop Zone included  in H.R. 1790. Each of  these bills,  after being favorably reported by the Commit tee on Interior and Insular Affairs, passed the  House. However, neither was acted on by the  Senate.  Finally,  through discussions which  involved  both House and Senate representatives, we  were able to arrive at a compromise omnibus  proposal dealing with all the areas addressed  in H.R. 1790. That compromise was embodied  in the amendment in the nature of a substitute  which was adopted on the floor of the House  after the bill was discarded from further com mittee consideration.  Because H.R. 1790 as a whole was never  the subject of a written committee report, I be lieve  it  is  important  that  the  record  reflect  some of the background and the policy con siderations which were reflected in the devel opment of the compromise and the final pas sage of H.R. 1790.  The provisions of H.R.  1790 as passed  which relate to areas in Nevada were based in  large part on the provisions of H.R. 4351 as  earlier passed by  the House of Representa tives. The background and rationale for those  provisions are  set out at  some  length  in  House Report No. 99-689, part I, presented to  the House on July 16, 1986, by Chairman  UDALL  In particular, I believe that the history  of the ""Bravo 20"" Area as set forth  in  that  report will be  important reading  for all  those  interested in the development of H.R. 1790 as  passed by the 99th Congress.  With regard to the Alaska areas dealt with  in H.R. 1790, House Report No. 99-920, part  I, presented to the House by Chairman UDALL  on September 24, 1986, provides  important  background information and an explanation of  the House's position with  regard  to  these  areas, a position largely reflected in H.R. 1790  as passed.  House Report No. 99-689, part  I, should  also be consulted with  regard  to  the provi sions of section 4 of H.R. 1790 as passed relating to the Desert National Wildlife Range  and  the  Cabeza  Prieta  National Wildlife  Refuge. Those provisions were closely mod elled on  the provisions of section 1 04(f) of  H.R. 4351 as passed by the House of Repre sentatives.  Section 6 of H.R. 1790 as passed ""Nevada  Report"" was based on section 105(c) of H.R.  October 18, 1986  4351  as passed by  the House. Again,  the  House reports on that bill should be consulted  with respect to the considerations lying behind  this most important section of the final bill.  The provisions of section 7 and section 8(e)  of H.R. 1790 as passed have no direct ante cedents  in either of the House-passed bills  nor in  the military withdrawal bill-S. 2412considered  by  the  Senate. However,  the  policy considerations which led to inclusion of  these provisions in H.R. 1790 as passed are  discussed  to  some extent  in  the minority  views of Senator METZENBAUM included in the  report on the Senate bill-Senate Report No.  99-514-dated October 1 , 1986. The provi sions of section 7 were the subject of a collo quy  between  Senators METZENBAUM  and  MCCLURE appearing on page 33728 of  the  RECORD (October 18, 1986).  The Senate committee's report should also  be  consulted with  respect  to  sections 1 0  (""water  rights""),  11  (""hunting,  fishing,  and  trapping""), and 12 (""mining and mineral leas ing"") of H.R. 1790. All the provisions of those  sections are generally based on correspond ing sections of S. 2412 as favorably reported  by the Senate Committee on Energy and Nat ural Resources, with the exception of section  12(h). That subsection is identical to section  2(b)(1) of H.R. 5151 as passed by the House  of Representatives on October 6, 1986, and is  discussed in House Report No. 99-946, pre sented  to  the House of Representatives by  Chairman UDALL on October 1, 1986.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  section 16 of H.R.  1790 as passed embodies the provisions of  H.R. 4645, dealing with an adjustment of the  boundary of  the Cuyahoga Valley National  Recreation Area  in Ohio. That bill was  the  subject of House Report No. 99-759, present ed to the House of Representatives by Chair man UDALL on July 30, 1986.  SALUTE TO ED DONLEY-AN  AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADER  HON. DON RIITER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, October 18, 1986  ",1986
424,,99,0.268,1234,23,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, Air Products &  Chemicals, Inc., one of the leading businesses  in the State of Pennsylvania and the Nation,  will soon be  losing  to  retirement  its distin guished chairman and chief executive officer,  Mr. Edward Donley.  Air Products, which  is  headquartered  in  Trexlertown, PA, has  risen  from $15 million  per year in sales in 1957 to nearly $2 billion  today, and achieved a Fortune 500  rank of  205  among  the Nation's  largest  industrial  companies. Ed Donley has overseen virtually  all of this growth, having become president of  the company in 1966, chief executive officer  in 1973, and chairman in 1978.  Ed Donley,  in addition  to guiding  the  for tunes of  this  innovative and  technologically  oriented company, has achieved a well-de served reputation as one of the national busi ness community's most effective and respect ed spokesmen. This is evidenced by Ed Don",1986
425,,99,-0.419,1247,23,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to ex press my support for S. 2948, which would au thorize the President to promote, posthumous ly, Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka  to  the grade of  colonel. I had the great honor of knowing Elli son Onizuka-he was a kind and selfless man  who  loved the Air Force and  its Space Pro gram not as a job, but as the culmination of  his life's ambition.  In January 1978, when I was yet a newcom er to Congress,  I had gone to the  island of  Hawaii to inform Ellison's mother that he had  been selected as an astronaut candidate by  NASA. Her jubilant response to the news re flected the fact that this was the materializa tion of his greatest dream.  After 7 years of specialized training, Ellison  became a member of the Discovery mission.  On this flight, he was, among other things, re sponsible for primary payload activities. During  Discovery's 48 orbits around the Earth, Ellison  logged a total of 7 4 hours in space, landing at  Kennedy Space Center on January 27, 1985. I  was fortunate enough to be in attendance at  the launching of that exciting voyage, sharing  with his  family and many other well-wishers  that historic moment.  For the people of Hawaii and especially for  the children, Ellison became a hero. He was  the first Hawaiian astronaut in  the history of  the Space Program. Ellison was an inspiration  to all  those he met, generously donating his  time to speak of his experiences, often visiting  many of our local schools. The children were  in awe of this kind and humble man. His life  stands as a monument to all those who strive  to fulfill their dreams.  Ellison Onizuka was a  valiant American  whose promotion is well-deserved.  I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2948.
