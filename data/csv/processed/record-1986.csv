0,28,1,Mr. TALLON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the  life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  and  the dream  for which he died. At certain  brief and  isolated moments, history is seized  by the energy and vision of a single man. The  life of Martin Luther King was such a moment.  Dr. King  infused us with  the dream of  free dom,  equality,  justice  and  peace  for  our  Nation and the world. He touched each of us  with this dream and  then showed us how to  bring that dream alive. This legacy remains a  constant source of inspiration and responsibil ity.  In honoring Martin Luther King, let us reflect  on our place in his march for freedom and jus tice. We have a moral obligation to realistically  examine how faithfully and how far we have  carried ""the dream."" This reassessment is the  first step in what Dr. King called his nonviolent  campaign  for  justice. King noted  four basic  steps in his campaign: First, collection of the  facts to determine whether injustices are alive;  second, negotiation; third, self-purification; and  fourth, direct action.  I believe we have a responsibility to contin ue Dr. King's campaign  for nonviolent social  change. A collection of the facts clearly indi cates that domestic and  foreign policy viola tions of civil  rights, equality,  justice  remain  prevalent  in our domestic and our  foreign  policy.""Certainly, blacks have made significant  political, economic, and educational gains. Yet  still, minorities  in  this country are still not  given the educational and economic opportu nities that are available to their white counter parts. There are heartwrenching examples of  inequality and  injustice all around us. Unem ployment  for blacks stands at 15 percent.  Nearly half our black children are born  into  poverty. The median  family  income for black  families is $15,432 compared with $27,686 for  white  families. Vestiges of prejudice are still  prevalent in some of our social, political, and  economic institutions.  Injustice and inequality remain a part of our  foreign policy as well.  In South Africa  today  there are millions of blacks who struggle and  long  for  freedom and equality. This struggle  parallels that of black Americans just 30 years  ago. We have a responsibility to support and  assist them in this struggle.  Negotiation is the second stage. Negotiation  is different  from  concession or  regression.  Rather,  it  requires careful consideration and  compromise as we work to promote freedom  and equality  for  the disenfranchised. This  is  perhaps  the most difficult stage, demanding  tenacity,  foresight and  cooperation. As Dr.  King observed,  the negotiator  is often con fronted with  ""blasted hopes, and  the dark  shadow of deep disappointment.""  A  time of  reflection and  recommitment  is  important in this long difficult struggle for free dom. The Martin Luther King holiday provided  us such time. The stage that Dr. King termed  self-purification  is a period  for  introspection  and self-examination. This stage allows us to  regain courage to confront the reality of injus tice and the will to work for peaceful change.  Dr. King provides us with the inspiration to re commit. We can gain strength  from his un flinching determination  to overcome  racism  and promote equality.  The  final  stage  is  that of direct action.  ""Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such  creative  tension  that a community  that has  constantly  refused  to negotiate  is  f creed  to  confront the issue,"" said Dr. King. Neglect of  civil  rights  in America  is something  that we  had to confront during King's lifetime and it is  something  that we must confront now. The  issue and threat is as real now as it was then.  For, as Dr. King observed, ""injustice anywhere  is a threat to justice everywhere."" I am fright ened by a complacency and a dullness that  seems to have settled across America. Now,  more  than ever, we must heed Dr. King's  advice that ""we must use time creatively, and  forever realize that the time is always ripe to  do right. Now  is  the  time  to make  real  the  promise of democracy,  and  transform  our  pending national elegy  into a creative psalm  of brotherhood.""  In conclusion, I would like to share with you  a few remarks from the Reverend Boesak. ""I  am convinced that there is another America.  An America that remembers its own struggle,  that cherishes  its  freedom and dignity,  that  therefore understands  the aspirations of an  unfree people. An America that lives up to the  ideals of  injustice and equality so  jealously  guarded by your constitution and so preciously  held  in  the hearts of your people.""  It is this  America that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. envi sioned. Let us gather  the courage,  integrity  and commitment to make his dream a reality  for all Americans.  ",1986
1,28,1,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I take  this op portunity to commend Representative MICKEY  LELAND, chairman of the Congressional Black  Caucus, for taking the special order to honor  a great American, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Dr. King's vision of America at its best-a  land of equality, fairness, and compassion for  all of its citizens-and his unyielding devotion  to  nonviolent  protest  (while  facing  death  threats, jail, and ugly verbal abuse and physical brutality) helped lead our Nation through a  turbulent, but necessary, period of growth.  This past Monday, our country of rich and  diverse cultures came  together to honor Dr.  King's memory and rekindle its commitment to  making his dream a reality. This national trib ute was  long overdue.  In 1968, shortly after  Dr. King's death,  I sponsored a bill  to desig nate a national holiday in his honor; 18 years  passed before a day was set aside to honor  his birth.  I am also pleased to note that I am cospon soring legislation with Senator FRANK LAUTEN BERG  to name  the planned Federal  court house in Newark after Dr. King.  However,  our  celebration  of Dr.  King's  legacy is tempered by the sobering fact that  for many Americans, his dream has not yet  become a reality: The gap between rich and  poor  grows  dangerously wider  each  day;  blacks continue  to  suffer disproportionately  high unemployment and infant mortality rates;  the  future  of  essential  social  services  is  threatened  by Gramm-Rudman  and  other  budget-slashing schemes;  the Department of  Justice  is working  to  turn  the clock back on  civil rights gains of the last three decades.  Let us join together to honor the memory of  this great man by carrying on his work.  Dr. King's dream was a dream of social, po litical, and economic justice  for all. He dedi cated his  life  to securing a society  that will  judge its citizens not by the color of their skin,  but by  the quality of their character and  the  contents of their minds. The civil rights  laws  guaranteeing  equal  opportunity  and  equal  rights would be legacy enough for most great  men. But not for Dr. King. For his  is also a  legacy of hope and promise that bigotry will  be erased, justice will be served, and human  rights will be  respected  in  this country and  throughout  the world.  In  1975,  I  told  the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference:  They  shot  down  the man-and  they  snuffed out his  life-but  they could not  shoot down his dream. For his dream was  stronger than life and more powerful than  death. And the dream lives on.  Let us join together to honor the memory of  this great American by working for the realiza tion of his dream.  ",1986
2,28,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  thank my distinguished colleague, the gentle man  from Texas  [Mr. LELAND]  for  reserving  this special order so that Members can partici pate  in  the observance of  the  first Federal  holiday enacted in honor of a black American.  That black American was Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., whose young life was snuffed out by  an assassin's bullet almost 18 years ago.  Mr. Speaker, much has been written; much  has been said; and many events have been  conducted  in  the  last month  relative  to Dr.  King and this new Federal holiday. Each event  has focused on the monumental contributions  and achievements of Dr. King on behalf of not  just black Americans but for all Americans.  This historic occasion is a time for America  to pause and memorialize, to perpetuate, and  pay tribute to a man whose greatness was es tablished  through his  leadership of a move ment which  pricked  the  conscience  of  a  nation and changed the course of history. But  more  than  that,  the holiday  is a time  for all  ",1986
3,41,1,Mr. CONYERS.,"  I  thank my  col league  from Maryland  [Mr. HOYER]  whose  eloquence  humbles me,  and  who is very generous in his praise for  me.  I happen to know that your partici pation  in  this measure  across  the  years was not inconsiderable, and that  he led in many of the activities in the  House and in the other body which ul timately  led  to  its passage when so  many of our colleagues to that over whelming vote that occurred on that  day in 1983.  I am also impressed by your sense of  history not simply civil rights history,  but our history. Every year when I  begin to think I have just about taken  in all that I can, and that I have a fair  knowledge of our historical underpin nings, each year reveals other rich in formation, sparkling jewels of history,  incidents, facts that were not known  to me all of these years before. So this  education and reeducation of mine my  colleagues and of America continues  because this celebration is very impor tant for this reason.  I do not know what forces lent their  way upon you to help form the feel ings that led to the energies that you  contributed to the bill, sir, that I can  tell you  that  in addition  to Martin  himself, there were two that were very  close  to me. First,  there was Rosa  Parks, whom  you mentioned. Rosa  Parks has been with me every step of  my  congressional  career. Can  you  imagine what an enormous, incredible  force to have a saintly person like this  impacting upon an unpredictable and  ",1986
4,54,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  clerk will call the roll.  ,1986
5,158,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Reading at the top  of page 2, the Assistant Attorney Gen eral says:  Based on  the  information we have ob tained to date, including but not limited to  the recent Preliminary Report of the De partment's  independent  consultant, R.L.  Banks and Associates,  it does not appear  that the proposed divestiture will establish  a rail carrier in the designated carrier capa ble of providing long-term viable competi tive service.  The Assistant Attorney General goes  on  to raise questions about the ade quacy of the divestiture proposal. Mr.  President, I for one would be very in terested to see an earlier draft of that  letter if that is in accordance with the  Department  of  Justice  practices.  I  would like to see how strong the lan guage was. We are now finding in Jan uary of 1986 that a month ago the De partment of Justice said these very se rious problems may have been correct ed. Well, how could they have been  corrected? What did the Assistant At torney General say in his draft letter  of September 25? The Judiciary Com mittee has not concluded  its hear ings-we  just had  the  informal  inquiry-and these would be questions  that  this Senator would  raise. Why  should we sweep this under the rug?  Why should we be asked to pass upon  this issue about an antitrust problem  when these questions have been raised  by the chairman of this very  impor tant subcommittee of  the House of  Representatives? If the Senator from  Missouri believes that this is raising a  sour note, then I have to disagree cate gorically with him. I think this is an  issue of utmost materiality and utmost  importance, and it is our job in the  United States Senate  to  find  those  facts before we are asked to make a  conclusion and/or  to  reach  a  judg ment. I think perhaps it is most significant  to  consider what  the  distin guished chairman of the Senate Com merce Committee did not say, as op posed to what he did say. He picked an  alleged sour note by Senator METZ ENBA UM, an alleged sour note on this  inquiry, but he did not deal with the  substance  of  the  ICC  staff  report  which found a violation of the anti trust laws.  The  chairman  of  the Commerce  Committee, the Senator from Missou ri, did not deal with the conclusions of  the Banks study which found insuffi cient stature by Guilford, Pittsburgh,  and Lake Erie to provide competition.  The Senator from Missouri did not  deal with the parallel of the Southern  Pacific-Santa Fe merger. If that pro posal violates the antitrust laws, then  certainly the Conrail-Norfolk  joinder  violates the antitrust laws.  The Senator  from Missouri dealt  very briefly with the question of the  viability of Conrail, and I would ref er  to the USRA finding:  The agency established by Congress  to  oversee Conrail's operation concluded in a  staff report reviewing the financial outlook  for an independent Conrail back on July 29,  1985, that ""All available evidence supports a  finding that Conrail can generate positive  cash flow for the foreseeable future. Traffic  shortfalls compared to the forecasts should  not threaten Conrail's survival as  long as  the rail regulatory fare work is unchanged  allowing service to be shaped to meet the  demands of the market. By the end of this  year Conrail will have been profitable for 5  years. It has been reasonably and credibly  forecast  to be profitable  through  the  re mainder of this decade. While there can be  no absolute certainty it might have a fore cast, to require more evidence from Conrail  of its likely reliability will impose an unrea sonable burden of proof on  that opposi tion.""  Mr. President, it must be noted that  Conrail has  sustained extraordinary  profits: In 1981, $39 million;  in 1982,  $174 million; in 1983, $313 million; in  1984, $500 million;  in 1985, $440 mil lion. The 1985 figure came at a  time  when traffic was down somewhat, and  I believe  there were extra payments  made to labor. But I think the viabili ty of Conrail has been established.  Mr.  President,  I  know  the  hour  grows late and there is an inclination  to adjourn the Senate at this moment.  But I conclude by expressing the hope  that the important issues projected in  Senate bill 638 will  receive adequate  consideration by this body.  Senator METZENBAUM wants to know  if he can go home. Yes, we can. But  these issues require analysis. The De partment of Justice has not made that  analysis. The  Interstate Commerce  Commission has not made that analy sis. The Senate Judiciary Committee  has not made that analysis. It is up to  the Senate to do so, and we ought not  to shorten the time. We ought not to  impose cloture.  I  thank the Chair and I yield the  floor.  ",1986

13,158,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, on  January  17,  1986, Ambassador Do brynin of the Soviet Union formally  presented  to me,  in my capacity as  President pro  tempore of  the U.S.  Senate, a message addressed  to  the  Congress from the U.S.S.R. Supreme  Soviet. This document urges Congress  to accept the nuclear weapons propos al which was previously submitted by  Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev  on January 15, 1986.  Ambassador Dobrynin and I had a  constructive meeting. We  discussed  our hopes of  improved  communica tions between our nations based on  the  recent Geneva  summit. As  a  member of the bipartisan Senate dele gation which  traveled  to  the Soviet  Union last September, I told Ambassa dor Dobrynin that General Secretary  Gorbachev and  I had discussed  the  need for cooperation between our na tions. I  told Gorbachev last Septem ber, and reemphasized to Ambassador  Dobrynin,  that  just as our nations  stood together to defeat the Nazis in  World War II, we should work togeth er today for the cause of world peace.  We both agreed that annual summit  meetings would greatly assist in nor malizing  the  relations  between our  countries.  We  also  discussed President Rea gan's Strategic Defense  Initiative.  I  told Ambassador Dobrynin  that  I  would urge President Reagan to stand  firm on this important defense plan.  It is my belief that the path for con structive  dialog  and  proposals  for  peace should always  remain open.  I  told Ambassador Dobrynin  that  I  looked forward to studying this latest  Soviet arms  reduction proposal and  making the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet  ",1986

15,197,1,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, Laurie Brown,  of Coon Rapids, MN, a Minneapolis suburb,  completed a 2-year Peace Corps assignment  in the Philippines in 1985.  Her experience, in the town of Matag-ob, in  Leyte Province, was  typical  of  the Peace  Corps. The work was hard, the privations were  many, the pay was poor.  Often she found that when she could help  to make life better for the people with whom  she worked, it was in ways which had little re lationship  to her skills and education. Other  assets,  like adaptability, patience,  courtesy,  judgment, and love were often more important  than training.  When her  time was up,  the people with  whom she worked drew a resolution of thanks  to Laurie Brown. It calls her an ""Ambassador  of Goodwill,"" cites her good work, and desig nates her as a ""true daughter of our Barangay  of San Sebastian.""  Laurie's unique experience has left her with  more than a flowery resolution. She also has  a heart full of memories,  lots of friends, new  self-reliance, and a sense of real accomplish ment.  Laurie Brown and her friends in San Sebas tian Barangay are not the only ones to profit  from the past 2 years, however. The really big  winners are  the people of the United States  who sent her, and who annually send hun dreds of Americans all over the world to prove  that  the United States  is not only a great  country, but a good one as well.  Laurie Brown's resolution follows:  REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PROVINCE OF  LEYTE, MUNICIPALITY OF MATAG-OB, BGY.  SAN SEBASTIAN  To all to whom these presents shall come:  We,  the undersigned signatories, all citi zens of the Republic of the Philippines and  all residents particularly of Barangay San  Sebastian, of the Municipality of Matag-ob,  Province of Leyte, Philippines, by virtue of  this simple document do hereby by these  presents express our heartfelt feelings of  gratitude and warmest regards to the Good  People of America <the United States of  America) through its Peace Corps Volunteer  Program for the show of genuine, deep and  sincere concern over our welfare, we who  are otherwise known and classified, as the  ""poor, impoverished, ignorant, suffering or  miserable"", segments on our Philippine So ciety, by way of having made available in  our midst for almost two <2> years, one of  their truest Ambassadors of Goodwill in the  person of Miss Lorie Brown, who despite our  shortcomings and ways of life have stead fastly withstood the rigors of our economic  conditions <depressed, distressed and under served), in the process of letting us awaken  once more to the realities that regardless of  how little we are in life, the Good People of  the United States of America do whole heartedly consider us, as a true brother and  sister.

16,210,1,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the memory of  the members of  the  101 st Airborne who lost their lives on Decem ber 12, 1985 in the service of their country.  When loved ones answer the call to duty in  the face of danger, we are wont to know both  pride and fear. Whether they be soldiers serv ing in distant lands, or police patrolling neigh borhood streets, we are all too aware of their  vulnerability. We are heartened by their cour age, but we are also anxious for their return.  Knowing what we may, when tragedy is vis ited,  the grief is no  less. And so it is for the  families of the 248 fine young soldiers whose  in e quiet,  mission of peace ended abruptly  snow covered field in Gander, Newfoundland.  Our hearts go out to  the  loved ones who  grieve  the untimely  loss of these brave sol diers. Though  it does  little  to  lessen  the  sorrow of  their  loss,  I know  I join with  the  entire country in expressing my deep sympa thy to each family. While we will never know  what  accomplishments  they  might  have  achieved had  they  lived, we will always  re member the cause  for which  they served so  proudly.  TRIBUTE TO ELLIE GRAHAM  HON. CARL D. PURSELL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 21, 1986  ",1986
17,210,1,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to  take  this opportunity to pause and comment  on the career of a woman from my hometown  of Plymouth-Ellie Graham.  Mrs. Graham is retiring from her work at the  Observer & Eccentric Newspapers this month  and I believe it fitting to comment on her out standing work and dedication as a community  journalist.  Mrs. Graham went to work at the Observer  Newspapers in May of 1967. Then headquar tered in Plymouth, she was no stranger to the  community-having  raised  her  family  there  and having been active in Plymouth events.  Ellie spent most of her time working on the  central  copy  desk  until  1976, when  she  became the suburban life editor of the Plym outh edition. This was a natural  role  for a  woman who already was  involved with  the  Plymouth Symphony,  the Plymouth Historical  Society, Plymouth Fall Festival, and other or ganizations.  The distinguishing part of Mrs. Graham's  work is her dedication to the community and  the people who live there.  It is rare to find a  community  journalist who,  beyond  writing  about a town's people and their events, takes  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the  time  to  truly care about  them. And be cause of that, Mrs. Graham has had a positive  impact on the Plymouth community.  But beyond that, I believe it bears mention ing  that  this appreciation  for an American  town and American people comes  from one  who was born and raised in a different coun try. Mrs. Graham  is a proud citizen of our  neighbor to the north, Canada.  I would like to join with the people from my  hometown in congratulating Ellie on her retire ment. It truly is to our benefit that years ago a  schoolteacher from Essex County decided to  cross  the Detroit River and make her  resi dence in Michigan.  BTX'S: A THREAT TO HEALTH  AND THE ETHANOL INDUSTRY  HON. DOUG BEREUTER  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 21, 1986  ",1986
18,210,1,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation that will prohibit oil refin ers  from  introducing benzene,  toluene, and  xylene, commonly known  in  the  industry as  BTX's,  into commercial gasoline.  I introduce  this  legislation for two primary reasons: One,  is environmental; the other is economic.  From an environmental standpoint, all of us  are aware  that the Environmental Protection  Agency  has mandated  that oil  companies  phase out the use of lead as an octane en hancer  in gasoline. The EPA mandated  this  phaseout because  it has been determined  that lead is a toxin and that its use in gasoline  is detrimental to both air quality and individual  health.  The EPA lead phaseout has left oil compa nies with two basic alternatives for increasing  the octane level in the production of gasoline.  One is the use of ethanol manufactured from  agricultural products such as grain or sugar  cane. The other  is  the use of one or more  BTX's-benzene, toluene, or xylene. The first  is a clean and efficient method for increasing  the  octane  ratings  in  gasoline. The  other  raises potentially serious health consequences  for Americans because benzene  is a proven  carcinogen and  toluene and xylene are sus pected carcinogens.  Because BTX's are naturally present in gas oline and a by product of petroleum refining,  the major oil companies during the past year  have tended  to invest in  the development of  STX facilities rather than turn to ethanol as an  octane enhancer for gasoline. The increased  use of BTX's, however, raises several poten tial health concerns. The carcinogenic conse quences of BTX's are currently being investi gated by EPA, OSHA, and other Federal and  State agencies. Recent cancer biopsies from  animal studies show that benzene causes leu kemia, and a variety of other cancers includ ing  lymphoid cancers, cancers of  the skin,  ovary, oral cavity lip, tongue,  lung, and mam mary gland.  While it appears that the regulation of BTX's  would have positive health benefits, it is also  apparent  that  their  limitation, or even com plete phaseout, would have positive economic  consequences  for our depressed agricultural  January 21, 1986  economy. A recent report by the Congression al Research Service shows  that  the United  States uses nearly 11 O billion gallons of gaso line annually. Assuming a 10-percent alcohol  mixture, CRS estimates that 11 billion gallons  of alcohol would then be required. At 2.55 gal lons per bushel, 4.3 billion bushels of grain  would be needed to manufacture this amount  of alcohol. Thus, 40 percent of the grain har vest of the United States could potentially be  utilized to supplement our Nation's automotive  fuel supply.  While  it may be many years before  this  amount of grain is put to use in the production  of alcohol,  there  is already a proven market  for ethanol in the United States with a tremen dous potential  for  future growth.  Increased  ethanol usage  in  recent years has already  proven  to be an  important market  for corn  producers. Between  1980 and  1985,  corn  used  in production of ethanol  rose  from 16  million to nearly 200 million bushels annually.  With  the phaseout of lead as an octane en hancer in gasoline, the potential exists for the  amount of corn used  in ethanol  refining  to  double, or even possible triple, over the next  few years.  In  light of our current huge surpluses of  grain, ethanol production  is a safe, efficient  and economical means of utilizing excess ag ricultural products. The use of corn in ethanol  production also helps to increase farm income  and  reduce  the cost of Federal  farm pro grams. However, if oil refiners are allowed to  manufacture and use BTX's on an economi cally large scale, then ethanol will cease to be  a viable alternative to lead as an octane en hancer and a market for surplus grain produc tion.  The legislation which I am introducing today  is a simple, straightforward means  to both  protect public health and  insure a future  for  our developing ethanol  refining  industry. My  bill would prohibit any petroleum refiner from  introducing benzene,  tolulene, or xylene  into  gasoline  for  the  purpose of  increasing  its  octane  ratings. Naturally occuring BTX's al ready present in gasoline would be limited to  the following amounts: benzine-1 percent to lulene-3 percent and xylene-3 percent by  weight.  I urge all my colleagues who are concerned  about the environmental health consequences  of BTX's and the future of the ethanol industry  to support this legislation.  HONORING BERTRAND E.  STEW ART, JR.  HON. VIC FAZIO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 21, 1986  ",1986
19,210,1,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay  tribute to a good friend and outstanding civil  servant, Mr. Bert Stewart, Jr. After nearly four  decades of distinguished service in the Feder al work  force, Bert retired on December 31,  1985.  Bert enjoyed an exemplary career as a civil  servant. His 38 years of service featured nu merous honors that highlight the outstanding  contributions he has made to our Nation.  In",1986
20,223,1,Mr.  SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  Members are still reeling from the rev elations as to what they are going to  have to go through with the Gramm Rudman law particularly the cuts in  important programs for our cities, for  people in need, and for the environ ment. Nevertheless, today's New York  Times says President Reagan will seek  $100 million  in aid  for  the Contras  who are seeking the overthrow of the  Nicaraguan Government.  if  that were  not  chutzpah  enough, an article  last week  in  the  Washington Times says: ""Reagan  to  ask Hill for broad war powers."" And I  am now quoting:  As  President Reagan will ask Congress for a  resolution, similar to that passed in 1964 fol lowing the Gulf of Tonkin incident, to em power the executive branch to use ""what ever military force is required"" to deal swift ly and effectively with the terrorist threat,  a senior administration official said.  I  suppose  the theory  is  that Con gress,  having  abdicated  its  fiscal  powers, might now be prepared to ab dicate its war powers. If so, then we  might as well go home, just turn ev erything over to the geniuses of the  Pentagon and the OMB, and declare  that we are no longer a democratic Re public but a nation ruled by one man  and his hand-picked bureaucrats.  D 1515  WE OUGHT  TO BE WORKING  TOGETHER  IN A BIPARTISAN  SPIRIT  TO  DO WHAT  THE  AMERICAN  PEOPLE  WANT:  BALANCE THE BUDGET  <Mr. WALKER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1986
21,223,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, every  bit of data that we have makes clear  that the American people want  the  budget balanced. Many would have  you believe that there is no difference  between the two great political parties  on this issue. Oh, really? Let us look at  the record.  When the law was passed requiring a  balanced budget, a majority of Demo crats, mostly  liberals, voted against  the balanced budget law. A majority of  Republicans voted for it. The first call  in this House to repeal the balanced  budget  law came  from a Democrat.  When the court suit was filed trying  to gut the balanced budget law, it was  filed by mostly Democrats. It is  the  Democrats in this House who are sug gesting stonewalling the budget proc ess in order to undermine the balanced  budget law. It sounds like some pretty  wide differences between the two par ties on this crucial issue, and my guess  is that as the year unfolds, the differ ences will become even wider.  We ought to be working together in  a  bipartisan  spirit  to do what  the  American people want: Balance  the  budget. But that is not what is shap ing up in this House.  OUR HUGE DEFICIT REQUIRES  CUTS  IN  SPENDING AND  IN CREASES IN TAXES  <Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
22,223,1,Mr.  TRAFICANT.," Mr.  Speaker,  during the last Presidential election,  Walter Mondale said, ""I will have to  raise taxes and I am telling you the  truth."" Reagan will too, only he will  not tell you.  Although the President still declares  that there will be no  taxes, even he  now recognizes that this huge deficit  will require both cuts in spending and  increases  in  revenue  that should be  fair and should target those who pay  little or no taxes.  Gramm-Rudman, our current plan,  is flawed from a constitutional, an eco nomic standpoint, and a human stand point. If we allow it to continue, de pressed areas like mine will  literally  collapse. We have suffered from this  administration while they continue to  boast of a growing economy. An econo my  that  I  term  now  ""supply-side  suffer."" It is time for Congress, man dated by constitutional law,  to make  the tough decisions that we were elect ed to make, to take that bold action.  We cannot  avoid our  responsibility  any longer; we must raise revenue and  we must cut spending.  Finally, I remember in an election 6  years ago where one candidate called  the other as having policies of voodoo  economics. If we fail now to do what is  mandated by the Constitution, we will  put another $500 billion of debt on the  backs of the people of this country.  WAS IT THE CONGRESS' FAULT?  ABSOLUTELY YES  <Mr. MACK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
23,223,1,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker,  to speak  about flaws, I think the question that  is  going  through many Members'  minds today or yesterday is how did  we get from the $171.9 billion deficit  that we claimed was going to occur as  a result of the budget resolution that  was passed just last August? $171.9 bil lion, and the projection today is $220  billion. How did we get there? Was it  the President's fault? I do not think  so. Was it the Congress' fault? Abso lutely yes.  When you  look at what occurred,  there is an increase in the size of that  deficit of roughly $45  to $49 billion.  Where did it come from? Yes. Part of  it came from the fact that we grew at  a  level slightly  lower  than what we  had projected  in  the budget  resolu tion; about $13 billion.  But the balance of it, $32.7 billion,  came because the Congress failed  to  carry out its own budget resolution.  Flaws? You better believe  there are  flaws. Flaws in our ability to live with  the practices that we have established  in saying that we are going to live with  our own budget resolutions.  I mentioned lower economic growth,  but how about failure to enact the rev enue increases called for in the budget  resolution itself? How about the allo cation of $6.3 billion  in unobligated  funds for pay raises for the military?  Failure  to enact military retirement  reform called for in the budget resolu tion of $2.8 billion. Faster payout in  the defense budget. Enacting the farm  legislation which  actually  increases  outlays in 1986 of $4 to $5 billion over  the budget resolution. Lower prices re quired higher payouts under the bill.  The end result is that we failed to  pass a  reconciliation bill; about an other $8 billion. The point that I am  making is that Congress failed to carry  out its responsibility last year, and if  there is one major argument that says  that the Gramm-Rudman bill should  have been passed, it is this data that I  have now placed into the RECORD.  FIRST-TIME ECONOMIC AID TO  NORTHERN IRELAND  <Mr. BIAGGI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986

47,262,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, on  January 30, 1986, a group of very dedi cated people are coming together at  the Liberty High School  in Bethle hem, PA, for a very special concert  where  the Oscar Mayer Corp. will  present a donation of $250,000 for the  restoration of the Statue of Liberty.  This event is  the culmination of a  project begun in January 1984, by Mr.  Constantine ""Gus"" Loupos, a  teacher  at Liberty, who has been very instru mental  in  leading  students  of  the  Bethlehem Area School District in an  effort to raise money for the Statue of  Liberty's refurbishment.  So far, Mr. Loupos and his students  in  the Bethlehem area have  raised  some $30,000 for this effort. According  to recent news reports, these students  have raised more than any other stu dents in the country.  As an  incentive  for  the pupils  to  become  involved  in raising funds for  Miss Liberty, the Oscar Mayer Corp.  offered to donate 25 cents for every  dollar raised by schoolchildren across  the Nation.  Oscar Mayer has chosen  to honor  the Bethlehem School District for the  amount of money it has raised and for  the enthusiasm, commitment and in volvement of  the people  involved  in  this fundraising effort.  At this time, Mr. President, I would  personally  like  to  recognize Mr.  Loupos, his students, and those in the  Bethlehem area who all have worked  so  tirelessly on  this most  important  project.  I would  like  to  thank Ms.  Jean  Cowden of the Oscar Mayer Corp. for  honoring the Bethlehem School Dis trict, and also Ms. Sheila McCauley,  director  of  the Liberty Centennial  School Campaign for her exemplary  work on this campaign.  As we all know, the Statue of Liber ty is symbolic of the ideals on which  this Nation was founded.  To  have  our  schoolchildren-the  future of our Nation-undertake such  an endeavor as to raise $30,000 for the  Statue of Liberty is most impressive.  I  am  indeed proud of all of  the  people who have sacrificed their time  to donate their services for  this no blest of causes.  THE BEST FOOTBALL TEAM  IN  AMERICA: THE UNIVERSITY OF  OKLAHOMA  ",1986
48,262,1,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, it is  my pleasure to take this opportunity  to  congratulate  the University  of  Oklahoma  football  team and coach  Barry Switzer for winning their sixth  national championship on New Year's  Day.  The Sooners won by beating previ ously-unbeaten and No. 1 Penn State,  25 to 10, in the Orange Bowl.  Coach  Switzer  certainly  deserves  special recognition as this win brings  to three the number of national cham pionships he has won. He has brought  great distinction to the Sooner foot ball team, the University of Oklaho ma, and our State. He is the winning est coach in college football.  Coach Switzer also won the national  title in 1974 and 1975. The University  of Oklahoma also secured the national  title  in 1950,  1955, and 1956 under  Coach Bud Wilkinson.  Of course, the credit must be shared  with  the  fine  young  athletes who  make up the Sooners' team. Their bril liant teamwork and dogged determina tion  against  a  tough Nittany Lion  team made the national championship  possible.  Among  some  of  the  Orange Bowl statistics:  noteworthy  the best  Lydell Carr's rushing total was  against Penn State in a Bowl game;  Tim Lasher set an Orange Bowl record for  most field goals kicked, he was successful on  four attempts;  Tim also set a record for most points ever  kicked against Penn State, 13.  I would  also  like  to congratulate  Penn State and Joe Paterno for their  excellent season. They are a good foot ball organization with a  lot of pride  and tradition. Knowing that they are  an outstanding  team makes  the OU  victory that much more significant.  My  compliments  to Coach Barry  Switzer and the best football team in  America: the University of Oklahoma.  UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  ",1986
49,262,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  today,  January 22, 1986, marks the 68th anni versary  of Ukrainian  Independence  Day. To millions of people in Ukraine,  and  to  the  thousands of Ukrainian  Americans  in Ohio  and  across  the  Nation, it is a day of special signifi cance. On January 22, 1918 the inde pendent republic was proclaimed. And  while it endured but 3 short years, it is  extremely important that this day and  what it represents never be forgotten.  Ordinarily,  the commemoration of  an independence day is a cause for joy  and celebration. But in this particular  instance, there can be no such joy, and  no such celebration.

51,275,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1986
52,275,1,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  would like to speak on the subject of  Conrail.  I  oppose  the  sale  in  its  present form and hope that we can  find an alternative method of selling it  which will  provide  competition.  I  would  like  to  recount  some of  the  struggles that I have had in getting an  answer from the Justice Department  about  the antitrust  impact, and dis cuss the regional railroad issue as it  pertains to the Midwest and other re gions of the country.  About a year ago, I raised a number  of questions  in  the Commerce, Sci ence, and Transportation Committee  regarding the antitrust issue. Of spe cial concern to me was the fact that  the Pittman analysis had been used by  the Justice Department  in advising  the  ICC,  the  Interstate Commerce  Commission, regarding the Santa Fe/  Southern Pacific merger in the west ern part of  the United States. The  Pittman analysis was a Department of  Justice method for analyzing the anti competitive  impact  of  a  railroad  merger that was developed by a De partment of  Justice  economist, Dr.  Russell Pittman. The Pittman meth odology was used by the Department  of Justice in its study of the Sante Fe/  Southern Pacific merger, which it op poses as anticompetitive.  However,  the  Justice Department  used a different economic analysis re garding the Conrail sale. And I asked a  number of pointed questions to which  I was promised answers, which I have  never received. Subsequently, I wrote  and other Senators wrote, and there  were long delays in getting an answer  on the antitrust issues or in getting an  adequate explanation of why one eco nomic model had been used to analyze  the Santa Fe/Southern Pacific merger  in  the western part of  the United  States but the same Justice Depart ment, the same people, used a differ ent analysis  in  the Conrail/Norfolk  Southern study.  Following my remarks today I will  insert for the record additional materi als which explain the differences be tween  these different methodologies  and describe their significance in more  detail.  Subsequently,  I asked a nationally  well-known  private  transportation  firm, Rubie Associates, to analyze the  Norfolk  Southern/Conrail  merger  using the Pittman analysis in exactly  the same way it was applied  in the  Santa Fe/Southern Pacific merger.  When that was done there were quite  different  results,  especially  as  the  issue relates to the impact on regional  railroads and on regional shippers.  Thus, to me, as I look at it from my  part  of  the  country-and  I  think  throughout the West and the Midwest  and the South-a key issue is the issue  of regional railroads or regional truck ing  firms or regional  transportation  groups connecting into a Conrail mo nopoly.  I believe  that much of  the  debate thus far has centered on the  amount offered in the sale, whether  more money  can be gotten out of  Morgan Stanley or another offer, and  what the tax advantages and disadvan tages are. But to the United States as  a whole there is a real issue at gate ways-that is, where a smaller railroad  connects with a bigger one-with traf fic  diversion  problems,  and  other  issues relating to the anticompetition  aspects of  this merger. And  that  is  true of smaller regional and short-line  railroads across the United States.  When we passed the Staggers Rail  Act deregulation paved  the way for  some fundamental changes in the rail road industry. Many of those changes  have proved to be wise, but some have  proved to be not so wise. But we did  breathe life into railroads that prob ably would not be here today without  it. Many of those same railroads will  experience severe financial setbacks if  the  Norfolk  Southern  bid  goes  through. We will essentially wipe out  many of the good things Staggers pro vided. And I,  for one, get especially  concerned when  those railroads that  will be set back are operating in my  State. For the Chicago & North West ern, and many others, this transaction  would be one giant  step backward  from the advances made over the past  few years.  When S. 638 was before the Com merce Committee, I offered an amend ment that would have given some pro tection to the regional railroads.  It was my feeling at the time that  some of the railroads were getting spe cial agreements with Norfolk South ern  in  return  for key support. The  amendment was an attempt to treat  all of the regional and small railroads  equally. On the morning of the vote,  the Department  of Transportation  and the Norfolk Southern circulated  letters stating that negotiations were  underway with the other small rail roads  and  hinted  that  agreements  were close to being reached. This, of  course, was not the case and none of  these railroads concerns were ever ad dressed.  In  addition,  an  amendment was  viewed and ref erred to by the Depart ment of Transportation as an attempt  to repeal parts of the Staggers Act,  and a reinstitution of regulation. My  amendment was defeated in the Com merce Committee.  Subsequently, weeks  and months  passed. And the Justice Department of  Transportation  still  did  not  come  through with specific answers on the  antitrust area. I  think my colleagues  from Pennsylvania did an excellent  job yesterday outlining some of those  unanswered antitrust questions. They  go  to the heart of my concern with  this sale.  I would like to see the Government  get out of  the  railroad business.  I  think  private  enterprise  can  do  a  better job of running this railroad. I  also think that we are in an era where  we will see prosperity of the railroads  again. I am seeing prosperity on the  short-line railroads that feed into the  major railroads.  So progress  is being made. But a  great mistake that we could make is to  allow a monopolistic carrier take con trol of the east coast. That is precisely  what the sale of Conrail to Norfolk  Southern would do.  As we  look  around  the United  States, I  think it is  important to re member  that  the  trucking  industry  and  the  railroad  industry are both  very  important  in  terms of moving  grain,  timber, machinery, and prod ucts of all sorts. There is a strong feel ing that we should preserve the rail road lines and indeed strengthen them  in many  cases. But  this will  not  happen if we have a monopoly carrier  east of the Mississippi.  I believe I could say there is almost  unanimous agreement among the ship pers,  regional  railroads,  and  labor  groups west of the Mississippi that the  Conrail sale in its present form should  not go  forward because of the anti trust questions, because of the gate way  and  traffic diversion problems,  and because of the prices that will be  charged or could be charged by this  monopolistic carrier. There will not be  competition.  Earlier this year I pleaded with the  Department  of  Transportation  to  come up with some kind of a gateway  agreement or diversion, with some as surances so that we could be in a situa tion where there could be assurances  to regional railroads, in the West, and  in the South, and in the Midwest-as surances that these smaller railroads  would not be subject to predatory pric ing  practices. No  agreements were  forthcoming.  It is  for  that reason  that I  shall  off er an amendment when and if we  proceed to that stage of this debate.  Let me say I am one of those Sena tors who  tomorrow at 1 o'clock will  not be voting for cloture because I be lieve that until we have this funda mental answer on antitrust we should  not go forward.  That is not said in any obstructionist  way. I have not, during my time in the  Senate or in the House, engaged in fili buster tactics. I have not engaged in  obstructionist  tactics.  Perhaps  one  should do more of that kind of thing  around here. But I have not done so  because of a firm belief that the proc ess should work, and we should go for ward. But in this case, the Department  of Transportation and the Justice De",1986
53,288,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  Senator GLENN has m~de a most com prehensive statement. I do not agree  with  it, of course, but I do want to  compliment him for the care and the  attention he has given  this  issue.  I  would take exception to several of his  conclusions.  Repeatedly, the Senator from Ohio  characterized what we are doing as a  rush to judgment. I do not believe that  that is a  reasonable characterization  of this bill. In fact, it is the very oppo site of a rush to judgment. The proc ess of selling Conrail did not begin a  month or two ago and it did not begin  a year or two ago. It began in 1981  when Congress  decided,  in  the  so called NERSA bill, that we would sell  Conrail. That set in motion a process  which led us to where we are today.  As part of that process, the Depart ment of Transportation first hired a  consultant, Goldman Sachs, then so licited bids from over 100 possible bid ders for Conrail, then received 15 dif ferent bids and screened them.  The Norfolk Southern proposal was  put  together approximately 2 years  ago and was submitted to the Depart ment of Transportation on June 19,  1984. It has been studied and restudied  by the executive branch and by the  Congress not for a few weeks or a few  months, but since June 19, 1984.  The Department of Transportation  has studied this question comprehen sively,  the Treasury Department has  studied it, and the Justice Department  has studied it. The Assistant Attorney  General in charge of the Antitrust Di vision, Mr. Ginsburg, testified before  the  Judiciary  Committee  that  no  other acquisition of this type, no other  acquisition that he knows of, has re ceived the kind of comprehensive at tention and the kind of time that the  Conrail proposal has received.  That is what the Assistant Attorney  General tells us.  With respect to whether or not this  is premature, the Justice Department  has studied  this, and  they say  that  they do not see  the antitrust prob lems. Their concerns have been satis fied. The Assistant Attorney General  in charge of the Antitrust Division has  said to the Congress go ahead. Do not  delay any further. Yes, we have a con sultant hired. What is the reason for  the consultant to be hired? To review  the factual bases on which the Justice  Department reached its conclusion in  the nature of, as Assistant Attorney  General Ginsburg put it, dotting the  i's and crossing the t's.  It is the nature of a closing at the  end of a transaction to make sure that  all the facts are as represented.  Furthermore, we have provided  in  the legislation, and also in the memo randum  of  intent  between Norfolk  Southern  and  the Department  of  Transportation, that if at the end the  Justice Department turns out not to  be satisfied, then the Department of  Justice has veto power over this trans action-veto power.  Mr. President, I do not know of any  other case  in history where the De partment of Justice has been given  veto power for a  railroad merger. It  does have it in this case.  If we act-if we pass the legislation still  the Department of Justice has  veto power if its antitrust concerns are  not in fact met by the technical review  that will be made.  The Senator from Ohio, senior Sena tor from Ohio, said, well, why rush?  There  is  no  hurry. Mr. President,  there  is a hurry. There  is a hurry.  What is the hurry? Norfolk Southern  made a good-faith offer based on a so licitation of bids made by the Depart",1986

A bill to eliminate or change  statutory requirements preventing the  reduction of paperwork burdens and  regulatory simplification; to the Com mittee on Governmental Affairs.  PAPERWORK AND REGULATORY SIMPLIFICATION  ACT  This bill is intended to eliminate or  change a number of statutory provi sions requiring executive branch agen cies to impose information collections  on the public and to issue regulations.  The  Office  of Management  and  Budget advises  that these provisions  are now either obsolete or no longer  serve useful purposes. This bill is Gov ernmentwide in scope in that statuto ry  provIS1ons  administrated  by  a  number of departments and agencies  are  being processed  for  change or  elimination. The bill  represents  the  administration's first attempt to seek  such changes on a Governmentwide  basis. According  to OMB,  the provi sions contained in the bill will, if en acted, result in improvement in overall  Government efficiency and will elimi nate  unnecessary  burdens  on  the  public. As the administration contin ues its activities under the Paperwork  Reduction Act, it expects to identify  statutory  requirements  that  impose  unnecesary burdens on the public, and  will bring these to the attention of the  Congress.  Examples of existing statutory pro visions affected by this legislation in clude a decennial census of drainage,  the establishment of a standard barrel  of apples, restrictions on for-profit or ganization receiving Federal grants or  contracts,  and  a  requirement  that  wholesale  liquor dealers post a  sign  outside their business premises.  I  request unanimous consent  that  the bill and accompanying section-by section  analysis  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  ",1986
55,340,1,Mr. HAMIL TON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington report for Wednesday,  January 22, 1986,  into  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD:  THE 1986 ELECTION  With the 1986 elections less than a year  away, political talk is beginning to heat up  the congressional cloakrooms.  The stakes in the election are high both  locally and nationally. With both political  parties positioning themselves for the post Reagan era, the consequences of this elec tion could be greater than usual: Republi cans could move within striking distance of  becoming the majority party. The biggest  national battle will be  for control of  the  U.S. Senate, where Republicans now have a  53-47 advantage. A quieter year is expected  in the U.S. House of Representatives, with  most of  the battles occurring over open  seats. It is unlikely that Republicans will  gain enough seats to overcome the Demo crats' present 253 to 182 advantage. History  suggests that the Democrats could solidify  their control of the House: in mid-term elec tions in a President's second term, the party  out of power in the White House usually  gains seats. There will also be  important  races in 1986 in the states, where 34 of 50  governors are Democrats and two-thirds of  the legislative houses have Democratic ma jorities. Just as Republicans must defend a  disproportionate  number  of U.S.  Senate  seats, Democrats have to defend a dispro portionate number of governorships. Be cause 27 of  the 36 governors before  the  voters in 1986 are Democrats, opportunity is  rich for Republican gains. The activity of  the presidential contenders in both parties  as  they position  themselves  for  election will also be worth watching. The  demands of building a national organiza tion, and the intense competition for sup porters and resources, drive contenders to  increasingly early and elaborate efforts.  Given the high stakes, politicians at all  levels are trying to come up with ways to  appeal  to  apparently more  open-minded  the 1988  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  voters. Voter affiliation with either party is  at best loose. Recent polls show that the  public's preference  for political parties  is  nearly even, but that almost a third of the  public identifies with neither party. Politi cians  are  now  looking  past  President  Reagan and searching for themes that can  win  the voters' allegiance  in future elec tions.  These politicians spend a lot of time argu ing among themselves about the best way to  appeal to American voters. Some favor an  emphasis  on  issues;  others  stress  broad  themes.  Issue-oriented  politicians  think  voters decide on  the basis of  issues,  like  social security,  the nuclear freeze, or the  high deficit and interest rates. They believe  that the way to win elections is to identify  the issues most important to voters,  then  charge the opponent with being wrong on  those issues and out of touch with the views  of the majority. This issue approach is used  in every election, and is especially popular  in congressional campaigns. On the basis of  some statement or vote, a political opponent  is labeled a ""big spender"" or ""soft on com munism"" or ""lacking compassion"" or ""favor ing the rich"". One problem with this ap proach  today  is  that,  just eleven months  before the next election, they do not detect  an  issue of overriding  importance  to  the  voters. They tend to think that now, with  no crisis or great division, local issues will  dominate the election, and that the person al, financial and organizational strengths of  individual candidates will be more  impor tant than national trends and issues.  Another approach, popularized by Presi dent Reagan, deemphasizes specific issues,  and stresses warmth, emotion, and personal  values. In 1984, the President was successful  in making people  feel good about  them selves and their country, and upbeat about  their prospects. He was often more interest ed in creating a mood than in arguing about  issues. His idea was that people vote more  by how they feel about the candidate and  general conditions, and less by their feelings  on specific issues. Other politicians favoring  this approach stress that people between 30  and 45 years of age cast a disproportionate  number of votes, and tend to be the least  ideological of all age groups, largely because  they are preoccupied with family and per sonal concerns. Perhaps more  than other  voters, they are attracted to candidates who  emphasize broad  themes. Candidates who  have a five-point plan for every problem do  not make as good an impression on these  voters as do those who appeal to values and  life-styles. This approach worked well for an  incumbent president in 1984 in a campaign  dominated by television. A similar approach  might not work as well for a challenger in a  lesser race.  My view is that politicians must be cau tious in choosing between these approaches.  They must be  ready  to  appeal  to some  voters on  issues, and  to others on broad  themes. Recently  I have come  to believe  that voters are concerned more with broad  themes and general conditions, and some what  less with specific  issues. Above all,  voters want government to keep the econo my  in reasonable order so  that they can  continue to provide for their families and  tend to their concerns. They also want the  government  to keep  the country out of  needless military conflicts. In times when  the economy  is working  reasonably well,  and no military crisis looms, most voters will  give politicians decent, if not high, grades.  I think that efforts to assess blame do not  have as much effect on elections as politiJanuary 22, 1986  cians think. I do not find voters especially  interested in efforts by politici""ans to place  blame for failures or to claim credit for suc cesses. Many voters do not have  time  to  monitor closely  the  intricate political ma neuvers in Washington, or to try to distin guish which party has a better approach to  specific  issues. They have more important  and  immediate things to do and to think  about-principally, the conditions they face  in their daily lives: Do they have jobs? Are  prices going up?  Is a war  imminent? An nouncing or denouncing specific policies un doubtedly has some effect on the outcome  of elections, but I think that for most voters  the issues are less important than their gen eral  feelings about the economy, security  and the candidate.  Politicians may argue over the tactics and  issues for 1986. They agree the stakes have  rarely been higher.  ILL TREATMENT OF  UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS  HON. RONALD D. COLEMAN  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 22, 1986  ",1986
56,340,1,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as  the House continues the debate on the refor mation of immigration policy and  the evalua tion of the many issues involved,  it is disap pointing to read about the certain actions and  beliefs of key administration officials charged  with carrying out these policies.  The most  recent Time magazine contains  an article on Harold Ezell, the western region al commissioner for the Immigration and Natu ralization Service, who  apparently  believes  that acting out his Rambo fantasies by tearing  up and down the Southwest border arresting  illegal aliens is ""fun,"" to quote him.  Aside  from  the  fact  that Mr. Ezell cannot  even pretend to be qualified  for the position  he holds-his sole reason for having the job is  the  fact that he worked  for the President in  both his gubernatorial and Presidential cam paigns-Mr. Ezell's philosophy on what should  happen  to  those  undocumented  workers  found in this country is summarized by saying:  ""If you catch 'em, yu ought to clean 'em and  fry 'em yourself.""  Now, Mr. Speaker,  I am  sure  that most  thinking people would recognize the depth of  ignorance portrayed by such a statement on  such a complex  issue. What  troubles me  is  that such a thing could be stated publicly by a  Government official  charged with  at  least  having  the semblance of being capable of  performing his job without  lapsing into taste less ""tough guy"" posturing.  Racism has a thousand faces, Mr. Speaker,  and I believe that Mr. Ezell, through his state ments, has added his portrait to  this collec tion.  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, January 14, 1986.  The PRESIDENT,  The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I would like to call to  your  attention  an  international  incident  which has developed in El Paso, Texas, over  the last three days which the Federal Gov",1986
57,353,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last week,  Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev indicated  that the Soviets will continue Moscow's mora torium  on  underground  nuclear  tests  until  April, and perhaps longer if the United States  also stops testing.  The Reagan administration quickly indicated  that it has little interest in joining this moratori um. It wants  to keep on  testing, contending  that continued nuclear warhead  testing is re quired for the United States to assure strate gic ""deterrence.""  I find  it somewhat  incredible  that a Presi dent who repeatedly says his ultimate goal is  the elimination of all nuclear weapons  from  the  face of  the earth keeps ducking out of  comprehensive  test ban  talks.  If he  really  wants  to eliminate all nuclear weapons,  the  President should be willing to talk about halt ing  the  tests needed  to develop new war heads.  When the Soviets first announced their uni lateral testing halt, the administration said that  we wouldn't join because it was just a propa ganda stunt.  But the Soviets have stopped testing. That's  not just a stunt; they aren't testing their nucle ar warheads and we're continuing to test ours.  351  As the attached chart indicates, the United  States conducted 16 underground  tests  last  year, 7 of  them  following announcement of  the Soviet test moratorium. The Soviets con ducted seven  tests  in 1985 prior to  the an nouncement of  their moratorium  last  July.  They have not tested since that time.  I am convinced that the primary reason the  administration refuses  to enter into a testing  moratorium is not its concern with the preser vation of strategic deterrence nor its concern  about verification. The United States has kept  on  testing chiefly because of the administra tion's desire to accelerate a key part of star  wars program-the x-ray laser.  The most  recent U.S. nuclear  test, code named Goldstone, was reportedly a test of the  nuclear-driven x-ray laser. Maintaining a rigid  and accelerated  test schedule  for  this pro gram is so important to this administration that  it denied a request from Representative BILL  GREEN, myself, and  28 other Members of  Congress  to  temporarily delay  this  test until  technical problems with  the design of these  experiments had been rectified.  Star wars  is  not  only  an  obstacle  to  progress in strategic arms reduction; it is hold ing up talks on a comprehensive test ban. The  administration would better serve our national  security  interests  if  it stopped  reaching  for  harebrained technological panaceas like the x ray laser and committed itself to negotiations  to end nuclear testing.  I would  like to call  to  the attention of my  colleagues a recent article by Fred Kaplan of  the Boston Globe, which analyzes the admin istration's decision to reject a test ban.  The article follows:  [From the Boston Globe, Jan. 19, 19861  WHY U.S. REJECTED NUCLEAR TEST BAN  <By Fred Kaplan)  WASHINGTON.-ln  the  package  of  arms  control  proposals  offered  last week  by  Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, there is  one element that could instantly be put into  effect-a ban on nuclear weapons tests.  Yet the Reagan administration has reject ed this idea. The reason is simple. It has  nothing to do with whether such a ban can  be verified or whether it would make the ex isting U.S. nuclear arsenal less reliable. It is  because the administration wants to develop  new types of nuclear weapons, and this re quires nuclear testing.  Last July, Gorbachev announced that, as  of Aug. 6, the Soviet Union would suspend  nuclear testing. The moratorium would last  until the end of the year, and could be ex tended if the United States reciprocated.  Reagan  spokesmen declined  the  invita tion. They said a test ban could not be veri fied, and called  the offer a  propaganda  hoax. They said the Soviets had just com pleted tests of a new series of nuclear weap ons, and had  indeed accelerated  the  test  schedule so it could be finished before the  suspension began.  One of those rationales for refusal was  false, and the Soviets would soon make the  other a moot point.  The falsehood was that the Soviets had  just accelerated a  series of new weapons  tests. The data-gathered by the Swedish  National Defense Research Institute, whose  Hagfors Observatory has seismometers ca pable of detecting underground nuclear ex plosions in the Soviet Union down to the  level of one kiloton-indicates otherwise.  71-059 0-87-12 (Pt. 1)  ",1986

59,366,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, in the  course of approximately 15 minutes  there will be a live quorum as provided  by the procedural rules for  the day,  and then the scheduling of a cloture  vote on the proposition to sell Conrail  to Norfolk Southern. For the past 3  days-Tuesday,  Wednesday,  and  today-the attention of the Senate has  turned  to  this  issue.  I opposed  the  unanimous-consent request to proceed  to the consideration of the proposed  sale of Conrail  to Norfolk Southern  because it seemed to this Senator that  there needed to be some focused atten tion on the underlying issues.  In the course of the presentations,  we have attracted  the attention of  some Senators on  the Senate  floor,  and that is always a difficult matter,  especially when the facts are as com plex as those present in this subject.  The debate, Mr. President, has laid  the  foundation  to  show  that  the  Senate must give very extensive con sideration to the antitrust implications  of the proposed sale of Conrail to Nor folk Southern. In this matter there is  no independent ICC consideration as  is  customary  in a proposed merger,  and as is present, for example, in the  pending merger between Santa Fe and  Southern Pacific Railroads.  It is obvious that the Department of  Justice has not given the kind of anal ysis needed to give the Senate assur ance that the antitrust considerations  have adequately been considered.  Back in January of 1985, the Depart ment of Justice wrote to the Secretary  of Transportation saying  that  there  would be antitrust violations with the  proposed merger unless there were ap propriate divestitures.  Since  that time, Norfolk Southern  has come forward with three proposals  for divestiture to two small rail lines,  the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie and Guil ford transportation industries. Both of  the first two proposals were rejected  by the Department of Justice as being  inadequate  to  provide  the  requisite  competition.  Then, when a  third proposal was  made in November, in short order the  Department of Justice gave what  it  calls  preliminary  approval. This  is  somewhat  unfathomable,  given  the  context that the Department of Jus tice has opposed the proposed merger  of Southern Pacific and Santa Fe-a  merger which would be less violative  of the antitrust laws than the Conrail Norfolk Southern proposal.  The procedures by the Department  of Justice are strange, as evidenced in  a letter, which I previously placed in  the RECORD,  from Assistant Attorney  General Douglas Ginsburg  to me,  dated January 21, 1986. This letter re f erred  to a  request  for  information  and documents which I had outstand _ing for some time, and was only deliv ered to me while I was on the Senate  floor on Tuesday of this week, discuss ing this issue.  The letter from Mr. Ginsburg to me,  dated  January  21,  1986,  contained  copies of letters which have been sent  by the Department of Justice to Pitts burgh & Lake Erie and Guilford.  I now refer to a letter dated January  8, 1986, from attorney Paul A. Mapes  of the Antitrust Division to Joe Sims,  Esq.,  representing Guilford,  which  says at page 2:  However, the nature and viability of the  rail service your client intends to provide on  the divested properties is of major interest  to Congress and the public.  I  could not agree more with  the  statement of  the Antitrust Division  that it is of interest to Congress, and  of course Congress includes the U.S.  Senate. But if this body is going to be  voting on the sale of Conrail to Nor f 9lk Southern at  this  time, or next  week or the week after, before this in formation is provided, then obviously,  the Senate, as part of the Congress, is  not in a position to review these very  important matters.  That is why this Senator so strenu ously contends that this entire issue is  not  ripe  for  consideration  by  the  Senate. We are really being asked to  buy a pig in a poke on a matter of  enormous  importance  to  this  coun try-the  joinder of  the  18,000-mile  Norfolk Southern line with the 15,000mile Conrail line, in a context where  the Department of Justice has said  that  this  joinder would violate  the  antitrust laws unless there is appropri ate divestiture. There have been two  proposals of divestiture  to the Pitts burgh & Lake Erie and Guilford rail roads, which were rejected by the De partment of Justice after an expansive  study by a  consultant, R.L. Banks.  Now  the Department of  Justice  is  going back into the field and selecting  a new consultant. Why they are not  going to Banks is explainable only in  terms of their anticipation of a finding  by Banks that proposal 3 violates the  antitrust laws, as proposals 1 and 2  did.  There have been preliminary studies  by the U.S. Railway Association on the  third plan. In a letter dated December  3,  1985,  to Representative  JAMES  J.  FLORIO, chairman of the House Sub committee on Commerce, Transporta tion and Tourism,  the U.S. Railway  Association commented:  Lacking  definitive  agreements  which  should clarify important terms still under  negotiation,  the divestiture  carriers have  not revised their operating plans and finan cial projections.  That letter makes the obvious point  that there can be no determination on  the sketchy state of the present record  as  to whether any proposals would  comply with the antitrust laws.  The third proposal contains the in firmities of the first  two. There will  continue to be ""little or no service to  many of the problem markets,"" a fail ure identified by the Assistant Attor ney General in charge of the Antitrust  Division,  in his letter to the Depart ment of Transportation dated Septem ber 25, 1985.  The problems raised  in that letter  are  still present. The Guilford and  Pittsburgh & Lake Erie will not meet  the test of the Department of Justice  for effective competition. The facili ties to be acquired are inferior to those  to be retained by Norfolk Southern Conrail. One specific criticism by the  Department of Justice is with respect  to the yard which Guilford would use  in St. Louis. The very cogent objec tions  raised  by Assistant Attorney  General Ginsburg in his letter of Sep tember 25, 1985, to Secretary of Trans portation  Elizabeth Dole  are  still  present.  Mr. President, that is why it seems  to  this Senator that the underlying  issue of the sale to Norfolk Southern  should not be voted upon by this body  until we have the details of the divesti ture proposal and until there is a hear ing by the Committee on the Judiciary  on these very important issues. It is  only after such consideration has been  given that the U.S. Senate will be in a  position to undertake an analysis as to  whether, in any event, there could be  a sale to Norfolk Southern.  Then the issue would arise as a com parison of the merits between Norfolk  Southern as a buyer and Morgan Stan ley as a buyer-that is,  the investor  group which has been put together by  Morgan Stanley. When we  come  to  that point, the arguments in favor of  Morgan Stanley are very substantial.  First, Morgan Stanley has offered  $200 million in excess of the Norfolk  Southern offer. Second,  if Norfolk  Southern  acquires Conrail, Norfolk  Southern will have a tax advantage in  the neighborhood of $400 million, or  perhaps as high as $800 million.  The offer of Morgan Stanley, with  $200 million excess cash on  its face  and additional tax factors, would bring  dollars to the taxpayers of the United  States in the range of $600 million, at  a minimum, and perhaps as high as $1  billion. These considerations may well  be undertaken by further  review by  the Department of Commerce.  One suggestion which may arise as a  possible amendment would be to have  the bill  recommitted  to  the Senate  ",1986

64,379,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  some time ago I made an inquiry to  the Treasury Department as to the ef fects on  tax revenue  to the Federal  Government of a  sale of Conrail  to  Norfolk Southern. Clearly, as has been  recognized by everybody, there is a tax  consequence. The fact of the matter is  that the proposal that was made by  Norfolk Southern to the Department  of Transportation forgoes  loss carry  forward, net operating loss carry for wards and the carry forward of invest ment  tax credit unused  from prior  years because Conrail has not been  paying  taxes. These carry  forwards  would otherwise be available. Howev er, it was agreed by Norfolk Southern  to forgo carry forwards of the net op erating losses and of the investment  tax credit.  However, there are some tax conse quences  to any business  transaction.  Why? Because anytime a corporation  that generates tax losses files a con solidated  tax return with a business  that  is making money  and  paying  taxes, one offsets the other. So, in the  future, there are tax consequences.  The Treasury Department,  along  with a  lot of other people, including  Morgan Stanley and the Joint Com mittee on Taxation and the Congres sional Budget Office, have made anal yses of what happens to tax revenues  by virtue of the acquisition of Conrail  by Norfolk Southern. The Treasury  Department has written me. Mr. Presi dent, I ask unanimous consent that a  copy of a letter that I have received  from J. Roger Mentz, Acting Assistant  Secretary of  the Treasury  for Tax  Policy, be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,  Hon. JOHN c. DANFORTH,  Washington, DC.  Chainnan, Committee on Commerce, Sci ence, and Transportation, U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to  your request for an analysis of the Federal  income tax revenue effects of the proposed  sale of Consolidated Rail Corporation <Con rail) to the Norfolk Southern Corporation  <Norfolk Southern>. Our analysis  is based  on the proposed sale transaction as reflect ed in S. 638, the Conrail Sale Amendments  of 1985, and in the Memorandum of Intent  signed on February 8,  1985,  by Norfolk  Southern and the Department of Transpor tation. Pursuant to your further request, we  also have analyzed the tax revenue effects  of an alternative proposal for a sale of Con rail  to a syndicate of  investors organized  and headed by Morgan Stanley & Co., In corporated  <Morgan  Stanley). We  have  relied for the details of a sale of Conrail to  the Morgan Stanley syndicate upon Morgan  Stanley's written description of the proposal  dated May 14, 1985, as subsequently amend ed.  OVERVIEW  Subject to the uncertainties and qualifica tions noted below, we estimate that a sale of  Conrail to Norfolk Southern, in comparison  with a continuation of the Federal govern ment's ownership of Conrail, would result in  a present value revenue loss of $125 million  for  the 1986-1990 budget period. Without  adjustment for the time value of money, the  nominal loss in Federal tax revenues over  this period is $174 million. Alternatively, we  estimate  that  a  sale of Conrail  to  the  Morgan Stanley syndicate, again in compar ison  to continuation of Conrail's current  ownership, would result in a present value  increase in revenue of $18 million over the  same 1986-1990 period. This positive reve nue effect  represents a nominal  revenue  gain of $24 million.  As discussed in further detail below,  the  difference in estimated revenue effects of a  sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern and a  sale to the Morgan Stanley syndicate is at tributable primarily  to differences  in  the  rate at which losses and credits generated  by Conrail after the sale would be utilized  under the alternative sale proposals.1 Thus,  our estimates  reflect period and present  value differences in the revenue effects of  the alternative proposals, even though their  revenue effects on a long-run, undiscounted  basis would be very similar.  In addition, we must emphasize that the  difference  in estimated revenue effects of  the alternative proposals in highly sensitive  to a number of legal and factual issues as to  which there is substantial uncertainty. We  have,  for purposes of our estimates,  at tempted to resolve these issues on a basis  that  reasonably  reflects  the comparative  revenue effects of the sale proposals. Alter native assumptions concerning a number of  these  issues would have been defensible,  however, and could have significantly al tered the absolute and relative revenue ef fects of the proposals. We also must empha size that our revenue estimates do not rep resent an analysis of the relative merits of  selling Conrail to Norfolk Southern or to  the Morgan Stanley syndicate. In particu1 Both the Norfolk Southern and Morgan Stanley  proposals contemplate  that existing Conrail  loss  and credit carryovers would be extinguished in the  sale transaction.  ",1986
65,392,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  a  recent article  in  the Boston Globe  praises my  longtime friend and con stituent Tom Mcintyre as a man who  gets the job done.  Tom, who lives and works in South  Boston, is the international vice presi dent of Local No. 3 of the Bricklayers  Union. He is known for his ""can do""  attitude and his direct approach  to  any issue or problem. But more impor tantly, he is known for his unflagging  support and loyalty to his friends from  all walks of life. All you have to do is  join him for a sandwich and a beer at  Arn.rhein's on West Broadway and you  know that here is a man you want on  your side.  For those folks who have grown up  on Andrew Square,  off Dorchester  Street, who have married and raised  children  there, Tom Mcintyre  is  in  their corner. As  the Boston Globe  story of November 24,  1985,  shows,  Tom Mcintyre has worked to provide  affordable housing  for many young  families during a  time when inflation  has put housing out of reach. During a  time of high unemployment for union  members  in  the construction  trades,  Tom Mcintyre has created jobs. This  is a man who gets things done. I am  proud to call him my friend.  I ask unanimous consent that David  B. Wilson's article  from  the Boston  Globe of November 24, 1985, be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Boston Globe, Nov. 24, 1985]  BARGAIN HOUSES-NO SPECULATORS NEED  APPLY  <David B.

No such ad will appear in the Globe be cause,  by  spring, when  the BLNPHC  is  ready to sell these 18, sunny, special places,  the word will be around and they will all be  taken.  And  if you don't live  in  the neighbor hood-that's  the  key word-of Andrew  Square, forget it. Tom Mcintyre didn't  lay  up all that brick for yuppie speculators. He  did it for what he calls ""the two-dollar bet tors.""  You do not mess with Tom Mcintyre. He  is international vice president of Local No. 3  of the Bricklayers Union. You do not get to  be that and stay that by avoiding or losing  fights. He is Mission Hill Irish, silver-haired,  black-browed,  tough, decisive,  the kind of  man other men will follow. He also  is an  idealist with a  creative  imagination,  lan guage to which he would no doubt object.  Like  the wheel, great  ideas are simple.  Mcintyre's was, is, this: Boston is desperate ly short of housing. Housing costs too much  because land costs too much. People can't  afford to live where they grew up, formed  families. The city owns a lot of land, aban doned schools, burn-outs, tax-title takings,  vacant lots strewn with rubble and broken  glass, going to waste.  The way to produce housing that neigh borhood people can afford is to build it on  city land conveyed for $1 to a nonprofit de veloper. A bank that enjoyed the union's  pension business ought to be interested in  financing.  Union  craftsmen,  paid  scale,  working for a union-backed outfit, could do  the work. And  the buyers would get  a  double discount-the land cost and the de veloper's profit.  This is pretty radical stuff, you know. No  federal funds. No limited partnerships. No  sales commissions. No syndicated tax shel ters. No complex gimmickry, publicity cam paign, extended planning procedures, envi ronmentalist  tedium,  hearings,  seminars,  workshops, committees, reviews. Just do it.  But you need an architect.  Bill Rawn is an architect. Matter of fact,  he is The Architect in Tracy Kidder's best  seller, ""House."" Through Ed Lashman, a  mutual friend, Mcintyre found Rawn. One  night last January they had dinner at Amr hein's on West Broadway and discovered  that they liked each other's style and ideas.  It helped-a lot-that Mcintyre had been  with Ray Flynn early in the 1983 election. It  helped that Arthur Cola and Pat Walsh of  the Laborers Union were willing  to get  aboard.  It helped  that Billy Bulger had  gone to the Andrew School. It helped that  Dave Mirabassi was willing to take charge as  general contractor and that attorney Valer ie Swett was fascinated by the legal issues.  Bill Rawn delivered plans a month after  the Amrhein's dinner. A month later, Mcin tyre had cost estimates from Mirabassi. In  May, the city issued requests for proposals  for the old Andrew School site. In June, to  the surprise of almost no one, the BLNPHC  was chosen.  It took  title  in August and  broke ground Sept. 9. In May, people will be  living in the houses.  Boston is not supposed to work that way.  In Boston, people love to fight, brood upon  ancient wrongs,  to  chew over  issues,  to  debate important principles, to punish and  reward old foes and friends, to convene and  consult and pick nits. Instead, Tom Mcin tyre, the Mission Hill kid, and Bill Rawn,  the post-modernist 1 Yalie, Harvard Law  graduate and oncoming national celebrity,  and  their friends, went out and built 18  houses.  You can see them today, framed in and  rough-plumbed, their bay windows shining  out on Dorchester street, with  the  fine,  clean smell of new lumber blending with the  sour scent of mortar. It is the fragrance of  progress and growth. Thousands of empty  lots in this city could use a little of it.  Valerie Swett has written deed restrictions  designed  to prevent speculation, and she  thinks  they will work. The  houses,  of  course, are worth on the open market two to  three times their expected price.  Tom Mcintyre may have discovered a no lose game. The union gets work and jobs for  apprentices and badly needed public rela tions. The neighborhood gets some protec tion against gentrification. A development  model  has been  established. Ray Flynn  looks great. The city gets taxes and neigh borhood stability. Bill Rawn gets an excit ing commission. Valerie Swett breaks new  ground  in her profession. And people get  places to  live. Each new unit,  just about,  creates a corresponding vacancy.  If it all does not work out exactly as  planned, well, somebody tried. Right away.  Now. Tom Mcintyre's way.  AN INVITATION TO MR.

67,418,1,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President, I  inserted  into  the RECORD  an article  from the Air University Review from  the  September-October  1985  issue,  which dealt almost entirely with the  subject of military reform.  I intend to continue to insert these  various articles because of the coming  legislation  that  the Armed Services  Committee is preparing, to accomplish  some of the reforms discussed by Sen ator SAM NUNN and me on the floor  last year.  Today,  I have  removed  from  that  publication an editorial entitled, ""Indi viduals, Institutions, and the Impulse  for Reform."" This rather short editori al pretty well summarizes the needconstant need-for the observation of  reform.  I ask that it appear at this point in  my remarks.  The article follows:  [From Air University Review, September October 19851  INDIVIDUALS, INSTITUTIONS, AND THE IMPULSE  FOR REFORM  surge  Like  individuals,  institutions ossify with  age. Goals and objectives become part of  the warp and woof of corporate personality,  enforcing conformity and demanding unity  of purpose from those who are part of the  institution. When service  to  institutional ized goals becomes an objective unto itself, a  bureaucratic  rigidity develops  that stifles  initiative and, ultimately, causes atrophy  and impotence. That is when the invigora tion of reform is needed.  Only  the  strongest  establishments  can  reform  themselves. Those  that  seek  to  foster change from within must, in most in stances, be prepared for the lot of martyrs.  On the other hand reform from without can  be unduly abrasive, destroying rather than  improving. The successful reformation usu ally results when insiders work with inter ested outside parties  to bring about con structive changes.  The  Protestant Reformation  and  the  Catholic Counter-Reformation provide good  examples of successful reorientation and re constitution. In 1520,  the Papal Bull Ex demanded  that  the monk Martin  Luther either recant his position on reform ing  the Church or be branded a heretic.  Luther became an unenthusiastic  revolu tionary.  Martin Luther loved the Church. He did  not seek to destroy it, but he was a deter mined advocate for redirection and reform,  particularly in the area of finances. When  Luther criticized the sale of indulgences, he  did more than probe at a lucrative practice  that was vital to financing Europe's Most  lavish court: he ultimately raised questions  about doctrines basic to the Church's exist ence,  including that of papal  infallibility.  However  limited  Luther's  impulse  for  reform was initially, the consequences were  dramatic.  The Air Force, like the medieval church,  is subject to the vicissitudes of institutional  life. As the Air Force matured, particularly  after it attained its independent status in  1947, goals and objectives were incorporat ed, and air doctrine was defined and devel oped.  Such  processes  are  proper  and  common for any military service. However,  if doctrine has become dogma, reformation  may be needed. Like Martin Luther, today's  military  reformer seeks  to correct rather  than to destroy. In Luther's day, it was the  Infidel Turk that actually sought to destroy  Christiandom. Today, it is the Soviets who  wish to obliviate the American way of life,  with all of our institutions. Military reform ers are neither infidel to our military ideals  nor Communist, and it would behoove us  not to use the terms heretic or adversary  too freely.  Even  the most  facile  study of history  teaches that the impulse for reform is virtu ally  irresistible  to  all but  the very  en trenched. If accommodated, reform can im prove  the  institution,  strengthening  it  through evolutionary  rather  than  revolu tionary  development. The United States  government is an example of an institution  in a continuous state of reformation. Impe rial Russia's tsarist autocracy, on the other  ",1986
68,444,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, millions of hard-work ing Americans carry their paychecks  down to the bank every week in antici pation that they can use the funds to  buy  groceries,  pay  the  rent,  buy  clothes, and other necessities.  In all  too many cases,  they don't  have access to the money they have  earned. It is  tied up by banking poli cies, check hold policies, that say the  customer has to wait days, and days  and,  sometimes, weeks  and weeks,  before  the bank says  the money  is  available.  H.R. 2443 is designed to change this  outlandish policy-this age-old game  of allowing banks  to play with and  profit from your money,  the float while the customer waits.  Some may suggest  that  these are  just minor  inconveniences and  that  the Congress really ought not be wor ried.  For  the well-heeled with big bal ances in their checking accounts, the  need for this legislation may, indeed,  seem remote. But, for the millworker,  the salaried employee,  the retiree of  modest means, and to others who must  pay their basic living expenses out of  their weekly or monthly income, these  arbitrary check holds are a disaster.  It is a traumatic, costly and embar rassing experience for  the consumer  who becomes a pawn  in any bank's  check hold schemes.  I can guarantee that the legislation  has real meaning for Mrs. Lucy Cody  of Boston. Last year,  she deposited  $1,413.45  in a Boston bank. Most of  these deposits were in cash, but about  $400 was in checks and an American  Express money order. Mrs. Cody as sumed  that  the deposits, since  they  had included a preponderance of cash  would be credited without delay. So  she proceeded to write checks on the  account, only to have the checks re turned. She ended up with $296.30 in  return check fees and the embarrass ment of having checks for such items  as her son's Boy Scout uniform dis honored by the bank. It all happened  because her bank had placed an arbi trary 2-week hold on the account.  Over the past few years, the House  Banking Committee and Members of  the House have received a flood of let ters from consumers describing the in convenience  and  financial  hardship  they face when a financial institution  holds their deposited checks for an in ordinate period of  time. Some come  from  those hit with bounced check  charges as high as $30, an exorbitant  fee when the Federal Reserve tells us  it only costs 36 cents to return a bad  check. Others come from  those who  can least afford having their money  tied up for weeks on end-our elderly,  our youth, and our citizens living pay check to paycheck.  These letters come from all over the  country,  representing  your  congres sional districts as well as mine.  This is not organized, canned, com puter-generated mail. This mail comes  from  individuals-housewives,  senior  citizens, working men  and women,  small business people, parents and stu dents. The  stationery  varied  from  standard,  to  lined pads  to scraps of  paper.  Don't think  the victims of check  holds are simply unsophisticated con sumers.  It can happen  to even  the  most knowledgeable.  I have a letter from a man in Phila dephia who says he is a former banker  and his wife a former bank regulator.  He was caught with a pile of overdraft  fees when his bank decided to place a  14-day hold on an IRS tax refund. He  had written checks on the deposit as suming,  as  any  reasonable  person  would, that the bank would give imme diate credit for a U.S. Treasury check.  It's not an isolated case. From my  own State of Rhode Island, I have a  letter from a couple in Pawtucket who  thought that their $1,212 tax refund  check drawn on the good U.S. Treas ury could be treated as cash. But their  banker said no. This is the bank where  these people have their mortgage loan  on  their home,  their  loan on  their  automobile and where  they did  all  their banking business. They were told  they would have to wait 5 to 10 days  while the check cleared, just to make  sure the United States didn't go out of  business before it cleared.  But, don't blame just the banks in  Philadelphia and Rhode Island. Chica go has  its Refrigerator and  its own  version of the check hold game. I re ceived a  letter from a copy editor at  the Chicago Tribune who deposited a  check for $5,000 into his account at a  Chicago bank. Five days later, this in dividual attempted  to withdraw $50  from the bank's ATM but was unsuc cessful. Puzzled, he called  the bank  and was told that it had put a 10-day  hold on not only  the $5,000 deposit  but also on the $1,400 already in his  account. Not only had the bank tied  up this individuals entire account be cause of the $5,000 deposit, but he was  informed by the company that issued  the check that it had cleared its ac count just 4 days after it was deposited  in the Chicago bank.  It is for this reason that 125 of us  were cosponsors in the 98th Congress  and 146  in the 99th Congress. After  extensive hearings  in  the 98th and  99th Congress, we  today  respond  to  these letter writers, whose complaints  are certainly justifiable, by passage of  H.R. 2443, the Expedited Funds Avail ability Act.  H.R. 2443  is based on  the simple  premise that customers are entitled to  have access to their deposited funds as  rapidly as modern technology allows.  The  bill mandates  the maximum  number of days a financial institution  can hold a deposited check, cash, or  funds  transferred  by wire without  freeing up the funds.  For the first 3 years of the bill, local  checks will be available for withdrawal  in just 1 to 3 business days. Most out of-State checks can be withdrawn on  the seventh business day after deposit.  After  3  years,  local  and  in-State  checks will be available for withdrawal  the next business day after deposit,  and all other checks by  the fourth  business day after deposit.  I would like to stress that when the  House  Banking  Committee  passed  H.R.  2443, we had no  intention of  making life difficult for the financial  community. Indeed, we have acknowl edged that financial institutions need  time  to  learn whether a  check has  cleared. For  this  reason, H.R.  2443  shortens, rather than eliminates hold  periods. And, these shortened periods  are phased in over a 3-year period.  Those lobbying against the bill are  falsely claiming that shortened hold  periods will  increase  the number of  bad  checks  passed.  However,  the  House Banking Committee repeatedly  heard testimony that shortened check  hold periods do not lead to an increase  in  fraud.  Indeed,  Jill M. Considine,  New York State Superintendent of  Banks, reported that 130 of 160 New  York  institutions  surveyed had  suf fered no  losses whatsoever from  the  State's 1984 check hold law. Of those  institutions reporting losses, the aver age 6-month loss was only $1,811. New  York's success is no small matter-the  State  boasts  the  largest  banking  market in the country and is home to  four of the five  largest bank holding  companies.  This is not to say that check fraud  does not exist. In an effort to be of as sistance  in controlling check  fraud,  the committee adopted an amendment  granting  the Federal Reserve Board  authority  to  act  to  prevent  check  fraud. H.R. 2443 empowers the Fed to  suspend  for  45  days  the mandated  check hold  schedule  for  a  class of  checks when such checks are directly  related  to  a  nonacceptable  level of  losses  as  a  result  of  check  fraud.  Taken together with the Comprehen sive Crime Control Act of 1984, which  includes a new section on bank fraud  specifically intended to apply to check  kiting cases, H.R. 2443 gives the Feder al Reserve and law enforcement agen cies sufficient authority to respond to  fraud-related concerns.  For this reason,  I strongly oppose  the  ""good-faith""  amendment  being  bandied about. This amendment would  allow a financial institution to disre gard H.R. 2443 and hold a deposited  check for as long as it wants if, and it's  a big if, the institution has ""reasona",1986
69,457,1,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Chairman, while  I'm cer tainly  aware  of  the  problem  of excessive  ""holds"" on financial instruments which certain  depository  institutions  impose,  I must rise  in  opposition to H.R. 2443, the Expedited Funds  Availability Act.  Quite simply, there is not a need for Federal  legislation of this sort. Unnecessary delays in  clearing  checks and  other  financial  instru ments  is  a  localized  problem,  one which  varies from State to State and which  is best  dealt with by State authorities. Six States have  already enacted check hold funds availability  legislation best suited  to  their particular con cerns and another dozen  legislatures have  discussed possible legislation. Moving forward  with this legislation will only preempt State ef forts to construct the best possible means for  addressing this problem.  In addition to preempting the State's right to  regulate this matter, I also believe this legisla tion would ultimately raise costs for consum ers. H.R. 2443  imposes rigid, unrealistic time  schedules  on  depository  institutions.  In  a  system where 40 billion checks are written on  40,000  financial  institutions yearly,  this bill  would require depository institutions to invest  hundreds of millions of dollars in processing  systems capable of meeting these rigid, feder ally imposed payment schedules.  This legislation is also lacking in that it does  not contain a ""good faith"" exemption for pro tecting  depository  institutions  from  losses  where there is an honest and legitimate belief  that a check is uncollectable.  Who pays for this massive investment and  for uncollectable checks?  It's the consumer,  of course.  Access  to  funds  in  a  timely manner  is  something we're all  interested in, and  I don't  just mean as  legislators. Clearly, different  nancial  institutions have different policies on  the availability of  funds. But why should we  treat banking services differently  from other  goods and services in the marketplace?  As most depository_ institutions already real ize,  providing  prompt access  to  deposited  funds is good business.  If there are a few in stitutions who aren't clearing checks expedi tiously, why not  let consumers exercise  the  most persuasive and compelling sanction of  all-let them move their business elsewhere.  Along  these  lines, disclosure  requirements  would be much more effective in dealing with  ""a few rotten apples,"" as opposed to mandat ing  rigid,  unrealistic,  and  costly mandatory  availability policies.  fi ",1986
70,457,1,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Chairman, first  let me salute our chairman for  the  leadership that he has shown on this  issue. Hopefully, this year will be the  year of the consumer in banking law.  Hopefully,  this will be  the  first of  many pieces of proconsumer  legisla tion to emerge from the Committee on  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs  to pass this body and pass the other  body.  Without the leadership of our good  chairman, this year of the consumer in  banking law might well not happen.  I would like to say to my colleagues,  I think many of you have laid out very  cogently the reasons for this legislaIt,  tion. Let me just try to put them in  context.  We are living in a world of banking  deregulation.  This  Congress  may  choose not to act, but the regulators  and  the  economy move  along  and  banking has become deregulated.  Consumers are hit with fees of every  kind, changes in rules, and changes in  laws, changes in policy. It is very hard  for a consumer who would spend all of  his or her time keeping track of these  changes  to adapt  to  those  laws,  let  alone a working man or woman who  has a family to raise.  therefore, behooves  this body,  this Congress, to do things that will be  helpful to the consumer to make sure  that a modicum of fairness exists in  this wild and wooly world of deregula tion. Elemental fairness  in saying  if  you have deposited money and  the  banks  have  taken  credit  for  your  money, you should have access and in terest. That is all this bill does. It de serves passage in an unamended form.  The CHAIRMAN. All time for gen eral debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the committee  amendment in the nature of a substi tute now printed in the reported bill  shall be considered as an original bill  for  the purpose of amendment, and  each  section shall be  considered as  having been read.  No amendments  to said substitute  are in order except pro forma amend ments and amendments printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at least 1 legis lative day prior to consideration.  The Clerk will designate section 1.  ",1986

The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Rhode Island?  There was no objection.  The text of the committee amend ment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:  H.R. 2443  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION I. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as  Funds Availability Act"".  SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  the ""Expedited  fa) FINDINGs.-The Congress hereby finds  that( 1J the writing and depositing of checks is  an important element in the efficient oper ation of the American economy;  (2) many people rely on the rapid avail ability of funds deposited in their accounts  for the basic necessities of Zif e;  ( 3J notwithstanding the fact that deposito ry  institutions usually  receive provisional  credit from the Federal Reserve for checks  they receive within one to two business days  after such checks are deposited with them,  many depository institutions have imposed  inordinate delays  on  the availability of  those funds to depositors;  f4J the incidence of returned checks, which  depository institutions often use  to justify  their delayed  funds availability policies,  amount to approximately one percent of all  checks written in the United States, and a  substantial portion of these returned checks  are paid on second presentment,  f5J with few exceptions, efforts by State  governments, Federal agencies, and the fi nancial industry have been unsuccessful in  curbing the abuses which have been found  in the area of delayed funds availability;  and  f6J a coordinated Federal response is the  most reasonable way to assure that deposi tors throughout the United States are treat ed fairly in gaining access to funds in their  accounts.  fbJ PURPOSE.-lt is the purpose of this Act  to(1)  adopt  temporary,  maximum  time  limits for the availability of funds deposited  by check;  f2J  replace  those  temporary  time  limits  with standard availability ceilings within 3  years after the effective date of section 4;  f3J require depository institutions to fully  disclose  their funds availability policies to  depositors;  f4J permit States, and individual deposito ry institutions,  to adopt funds availability  policies which  allow  depositors  to  gain  access  to funds earlier than prescribed by  Federal law or regulation; and  (5)  prescribe  appropriate  enforcement  mechanisms to ensure compliance with the  provisions of this Act.

72,470,1,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I appreciate  the gentleman's raising  the question. It is a very good point  and one that needs to be understood  by Members.  As  I understand  it,  there are now  five States that have similar laws to  this one governing the subject of avail  ability of deposited funds. In four of  those  States,  those  being  Rhode  Island,  Connecticut, Massachusetts,  and New York,  there is a goodfaith  exception which can be utilized by  banks to put a hold upon checks pre  sented for deposit.  The fifth State, California, as I have  mentioned in an earlier colloquy, has a  law which very closely parallels my  amendment which I have offered here.  It outlines three specific areas and re  quires on the part of the bank a rea  sonable belief  in  those areas, rather  than just an unfettered grant of dis  cretion, before one of the exceptions  could be invoked.  D 1455  So there is a patchwork quilt being  developed, because not all States have  the same kind of law.  ",1986
73,470,1,Mr.  CARPER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for his response.  Reclaiming my time for another fol  lowup  question,  in  the  four States  where the good faith provision is  in  eluded, has it indeed been abused by  the  financial  institutions  that have  been given prerogative?  ",1986
74,470,1,Mr. SHUMWAY., There was no evi  dence of abuse at all presented to the  committee during  the hearings. We  had representatives from a number of  States that have had some operating  experience and in every case there was  no evidence or any hint even that the  banks have indeed abused those proce  dures.  ,1986
75,470,1,Mr. CARPER.," In the discussion that  occurred between the gentleman from  California and  the gentleman  from  Massachusetts earlier this afternoon,  the issue of notice being part of the  California bill, as opposed to this par  ticular bill, was raised. Has the author  of this amendment considered includ  ing in his amendment the notice provi  sion?  ",1986
76,470,1,Mr. SHUMWAY.,"  I  do not  really  have any bias against giving notice. In  fact, I intend to introduce later in the  afternoon a bill, or a substitute, which  would  rest  the  entire  proposal  on  giving notice and making full disclo  sure to consumers. I have no objection  to  that. Simply  in an effort  to be  simple and to be very straightforward  in my amendment, I have not tried to  load  it up with provisions  requiring  notice.  ",1986
77,470,1,Mr. CARPER.,"  I  thank the gentle  man for his response.  For purposes of answering this ques  tion, let me yield to the chairman of  the  full  committee. The question  I  want to ask of the chairman is absent  this amendment, specifically what pro  tections  do  these  institutions  have  against, one, fraud;  two, bankruptcy;  and three, check kiting, because I be  lieve we are all concerned about that.  ",1986
78,470,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Mr. Chairman, if  the gentleman will yield, we are all  concerned.  I would like to make a few points.  No. 1, as to the patchwork quilt, what  the other States do, I might mention,  you see, I was a member of the State  legislature  in Rhode Island before I  came to Washington. I felt that this  was a step up in the world, and that  because most of us here are fulltime  and in Rhode Island they are in ses  sion 60 days a year. With all due def er  ence to the State legislature, they do  not have the time, the staff, et cetera,  to analyze these things as we do; so I  would like to feel that we in the Con  gress do not have to take a back seat  to any State legislature.  No. 2, let us get to the gentleman's  question.  I  think  that  Chairman  RODINO has put the bankruptcy situa  tion to rest in that which has already  been introduced in the RECORD.  As to fraud and kiting, page 17 of  the bill on prevention of fraud losses,  as explained on page 20 of the report,  prevention of check fraud losses, ade  quately takes care of the financial in  stitutions.  Recall this, that at any point in time  if this amendment is not in the bill,  and as I said to the gentleman from  California CMr. DREIER], there is noth  ing that says to a bank that it must  accept a check. If they really feel that  they are going to be defrauded, they  can just say, ""We are not going to take  the check."" That is all. That is why I  oppose this amendment.  ",1986
79,470,1,Mr.  CARPER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for his response.  ",1986
80,470,1,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I am not a member of  this  committee,  but  I  have  been  watching the debate and attending to  the debate. I have some comments I  would like to make.  I think the Shumway amendment is  wellintended,  wellsupported  and  ought to be added to this bill.  The gentleman from Georgia CMr.  BARNARD]  started out by saying that  the bank has an alternative. The bank  simply can refuse to accept payment  of a check. They can refuse to put the  check in the process of collection. We  ought to expose the fallacy in that.  Tellers do not have the knowledge,  the information with which to intelli  gently make that particular decision.  That decision is going to have to be  made, if it deals with check kiting",1986
81,470,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Mr. Chairman,  will  the  gentleman  yield  on  that  point?  ",1986
82,470,1,Mr. SPRATT., Certainly.  ,1986
83,470,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," By  the same  token, in one instance the gentleman  says that the teller does not have the  ability to make that decision. The gen  tleman just said that, right?  ",1986
84,470,1,Mr. SPRATT., Yes.  ,1986
85,470,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," And yet what  does the Shumway amendment do and  what does it say? It says that if the  teller feels there is reason to believe  that there might be fraud or bank  ruptcy or legal procedures,  they can  put a hold on that check. So how in  one instance does that teller bring it  and in the other instance is not knowl  edgeable, if the gentleman will be good  enough to explain that?  ",1986
86,470,1,Mr. SPRATT.," Very  simple.  I  am  making a generalization. The  tellers  are not likely to have the specific in  formation needed  to know whether  there is check kiting going on, wheth  er  there  is  fraud afoot or whether  their particular depositor is about to  go bankrupt. The loan officer is likely  to know that. The credit department  may know it. The bookkeeping depart  ment may get wind of some sort of  check kiting, but  the  teller on  the  teller line is not likely to know it. Now,  if he or she does know  it,  then by  golly, he or she can exercise that judg  ment. That is the first problem with  this particular bill. It denies the over  ride of intelligent decisionmaking in a  bank by the people who have the abili  ty and  the knowledge  to make that  particular decision.  It takes  it away  from them and it says that the teller  or somebody at a very low level has  got to make the decision when they do  not have the information with which  to make  the  decision  intelligently.  That is the first problem.  We say that this bill  is  to protect  consumers against abuse. Well, let us  protect consumers against abuse by  other consumers who are going to cost  them a  lot of money, even  if  it  is  capped at $5,000, by putting into the  process  of  collection  and  receiving  credit on checks that are not any good  because of bankruptcy or checkkiting  schemes.  Second, it is said that this particular  amendment is defective because it uses  the standard of good faith or reason  ableness. Well, anybody who has read  the UCC knows that article II and ar  ticle  III are replete with  the words  ""good faith.""  Have you ever heard of the BFT, a  bonafide purchaser, a good faith taker  of a negotiable instrument? The UCC  knows good faith and the courts adopt  ",1986

100,483,1,Mr. BARNARD.,"  I would  ask  the  chairman  again,  would  not  this  amendment have fair consideration if  this bill passes the House, and maybe  that bill will pass the other body, and  would it not be fair consideration to be  considered in conference?  ",1986
101,483,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Well,  I cannot  speak for what the other body may do.  But, by the same token, I say to the  gentleman he made a good point. The  gentleman who offers this substitute  would be the first to object to any leg islation or a substitute that goes as far  as this does without consideration in  the committee, and yet he now wants  to consider it.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from Rhode  Island  has  again expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. ST GER MAIN was allowed to proceed for 1 ad ditional minute.)  ",1986

However, upon a cursory  examination of this substitute, I  just  think this is too vague and ambiguous,  in only calling for them to issue regu lations  to be commented upon;  too  long a period of time; it is not detailed  nor specific enough. For the fact that  it was not offered in committee, we did  not have ample  time  to consider  it,  and it seems too vague and ambiguous,  I would urge def eat of the substitute  at this time.  ",1986
106,483,1,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Mr. Chairman, I  would urge def eat of the amendment  and yield back the balance of my time.  ",1986
107,483,1,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and  I  rise  in support of  the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I know the hour is  late on Thursday afternoon, but the  Shumway substitute which he offers, I  call  to  the attention of  the entire  House,  in fact,  resolves  the problem  that has been discussed by this commit tee during the debate on the amend ment in committee and subcommittee  and by the Committee of the Whole all  afternoon. What the Shumway amend ment does, and it is quite a courageous  amendment to offer, it is against the  tide  on  the House  floor;  it  an  amendment  that I  think speaks for  the consumers of this country to give  the consumers a  choice. The differ ence between the Shumway substitute  and the committee bill  is very, very  plain. The Shumway substitute would  leave the choice as to what type of ac count, what type of hold, if any, and  what type of interest rate, and what  type of cost to the consumer. And the  consumer then is allowed to be a rea sonable and  reasoned and  informed  shopper. I would say to the gentlemen  on the other side, the sponsors of the  main bill,  that  there  is  a  problem.  There  is a problem  in  this country  with deposits  that are held  for  too  long. But the problem is the frustra tion of consumers who are not  told  about those holds and do not have an  informed  choice.  The  Shumway  amendment resolves that problem be cause it ensures that consumers would  then be  informed when  they open  their account at every day subsequent  to that opening with each deposit as  to what their choices are. So a con sumer then goes to their financial in stitution and is told, without having to  ask under the Shumway substitute, is  told what the policies are and what  the costs would be and what the inter est rate is for that account. Then if  the consumer decides that that is not  their  package,  they  go  across  the  street or down the street or across the  is  way and  find a  financial  institution  that meets their specific needs.  Let me be very specific: This substi tute provides for an informed choice  so that a  financial  institution under  this substitute could off er a higher in terest rate with a longer hold, tell the  depositor about it, and if that fits the  depositor's needs,  the depositor will  accept that account, or the financial  institution could offer no hold, offer  immediate credit on all deposits with a  lower interest rate to account for the  additional cost. And  if that fits  the  consumer need,  then  the consumer  chooses that kind of account.  With  the Shumway substitute  the  depositor is the king, the consumer is  the king. With the committee bill the  Government  is  the king,  the regula tors, as the gentleman from New York  said, and I admire him a great deal,  but he said it. He said he wanted to  help the regulators make the decisions  for the consumers of this country. I do  not  think when  the Congress  really  examines this problem that they will  conclude that that is the right way to  solve it because it is not a solution. It  creates a bigger problem. It says we  are going to return to the days of no  choice, that the Government is going  to decide what rate, what date, hours  of service, what accounts, what type of  accounts. I know the gentleman would  not add all of that, but that is the di rection.  So  I would  implore  the House  to  avoid  the  fashion  of  being  heavy handed, voting just for the title of the  bill, to vote for the consumer, for the  consumer choice, and for a disclosure  substitute.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment in the nature of a sub stitute offered by the gentleman from  California [Mr. SHUMWAY].

109,522,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, on De cember 11, 1985,  the House approved  the  Compact of Free Association between  the  United States and  the constitutional govern ments of the Federated States of Micronesia  and  the Marshall  Islands. On December 13,  1985, the Senate also passed the joint resolu tion approving  the compact. That  legislation  has also now been signed by the President,  and  the compact will  take effect  in accord ance with  its  terms and  in conjunction with  termination of the U.N. trusteeship.  The compact  is a comprehensive govern ment-to-government agreement. Because of  the exhaustive  record created  in connection  with congressional  review of  the compact,  I  will not  take  the  time on  this occasion  to  review all of its elements or implications.  However,  there  is one aspect of the com pact which I would like to address. I am refer ring to section 177 of the compact and the re lated provisions for settlement of all claims of  Marshallese citizens arising from the U.S. nu clear testing program  in the Marshall  Islands  following World War  II. Upon personally  re viewing the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD with re spect to the compact,  I discovered  that last  minute questions were  raised  regarding pur ported  ""constitutional  issues"" which  some  parties may seek to raise with respect to the  section 177 settlement agreement.  If the section 177 agreement is challenged  in the courts, it is the view of the Department  of  Justice  and  the Department  of State,  whose representatives testified on the section  177 agreement during our hearings on  the  compact,  that  the United States will prevail  and that the constitutionality of this agreement  will be affirmed. I tend to agree with the state ments on this subject made in the section-by section analysis of  the compact offered by  Senator McCLURE, chairman of the committee  which had jurisdiction over the compact in the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Senate. In the December 13, 1985, CONGRES SIONAL RECORD  at page S17651, Senator  McCLURE makes it clear that the section 177  agreement  is  intended by Congress  to be a  ""full and final settlement of all nuclear effects  claims."" He goes on to remind us that those  who are generating questions about the con stitutionality of  the settlement,  including  the  espousal provisions, may be promoting pro tracted litigation rather than compensation for  the victims.  Senator McCLURE also refers to Senate and  House agreement  to expressly endorse  the  espousal provisions  in section 103(g) of  the  resolution  approving  the  compact.  As  a  member of both the Foreign Affairs and Interi or  and  Insular Affairs Committees  of  the  House, the two committees which had original  jurisdiction over the compact and section 177  agreement in the House,  I participated in the  agreement to which Senator McCLURE refers.  I can confirm  that  it was  the  intent of Con gress that the section 177 be fully implement ed strictly  in accordance with  its  terms, and  that the final version of section 103(g) of the  resolution represents our rejection of the earli er versions of that provision.  In response to some of the questions that  have been raised I would like to make the fol lowing statements:  As Congress prepared for review of the ne gotiated  compact,  the  Congressional  Re search Service was asked  to  take a critical  look at the document. That study was for the  purpose of  raising every conceivable ques tion-in some cases even  if somewhat  far fetched or  implausible-about all aspects of  the compact, so that the members would be  aware of all  possible  issues and potential  problems. The GAS study done on  the com pact was useful, in that the document assisted  the members  in  formulating questions  that  were submitted to the administration. Howev er, it is a distortion to rely upon the GAS study  of the compact without also looking at the ad ministration's responses, as well as the tran scripts of our hearings and the committee re ports which also contain administration views  on these matters. In the end, the Members of  the Congress who were most actively involved  with  these  issues, and  I am  included  in  that  category, were satisfied that the administration  had answered those questions. We came  to  the conclusion  that  the section 177 agree ment is consistent with  international  law and  U.S. constitutional practice. The  fact that we  recognize that courts may be asked by plain tiffs in some of the court cases to review the  validity of  the compact and  the section 177  agreement does not alter the clear meaning of  the settlement provisions or the provisions of  section 103(g) of the resolution approving the  compact.  There is one point that is seldom mentioned  by those who purport to be concerned about  the rights of the Marshallese claimants.  I am  referring  to  the  fact  that  the percentage of  people voting for the compact and the section  177 agreement was significantly higher in the  atolls and  islands of the Marshall  Islands in habited by claimants than it was in the Mar shall  Islands generally. The  lawyers involved  in these lawsuits visitied these atolls regularly  and especially just before  the vote and  told  the people to reject the compact and the secJanuary 23, 1986  tion 177 agreement so that they could pursue  their remedies in court. The choice presented  to the claimants as voters was clear, and the  U.N.  report on  the plebiscite  finds  that  the  people voted freely. The people knew exactly  what their implications of their vote were, and  they voted to approve the settlement as part  of the compact. Again, most of the claimant  groups voted to approve at a higher rate then  the genreal population. Thus, there is no basis  for the argument that the rights of the claim ants were subsumed in the vote of the gener al population on the overall agreement. In the  major population centers where claimant pop ulation is smaller, the vote for the agreement  is  lower  than  in  the claimant atolls and  is lands. But even  in the Marshall  Islands as a  whole  the vote was decisive  in  favor of the  compact and the section 177 settlement. This  fact is too often ignored by those supposedly  speaking on behalf of claimant rights.  There have been a lot of questions about  the validity of espousal. The arguments we  have heard questioning the espousal mecha nism seem to have  little connection with the  factual and  legal bases of  the section 177  agreement. After considering  the views ex pressed by all sides, it seems clear that when  the people of the Marshall  Islands,  including  the  claimants,  exercise  their  sovereignty  through  their  constitutional  government  to  enter  into  a  settlement,  and  then  these  people, who retain  their  inherent sovereignty  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they are  in a  transition  from  non-self-governing  status  to  self-government,  expressly  and  specifically  affirm  that exercise of sovereignty  in a free  vote, then any conceivable test of internation al  law with respect to the rights of the claim ants has been met. I am referring generally to  fairness and equity here. The espousal proc ess  itself  is a government-to-government ar rangement that is well-established and recog nized under international  law and U.S. prac tice. The Marshall  Islands Government made  its decision  to espouse  these  claims,  the  United States recognized the authority of the  Marshall  Islands to make that decision within  the context of its constitution and the state of  affairs as the trusteeship is drawing to a close  and the transition to self-government is nearly  complete. The section 177 agreement meets  all the legal tests I know of-and then some by providing a tribunal for adjudication of addi tional claims, as well as recognizing the possi bility of ""changed circumstances"" and  future  ex gratia measures. Anyone who studies the  agreement, instead of listening only to the ar guments of those who thrive on litigation, will  recognize why Congress approved  this very  fair and comprehensive settlement.

111,535,1,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing the Rehabilitation Act Amendments  of 1986, a bill which reauthorizes this Nation's  rehabilitation  efforts,  extending  them  for 5  years,  and making  a  number  of modest  changes in the language of this statute.  The Rehabilitation Act is very important, Mr.  Speaker.  It provides the mechanism by which  the States and the Federal Government have  maintained  a  successful  partnership  for a  number of years. This partnership has worked  to  the benefit of our economy by providing  employment-related assistance  to  individuals  who are disabled, thereby increasing the con tributions by such individuals to our economy.  It also helps some persons with disabilities  maintain a  level of  independence  that adds  immeasurably to the quality of their lives, and  thus, enr:ches us all.  The Subcommittee on Select Education has  held five hearings around  the country and  in  Washington. We have heard  from many wit nesses, representing individuals, governments,  and rehabilitation organizations. Out of these  many helpful discussions have come the sug gestions that are now incorporated in this pro posed reauthorization bill.  I referred to the changes as ""modest."" Wit nesses  pointed  out  a  variety  of  problem  issues that minor statutory changes could re solve. For example, this bill modifies the defi nition of local agency in order to ensure that  Indian organizations are included in this defini tion. Other examples of such modest changes  would  include adding a requirement  that the  annual  report go  to  the Congress simulta neously with its delivery to the President and  making the language gender-free.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Several management changes are also pro posed in this legislation. Currently, the Office  of Special Education and Rehabilitation Serv ices consists of three units, the Office of Spe cial Education, the Rehabilitation Service Ad ministration,  and  the National  Institute  for  Handicapped Research. The heads of these  units  report  to  the Assistant Secretary. The  head of special education is appointed by the  Secretary; the remaining two are appointed by  the President.  In  this  legislation  all  three  would become secretarial level appointees to  a Presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary.  The changes would become effective upon a  vacancy in the current slots.  Examples of other management changes in clude increasing the public membership of the  Architectural  and  Transportation  Barriers  Board, to balance an increase in the Federal  agency members  that occurred when HEW  became HHS and DOE, and specifying  that  the chairman of that board is elected from the  public members.  This legislation would require that the Direc tor of  the National  Institute of Handicapped  Research, working with the lnteragency Com mittee, come up with recommendations for es tablishment of some type of agency or mech anism  for ensuring  the development of cost effective production and marketing of techno logical devices and the efficient distribution of  such to persons with disabilities.  However,  there  is one change  that  is not  modest and I would be remiss in not pointing  it out  to my colleagues. Presently, and  for  sqme time, the Rehabilitation Act contains an  80-20 match requirement. The Federal share  is 80 percent. Repeatedly, we have heard  from State directors of rehabilitation agencies  and from others that the system is not serving  anywhere close to the true number of individ uals who might be eligible for such services. It  is equally clear that  investment  in  rehabilita tion  is a sound  investment;  the returns out weigh the costs. Therefore, it is time that the  States begin to take a greater role in this part nership that is so beneficial to all our citizens.  I am proposing  in  this  legislation  to change  the match  to 75-25, and at the same  time,  ensure  that  the States' contributions do not  drop below their fiscal year 1985 levels.  Finally, the bill also includes language to re authorize the Helen Keller National Center Act  for 3 years and would authorize  funding  for  that center at current levels.  533  Mr.  Speaker,  I  believe  the  proposed  changes reflect sound policy. The Subcommit tee on Select Education will soon hold hear ings on this bill, and we welcome the input of  everyone concerned about  rehabilitation as  we move  to  finalize  this  legislation  in  the  coming months.  LEGISLATION THAT PROHIBITS  THE PURCHASE OF SOVIET EN RICHMENT  SERVICES  FOR  UNITED  STATES  NUCLEAR  POWERPLANTS  HON. MARILYN LLOYD  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 23, 1986  ",1986
112,535,1,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I have today in troduced a bill which prohibits nuclear electric  power utilities in the United States from pur chasing uranium enrichment services from the  Soviet Union.  The United States operates a uranium en richment program through the Department of  Energy, and it is intended to be fully self-suffi cient through the revenues  it generates from  the customers  it serves.  In  the recent past,  the demand for uranium enrichment services  has been substantially reduced causing a sig nificant  retrenchment  in  the Government's  program and  the closure of one of the Gov ernment's three uranium enrichment plants in  the United States.  Soviet Union sales of enrichment services  to domestic utilities  impair  the ability of  the  United States to continue its uranium enrich ment program, which the United States oper ates without a profit for the benefit of electric  ratepayers.  The Soviet Union does not operate its ura nium enrichment business on the principles of  a free market society. They offer this enrich ment services at a discount  from whatever  level is established as the price of enrichment  services in the United States.  The Soviet Union  is an unfair competitor  and enrichment service sales to U.S. citizens  detract  from  the national energy security of  the United States.  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this leg islation.  ",1986
113,574,1,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, today I  am  introducing, along with Senator  DURENBERGER and Senator RUDMAN a  bill  to bring accountability  into  the  regulatory  review process conducted  by OMB and established by President  Reagan in two Executive Orders 12291  and 12498.  The concept  for public disclosure  contained in this bill is not new. It was  addressed in S. 1080, the omnibus reg ulatory reform bill passed unanimous ly by the 97th Congress on March 24,  1982 it was addressed in the reauthor the Pape1work Reduction  Act passed unanimously by the Senate  Governmental Affairs Committee  in  the 98th Congress on July 26, 1984;  and it has been publicly endorsed in  part by OMB officials involved in the  regulatory  review  process  over  the  past several years. It has not, however,  been put into effect, and that is why  we are here today introducing a bill  containing basic ""sunshine in govern ment"" provisions for the OMB review  process, which should have been im plemented over 5 years ago. We are  having to mandate by legislation, what  OMB and the President should have  had the good sense to do administra tively many years ago. But that fact  does not make this bill any less impor tant. In fact, it is vitally significant to  well  established and congressionally  intended principles of public participa tion in the rulemaking process.  Let me take a minute before I elabo rate on the problems concerning the  lack of public participation in OMB's  review of rules, to provide a brief back ground on  just what review process  this bill addresses, for those who may  be unfamiliar with it.  On February  17,  1981,  President  Reagan issued Executive Order 12291,  which required all covered agencies that  included  all  executive  branch  agencies, but not the independent reg ulatory agencies-to submit their pro posed and  final  rules  to OMB  for  review prior to publication. It directed  OMB to review the rules for compli ance with five principles layed out in  the Executive order. For the record,  these five principles are:  <a> Administrative decisions shall be on  adequate information concerning the need  for and consequences of proposed govern ment action;  Cb> Regulatory action shall not be under taken unless the potential benefits to socie ty for the regulation outweigh the potential  costs to society;  Cc> Regulatory objectives shall be chosen  to maximize the net benefits to society;  Cd> Among alternative approaches to any  given  regulatory objective,  the alternative  involving the least net cost to society shall  be chosen; and  Ce> Agencies shall set regulatory priorities  with the aim of maximizing the aggregate  net benefits to society, taking into account  the condition of the particular industries af fected by regulations, the condition of the  national economy, and other regulatory ac tions contemplated for the future.  The order set a timetable for OMB  review of 10 days for proposed and  final nonmajor rules, 60 days for pro posed major  rules, and 30 days  for  final major rules. Implicit in the order,  however,  is  the understanding  that  these timeframes are not inviolate and  can be extended indefinitely by OMB.  In short, OMB can delay the publica tion or implementation of a  rule in definitely  under  Executive  Order  12291, if it sees fit, but arguably only  if one of the standards in the order is  not met. That's strong medicine and  an unprecedented role for the manage ment side of OMB.  Now, I should add, here, that my de scription of the operation of Executive  Order 12291, would not coincide with  that of OMB. It maintains to my utter  amazement,  in  documents  filed  in  court cases challenging the authority  of OMB to hold up rules, that its role  is limited to that of an adviser, that  the agency head retains the legal au thority to draft and issue rules, and  that OMB only offers advice. The con sequences, it says, to an agency's fail ure to follow OMB's advice is not legal  in nature  but political-that  is  the  possible l~ss of a job by the responsi ble agency personnel. So, OMB main tains, it is not the ogre in the rulemak ing process; it is merely the consult ant.  Well  this consultant has developed  a rem~rkable track record for getting  its ideas accepted. Following this fic tion  created  by OMB,  on OMB's  ""advice,"" agencies, such as  the EPA  and OSHA have delayed numerous  rules beyond the time periods speci fied in the order and many indefinite ly. Senator DuRENBERGER, chairman of  the Intergovernmental Relations Sub committee of  the Governmental Af fairs Committee, will be chairing a  hearing on next month at which testi mony will be presented citing several  examples of  the strength of OMB's  ability  to ""consult"" with  these rule making agencies. The House Subcom mittee on Oversight and  Investiga tions of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce held a lengthy hearing and  conducted an extensive  investigation  into  the example of OMB's involve ment  in EP A's asbestos  regulations.  Numerous court cases have been filed,  the discovery portion of which has dis closed OMB's heavy hand.  Many highly experienced persons in  the field of regulation have called for  the elimination of  the OMB  review  process. They argue that the OMB has  no legitimate role in reviewing many  of the highly complex, unique and ex haustively  developed  rules  agencies  are required to send OMB for review.  They point out that OMB simply does  ",1986
114,587,1,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to call to the attention of the House  of Representatives the National Cancer lnsti tute's  [NCI]  ""Community Mobilization  for  Smoking Cessation Project."" NCI should be  applauded  for both  its  research  focus and  community approach  to smoking prevention  and cessation in the general population.  NCI has distinguished itself among the Na tional Institute of Health by introduction of re search initiatives in black and Hispanic popu lations where there eixsts a higher incidence  of  smoking.  These  large-scale  community  based smoking prevention and cessation ef forts are major stepping stones toward NCl's  goal of 50 percent  reduction  in  the cancer  rate,  and  the Surgeon General's goal  of  wiping out smoking by the year 2000.  Richmond, CA., a city I am privileged to rep resent, has been chosen as one of the model  research sites. Having witnessed the commu nity effort prior to the actual funding, I am de lighted to have aid in securing this recognition.  The Richmond community's preliminary activi ties brought  together smokers, nonsmokers,  public and private sector representatives alike  to work on this public health concern.  NCI has now provided the vehicle to assist  their efforts and validate  their effectiveness  with a $2 million grant.  Mr. Speaker,  I am honored and privileged  that  the Seventh Congressional District has  become one of the beneficiaries of this part nership. The  results will help reduce  the  in creased  incidences of cancer, of related  ill nesses, and of the needless deaths which ac companies smoking. The efforts of our citi zens, together with NCI, will serve as a model  for other communities which want to provide  similar services to their residents.  I also want to call attention to the four lead ers of one Richmond project who have come  to Washington  this week  to  inaugurate  the  anti-smoking effort: Enid Hunkeler, project di rector,  Bess Anderson-McNeal,  community  participation coordinator, Dr. Leonard Syme,  principal  investigator, and Larry Hill, project  coordinator.

DAVIDS. SPERBER  HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 27, 1986  ",1986
116,587,1,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, on March 2,  1986, David S. Sperber will be honored as  ""Man of the Year"" by Chabad of the Valley  for his outstanding contributions to the com munity.  David Sperber, a well-known attorney  in  southern California and  former deputy attor ney general of the State of California, has de voted much of his time to a multitude of civic  and humanitarian causes. Among his affili ations are membership to the Lawyers Club,  Los Angeles County Bar Association, San Fer nando Valley Criminal Bar Association, Feder al Criminal Indigent Defense Panel, Los Ange les Trial Lawyers Association, and California  trial Lawyers Association.  Mr. Sperber's community activities  include  participation in the Junior Barristers Parble Aid  Program; president of the Board of Trustees  of Hear Center; member of  the Board of  Trustees Hillel Hebrew Academy; associate  chairman of the United Jewish Welfare Fund  (metropolitan division); member of the City At torney's Criminal Procedure Committee; co chairman of the Chabad Bar Mitzvah Celebra tion; chairman of the Legal Committee, Yeshi va University Holocaust Center.  Of Mr. Sperber's many philanthropic and  civic activities, the one which has received the  lion's share of his attention has been Chabad  of the Valley. This organization is the San Fer nando Valley branch of the worldwide Luba vitcher movement which is under the leader ship of the renowned Lubavitcher Rebbe Men achem Mendel Schneerson.  The work  of  Chabad ranges from elementary Jewish edu cation  to senior citizen activities. Chabad of  the Valley maintains four synagogues, a coun seling service, and an extensive outreach pro gram to bring the moral and spiritual values of  Judaism to the unaffiliated.  David S. Sperber reflects  in his character  and community activities the values manifest  in  the  Hebrew  acronym  which  ChaBaD  spells-chochma  (wisdom),  binah  (knowl edge), and daas (understanding).  I ask the Members to join me in congratulat ing David S. Sperber, his wife Jeanine Rose marie, and children, Toby, Elliot, Joshua, and  Mara on this special occasion. May the years  ahead continue  to be filled with happy and  meaningful experiences and pursuits.  ",1986
117,600,1,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  ask  unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to  revise and extend their remarks on the  resolution now under consideration.  The SPEAKER. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  California?  There was no objection.  ",1986
118,600,1,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, as a nation we  may never be able to measure the extent of  our loss from  today's tragic explosion of the  space shuttle Challenger. This  tragedy has  robbed us of  the  lives of seven American  heroes-the shuttle  crew members.  It has  turned hope into tears for thousands of school  children who were thrilled with the expectation  of a classroom  from space. And  it has sent  the people of our country into deep mourning  and sad  reflection. Each of us shares  the  pain.  The seven crew members gave their  lives  to America, and  it  is  important  to express  what this means to us. Since the founding of  our Nation, brave pioneers have risked  their  lives to conquer successive frontiers-and our  Nation has prospered and grown because of  them. Years ago  the  frontier was  the wild  West. Today it is space and technology. In the  truest sense of the word, each of these seven  crew members on the space shuttle Challeng er was an American pioneer. For they gave  their lives unlocking the mysteries of the heav ens-so that the rest of us could benefit from  the vast sources of knowledge to be gained.  We will remember their sacrifice.  To our Nation's honor roll we will add  the  names of Christa McAuliffe, the social studies  teacher from Concord, NH, who bravely ac cepted the role as the first ""common person""  to go up in space; retired Air Force Maj. Fran cis R. ""Dicky"" Scobee, the flight commander;  Navy Comdr. Michael J. Smith, the pilot; mis sion specialists Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair,  and Air Force Lt. Col. Ellison S. Onizuka; and  payload specialist,  from Hughes Aircraft Co.,  Greg Jarvis.  This was going to be a very special space  shuttle  flight. With  the presence of a high  school  teacher, Christa McAuliffe, and  the  planned classroom  from space,  this shuttle  was  really dedicated  to  the children of our  Nation-to  inspire  their  imagination and  lift  their eyes to the future. This makes the trage dy doubly sad.  I want  to extend my condolences  to  the  families and friends of the crew members, and  to offer them all the strength they need in the  difficult days ahead. My  thoughts are with  them.  ",1986
119,600,1,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join with millions of Americans-young and  old-in expressing our sorrow and grief over  the  tragic  loss of  the seven astronauts  this  morning aboard the space shuttle Challenger.  My  thoughts and prayers go out  today  to  the  families and  loved ones of  these seven  heroes. We mourn them in death and we vow  never to forget the lessons they taught us in  life-that we must  reach  for  the stars and  seize . all the opportunities and challenges we  can.  As we grieve today for the six professional  astronauts who were on board the Challenger,  we each share special sorrow at  the  tragic  death of Christa McAuliffe who was to be the  first teacher in space.  While I did not know Mrs. McAuliffe person ally, I certainly knew of her.  I knew that she  and her husband once lived in Maryland and I  knew  that she came back  to our State  this  past fall to speak to students and teachers in  Prince Georges County where she once lived  and taught.  During her remarks last fall, Christa McAu liffe told the teachers and students of Prince  Georges County how proud she was to have  been selected to represent her profession and  her Nation on a space shuttle flight. She chal lenged teachers and students alike to ""reach  for the stars"" in everything they do; she urged  them to always do the best they can and  to  be true to themselves.  Christa McAuliffe said she is in  touch with  the future every day because she is a teacher,  touching the lives of the very people who rep resent our future-our students.  These seven heroes died today not as indi viduals but as a team. They represented the  best America has to offer; they embodied the  same spirit, energy and  life  that President  Kennedy saw in all of us when he called us to  reach for new frontiers.  President Kennedy wasn't  just calling on  our astronauts to seek these new frontiers, he  was calling on all of us. He would have been  as proud of these seven heroes as all of us  are,  he would  have mourned  their  tragic  deaths, and he would have urged us to contin ue to ""reach for the stars"" and so do I.  ",1986
120,600,1,Mr. STANGELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  I share  the  shock and  sadness  felt by  the entire  Nation over  the  loss of  the space shuttle  Challenger and  its crew of seven astronauts.  The men and women who go into space are  special people.  I have met with former astro nauts in Washington, and they are motivated  by a special sense of mission.  Today we  lost seven adventurers,  seven  heroes. In many ways, they represent the best  America has to offer. They were conscious of  the danger, but eager to push back the limits  of human knowledge.  Our prayers are with  the souls of the  crew and with their families.  lost  There should be a comprehensive NASA in vestigation of  the  fiery explosion which de stroyed  the spacecraft. But  I emphasize  the  need to continue the space program.  We must mourn our dead, take care of their  families,  learn from  the tragedy, and turn our  eyes to the stars again.  ",1986
121,600,1,Mr. TALLON.," Mr. Speaker,  this  is a very  tragic day in American history. It is especially  difficult for those of us in South Carolina and  the Sixth Congressional District who knew and  admired Astronaut Dr. Ronald McNair of Lake  City.  I want to extend  to his devoted family my  deepest sympathy. They will  certainly  face  some difficult hours in the days ahead. If there  is any consolation,  I hope they will remember  that Ron McNair was a pioneer. He gave his  life in service to our country.  Ron McNair  represented  the very best of  this Nation-in spirit, courage,  intellect, and  dedication. Those are fine qualities and having  had  the good  fortune  to meet Dr. McNair,  I  want to assure you  that he embodied all of  these characteristics.  When I met him in February of 1984, I was  very  impressed.  In addition to his keen  intel lect, Dr. McNair was a kind, humble, and very  genuine human being.  I want to again express my sympathy to Dr.  McNair's family and  to all of the  families of  the astronauts aboard the mission.  In Dr. McNair, we have lost a gifted scien tist, a  talented  individual, and a dedicated  American-we have lost a giant among men.  ",1986
122,600,1,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, the tragic death  of the space shuttle astronauts touches each  of us  in a very personal and emotional way.  As a nation, we share a great sense of loss.  These pioneers carried with them the hopes  and  dreams  of  all  Americans. We  draw  strength from their courage.  ",1986
123,600,1,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, at  11 :38  this morning, a group of seven astro nauts on the space shuttle Challenger, includ ing  the  first private citizen,  teacher Christa  McAuliffe, lost their lives in a terrible accident  some 9 miles above the coast of Cape Canav eral. Words cannot express  the grief  that  I  and all Americans  feel  for  these  individuals,  and their loved ones.  After 24  successful  shuttle  flights, many  Americans took the frequent flights as routine.  I can guarantee you,  the men and women  who participated in every one of the previous  24 missions understood the dangers involved,  and they proceeded undaunted.  As we have become accustomed  to  their  successes, we tend to forget that these astro nauts risk  their  lives each time they step on  board. Our Nation has reaped the benefits of  their courage. We owe it to  those lost today  that every effort be made to understand the  circumstances behind the events of this morn ing.  ",1986
124,600,1,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker, along with all of  my colleagues,  I am deeply saddened at the  loss of the Challenger crew members in  this  morning's tragic accident. Our Nation will long  mourn the passing of these brave and coura geous young Americans who  lost  their  lives  serving their country's space exploration pro gram.  ",1986
125,613,1,Mr. MELCHER.," Madam President,  next week on February 7 the people of  the Philippines go to the polls to vote  in  the  first Presidential election  in  years to determine the future of their  republic.  I believe it is clear to Americans and  Filipinos alike that the time has come  for changes  in  their government  to  turn  around  the  growing  economic  hardships,  the military  abuses,  and  the use of extraordinary constitution al powers  to restrict  individual free doms.  For the past 18 months or longer, re lations with the Philippines have been  misguided. The State Department has  blocked sales of wheat, dairy products,  and other goods while orchestrating a  chorus of charges of corruption about  the election process and the principals  involved. Further,  the State Depart ment,  in pursuit of  their  ill-defined  policy  of  goals  and objectives, has  alienated  Filipinos  and  damaged  United States producers. This course  loses sight of  the objectives of  the  election  itself. We are  focusing  too  closely on February 7 and not enough  on February 8 and beyond.  While the end of the Marcos 20-year  regime appears to be desirable, it is a  decision for the Filipinos to make-not  for the United States to dictate. We do  have a vital stake in the outcome of  the  election. Paramount  in United  States vital interests are the strategic  location of the Philippines for United  States  trade and military bases and  neither of these interests is served by  the nitty-gritty of political partisan ship.  Retaining  our  strategic  military  bases at Subic Bay  and Clark Air  Force Base  is essential regardless of  who will  lead  that Pacific  nation.  There are no worthy substitute base  locations in any other islands of the  far western rim of the Pacific.  For trade, the United States domi nates the Pacific rim and the gateway  to Southeast Asian trade in the Philip pines. With 54 million persons,  it is  the leading market for U.S. agricultur",1986
126,639,1,Mr.  DECONCINI.," Mr.  President,  words fail to describe my emotions as  we discuss the loss of the entire space  shuttle Challenger crew. There is no  easy way to relay the feelings we all  felt upon hearing the news of the ex plosion of the shuttle. In the pit of  our stomachs something clenches and  will not unclench.  Perhaps we had forgotten that the  paths to the heavens are treacherous.  Man's fallibility and our inability  to  completely control our surroundings  has been proven yet  again.  I  had  begun to take space travel for granted,  perhaps many of us have. In the early  days of our Space Program, we had a  healthy fear of space and space travel.  Recently, we had begun to think of it  as safe. Clearly, we need  to rethink  that notion.  One of the things that has distin guished America as a nation has been  our willingness  to hide nothing-nei ther our victories nor def eats. In this  hour of def eat, we must commit our selves to finding answers to what has  happened  today.  In  that  regard,  I  would urge the President to delay all  further shuttle missions until we com pletely understand what caused  this  tragedy. At the same  time, we must  move ahead cautiously and not aban don our commitment to exploration of  the vastness that surrounds us.  My deepest sorrow today is for the  families of those who died in today's  explosion. We grieve as a nation and  as individuals knowing, but not fully  comprehending,  the  pain  that  the  families and friends of the members of  the Challenger crew are experiencing.  To them, I extend my heartfelt sym pathy and my prayers.  It is appropriate that the Senate re cessed early today, and it is appropri ate that the President has canceled  today's State of the Union Address so  we can grieve as a nation and as mem bers of the family of man.  ",1986
127,639,1,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, we  are stunned and deeply saddened by  today's event at Cape Canaveral.  The  loss  of  the  seven men  and  women aboard the shuttle is a tragedy  which  touches  all Americans. They  were individuals of vigor, accomplish ment, and hope, who represented the  best of America.  Mr.  President,  those  who  have  sought to advance the frontiers of our  knowledge, to expand our understand ing of science and our environment,  have always undertaken extraordinary  risks. The Challenger team followed in  that tradition of courageous  individ uals dedicated to a better world and a  brighter future.  Mr. President, as the Nation honors  these  brave men  and women,  our  thoughts and prayers are with their  families  and  their  communities  to  whom they gave so much.  ",1986
128,639,1,Mrs.  HAWKINS.," Mr.  President,  today all of us are extremely moved by  the tragedy at Cape Canaveral. The  Shuttle Program has been fate  free  for 24 flights. But today, on perhaps  the most  highly  publicized  flight,  seven of America's finest have  lost  their lives.  What was projected to be a coup for  the educational community, our chil dren, and teachers nationwide, has re sulted in the fate of a  teacher from  Concord, NH, Sharon Christa McAu liffe. Christa was selected from among  over  11,000  applicants  to  represent  teachers nationwide. She had been  studying since September 1985, to de velop the lesson plans for two classes  that she was  to have  taught  from  space. Thousands  of  schoolchildren  nationwide  eagerly  anticipated  this  new dimension in their learning.  When Christa was selected last year,  educational  associations  nationwide  banded together with pride to encour age  teachers  and  children  alike  to  keep their porch lights on from 7 p.m.  on Thursday evening until 7 a.m. on  Friday morning-the morning  that  Christa was scheduled  to  teach her  first lesson. In memory of the entire  crew, Americans are being encouraged  to keep those lights on. A tragic turn  of events.  Christa  represented  our Nation's  teachers extremely well. She exuded  confidence and a tremendous love for  learning. Her training, which included  instruction in weightlessness and con finement  in a black bag  to simulate  conditions in space, was a constant ad venture. And she was not willing  to  put herself in the limelight. Rather,  she gave constant credit to her fell ow  educators and astronauts.  I ask Americans nationwide to pray  for  the  immediate  families  of  the  seven  shuttle members. America  is  stunned by this event, and I hope and  pray that we would band together in  support of one another.  ",1986
129,639,1,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, like all  Americans and all people around the  globe who  recognize  the  value  of  human life, I was filled with complete  and total shock when I first learned of  the horrible tragedy which struck the  space shuttle Challenger and its seven member crew. The memory of this dis aster will remain with us always, as  will  the dreadful, sinking, emotional  feeling I am sure we all experienced as  we learned of the explosion.  We have not yet learned all the de tails of the tragedy. We still do not  know what caused  the explosion or  what could have been done to prevent  it. We can be certain, however,  that  the incident will be probed and investi gated until we have learned all that  can be learned. I have always been a  fervent supporter of our Space Pro gram, but,  in our quest  for  further  learning about the Moon, the planets,  and the stars, we cannot lose sight of  the necessity of taking every possible  safety precaution.  Just a little more than 19 years ago,  on January 27, 1967, three Apollo as tronauts were killed during a  test of  their spacecraft. In the wake of that  tragedy, which was the only previous  loss of life during training or perform ance of a NASA  flight, we basically  placed  the Space Program on hold  while  instituting greater safeguards.  Today, it is just as necessary that we  gain even greater strength from this  tragic occurrence, and I am fully confi dent  that NASA will  become  even  more determined than ever to fulfill  the greatest possible role in exploring  our  last  frontier  in  the  absolutely  safest environment possible.  The Space Shuttle Program  has  been one of the greatest technological  achievements  in the history of man kind,  and  all Americans have been  proud of the growth of the program.  We must not look at this tragedy as a  betrayal of the Shuttle Program, but  as a turning point for even greater ef forts.  In spite of this calamity, NASA has  had a remarkable record of safety and  efficiency.  One  cannot  witness  a  launch without  realizing  the danger  from  the  fire,  the  thrust,  and  the  power. Nevertheless, this horrible ex plosion should renew and strengthen  our efforts to protect human life as we  continue to explore the unknowns of  space.  The seven patrotic Americans who  lost their lives during this tragic acci dent-Francis <Dick) Scobee, Michael  Smith, Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik,  Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and  Christa McAuliff e-will always live in  our memories. Their efforts on behalf  of our Space Program must not go un noticed or unrewarded; it would be a  fitting legacy, one of which I am sure  they would be proud, for us to learn  from and grow because of their loss,  for then they will surely not have died  in vain. To  their  loved ones,  their  friends,  their  coworkers,  go  our  thoughts and our prayers.  ",1986
130,639,1,Mr.  HOLLINGS.,"  Mr.  President,  today is a sad day in the U.S. Space  Program. The tragic explosion of the  shuttle orbiter Challenger this morn ing has shocked the Nation and has  dealt a  severe blow  to  the Nation's  Space Program.  I should like to express my heartfelt  sympathy to the families of the shut tle crew of mission 51-L. Dick Scobee,  Michael Smith, Judith Resnik, Ronald  McNair,  Ellison  Onizuka,  Gregory  Jarvis, and Christa McAuliff e will not  be forgotten, nor will their dreams and  aspirations. Man will  continue  to  voyage  into space and to respond to  the challenges of new frontiers. Unfor tunately,  seven  of America's  finest  have been lost to space and our space  effort.  ",1986
131,678,1,Mr. SWIFT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from New  York [Mr. BIAGGI].  ",1986
132,678,1,Mr. BIAGGI.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise as a cosponsor  and supporter of this bill, H.R. 3525,  to  establish  a  uniform poll  closing  time for Presidential general elections.  The notion of same-time voting has  long appealed  to me.  In fact,  I  au thored a  bill  in 1980 providing  for  same-time voting in Presidential elec tions and I have been advocating the  idea ever since. My support for same time voting is based on a firm belief  that we must do everything possible to  overcome  controllable  obstacles  to  voting. Quite frankly, the voter turn out rate in our Nation, which is barely  50 percent in Presidential elections, is  a disgrace.  I am convinced that there is a direct  link between the elimination of early  election  projections  and  increased  voter  turnout. One study, conducted  by  the University of Michigan, con cluded  that  the early projection  in  1980 resulted in a 6to 11-percent de cline in overall voter turnout.  Now, thanks to the deep concern and  tireless work  of  the  distinguished  chairman of the Elections Subcommit tee, Mr. SWIFT, and the ranking mi nority member, Mr. THOMAS, a sensible  and workable solution  is before us.  They have pressured the major net works into pledging not to make pro jections based on exit polls until the  polling places are closed. If this pledge  is coupled with a uniform poll closing  time, as proposed  in H.R. 3525,  the  problem of early election projections  would be eliminated. That is an objec tive worth achieving and I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting for this  very responsible measure.  But,  let me  add  that while  this  change should help to increase voter  turnout, this modest reform must not  be the end of our efforts to stimulate  voter participation. A more con:ipre hensive plan deserves our priority at tention and such reforms as Sunday  elections and 24-hour voting should be  given serious consideration.  The previous speakers, Mr. Chair man,  addressed  themselves  to  the  States of Hawaii and Alaska, and we  realize they are distinguished because  of the location and the time zones in volved, and they pose a problem. The  committee has dealt with that. And in  this case, there is no possible universal  legislation that could address the 50  States. But for those two States, the  program will not impose any hardship,  will not increase any cost. We have  had hearings in the past, when most  witnesses  testified  there would  be  little or no additional cost.  So most of the arguments that have  been offered by those who oppose this  legislation are specious, at best, when  you consider the overall principle of  providing an election process that per mits every person's vote to be as valua ble as  the other, whether it be the  first or the last.  I strongly urge the passage of this  legislation.  ",1986
133,678,1,Mr. THOMAS  of California.," Mr.  Chairman,  I yield 2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Washington  CMr.  MILLER].  ",1986
134,678,1,Mr. MILLER of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I rise in support of this bill.  I want to congratulate my colleague,  the gentleman from Washington CMr.  SWIFT], for his fine work in addressing  a very difficult problem.  Mr. Chairman, throughout the his tory of this Nation, we have battled to  preserve the right of every American  citizen to cast his or her ballot freely  and without any undue  interference  on election day. The battle started  back in the l 700's at the Constitution al Convention. Then  in  the  early  1800's  there was  a  battle  against  having property rights interfere with  voting. And  then  the battle against  having race interfere with voting. And  then  the battle against having  sex  interfere with voting.  Well, those were battles against too  little knowledge, ignorance, prejudice.  Today we have a new obstacle to the  right to vote. Instead of knowing too  little, today we know too much. New  techniques have created a technologi cal global village where there are in stant error-free election predictions,  where the news media competes with  each other to put out the news so that  we know instantly across the Nation  who is going to win, and the would-be  voter on the west coast is very discour aged from voting, from exercising that  franchise that we have fought for.  My colleague, who not coincidently  is himself a former broadcast journal ist, has found a cure for the problem,  and it is a cure that is not as bad or  worse than the disease. This bill, by  extending daylight savings  time and  modifying poll closings is a thoughful  and effective answer to our dilemma.  I believe this bill deserves our sup port and it continues that fight that  started hundreds of years ago to make  sure that all of us have a right to vote  without interference.  ",1986
135,678,1,Mr. SWIFT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 2% minutes.  Mr. Chairman, a number of points  have been raised, and I think when we  get to the amending process we will be  able to go into these in greater detail,  but a number of points have been  raised that simply are not true.  First of all, the concern on the west  coast and across the country has been  characterized as scattered complaints  on the west coast. I would point out  that, first of all, it was an uproar and  not scattered complaints. And, second,  I would point out that after the TV  Guide ran a series of articles in two  editions,  they suggested that anyone  who  is concerned with  the problem  write our subcommittee, and we  re ceived hundreds and hundreds of re sponses. They came from 49 of the 50  States. And out of all of the responses  we have had, only four suggested we  should not deal with the problem.  We have heard that there is only an ecdotal  evidence. Well,  there  have  been a number of studies, and one  that has gone so far as to indicate that  among people who  intended  to vote  and had not voted by 6 o'clock in 1980,  fully 25 percent did not go to the polls.  People quibbled with  that. There  have been other ones. And you can  always quibble with a poll. But what  there is consensus on is that you can  demonstrate at least a 2-percent drop off. I do not believe anyone can say in  a democratic society that 2 percent of  the electorate is de minimis.  The transportation system,  that is  way overblown. We are talking about  problems  that may occur during 1  hour of the day at perhaps six air ports, and we have looked into it and  in each  instance  that can be  taken  care of. That is the greatest straw dog  of them all.  And,  finally,  I would  like  to point  out that  there has been much said  here about the increased cost and that  they will have to go too long, in double  shifts, and so forth.  One of the things about this propos al is that it does not require of any  State  to  do  something  that  some  States do not do now. It requires no  State  to be open  longer  than some  States do now.  It does not  require  them  to stay open  later  than some  States do  now. The  concerns with  double shifting are not legitimate con cerns. There will be no need for double  shifting because States currently are  able  to make  this work,  there  is no  double shifting anywhere  in  the 50  States of the United States now, and  this bill will not require of any State  that kind of an extraordinary effort.  So the points that are being raised  are points that I think are being raised  because of sincere concern but they  are not of accurate concern.  ",1986

150,730,1,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President,  I would  like to share with my colleagues an ex cellent  article  about Mrs.  Christa  McAuliff e, who died  in yesterday's  tragic explosion of the space shuttle  Challenger.  The article was written by a reporter  who met her briefly before her final  selection  from among  thousands of  teachers to be the first private civilian  in space.  John E. Mulligan, manager of the  Providence  Journal's  Washington  Bureau, met Mrs. McAuliff e for about  2 hours in a small Capitol Hill office  with dozens of other reporters but she  made a lasting impression.  Mrs. McAuliff e left, as part of her  legacy, the clear picture of an unas suming, enthusiastic teacher who en joyed her work with children every bit  as much as her work preparing  to  teach them about space flight.  She appeared to ""have been plucked  from our midst"" to be as member of  the space shuttle Challenger crew, but  she  clearly was  an  extraordinary  person.  I ask unanimous consent that the ar ticle from today's Providence Journal,  ""Recalling the Girl Next Door,"" by  John E. Mulligan, be printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:    RECALLING THE GIRL NEXT DooR  <By John E. Mulligan>  WASHINGTON.-! met the woman months  ago for a total of maybe two hours' time,  most of it shared by dozens of other report ers. So why do I feel as if I Just lost a sister?  I  When Christa McAuliffe greeted me in a  little Capitol Hill office last July 18, I mis took her for the receptionist. She smiled,  showed me to a seat and asked how she  could help while I waited to interview Dick  Methia,  the New Bedford  teacher among  the finalists vying for the chance to be the  first private citizen in space.  We chatted for a few minutes before Mrs.  McAuliffe got around to introducing herself  as another of the 10 chosen from among  11,000 teachers.  She's not the one,  thought  instantly,  Too sweet,  too unassuming,  too down-to earth to match the right-stuff macho we  seem to associate with the space program .  But the next day at the White House,  Vice President Bush announced  that the  sunny-faced woman in the mustard Jacket  was indeed the one. Score one for the plain  people, I  thought, and I wasn't alone. The  social studies teacher from Concord <N.H.>  High was an obvious favorite with her com petitors and with the reporters and officials  who knew her.  Mrs. McAuliffe's first impulse was a ges ture to the others who had made it through  the space agency's exacting selection proc ess. ""I've made nine wonderful friends over  the past two weeks,"" she said with some  tears, ""and when that shuttle goes,  there  may be one body but there's gonna be 10  souls I'm taking with me.""  Coming from the skilled politicians who  do most of the talking in  this city,  that  could have seemed contrived. Coming from  Mrs. McAuliffe in the unmistakable accents  of her native Boston, it was touching.  Coming back to me from the pages of my  notebook yesterday, it was-like every detail  of the disaster-monstrously ironic.  It took a dozen viewings, it seemed, for me  to get past  the surface of  the  televised  image, the cruel beauty of the fireball and  the  smoke  plume  etching  themselves  against the blue.  To watch the faces of Christa McAuliffe's  students at Concord High School was  to  know  that their young memories will be  etched with  that  image  like mine was  etched one eighth-grade afternoon with the  image of Jacqueline Kennedy's blood-spat tered pink suit and pillbox hat.  It's been a good few years, I realized last  July at the White House, since I've paid  much attention to the space program. But  the selection of Christa McAuliffe made  perfection of President Reagan's masterly  decision to make a teacher, of all people, the  first ordinary citizen in space.  The space agency doesn't tell how it se lects the shuttle travelers and it must have  been tough to choose these 10 uniformly at tractive and bright personalities  from  a  most slighted profession. But I fancied that  Christa McAuliffe stood out because in her  mind teaching was so clearly as noble a pro fession as space flight.  Each candidate had to propose a personal  project for the shuttle flight. Mrs. McAu liffe's was disarmingly straightforward and  teacherly. Like the pioneer women crossing  the prairies in their Conestogas more than a  century ago, she said, ""she would keep a  Journal of an ordinary person's perspective  of history.''  She said she wanted to teach the children  that ""the space program belongs to them  and to try to bring them up with the space  program"" by answering the children's ques tions. ""How's the food have to be different?  How's the toilet have to be different?"" she  wondered.  ",1986

155,743,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  my distinguished colleague from Mis souri just said that I was wrong in in dicating that cancellation of a debt is  not income to the shareholders. That  very likely may be the fact. But can cellation of a debt owed b  a corpora tion is income to the corporation be cause what happens is the corporation  1 day owes, let us say, $1 billion. If the  next day it does not owe $1 billion,  then it has an income item that has to  show up somewhere.  The fact is, as I understand the tax  laws, that would otherwise be income  to  the corporation, and it would be  taxable income. I am not prepared to  debate  the tax laws of  this country  with my colleague. But I do believe  that when he talks about it not being  income to the shareholders, that very  well may be the fact. But I do believe  that it is probably income to the cor poration absent the warranty that is  provided for in the memorandum of  agreement.  I  respect  the chairman of the Fi nance Committee when he spoke tne  other day, but I  just would  like  to  make some clarifications because I do  not think that he was fully knowledge able as to exactly what the situation is  as it pertains to this particular trans action.

159,769,1,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, I rise as a  cosponsor of this amendment which in  my view  is  an  absolutely  essential  amendment. This amendment provides  us with the opportunity on the floor  to rewrite a flawed piece of legislation,  a piece of legislation that, were we to  allow  it  to go  through  the Senate,  would seriously  jeopardize not only  the jobs of many people but, most im portantly, would be a step backward in  helping  to  frame a  competitive  rail  transportation network in this coun try.  At the same time, the bill before the  Senate, offered by the Senate Com merce Committee, is a bad deal for our  taxpayers. It is not the best deal on  the table in terms of what others have  offered. It allows a back-door tax bo nanza to the Norfolk Southern Corp.  If you are Norfolk Southern, it is one  of the great all-time bargain purchases  that has ever been consummated.  Of course, if this were just between  private parties, we would not take an  interest  in  that. But the  trouble  is  that it is not between private parties.  It  involves  the  American  public,  which, since 1976, has invested $7 bil lion in the Consolidated Rail Corpora tion.  Anybody who can buy a $7 billion in vestment that is making $400 or $500  million a year, get $400 million worth  of tax advantages, pick up at the same  time more than $900 million worth of  cash, for a purchase price of $1.2 bil lion, has what we would conservatively  call a sweet deal. But it is a bad deal  for the American taxpayer. It is a bad  deal  for  people who  depend  upon  having a competitive rail transporta tion network.  It is a bad deal for those industries  that are transportation sensitive, and  we have many, as I will enlarge upon  in a moment; and I suppose, worst of  all, there is no compelling reason for  us to be stampeded into making a deal  that is not in the best interests of the  taxpayers or transportation policy.  We might reflect for a moment on  why we are going through this. We are  71-059 0-87-25 (Pt. 1)  ",1986

162,782,1,Mr. HARKIN.,"  I  thank the distin guished Senator  from Michigan  for  yielding.  I want to compliment him on his re marks. I have been listening to this  entire debate. A lot of Senators have  made very good statements, and have  pointed out the essential flaws in this  proposal of Norfolk Southern. I think  the distinguished Senator from Michi gan, as he has so often done in the  past, in the closing hours of debate,  really put it all together. He has asked  the essential question, ""Why? Why are  we doing this?""  I am going to ask unanimous consent  on my own time later to insert an edi torial that was in the Des Moines Reg ister yesterday. The editorial  talked  about how bad the deal is going to be  for the State of Iowa in terms of sell ing Conrail to Norfolk Southern. The  editorial writer said the Secretary of  Transportation ""engineered the nego tiated sale for $1.2 billion despite a  later better offer of $1.4 billion that  would keep Conrail intact. She has in vested too much prestige in the deal to  back away from it."" Those are not my  words. Those are the words of the edi torial.  Is that what we are being asked to  do here,  to sell  this  the  lowest  bidder,  sacrifice  this  additional  the Senator  to  to  money that we can raise for the tax payers because of the invested efforts  in it? I mean, is that what we are being  asked to do? Is that the reason?  ",1986
163,782,1,Mr. RIEGLE.,"  If the Senator  is  posing  that as a question,  I would  hope not.  I have enormous professional regard  for the Secretary of Transportation as  well as enormous personal regard. I  would not in any way attempt to char acterize her position other than being  what she thinks is right, and what is  sound.  But I will say this: The bureaucrats  who are involved in this, have their  fingerprints  all  over  it,  and  have  gotten themselves out on a  limb on  this issue simply do not have the facts  on their side.  I just do not know how we tum to  the American people  today, and ask  them to take less than full value for  something that belongs to them.  If we make this judgment this way, I  think we will have acted improperly.  This is not the way it works in the  stock market or any other place.  I  hear  talk  about  free markets,  and  open markets. And I believe in them.  If you are going to sell something, and  a public asset, why in the world is it  you do not  sell  it  to  the highest  bidder? Why is it under any set of cir cumstances you sell to the low bidder?  Some might say, well, there are other  factors involved. There are other fac tors  involved. Let us  take a  look at  them because every single one cuts on  it the other way.  What about  the competitive prob lem? I asked, in the Commerce Com mittee and  the Justice Department.  They are involved in a million and one  things. Have they gotten their work  done to give us a final Justice Depart ment approval to the effect that this  union of Conrail and Norfolk South ern would not be anticompetitive  to  the commerce of this country?  Frankly, I must say, we were given  an assurance, what I took for an assur ance, in the committee that this issue  would not come to the Senate floor  until we had that kind of an ironclad  approval  from  the  Justice Depart ment. I will tell you, we do not have it  today. We do not have it as we stand  here.  Frankly, it is not right that we are  here without it.  I will tell you why we do not have it:  because it is anti-competitive and they  cannot make the proper finding,  the  proper ascertainment, to the contrary.  So they are holding back. The effort is  being made to sort of rush this thing  on through.  Frankly, it is an embarrassment. It is  an embarrassment to the Senate and I  think it is an embarrassment to the  committee that we are here without  that final judgment, making it clear as  a bell, putting the Justice Department  on record, that no antitrust problems  exist.  That cuts against accepting this Nor folk Southern off er or whoever else  might be making  it  in  their  .stead  under the same circumstances.  You might say, well, what about the  operating plan? We  inquired about  that. When we were in the committee,  there was no operating plan. I asked  for it repeatedly. They said they were  developing the operating plan. They  did not have  it yet. Quite  frankly,  there were efforts going on to do a  little bit over here to try to satisfy one  Senator, do a little manipulation over  here to satisfy another Senator, an other area, a few customers here and  there to try to develop support along  the line.  We do not have an operating plan as  of this day. We do not have a full op erating plan. Yet, we are being asked  to make a  final  judgment and sell  these assets off at less than full value.  Does that distinguish us as a body in  terms of the kind of care with our  work that we should be taking? I think  not.  What about the labor agreements?  There are a lot of jobs involved here.  A lot of people have devoted their life  to railroading, not just in the top of  these companies but down  through  the ranks. What will happen to the  jobs of these different rail companies  that are affected. Some are  in my  area. But to all of them, have we an  answer for that?  I asked the question in the commit tee hearings, what was the labor plan  that was being put forward by the ad ministration  and by  this presumed  buyer that was being favored, namely  Norfolk Southern?  I was told, ""Well, that will be taken  care of."" One can read the committee  record and see for  themselves  those  kinds of assertions were made. They  were misleading. They were assertions  that were made because without any  firm understandings and there are no  agreements today on the labor issue.  Where are we  tonight? We do not  have clear answers on the labor situa tion. What is going to happen to the  jobs involved? We do not have clear,  final and clear, answers on the anti competitive side of this puzzle. We do  not have that either.  Plus, we  have  a  situation where  there is such a wide disparity in the  numbers that anybody who does not  have a particular angle on this thing  who would look at it cold would say:  ""Something is wrong here. Why are  we  selling  these assets  to  the  low  bidder and at less than full value when  we have other serious bidders there  who have more money on the table?""  Well,  the bottom line is  there are  not any good answers. There are no  good answers because this is a bad rec ommendation. It has a bad smell be",1986
164,795,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, for  the workers of this country who re cently lost their jobs to foreign compe tition, the Christmas just past was not  merry;  the  new  year  not  happy.  Indeed, the season was an especially  cold  one  for  an  estimated  workers  nationwide-about  1,000 in New York alone-who had lost  their jobs to foreign competition and  until last month were receiving cash  assistance under  the Trade Adjust ment Assistance Program.  On December 19, the Department of  Labor ceased paying the extended un employment benefits-trade readjust ment allowances-available to workers  under the TAA Program.  The result of the cutoff is clear. For  those who had failed  to  find a  job  using their existing skills or had not  completed training to learn new skills,  and had exhausted their regular un employment benefits, paying the rent  and putting food on the table became  a much more difficult proposition.  I might also note, Mr. President,  that technical and financial assistance  for firms that are trying to adapt and  adjust to import competition, by im proving their production processes or  changing  their  line  of work,  also  ceased on December 19. The Depart ment  of  Commerce-International  Trade Administration-notified the 13  regional  trade adjustment assistance  centers-the administrative vehicle for  delivering  aid-that  no  additional  funds or technical assistance could be  granted, no new applications accepted,  and that phaseout plans must com mence as of February 7, 1986.

165,964,1,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  continuing the practice I started sever al days ago,  I wish  to  insert in the  RECORD an interesting and challenging  article by Mr. William Lind, who has  served Senator HART as a military ad viser for a good number of years.  His title is ""JCS Reform: Can Con gress Take On a Tough One?""  This will point up, again, some of  the challenging  reasons  the Armed  Services  Committee  is  proposing  changes  in  the organizational struc ture of our military. I ask that the ar ticle be inserted in the RECORD.  The article follows:  [From Air University Review]  JCS REFORM: CAN CONGRESS TAKE ON A  TOUGH ONE?  <By William S. Lind)  One of the most important requirements  for victory in combat is a competent high  command. History is replete with examples  of good armies being defeated because of  bad  leadership at the highest level,  from  Carthage in the Second Punic War through  the British in the American Revolution and  the Confederacy  in  the Civil War to  the  Germans in World War II.  Do we have highly competent military  leadership today from the Joint Chiefs of  Staff <JCS>. our most senior military coun cil? Many observers think we do not. The  last really brilliant American military action  was the Inchon landing during the Korean  War. The JCS opposed it. During the Viet nam War.  the JCS consistently  failed  to  provide good advice. In his autobiography,  General William C. Westmoreland said that  ""no commander could ever hope for greater  support than I  received from . . . General  Wheeler and  the other members of  the  Joint Chiefs."" The support was, of course,  for a strategy that failed. The JCS blessed  the plan for the Iran raid, a plan so complex  that failure was inevitable. The hallmark of  JCS action has become, not competent plan ning, but ""pie dividing""-ensuring that each  service gets a piece of the action. Grenada  was the most recent case. The original plan  called for just the Navy and the Marines to  participate. But the JCS insisted that the  Army and Air Force be brought in also, so  they could get their share of the glory.  The root problem is that not only the JCS  but virtually all the upper echelons of our  military structure have become bureaucra cies.  In a  bureaucratic organization,  the  overall goals and purposes of  the institu tion-what it is supposed to accomplish in  the outside world-are broken down  into  ever-smaller  units  until  they  constitute  something one person can do, a job. The job  is precisely defined and in most cases nar rowly circumscribed. A variety of  formal  and <usually more powerful) informal sanc tions work to keep the individual's effort fo cused within the ""box"" that is his job.  In theory, all the boxes are linked in a  great chain which ensures that every  job  supports the institution's external goals and  purposes. But, in fact, something different  usually happens. The people in the institu tion must have some set of values in order,  if nothing else, to prioritize their time and  effort. They cannot focus on  the  institu tion's external goals and purposes; if they  do,  they quickly find  themselves overstep ping the bounds of their job description and  getting slapped down. Faced with this un pleasant prospect, they tend to adopt two  basic values. The first is personal career suc cess. The second is a tendency to see as most  important those things which take most of  their time.  What is the effect of these two values on  the way an institution functions? The deci sionmaking process comes to be dominated  not by questions relating to effectiveness in  the  external,  competitive world  but  by  intra-institutional considerations.  Why is this so? Because intra-institutional  issues-the office upstairs, the office down stairs,  the competing program, branch, or  service, etc.-take most of most people's  time. As people come <usually unconscious ly) to identify as most important the things  that take most of their time, these issues,  not the external world, become the bases of  their decisions. And since internal matters  are also  the most  important concerns of  their superiors, they can best advance their  personal careers by putting these matters  first and working hardest on  them. Ulti mately, they become accustomed to subordi nating  external  effectiveness  to pleasing  their superiors with reference  to  internal  matters. Those who don't do so pay  the  price in terms of career failure.  Both tendencies-careerism and seeing as  most important the matters that take the  most time-are accentuated in institutions  where there is no lateral entry <i.e., where  the people at the top have spent three or  four decades behaving this way) and where  there is no regular calling to account by an  annual balance sheet. Both characteristics  typify military services.  The JCS  is a microcosm of  the overall  military bureaucracy, but it is a very intense  microcosm. It is specifically designed to be  an arena where the services log-roll  their  parochial  interests. The  dual-hatting  of  service  chiefs  as members of  the  Joint  Chiefs, the requirement for unanimous deci sions, a  joint staff made of officers who  must  return  to  their parent services-all  these things not only perpetuate but intensify bureaucratic behavior. That the deci sions and  recommendations  from such a  body are frequently of little use in the out side world should not be surprising. The  focus on intra-institutional concerns is built  into the system.  JCS reform is now being discussed both in  Congress and in the press. Two of the most  important reasons are the disquiet of some  members of Congress with deficiencies  in  recent military operations  and  calls  for  reform  from  two  former  JCS members,  former Chairman of  the JCS, Air Force  General David Jones, and former Chief of  Staff of the Army, General Edward ""Shy""  Meyer. Within the last several years, these  two officers have made some sharp, public  criticisms of  the way  the JCS  functions.  General Jones has said:  ""The corporate advice provided by  the  Joint Chiefs of Staff is not crisp,  timely,  very useful, or very  influential. And that  advice is often watered down and issues are  papered over  in  the  interest of achieving  unanimity .... Individual service interests  too often dominate JCS recommendations  and actions at the expense of broader de fense interests.""  What must be done to give reasonable as surance of a competent high command? The  only adequate step is the replacement of the  entire Joint Staff system with a Prussian model general staff.  Some have attempted to portray a general  staff as a system that vests all power in one  individual. But that is not what the Prus sian general staff was all about. That did  occur under General Erich von Ludendorff  in the 1916-18 period, but it was a result of  a vacuum at the top caused by the personal  weakness of Kaiser Wilhelm II Cit has well  been said that Hitler listened to his generals  too little; the Kaiser to his too much).  To understand the essence of the Prussian  general staff, it is necessary to look at its  origin in the Scharnhorst reforms that fol lowed Prussia's disastrous defeat by Napo lean  in 1806. Scharnhorst and his fellow  military reformers-who were political liber als,  not  reactionary  Junkers-were  faced  with the task of creating enduring military  excellence within the framework of civilian  control of the military, in the person of the  King of Prussia. They attempted to create,  not a new command structure for the Prus sian army, but a system to provide the best  possible military advice to commanders at  all levels. The general staff was an advisory  system, not a command system. That is, of  course, exactly what we need from any re placement for the Joint Staff system: the  best possible advice  to  the civilians who  hold  the ultimate military authority,  the  President and the Secretary of Defense.  The Prussian general staff was  that  is  called a ""socialized,"" rather than a bureau cratic, organization.  Its socialization cen tered on three characteristics. The first was  very careful selection and education of staff  officers. General staff officers were selected  young,  usually  at  the  rank of  captain,  before the bureaucratic mindset had time to  develop. The selection process was extreme ly rigorous, with only about 1 percent of  those who attempted  to become general  staff officers finally making the grade. The  general staff was kept very small to ensure  quality and prevent bureaucracy: even at  the Wehrmacht's peak strength in World  War II, there were fewer than 1000 general  staff officers. The education process was  long and thorough, with emphasis on how  to think, not what to think, and on the mili tary  art, not management  and  formats.  ",1986
166,977,1,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, on Janu ary 20, we honored the memory of a  great fighter for  justice and human  rights,  the Reverend Martin Luther  King, Jr.  It so happened  that that  same day marked the 38th birthday of  another brave  champion of human  rights,  Anatoly  Shcharansky,  the  Soviet dissident. Mr. Shcharansky  is  serving a 13-year prison term because  of his outspoken defense of fundamen tal human freedoms.  Shcharansky had become the unoffi cial spokesman of the Jewish emigra tion movement in the U.S.S.R. when  he was arrested on March 15, 1977,  and charged with treason. Held incom municado for 16 months, he was tried  for alleged anti-Soviet agitation and  spying for the CIA in April 1978. In  July  of  that  year,  he  received  a  sentence of 3 years in prison and 10  years of forced labor.  After surviving the first part of his  punishment-a 3-year stint in the no torious  Chistopol  Prison-he  was  transferred to the Perm Labor Camp  where he continued to suffer official  abuse. At Perm in 1981 Shcharansky  was subjected to 185 days in a punish ment cell <where prisoners are  fed  once every 2 days) for a series of ""in fractions,"" including attempts to prac tice his  religion. This maltreatment  culminated  in October 1981 when a  three-man  kangaroo  court  decreed  that  in  retaliation  for  refusing  to  ""admit his guilt,"" Shcharansky be sent  back to Chistopol Prison for another 3  years.  To protest the cutting off of all com munication with his family, Shchar ansky went on a prolonged hunger  strike  in 1982. As a  result of  this  hunger strike and  the generally de plorable  conditions  of  his  confine ment, he has suffered serious health  problems.  Shcharansky is back in Perm Labor  Camp now, and his health continues  to deteriorate. Information received by  his wife early this year indicates that  he has been given an additional 5month sentence to be served in an iso lation cell within the labor camp. The  fact that he is still being punished for  ""infractions"" seems  to  indicate  that  his spirit has not been broken. The cir cumstances Shcharansky  has  faced  over the past 9 years would have de stroyed many other people. He  is  indeed an individual of rare courage  and strength of conviction.  Anatoly Shcharansky's only desire is  to be allowed to join his wife Avita! in  Israel. Since his imprisonment, count",1986
167,1003,1,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker, on December  20, 1985,  the House Banking, Finance and  Urban Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on  General Oversight and Investigations, which I  chair, convened in my hometown of Mayfield,  KY,  to hear  testimony  relative  to  the  farm  credit crisis and the problems of farmers.  Our subcommittee heard from nearly 40 wit nesses  including  farmers,  bankers, govern ment officials, and  representatives  from  the  Farm Credit System. However, one of  the  highlights of our hearing was  the  impromptu  testimony of Laura Anderson of Route 2, May field. Laura and her husband Tom are both  1971 graduates  from  the University of Ken tucky College of Engineering. This outstanding  couple has chosen farming as a livelihood, yet  it continues to be necessary for Laura to work  in management for South Central Bell in order  to complement their farming income.  Laura recently sent me a letter which  fur ther details her thoughts about possible solu tions  to  the problems  facing  the agricultural  sector.  I encourage my colleagues to read and con sider Laura Anderson's concerns and sugges tions. Her excellent letter follows:  Hon. CARROLL HUBBARD,  Rayburn House Office Building,  Washington, DC.  MAYFIELD, KY.  December 30, 1985.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN: We certainly appreci ate your public hearing in Mayfield. It is  difficult to testify at such a hearing without  emotion. I do not know if you are aware of  at lea.st one farm debt related suicide local ly. In spring, 1985, Bobby Knight, a farmer  in north Graves County, shot himself. This  fall his home,  farm and machinery were  sold at auction.  I spoke at the hearing, totally unprepared,  but emotionally driven to add to the record.  I spoke of the tools we use to aid our mar keting decisions. Enclosed is some of the in formation my husband and I gather and  study throughout the year. You will note  one thought about the farm bill stands out  clearly in all the reports. The market prices  for the 1986 new crop will be lower than the  current prices, worsening our situation. Like  other American businessmen we want  to  raise our crops and sell our products in an  open market. We do not want government  subsidies, deficiency payments or loan pro grams.  We have all  thought about solutions to  the farm crisis. I offer three solutions to the  three most troublesome areas.  1. INCREASED EXPORTS  We will have a very difficult time recover ing from Carter's grain embargo. Argentina,  Brazil, and other countries had  idle  land  cleared and planted with crops by entrepre neurs from all over the world. A real surplus  of grain exists. Why don't we send foreign  aid in food rather than dollars? The Federal  Government could buy the food on an open  market. Our dollars, <that we don't have?)  are used for weapons, and more likely than  not fall  into the hands of a few for their  own personal use.  2. LOWERED INTEREST RATES  The banks and savings and loans across  the country seemed  to have made great  profits in the pa.st few years. New elaborate  buildings, consolidation, buy outs, advertis ing all point to profitable times. Please note  the enclosed AP news article. Farmers have  checkoffs to support the American Soybean  Association and also participate in holding  funds for insurance against failure of grain  elevators. Why can't the banks and savings  and  loans participate  in a  checkoff plan  whereby a percentage <one-fourth, 1 per cent) of profits establishes a fund for the  PCA's and Federal Land Banks  to draw  upon for farm loans. The PCA's and FLB's  could borrow money from this fund at a low  interest rate and in return provide a low in terest  rate  to  the  farm  crop producers.  Within  time  the banks would  see  loans  repaid and even farmer savings accounts!  3. RESPECTABLE MARKETING SYSTEM  The management of the Chicago Board of  Trade is the main culprit here. Most of the  grain bought and sold is by people, corpora tions who never put out a crop, never take  delivery or know much about the agribusi ness. They  sell when  the market makes  them a profit and buy when grain is cheap,  driving prices lower. These moneychangers  manipulate the market on their terms while  the farmer must plant in the spring and  harvest in the fall. Can we not restrict the  manipulation of the market by registering  farm producers and legitimate grain buyers  as the participants in this game? The crop  producers are easily  identifiable  through  ASCS, PCA, FLB. The grain buyers must  1001  have taken delivery of grain either a speci fied number of times or a percentage of the  grain they bought.  My answers are simplistic, I know. Howev er, often we justify not trying by saying it  can't be done. While the new farm bill sends  a glimmer of light from Washington, it is  not the answer. For one who wants to till  the soil, the prospect of setting a.side good  productive  land and accepting money for  doing nothing is unacceptable. No, I don't  want to spend federal tax dollars to support  the farmer.  Again,  thank you for your effort.  I do  hope Congress continues to look for ways to  save the American farmer. Allowing farmers  to retain investment credit will help!  Yours truly,  LAURA ANDERSON.  DISMANTLING  THE MILITARYCONGRESSIONAL  COMPLEX:  THE  FIRST  LEGISLATIVE  STEPS  HON. JIM COURTER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 29, 1986  ",1986
168,1003,1,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, we are all fa miliar with  the wry saying:  ""Everybody com plains about  the weather but nobody does  anything about it."" The same might be said for  military reform. Many Senators and Congress men,  including myself,  have been working  hard in this area for several years now, but I  still have a nagging sense that we have failed  to get to the root causes of many of our mili tary difficulties.  I am today introducing two bills which, in my  view,  represent  the  first steps  toward  the  eventual dismantlement of what has been  called  the  ""military-congressional complex"";  that is, the collection of interconnected execu tive branch and congressional national securi ty entities which,  to a  large extent, dictates  how America will be defended. The following  is an overview of the problems caused by the  ""complex"" and an explanation of how my leg islation would attack the problem.  Over  the  last  two decades, we have wit nessed a well-intentioned series of efforts to  reform our military apparatus and increase its  combat effectiveness and peacetime efficien cy. Some of these reforms have succeeded;  others have not. The cumulative result, how ever, has been  the creation of a huge bu reaucracy  that  is slow, cumbersome,  ineffi cient, and frequently unaccountable to political  control. In the realm of defense procurement,  the disturbing examples of overpriced  items  result not from perturbations  in  the procure ment  system,  but,  paradoxically,  from  the  system  functioning according  to plan. When  simple procurement decisions are made by  dozens of Government officials  in different  agencies, we should not be surprised when  long  delays and  exorbitant  costs  are  the  common result.  The bureaucratic proliferation has occurred  on both sides of the Potomac. For its part, the  Congress has vastly expanded  its Pentagon  oversight activities since shortly after the Viet nam war. Congressional military  oversight  panels have ballooned from four committees  ",1986
169,1016,1,Mr. KRAMER.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  long  been a supporter of a strong synthetic fuels  program. During my first term  in Congress,  I  was honored to be the only Republican Rep resentative  from  the Rocky Mountain States  asked  to serve on  the  joint House-Senate  Energy Committee, which developed the legis lation that set up the Synthetic Fuels Corpora tion.  Following a commitment  from  the Federal  Government, western Colorado invested sub stantial  time and money  in an  infrastructure  which would support the needs of the Union  and Cathedrahl Bluffs oil shale projects.  Last month,  the Government  broke  promise to these Coloradans.  I would like to share with you an article from  the Dallas Morning News which accurately re flects my sentiment  in support of synthetic  fuels and the hard work of the SFC Chairman  Ed Noble. I ask that this information be print ed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  CFrom the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 15,  1986]  SYNTHETIC FuELS ENDEAVOR LEAVES  UNDETERMINED LEGACY  <By Jim Landers)  WASHINGTON.-Like a great elephant re peatedly wounded by hunters, Synthetic  its  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Fuel Corp. stayed on its feet for a long time  before a  final  javelin blow from Congress  last month brought it down.  The corporation was born in the 1980 Ira nian oil crisis and killed five years later by a  Congress more worried by budget deficits  than oil imports. It may take another five  years to discover how much of a contribu tion the corporation made to the country's  energy security by backing  four projects  with about $1.5 billion in federal funds, be cause that contribution is dependent on the  future course of oil prices.  If oil prices keep  falling,  the synthetic  fuels campaign of the 1980s will seem like a  waste of taxpayer money. The Reagan ad ministration under  the urging of Energy  Secretary James Herrington, adopted  this  view at a December Cabinet meeting.  ""The administration no  longer believes  continued funding of the Synthetic Fuels  Corp. serves any useful purpose,"" Budget  Director James Miller wrote Congress on  Dec. 12. The letter doomed the efforts of  some senators to keep the corporation alive.  If oil prices soar, then the four projects  backed by  the corporation could provide  energy companies with a quick means of de veloping plants  that  turn coal and shale  into oil and gas. Project sponsors and the  outgoing directors of the corporation have  taken  this view and expect  the country's  gratitude will be apparent  in another 10  years.  Together, the four projects backed by the  corporation are designed to add the equiva lent of 22,000 barrels a day of oil production  <current domestic projection is 8.9 million  barrels a day) to the nation's energy base.  The corporation spent far less money and  backed far fewer projects than its support ers envisioned. Six years ago, Congress and  the Carter administration talked of an $88  billion synthetic fuels effort. About $19 bil lion actually was appropriated by Congress,  and the corporation was given $15.3 billion  of that.  Synthetic Fuels Corp. chairman Edward  Noble acknowledged that falling prices un dermined the corporation, particularly the  initial  congressional mandate  to  finance  500,000 barrels per day of synthetic fuels  production by 1987 and 2 million barrels per  day by 1992.  But Noble said the corporation was able to  provide the country with a ""national securi ty insurance policy"" by fostering synthetic  fuels technologies.  One of those technologies is coal gasifica tion. When Synthetic Fuels Corp. was start ed, gas derived from coal was attractive be cause of pessimism about U.S. natural gas  reserves. Now that the pessimism about gas  reserves has dissipated, the technology used  in coal gasification is being viewed as a pos sible solution for acid rain.  And after Congress and the Reagan ad ministration last month decided the federal  government had no business spending bil lions of dollars on synthetic fuels, a  top  presidential adviser last week recommended  a $5 billion, five-year federal effort to devel op  technologies  to  reduce acid  rain  that  have many  similarities  to  the  synthetic  fuels effort.  Former Transportation Secretary Drew  Lewis, President Reagan's special represent ative on acid rain, made the recommenda tion on Jan. 9 at the conclusion of a year long U.S.-Canadian study of the problem.  Two of the four projects funded by Syn thetic Fuels Corp. are designed to transform  coal into energy-rich gas that can be burned  with a fraction of the air pollution generat ed by coal-fired boilers.  January 29, 1986  Dow Chemical Co. in Louisiana and a col lection of firms in California led by South ern California Edison Co. received $740 mil lion in Synthetic Fuels Corp. price guaran tees for two coal gasification projects. The  Dow Syngas project is expected to start op eration in 1987, while Southern California  Edison's Cool Water project has been turn ing coal into gas-and then gas into electric ity-for 18 months.  ""Cool Water is demonstrating the cleanest  way yet devised for burning coal,"" Noble  said. Several utilities have approached the  Cool Water consortium about licensing their  technology for other plants, he noted.  In  the bill  that killed Synthetic Fuels  Corp., Congress saved $400 million for clean  coal  technologies  development  by  the  Energy  Department  while  eliminating  nearly $7 billion in spending authority.  ""We  got  about  two-thirds  of  the  job  done."" Noble said. ""We still lack projects to  show us how to use Eastern coals and tar  sands, and we could have done more on  shale oil. If we'd had those other two or  three plants, we could have added all our  coal and oil shale to the nation's petroleum  reserves-five times the oil reserves of the  Middle East. As it is, we should be able to  add two or three times all the reserves in  the Middle East.""  John Howard, President of Greenwich Oil  Co. of Dallas, said the $60 million in loan  and price guarantees awarded to his compa ny by Synthetic Fuels Corp. in September  could add 10 billion barrels of thick, tarry  oil to the nation's useful oil reserves.  Greenwich Oil injects oxygen into a deep,  sandy oil formation in Wood County, Texas,  to produce an underground ""fire flood"" that  makes the oil fluid enough to pump to the  surface. The company hopes  to produce  about 1,600 barrels a day of useful crude oil  extracted with fire flooding.  Synthetic Fuels Corp. agreed to guarantee  Greenwich $40 per barrel for the first half  million barrels of oil lifted from the field by  fire flooding. The price guarantee is $22 per  barrel more than the current market price  for such heavy oil. But withoug the finan cial assistance, Howard said, Greenwich's  Forest Hill heavy oil project probably would  limp along  for several years, waiting  for  prices to rise, without ever demonstrating  the commercial feasibility of fire flooding.  ""I believe the day will come in the not-too distant future when we'll be back in a simi lar situation to what we went through in  the 1970s and 1980,"" Howard said. ""By 1990  or so, the United States once again will find  itself a massive importer of crude oil, vul nerable to offshore disruptions. Our tech nology will be available  then to anybody  who wants it.""  Noble  and Cantrell Exploration Co.,  a  Dallas oil firm competing with Greenwich  for heavy oil development, wrote Synthetic  Fuels Corp. objecting  to  the Greenwich's  use of federal finances, but Howard called  Forest Hill ""the best project ever brought to  the Synthetic Fuels Corp.""  ""This is an insurance policy and nothing  else,"" Noble said. ""If we don't need it, we  didn't spend that much money on it.""  ",1986
170,1029,1,Mr. MARTINEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportuntiy to bring to the attention  of my colleagues the distinguished career of  William Overmeer.  For  the past decade William  ""Bill"" Over meer has demonstrated outstanding service to  our community, as well as many adjoining  areas, with meritorious achievement. During  1 O years with  the West San Gabriel Valley  Consortium, Bill gave careful adherence to the  fiduciary responsibilities of his position. Being  a stickler for organization and  thoroughness,  Bill  implemented  high  standards,  reduced  costs, and maximized  the number of  local  residents trained.  In addition to his work with  the consortium, Mr. Overmeer spent 6 years  with United Community Efforts Inc. in East Los  Angeles.  In  the private sector, he performed  outstandingly as an assistant controller  for  two different public accounting firms.  Perhaps the greatest example of this man's  philanthropy  is  the 5 years he spent  in  the  Royal Dutch underground serving to eliminate  tyrannies  in Germany and Holland. Here we  find the intensity of this great American as he  stood tall to fight the terror of oppression and  represent  the principles of freedom and  jus tice.  Without hesitation and with much admiration  I salute a public servant; an man of great  moral character; and a man willing to uphold  qualities which separate the humane from the  inhumane. I salute William Overmeer.  AMERICANS FOR PRESIDENT  REAGAN'S FOREIGN POLICY  HON. WIWAM W. COBEY, JR.  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 29, 1986  ",1986
171,1029,1,Mr. COBEY.," Mr. Speaker, Americans  for  President Reagan's Foreign Policy have called  to my attention three articles from The Truth,  a New Hampshire newspaper officializing  in  foreign affairs matters. All Americans are af fected  for better or worse by U.S.  foreign  policy decisions. I believe that we all need to  be well informed about these policies in order  to protect not only our Nation, but our individ ual lives and property from the costs and perEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  sonal  dangers  generated  by  the  Soviet  Union's expansions and Soviet sponsored ter rorism.  Over the last 5 years, the Reagan adminis tration has demonstrated that it is committed  to  turning back  the Soviet-takeover  tide  in  Central America, Afghanistan, and southern  Africa.  I believe the two great foreign policy  problems confronting President Reagan today  are the Soviet efforts to expand their influence  in  the world and  the Soviet strategy enunci ated by  late Soviet  leader Krushchev, who  said ""* * * our aim  is to gain control of the  two great treasure houses on which the West  depends * * * oil  from  the Persian Gulf and  strategic minerals from southern Africa.""  Today we are seeing this dream become a  reality. Currently,  there  are around 35,000  Cuban troops occupying Angola on behalf of  the Soviet Union. These troops not only con trol  the Soviet-puppet government, but  they  also support the Soviet backed terrorist group  known as the Southwest African People Orga nization  [SWAPO].  This  organization  uses  Soviet military equipment under the guidance  of Soviet military advisers in a campaign of vi olence to gain control of the country of Na mibia before  the  recently  formed Namibian  Government can achieve  internationally ac cepted independence.  Within the broad framework of U.N. Resolu tion 435, the people of Namibia have chosen  their own political  leaders and have estab lished the Transitional Government of National  Unity. This democratic government assures all  powers of local self-determination by success fully negotiating a transfer of total local gov erning authority to the Namibian people from  South Africa.  I believe the United States should lend polit ical and economic support to this new govern ment in Namibia because it offers a responsi ble anti-Soviet Government, supported by the  people of Namibia, as a democratic alternative  to a puppet-state set up by SWAPO.  I recommend  the  following articles  to my  colleagues and other Americans who have an  interest  in  the  foreign policy of  the United  States.  [From The Truth, Winter 19861  STATE DEPARTMENT UNDER FIRE FOR NAMIBIA  POLICY  OPPOSES SELF-GOVERNMENT  WASHINGTON, DC.-The U.S. State Depart ment has come under direct attack by two  respected forces  regarding its handling of  Namibia, an African country  larger  than  Texas immediately south of Angola. Sena tor Steve Symms CR-ID) and Carl Shipley,  President of  the U.S.-South West Africa/  Namibia Trade and Cultural Council, both  lambast the State Department as ""archi tects of disaster""  for  their ""head  in  the  sand'' thinking regarding Namibia.  In articles below,  they present the true  picture of this virtually important, sparsely  populated  country, whose  people  desire  their own government, free of the Commu nist  influence  which  threatens  them  through SW APO <South West Angola Peo ples Organization>, backed by the Soviets  and the United Nations.  While the State Department encourages  U.S.  business  to  locate  in Communist  Angola, entrance into Namibia is discour aged. The State Department is still seeking  to effect U.N. Resolution 435, under which  1027  the U.N. would supervise an election of an  assembly  in Namibia. However, control of  this assembly would be seized by SW APO,  with  its U.N. backing. Shipley points out  that it is a blueprint for U.N. sponsorship of  a Soviet-puppet SW APO government in Na mibia.  FuRTHERS RED AIMS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA  <By Senator Steve Symms)  As a member of the Senate Subcommittee  on Economic Resources, Competitiveness  and Security Economics, I have long been  concerned with the fact that since 1970 the  U.S. Department of State has discouraged  investment in Namibia, at a time when po litical  leaders within  that Territory have  been trying to negotiate their independence  from South Africa.  Namibia has been administered for  the  past 65 years under a 1920 League of Na tions Mandate as a former German territory  conquered by the British (using South Afri can colonial  forces>  in World War  I. On  June 17 of this year, the Multi-Party Con ference of Namibia's internal political lead ers, all of whom have been elected or desig nated by  their political parties and  their  various population groups to represent their  interests,  persuaded  the Government  of  South Africa to transfer to the MPC all leg islative,  judicial  and  executive  functions  theretofore exercise in the territory by the  Administrator-General appointed by South  Africa.  The South African government voluntari ly,  and on  the basis of non-violent and  honest negotiations, agreed to the MPC re quest. Thus,  the people of Namibia now  enjoy all powers of  local self-government  <except foreign relations and defense, which  they voluntarily left in South African hands  because of  their own  lack of capacity  in  these areas)  for  the first  time since  the  original German colonization of South West  Africa in the 1800's.  However,  the same  type of head-in-the sand thinking that seems to be a congentia.l  affliction of bureaucrats in the U.S. Depart ment of State, and which has given us such  catastrophic  diplomatic  losses  as North  Korea, East Germany,  the Berlin Wall,  Soviet occupied Vietnam, Soviet occupied  Afghanistan,  and  Soviet-puppet  govern ments in Angola, Ethiopa., Mozambique and  North Yemen, now turns a blind eye on the  TGNU <Transitional Government of Nation al Unity) in Namibia..  Thus, our State Department is once a.gain  lending its indirect support to Soviet empire  expansionism in Africa by opposing recogni tion of the political reality of the TGNU,  opposing the right of self government of the  people of Namibia., and closing its eyes to  the fa.ct that the United Nations, the U.N.  Council  for Namibia., and  its subordinate  agencies all strongly support, both finan cially and politically, the Soviet-backed ter rorist forces seeking to seize control of Na mibia and bring it under the domination of  the Kremlin  before  that Territory  can  achieve  internationally  acceptable  inde pendence.  H.R. 2589 would apparently subject all  Americans, individual as well as corporate,  to five years in jail and fines ranging from  $50,000 to $1 million for using or dealing in  any product which might contain a ""natural  resource"" originating  in Namibia without  permission of the U.N.

176,1055,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman  and Members,  in the opinion of the  American  people,  a  public  health  menace of severe proportions  is now  facing the country, namely, the AIDS  crisis. In a recent poll, the AIDS epi demic in America ranks very close to  being the No. 1 public health problem  in the Nation. This amendment seeks  to address one of the policy options  that we can take in Congress to deal  with diminishing the transmission of  this fatal disease, namely, by saying to  any city  in America that chooses to  continue to receive its revenue-sharing  funds that it is going to have to shut  down its bathhouses.  These AIDS factories exist essential ly in three cities of the country: Los  Angeles,  San  Francisco,  and New  York. Those  three  cities  combined  produce about two-thirds of the AIDS  cases,  some  16,000,  so  far,  in  the  Nation, half of whom have died.  In my State of California we have  close to 100 bathhouses now operating.  We created this bathhouse culture in  this country in 1975  in the State of  California through the medium of re pealing  the  law proscribing sodomy,  and bathhouses proliferated after that  time when our culture said  to  the  people of the State of California, con doning  sodomy  and  such  activities,  that that is where the bathhouse cul ture came.  Medical experts tell us that AIDS, a  fatal disease for which no cure has yet  been developed, is transmitted sexual ly by anal intercourse, and we know  that that is what is going on at bath houses. There was a time in this coun try when you went to a bathhouse to  get a bath. But that is a very limited  activity  that goes on at bathhouses  today, and we all know it.  This just says, very simply, in order  to reduce the incidence of this fatal  disease, we will shut down the bath houses in the country. This Member  from California has  introduced  five  bills. One of them relates to this sub ject matter. It has been assigned to a  committee.  In writing,  I have asked  the chairman of this committee, the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations, to give a hearing on the bill,  but we are still waiting for when the  hearing will  take place.  Indeed,  this  Member from California is still wait ing for a response when a hearing will  take place.  So  I  have  no  other  alternative  except to watch for a health care vehi cle being processed through the House  of Representatives so that I will have  an opportunity of offering an amend ment to such a bill,  to give my col leagues an opportunity of voting on a  matter on which I know they yearn to  vote, because every Member  in  this  House, of course,  is  interested in re ducing the incidence of a fatal disease  and  improving  the  health  of  the  American people. I cannot think of a  better way to do both of those objec tives than to adopt this amendment.  POINT OF ORDER  The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentle man from California  [Mr. WAXMAN]  press his point of order?  ",1986
177,1055,1,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I do  assert my point of order.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  will state his point of order.  ",1986
178,1055,1,Mr. WAXMAN., The amendment is a  prohibition  for  the expenditures of  revenues under the Revenue Sharing  Act. It is not germane to the legisla tion before us.  The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentle man  from  California  [Mr.  DANNE MEYER] wish to be heard on the point  of order?  ,1986
179,1055,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Yes, I do, Mr.  Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, since the bill before  us now relates to a new program relat ing  to  the expenditure of  funds  to  reduce the suffering and improve the  care of the mentally  ill, does  it not  seem  logical  that we would add an  amendment that would reduce the in cidence of a disease that is fatal?  The CHAIRMAN [Mr. HUGHES]. The  Chair is prepared to rule on the point  of order.  General revenue sharing is a matter  that is within the jurisdiction of the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations. The bill in question deals with  mental health, not all public health.  For  the  reasons advanced by  the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  WAXMAN],  the point of order is well  taken and is sustained.  ",1986
180,1055,1,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  this  legislation which would provide  for  the protection and advocacy of  mentally  ill  persons. During  recent  hearings before Congress, the very se rious problems of abuse and neglect of  those individuals who have. been insti tutionalized  for mental  illness  and  those  individuals who have been re cently released from institutions were  brought to light. The inadequacies in  the present internal and volunteer pa tient  representative  programs were  outlined in detail by witnesses. These  inadequacies make it imperative that  we,  in  this body, support legislation  calling  for  the protection  and  im proved advocacy services for the men tally ill.  We, in Congress, last addressed this  issue through enactment of the Devel opmental Disabilities Assistance Bill  ",1986
181,1159,1,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, I would  like to take this opportunity on behalf  of Senator SIMON and myself, to call  the Senate's attention to an individual  who, after 46 years of reporting and  journalistic leadership, is retiring.  I refer, Mr. President, to Mr. Forrest  Kilmer,  editor  of  the  Quad-City  Times, who is highly respected in our  State  for his commitment  to excel lence in journalism.  Forrest Kilmer's dedication  to his  profession and to his community have  extended over his entire adult lifetime.  He began as a cub reporter at the age  of 18 on  the staff of  the Morning  Democrat in Davenport, IA. In 1955 he  became managing editor of the Morn ing Democrat. In 1964, he was named  executive editor of the Times-Demo crat, which resulted from a merger of  the Morning Democrat and the Daily  Times. In 1970, he became editor of  the  Times-Democrat,  which  later  its name  to  the Quad-City  changed  Times.  For nearly half a century Forrest  Kilmer has  striven  to  improve  the  quality of journalism in Illinois. In his  last assignment, as editor of the Quad City Times, he established a bureau in  the State capital  to report on State  government in a probing and insight ful manner. His  redesign  of  story  layout  led  to  numerous  national  awards and his courage and encour agement  have  resulted  in  several  awards for investigative articles.  His dedication to his profession has  also been matched by his dedication to  his country and community. As a vet eran of World War II he received the  Bronze Star and is an active member  of his Lutheran congregation.  Forrest Kilmer is a man of both per sonal and professional  integrity. We  will, indeed, miss his journalistic lead ership, but his contributions  to  the  profession will always serve as an ex ample for all reporters and editors.  Mr. President, the Governor of Illi nois has proclaimed January 31, 1986,  as Forrest Kilmer Day in Illinois and  Senator SIMON and I would like to join  all Illinoisans in wishing him and his  wife, Jeannette, all of the best in the  future.  ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL CON SULTATIONS ON REFUGEE AD MISSIONS: 1986  ",1986
182,1159,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I ask  that the following materials be print ed  in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  as  the substance of the annual consulta tions between the representatives of  the President and members of the Ju diciary Committee on refugee admis sions for fiscal year 1986, as mandated  by section 207 < d) of the Refugee Act  of 1980.  Mr. President, in order to conserve  the printing costs of the CONGRESSION AL RECORD, I am submitting only rele vant correspondence and selected ex cerpts from  the much more detailed  and lengthy hearing record compiled  by the Senate Judiciary Committee's  Subcommittee  on  Immigration  and  Refugee Policy entitled ""Annual Refu gee Consultation,"" September 17, 1985  <Senate Hearing 99-320). That record  should be considered to be incorporat ed by reference  in full  in  these re marks. Should any of my colleagues  wish to read this, or should they have  any questions about it, I would refer  them either to the staff of the Sub committee on Immigration and Refu gee Policy, which I chair, or the Office  of the U.S. Coordinator for Refugee  Affairs, Department of State, Wash ington, DC.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  REFUGEE ADMISSIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1986  Mr. Chairman and distinguished members  of the Committee, it is a pleasure to consult  with you on  the U.S.  refugee admissions  ceiling for fiscal year 1986. This annual con sultation affords  the Administration and  the Congress an opportunity to discuss the  refugee situation in the world and the hu manitarian response to this situation by the  United States.  Since the end of the Second World War,  the United States has provided haven to lit erally millions of refugees. They have ar rived in waves: first from Eastern Europe,  then from Cuba, then in the 1970's, from  the Soviet Union, and most recently, from  the countries of  Indochina. All of  these  countries and regions continue to produce  refugees,  and  the United States  accepts  more of them than any other resettlement  country. We are a nation founded by refu gees, and our national life has been reinvig orated throughout our history by recurring  waves of refugees. I think it is well that we  remember this as we consider the question  of how many refugees we should admit to  the United States in the coming fiscal year.  This  is  the second consecutive year  in  which I have been privileged to present the  President's refugee admissions proposal  to  the Congress. In doing so, I would again like  to thank the members of this Committee  for  their continuing support for  the U.S.  refugee program-which includes both the  admission of refugees to the United States,  and  the  important overseas assistance ef forts  to which the United States contrib utes.  PROPOSED REFUGEE ADMISSIONS IN FISCAL YEAR  1986  Mr. Chairman, I  turn now to the Presi dent's proposal  for  refugee admissions  in  fiscal year 1986. The President proposes to  establish a ceiling of 70,000 for refugee ad missions to the United States in the coming  fiscal year. This total will be broken down  into 3,000 for refugees from Africa; 40,000  for East Asia first asylum; 8,500 for the Or derly Departure Program  from Vietnam;  9,500 for refugees from Eastern Europe and  the Soviet Union; 3,000 for refugees from  Latin America and the Caribbean; and 6,000  for refugees from the Near East and South  Asia.  The President  is proposing a ceiling of  3,000 for Latin America and the Caribbean  in the hope that Cuba will end its suspen sion of  the U.S.-Cuban Migration Agree ment of December 1984. If, however, Cuba  does not terminate its suspension of the mi gration agreement, a portion of the num bers will be transferred on a quarterly basis  to other regional ceilings to accommodate  unforeseen  increased admissions needs. If  these numbers are not needed elsewhere,  they will be allowed to lapse.  As was the case last year, the President  wishes to maintain a separate ceiling for ad missions under the UNHCR's Orderly De parture Program <ODP> from Vietnam. This  separate ceiling serves two purposes. It reas sures the ASEAN countries that an expand ing ODP will not mean a decrease in reset tlement from the first asylum camps; and it  sends  a  clear  signal  to Hanoi  that  the  United States is prepared to make good on  its offer to accept a large number of Amera sians and ""re-education camp"" prisoners.  Aside  from  the uncertainties connected  with the Cuban and Vietnamese programs,  the proposed  regional admissions ceilings  should be adequate to provide for refugee  ",1986
183,1198,1,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President, we  have been negotiating with  the De partment of Transportation through out the morning and into this after noon on a  compromise amendment.  We have worked out an agreement on  an amendment that is not totally satis factory  to me. We have had a very  lengthy and useful negotiation with  the Department of Transportation by  which  I  think,  in  the House  and  during the conference, we can regain  the full thrust of the purpose of my  initial amendment.  We are still negotiating over a few  minor word changes and some other  details, but I believe I am prepared to  offer this compromise with the clear  understanding that this is a beginning  of a process which is intended to lead  to  legislation which  truly addresses  the concerns of the midwestern and  other regional carriers.  Because of the sheer lack of  time  needed to carefully draft and evaluate  ",1986
184,1211,1,Mr. METZENBAUM., Have the yeas  and nays been ordered?  ,1986
185,1211,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., They  have not.  ,1986
186,1211,1,Mr. METZENBAUM., I ask for  yeas and nays.  ,1986
187,1211,1,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  Is  there a sufficient second? There is a  sufficient second.  The yeas and nays were ordered.  ,1986
188,1211,1,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  commend my distinguished colleague  for  the  introduction of  this amend ment. On  the  face  of  the current  record, it is obvious that any sale of  Conrail to Norfolk Southern will be a  bonanza for Norfolk Southern and a  tremendous loss for the American tax payers. Conrail is an entity which has  cost the Federal Government in excess  of $7 billion.  This body has  rejected a  superior  off er  from Morgan  Stanley which  would produce $200 million more than  that offered  by Norfolk Southern.  There are  tremendous  losses  to  the  consumers of this country by the anti trust implications and the reduction of  competition by a  joinder of Conrail  and Norfolk  Southern,  and  there  should not be any further losses to the  American people,  the American  tax payers of American business or Ameri can consumers.  The disclosures by the Congressional  Budget Office show a  loss of some  $400 million  in  taxes. The updated  report  by  the Department  of  the  Treasury, doubtless partisan in nature,  shows an overall loss in the range of  $175 million, reduced to present value  to $125 million. Other analyses have  demonstrated the tax loss in the range  of $400 million.  Considering the bonanza and great  value to Norfolk Southern of the tre mendous value in the Conrail assets, it  is the judgment of this Senator that  Norfolk Southern ought not to be the  beneficiary of these tax breaks. And  for these reasons I am pleased to join  my distinguished colleague from Penn sylvania  in support of  this  amend ment.  ",1986
189,1211,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  first,  it  should  be  said  that  this  amendment  is  really,  I believe, sour  grapes. This  amendment  is  to  say:  ""Well, we  lost. We  lost  the cloture  vote, we lost the Morgan Stanley vote  and, having lost all that, let's change  the deal in such a way that it would be  totally unattractive to Norfolk South ern. Let's kill it.""  Mr. President, I think we have made  that decision in the Senate. We made  that decision after considerable debate  over  the purchase cost and  the  tax  consequences. The  tax matters have  been studied. The Treasury Depart ment  has  studied  them  at  great  length. The Treasury Department has  written letters on the subject, analyz ing the  tax consequences. It has all  been debated in the Senate. Now, post cloture, the Senator from Pennsylva nia suggests  that we get  into  it all  again.  Mr.  President, what  the Senator  from Pennsylvania would do  in his  amendment is  to rewrite the built-in  deduction rules in our tax laws. And  these  constitute  some  of  the most  complex aspects of the tax laws of this  country. The consolidated return regu lations, which are  touched by  this,  comprise some 127 pages of the tax  regulations.  It is  an extraordinarily  complicated rewriting of the method  of computing deductions for Norfolk  Southern after  the deal  is  entered  into.  I do not think we want to get into  this complex matter involving a  fine  tuning of our tax laws, aimed at one  company-one  company-a  company  specific. I do not think it is right. I do  not think we want tax laws that single  out one company.  I  think that, given the fact that it  totally wrecks the deal and wrecks the  economics  of  this  deal,  this  is  an  amendment we do not want to agree to  and, therefore, Mr. President, I move  to table the amendment.  ",1986
190,1211,1,Mr. HEINZ., Will the Senator with hold his motion for just a minute?  ,1986
191,1211,1,Mr. DANFORTH., I will withhold my  motion to table for 1 minute.  ,1986
192,1211,1,Mr. HEINZ.," Well, would the Senator  from Missouri be willing to answer a  question or two?  ",1986
193,1211,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," No, I am not. I am  not going to get into a debate on this.  I move to table the amendment and  I ask for the yeas and nays.  ",1986

I said earlier today that it is impor tant for substantive amendments to be  carefully weighed and evaluated and  to be debated. The amendment I of fered a few minutes ago-perhaps the  results would not have been any dif ferent-was debated briefly by me. I  spoke for 6, 7, or 8 minutes. Senator  SPECTER spoke for 2, 3, or 4 minutes.  ",1986
202,1224,1,Mr. WEICKER.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce legislation to create  an additional Federal district  judge ship for  the district of Connecticut.  Accepting  this much-needed position  would bring the total number of dis trict judges in Connecticut to seven; a  number supported by the Administra tive  Office  of  the United  States  Courts' Subcommittee on Judicial Sta tistics  in  its 1984 biennial survey of  judgeship needs. I am joined in this  legislative endeavor by my colleague  from Connecticut, Senator DODD, and  by the entire Connecticut congression al delegation, which has cosponsored  similiar  legislation  introduced  today  by Representative. STEWART McKIN NEY.  I recently had the opportunity to ad dress many of our State's judicial and  legal community in Bridgeport, CT. At  that time I commented on the great  pride the citizens of Connecticut take  in the integrity and experience of the  State's Federal judges. The men and  women fulfilling the awesome respon sibilities of the bench in Connecticut  apply not only their substantial legal  scholarship to the task, but also long  hours of hard work; hours  that  in crease each year.  Despite this dedication, Connecticut  is faced with a dilemma as illustrated  by the 1985 U.S. district court judicial  workload profile compiled by the Ad ministrative  Office  of  the United  States Courts. The district of Con necticut's overall workload  has  in creased by 40 percent since 1980. In  formulating  its recommendations for  new judgeships, the Subcommittee on  Judicial Statistics considered the level  of new case filings, the case mix, the  level  of weighted  filings,  pending  cases, and  the  length of  trials. The  subcommittee employed 400 weighted  filings per  judgeship as  the  level at  which a court deserved consideration  for additional judgeships.  Weighted filings are those deemed  to involve unusual complexity, requir ing substantial court  time.  In Con necticut, weighted  filings per  judge  were 512 in 1985; 633  in 1984; 569 in  1983; and 560 in 1982. So the district of  Connecticut has well  exceeded  the  level of 400 for all of the past several  years. Trials have risen corresponding ly as have the number of triable de fendants  in pending criminal  felony  cases. Therefore, at all levels consid ered by the subcommittee, the conclu sion reached was that the district of  Connecticut  fully  deserves  an addi tional judgeship.  I urge the Committee on the Judici ary to expeditiously consider this leg islation. I am confident the committee  and later the full Senate, will grant  Connecticut's district  judges and our  fine courts  the additional  judgeship  they need to sustain the outstanding  record of administering justice that we  have come to expect.

203,1224,1,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce private legislation  on behalf of a young girl, Victoria Ba carisas. Victoria's case struck a chord  with me. She has been in the country  since the age of 14. She is now 20, and  lives with her sister and brother-in law. Up to this point, she is not that  different  from many Filipinos who  have found their way into this coun try. However,  there  is a  special hu manitarian need in her case.  She contacted me late last year, and  asked for help in staying in this coun try. Although  unmarried,  she was  pregnant, and would in all likelihood  be just a few weeks short of delivery at  the time of her deportation hearing.  Discussions with immigration officals  disclosed that she could get a continu ance until after she had her child, and  she would be given time to recover. I  felt  that this would be sufficient  to  take care of her immediate problems.  I have discovered now that Vicotoria  gave birth prematurely, and that her  young son was  in intensive care.

204,1237,1,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, today DAN EVANS and I are intro ducing a bill to establish a new pro gram of ""targeted  fiscal  assistance""  for local governments. Representatives  BOB McEWEN'  JOHN  CONYERS,  and  a  PETER VISCLOSKY  are  introducing  companion bill in the House.  Over  the years, our failure  to use  the Federal grant system effectively to  address disparities in State and local  fiscal capacities has been a basic fail ing in our intergovernmental partner ship. This  is  a  responsibility which  central  governments  have  long  as sumed in every other major Federal  system. Today, as we stand on  the  verge of a fundamental restructuring  of our budgetary priorities, the need  to assure a minimum  level of basic  public  services  nationwide  can  no  longer be ignored.  Over the next few years, State and  local governments will confront a tre mendous challenge: To provide basic  and essential services to their citizens  during a period marked by limited and  declining resources. Deficit reduction  has a price, and I'm afraid that price  will include eliminating or drastically  cutting many of  the programs  that  have formed the basis of our intergov ernmental partnership over the past  decade.  These are programs that have en abled  the national, State and  local  governments  to work as partners  in  the delivery of important public serv ices  such  as highways and bridges,  schools and hospitals, health care for  the poor and elderly, education and  job  training  for  the disadvantaged,  cleaner air and water, and public hous ing-to name  just a  few.  I'm afraid  that many of these programs will re ceive deep reductions in the next few  years.  And the fact of the matter is, these  programs have already taken it on the  chin. Since 1981, a  ""De Facto New  Federalism"" has been occurring as the  national Government has struggled to  get a hold on the deficit by reducing  domestic spending. Federal aid as a  percentage of State and local revenue  has been declining since its highpoint  in 1980.  In  that year, Federal  aid  equaled 31. 7 percent of all State and  local own-source revenue. By 1984, this  figure had fallen to 23.7 percent and  in 1986 it is expected to be around 20  percent-a decline of 38 percent since  1980.  Put another way, defense expendi tures have increased 43 percent over  the past 5  years,  and entitlements  have grown by 24 percent. Meanwhile,  Federal aid to State and local govern ments has been cut more deeply than  any other  segment of  the Federal  budget: Down 25 percent  in current  outlays;  down  25  percent  in  the  number of programs; down 15 percent  as a proportion of GNP; down 20 per cent as a proportion of  the Federal  budget. And this is only the beginning.  As  the President has said, ""you ain't  seen nothin' yet.""  Budget cuts are not the only chal lenge confronting State and local gov",1986
205,1289,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, the bar rage of questions and complaints we  are  all  receiving  about  Gramm Rudman-Hollings  undoubtedly  will  grow as its impact becomes clearer. I  voted  for  the budget balancing bill  with the conviction that if we do not  get hold of our mounting fiscal prob lems now, we may face economic chaos  later. In a weekly column I write for  newspapers  in my State,  I have at tempted to answer some of the ques ~ons I am  frequently asked.  I  also  offer what I think will be the ultimate  result of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings-a  combination of revenue increases and  spending cuts that will move our coun try in a sounder financial direction. I  ask that the column be printed in the  RECORD,  The column follows:  PAY-As-You-Go PATH WILL PINCH ALL TOES  <By U.S. Senator Paul Simon>  There is a near-panic developing over the  enactment of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  plan to reduce the deficit. Otherwise ration al people-like columnist George Will-seem  to have come unglued.  People who should have been  in near panic about the deficit now are in that state  over this response to the deficit.  Let me comment on two of the statements  I hear:  ""We should deal with the deficit but not  in this way!""  Any way that steps on toes-and that is  required-will have some unpopularity. But  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings <GRH> does not  require any specific formula. It simply says  if Congress and  the administration don't  come up with better answers, we're not  going to continue this indefinite drift.  GRH calls for percentage across the board  cuts if Congress and the White House fail to  respond to specific targets in reducing the  deficit. GRH is  invoked only if better an swers are not found. But it is a recognition  that we  cannot  indefinitely  continue  to  spend roughly one-fourth more money than  we take in without causing economic chaos.  GRH leaves plenty of room, for those with  better ideas to solve the deficit, to propose  them. But I find that most of those who call  GRH the wrong answer have proposed no  solution at all.  ""But a program I believe in strongly may  get cut.""  It may indeed!  Programs a  lot of us believe in strongly  may be cut.  But the day is past when groups favoring  education programs, health research, and a  great many other things I favor can simply  hold out their hands and ask for money.  Now, people interested in money are also  going to have to be interested in revenue.  That is a dramatic change and a needed  change. If you want more support for educa tion, for example, which I happen to favor  strongly, then those of us who favor that  will also have to come up with ways to pay  for it. Whatever the program you favor, you  have to also propose means of getting the  revenue  for  it  if you  are  talking about  spending increases.  My guess is that we will come up with a  combination  of  revenue  increases  and  spending cuts that will move our country in  a sounder financial direction.  Indefinite  drifting  toward  bigger  and  bigger deficits is a course toward economic  disaster. That threatens not only our econo my, but our free system.  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings will force us to  face reality. I hope Congress and the White  House will act responsibly so that there will  be none of the horrendous cuts some people  have talked about. We won't go  to GRH's  automatic pilot unless Congress and  the  President give up the controls.  We know that the course we were on prior  to GRH courts disaster. Whether GRH will  force us to a responsible course we will know  within a few months.e  HEALTH CARE: QUALITY AND  CONSTRAINT  e ",1986
206,1289,1,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, Dr.  Otis Bowen has taken on one of the  toughest  jobs  in the country as  the  new Secretary of Health and Human  Services. But he has also taken on one  of the most important-touching the  lives of millions of Americans in pro grams ranging from Social Security to  Medicare.  One of Dr. Bowen's biggest chal lenges was outlined recently in an Op Ed in the Indianapolis Star by Frank  E. Samuel, Jr., president of the Health  Industry Manufacturers Association.  Mr. Samuel argues  that Dr. Bowen  must see to it that quality, access, and  compassion remain  top priorities for  administration health programs.  As Mr.  Samuel  points  out, Dr.  Bowen has the opportunity  to show  that the administration's commitment  to fiscal commonsense is matched by a  social  commitment  to  quality  and  access. I am sure that Dr. Bowen will  keep this important message in mind  as he carries out his new duties. I ask  that Mr. Samuel's Op-Ed be printed in  the RECORD.  The article follows:  HEALTH CARE: QUALITY AND CONSTRAINT  <By Frank E. Samuel, Jr.)  A country doctor  from  Indiana  is now  taking control of the third largest budget in  the world-the Department of Health and  Human Services. And Otis R. Bowen enters  the scene at a historic juncture for federal  health policy. A two-decade spending binge  in health care has been followed by a strict  Reagan spending diet. And although that  diet seems to be bringing costs under con trol, it is not doing so without sacrifices in  the  tremendous advances  in quality and  access that accompanied the high spending.  So Bowen has a unique opportunity  to  stop the pendulum in the middle, and bring  federal health policy  into a new era that  balances quality with cost constraint. To  succeed, he must rekindle a commitment to  compassion, and progress without pushing  aside the Reagan emphasis on fiscal control.  Cost control was scarcely on the agenda  when Medicare  and Medicaid  legislation  passed in 1965. Nearly all political factions  eventually agreed with a need to invest re sources in improving health care for the el derly and poor.  The investment paid dividends not only  for the beneficiaries of these programs. The  infusion of new resources into the health  care system helped bring about a technolog ical boom that has benefited all of society.  Advances  in diagnosis  and  treatment of  heart  disease,  cancer,  blindness,  infant  death and scores of other conditions and  diseases,  to some degree, are part of  the  Medicare/Medicaid legacy.  But  the  investment was costly. And as  health costs grew, the political support for  unabated growth in federal health spending  waned.  If the 1960s and 1970s were the years of  technological  advancement and expanded  access, the 1980s are the decade of cost con trol. President Reagan came to office with a  mandate  to  do  something  about health  costs. So since 1981 the administration and  Congress have made changes  in Medicare  and Medicaid that will yield $35 billion in  cuts by 1987. What's more, Medicare's hos pital payment scheme was overhauled  to  save costs. Rather than reimbursing hospi tals for whatever costs they incur, Medicare  now pays a set price for each of 476 diag noses-regardless of how much it costs the  hospital  to  treat a  patient. The private  sector has also clamped down on health  costs.  The results are striking. In 1984, private  and public sector health care spending grew  by only 9.1 percent-the slowest rate in 20  years. Hospitals share of those costs grew by  only half their 1983  rate. But evidence is  mounting that we may be paying for this  cost-cutting fervor in the form of reduced  health care quality.  About 35 million people-15 percent of the  population-are  estimated  to  be without  health  insurance. While Medicaid-the  main  federal-state  health  financing  pro gram for the indigent-covered 65 percent  of the poor in 1976, it now covers only 52  percent.  Changes and cutbacks  in Medicare pay ments have led hospitals to release elderly  patients too soon. At recent Senate hear ings,  doctors  reported  increased pressure  from hospitals to release Medicare patients  when  their treatment costs reach the set  price for their illness. And public hospitals  report that other hospitals are ""dumping""  more patients onto them only because the  severity of their condition makes them un profitable to treat when bumped against the  set Medicare price.  Medicare changes have also led hospitals  to use treatments that may run up higher  long-term costs. Newer pacemakers, for ex ample, cost more  initially  than the older  models. But  for  some patients  they can  reduce long-term costs because they can be  adjusted for changes in the patient's condi tion without follow-up surgery. Medicare's  payment system, however, often discourages  use of the more expensive model because  Medicare pays a  set  rate  for pacemaker  cases,  regardless of the actual pacemaker  used. So the hospital is money ahead using  the cheaper version,  especially  since pa tients may well .have to return for follow-up  surgery-in which case the hospital again  collects the total fee from Medicare.

He  is keeping his commitment  that  was made several weeks ago when I  asked  the  distinguished  majority  leader if he would give assurance that  S. Res. 28 would be brought up before  the Senate early in the Second Ses sion, and that commitment was made  during the First Session,  the closing  days of the First Session. He has kept  his commitment and fulfilled his as surance, as I knew he would.  I just want the RECORD to show that  I and those who are very supportive of  this resolution are appreciative of the  distinguished leader calling up S.

210,1315,1,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, those  of us who have been active in Congress on  the  issue of Soviet Jewry have  in  large part  relied on accurate and complete  information  about specific cases of Soviet Jews who have  been denied permission to emigrate and who  have encountered harsh treatment because of  their desire to emigrate. It is due to the efforts  of two of my friends and constituents, Margery  Sanford and Adele Sandberg of North Miami  Beach  that  congressional  offices have  re ceived and made use of 12 volumes docu menting the case histories of more than 1 , 100  refuseniks.  When my office became  involved  in  the  case of refusenik  llya Essas back in 1976, it  was one of these volumes that provided the  information we needed. Now, 10 years  later,  the Essas family finally received permission to  emigrate and arrived in Israel just days ago. I  would  like  to place  in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD an article from  the Miami Herald of  January 2, 1986, paying tribute to this very im portant project. The difficult challenge we face  in  trying  to  improve emigration prospects for  Soviet Jews is made so much easier than  it  would otherwise be-thanks  to Marge and  Adele.  The article follows:  THEIR CRY Is, ""Lrr OUR PEOPLE Go""  <By Bea L. Hines>  For more  than 10 years now, Margery  Sanford and Adele E. Sandberg have collect ed tidbits of information about thousands of  Jewish families still seeking their freedom  from the Soviet Union.  ""It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle,"" said San ford. ""A line from a story . . . a paragraph  from a letter ... things we have put togeth er to help tell their story.""  The result of their  labor  is 12 volumes  documenting  the  case  histories of more  than 1,100 Refuseniks-Jews who have ap plied to leave Russia but have been refused  permission by the Soviet government.  Their latest volume, ""Soviet Jews: Hos tages All,"" was published in September.  ""Our simple message to the Soviet Union  is, 'Let our people go,' "" said Sandberg.  Sandberg and Sanford, both married  to  doctors,  live  in  the same block  in North  Miami Beach. They both attend Temple  Sinai there. They became best friends after  they began volunteer work with the South  Florida Conference on Soviet Jewry.  They started documenting  the cases of  Refuseniks after each had traveled to the  Soviet Union.  Since the first volume was published in  1976, Sanford and Sandberg said the books  have been used throughout the country by  ",1986

212,1367,1,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I would  like to say a  few words today about  John Flink, my press secretary, who is  leaving my staff after loyal service of 7  years.  I would like to concentrate first on  the qualities that made John an ex ceptionally  fine  press  secretary,  as  well as a policy advisor. Above all, he  is a clear thinker. I always recommend  to my staff the slim volume entitled,  ""Elements of Style"".  In  that book,  E.B. White teaches us to use the sim plest words to most clearly express an  idea. Even if one adopts all of those  rules,  the writing  on  complicated  issues will never be clear unless the  person who pens those words thinks  clearly. John Flink does.  Moreover, John is a steady hand. He  is incapable of overstatement. He has  a quiet presence and an institutional  memory  that made him  trustworthy  for the rest of my staff and the press  corps in Montana and in the Capitol.  In short, John Flink had good  judg ment and integrity that people trust.  A few final personal thoughts about  John. His interest in running emerged  at the same time as mine, and both of  us helped each other when neither of  us really wanted to run.  There  is an old saying  that ""still  waters run deep,"" and I can think of  no one who better depicts that descrip tion than John Flink. When he goes  home at night, I know that he spends  hours listening to fine music and con suming a wide variety of good litera ture. He is a deep thinker about many  things; theology, world issues, and per sonal freedoms. He is a good listener,  and he was a wonderful and  loving  husband to his late wife, Kathy.  I will miss John, and I thank him for  the service he has rendered to me and  to the people of the State of Montana.  TO  JUDITH  CHRISTA  SOVIET  GESTURE  RESNIK  AND  McAULIFFE  ",1986

This move by the Soviets, whose car tographers are creating the first map  of the surface of Venus, is a thought ful gesture that could-if only in pass ing-bridge the deep gap that divides  our countries.  People  throughout  the world  that  cherish the quest for knowledge and  exploration are deeply  saddened by  this tragedy.  Over  the weekend, all across  this  Nation, Americans paused to pay trib ute to the seven members of the Chal lenger crew.  Judy Resnik and Christa McAuliff e  hold a special place in our hearts.  Ms. Resnik, who comes from Akron,  OH, was on her second space trip. She  was thrilled by her job and was an in spiration for all young women who see  space exploration as a challenging and  exciting goal. Those of us in Ohio were  particularly saddened by the untimely  death of one of our own.  Ms. McAuliffe was the best known of  the seven because she was the first ci vilian rider on a space mission. As a  school  teacher, students  throughout  the Nation looked to her as a special  hero and truly so.  The sudden end of the Challenger's  journey does not mean that the mis sion  of  these  two  end  in  failure.  Indeed,  they succeeded  in  forging a  path into space technology for women  and civilians that will remain forever.  To  them we owe a deep sense of  gratitude, and this designation on the  planet Venus will be an everlasting re memberance of their contribution.  EXPRESSION OF CONDOLENCES  ",1986

I see  a  line  to strike them out. But they  were there. I heard the Senator from  Tennessee say he favored every one of  them.

For example, this  matter by which you would not have  to invoke cloture to impose germane ness. You could just make a motion  for germaneness, and with 60 percent  vote for germaneness. You could do  this rather than have a limitation of  time, if all you really wanted to do was  have the benefit of a germaneness rule  rather than try to  limit everybody's  right to speak.  But, in any event, there are certain  things that need to be done. And you  wonder why. Why,  Senator,  is  a  motion to proceed still subject to un limited debate? A motion to proceed to  consider a bill? I am like the Senator. I  gave unanimous consent to bring this  bill up today. I did not object. But I  have many times debated the motion  to proceed purely as a dilatory tactic. I  ought to feel, well,  that gives me a  better chance to make more speeches  because you can make the motion to  proceed.  Has the Senator debated a motion to  proceed? I know I have.  ",1986
220,1393,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  I  certainly  have. Frankly,  I  think  there  is no  reason  for  that  to be  a  debatable  motion. But those are the rules of the  Senate. So we all have the privilege of  using those rules. But that does not  mean we should not change the rules.  ",1986
221,1393,1,Mr. LONG.," I would join the Senator  in changing them.  I will tell you frankly, Senator, tele vision means I am going to do more  talking.  I will  say  that  right now.  People are not going to have to say,  ""Where is old RussELL? Why don't we  hear from him?"" They will hear from  old RUSSELL.  ",1986
222,1393,1,Mr. BYRD., Will the Senator yield?  ,1986
223,1393,1,Mr. LONG., I yield.  ,1986
224,1393,1,Mr. BYRD.," I would like to see the  Senator  from Louisiana make more  speeches. I was disappointed to hear  the Senator state the decision which  he had been pondering for a long time;  namely, that he was going to leave the  Senate after this year. I dare say if he  goes on  television making  speeches  and  letting  the  listening Americans  get the point of his arguments, there  might be a great ground swell for him  to change his mind. I would like to see  him change his mind.  ",1986
225,1393,1,Mr. GORE., Will the Senator yield?  ,1986
226,1393,1,Mr. LONG., I yield.  ,1986
227,1393,1,Mr. GORE.," If the  introduction of  television into this Chamber will cause  the senior Senator from Louisiana to  speak more frequently and give Mem bers of this body the benefit of his  advice on more occasions, the Senator  has perhaps inadvertently introduced  a powerful argument in favor of open ing up this Chamber to broadcast cov erage.  ",1986
228,1393,1,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, I will be  glad to make more speeches provided  other Senators do not do  the same  thing. [Laughter.]  But if there are going to be 99 other  Senators  making  more  speeches,  thanks, but, no, it would be better if I  would make less.  Many years ago there was a member  of  the Chamber  of Commerce  in  Shreveport who asked me to make a  speech. He came by my office subse quently and asked how I enjoyed the  occasion. I said, ""I did not enjoy it a  darn bit. I would have been glad to not  make a speech if you had not called on  all these other fellows to make speech es. Why do you not draw straws next  time and let one or two make speeches  instead of all of them?""  Some of them were irritated because  I said the honest truth as I saw it. If I  had  to hear all  those other fellows  make their speeches, I would just as  soon not make mine.  ",1986
229,1393,1,Mr. METZENBAUM., Will the Sena tor yield?  ,1986
230,1393,1,Mr. LONG., I yield.  ,1986
231,1393,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.," The Senator  was  addressing himself  to  the ger maneness question. The Senator from  Ohio, the Senator from Louisiana, the  Senator  from West Virginia,  from  Tennessee, Texas,  and New Mexico  have  all  seen on  the  floor of  the  Senate time and time again there is an  appropriations bill and some amend ment is added to it that has nothing to  do with the subject matter. I remem ber when Warren Magnuson was here.  He used to almost cry, ""Why do you  have to put all these amendments on  the appropriations bills?"" There were  almost tears in his eyes.  I just heard the Senator from Louisi ana say something about 60 votes in  order to determine a question with re spect to germaness. I sort of wonder  whether the Senate would be a better  body if once the Parliamentarian had  decided  that something was nonger mane, from that point on and hence forth as far as that bill is concerned,  there would be no appeal. That would  be a final decision, that it was not ger mane and,  therefore, it does not get  onto that bill.  I think we all recognize the Parlia mentarian is the objective arbiter of  what is and what is not germane. The  question is it bears on schools, or it is  abortion, it is busing, or any one of  those  issues, and so many others as  well. It is something far out having  nothing to do with the legislation. We  then have the question of,  is  it ger mane? That is submitted to the body.  The people  do not  really vote on  whether it is or is not germane, but  vote on the matter by how they feel  on the subject.  ",1986
232,1393,1,Mr. LONG.," I vote on the issue of  germaneness. This Senator may, on  one or two occasions, have been per suaded  to go  along with what  ap peared to be an advantage to his State  or with the fear of being misunder stood by a very large group, but the  Senator will find very few cases where  this Senator has not supported  the  Chair on a matter of germaneness.  ",1986
233,1393,1,Mr. METZENBAUM., I was not talk ing about the Senator but of the body  as a whole.  ,1986
234,1393,1,Mr. LONG.," It makes me resentful  that others do not do the same thing.  It is our duty. We hire a man to do  that job, a fell ow doing his dead level  best, as the Almighty gives him the  power to reason and see it, has done  his duty and advised the Chair. The  Parliamentarian and the Chair have  both done their duty. Then to overrule  them  to me  is  just wrong and we  should not do it.  The Senator  from West Virginia  [Mr. BYRD]  suggested we  require a  two-thirds majority. That would help  a  lot to sustain  the Chair.  I might  even be willing  to make  it a  three f ourths majority. I do not think the  ",1986
235,1432,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to  call my colleagues' attention to an article by  Ms. Ellen Goodman which appeared  in  the  Boston Globe on Thursday, January 30. Her  article provides a commentary on the Reagan  administration's efforts  to  shield  star wars  from Gramm-Rudman budget cuts. What they  are really shielding is a technological free for  all  in which young star warriors get a blank  check to pursue what ever interesting physics  problems excite their curiosity.  It is a fine thing to fund scientific research,  but  there  are  far more worthy  scientific  projects  than  the  fantasies of our star war riors.  In a  time of raging deficits and  fiscal  austerity, star wars  should  face  the  same  budget cuts  that other related programs are  taking.  Ms. Goodman's article provides a skeptical,  sensible  assessment  of  star wars,  and  I  wholeheartedly agree with her.  The article follows:  PROTECTING THE YOUNG STAR WARRIORS WHO  CAN'T PROMISE PROTECTION  <By Ellen Goodman)  In case you have been up nights worrying,  there is at least one defensive shield already  in place on this planet. It's the shield the  White House is using to protect the funding  for  the  strategic  defense  iniative-""star  wars."" From all reports, it's impenetrable.  In theory, the sword of Gramm-Rudman  was supposed to cut budgets for every weap ons program by 4.9 percent, including SDI.  But the administration raised its shield to  make sure that the president's pet celestial  project won't be nicked.  February 3, 1986  As of this moment, the ""star wars"" pro gram  is perhaps the only sheltered work shop  for scientists  in the federal budget.  Whether or not we can afford it, we are fi nancing the highest-tech defense research  in human history.  The ""star wars"" money  is going  to be  spent to further and produce the ideas of an  elite cadre of scientists who, unlike Gramm,  Rudman or Reagan, are unknown to the av erage citizen.  Now  there is a glimpse or two  into the  world of  the young scientists working on  space-age weaponry. William Broad, a sci ence reporter, visited a critical mass of them  in Livermore, Calif., the home of the Law rence Livermore Lab, one of the two nuclear  research labs in the country. Here he found  the men of 0-Group, whom he dubbed  ""Star Warriors""  in his new book by  the  same name.  These warriors wear  no  green  berets.  They wear no uniforms at all, unless you  consider jeans, checked shirts and running  shoes a dress code. Nor do they eat regula tion meals, unless a diet of fast food and ice  cream is required.  Broad's sketches make a composite pic ture of a group described by an inside critic  as ""bright young hotshots who are socially  maladjusted."" An intellectual cadre high on  Coca-Cola and competition.  He  retraces  the way  the best and  the  brightest graduates of MIT and Cal Tech  were collected by the group leader, Lowell  Wood, to work on nuclear weaponry. They  were lured by a combination of money, high  camaraderie and, perhaps most of all,  the  freedom to pursue happiness in the form of  ""interesting problems.""  As Peter Hagelstein, one of the more com plicated personalities at Livermore and cre ator of the X-Ray Laser Beam, explained:  ""My view of weapons has changed. Until  1980 or so I didn't want to have anything to  do with nuclear anything. Back  in  those  days I thought there was something funda mentally evil about weapons. Now I see it as  an interesting physics problem.""  The motives of a computer star-whiz, Rod  Hyde-an MIT graduate at 19-are some what less earthbound: ""What I want more  than  anything  is  essentially  to  get  the  human race into space. It's the future. If  you stay down here some disaster is going to  strike and you 're going to get wiped. If you  get into space and spread out,  there's no  chance of the human race disappearing.""  These snippets make the young Star War riors sound spacy. This is only part of the  story. The atmosphere of the all-male 0Group, reads like a science-house fraternity,  complete with boyish pranks and competi tions. The brains who are the hired guns in  the national-defense scheme don't seem to  know how to take care of themselves. There  is no Wendy to make them get their proper  sleep and food. But they are undeniably, sci entifically brilliant.  And (this is the kicker) they don't think a  missile defense will work.  As Peter Hagenstein said, ""It would be  very nice  if we could develop a defensive  network that would blow away all Soviet  ICBMs. But I don't think we can do that.  We could take out some. But it wouldn't  keep cities from being obliterated.""  So it appears that the Star Warriors, the  men with both the background and the se curity clearance to know best, the men paid  to imagine, don't believe in the crayon-col ored dream of safety from nuclear weapons.  Here  we  are,  investing  incalculable  amounts of money in the work of top-secret  ",1986
236,4,6,The SPEAKER pro  tempore., The  gentleman from New York [Mr. STRAT TON] is recognized for 1 hour.  ,1986
237,4,6,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Speaker, the  Members of the House have lost a very  valuable and dedicated Member in the  passing of the gentleman from New  York [Mr. ADDABBO]. He was one of  the pillars of this House as the chair man of  the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee, and he was a  tireless  proponent of a strong defense but not  supporting a wasteful defense.  We have all recognized that the gen tleman from New York has been fight ing a personal battle over the last few  months against illness, but he never  gave up in that fight and he will cer tainly be missed.  One of the features, I think, of the  gentleman from New York  [Mr. An DABBO] was that, although he occupied  one of  the most  responsible assign ments  in  the House of Representa tives, he always proceeded at a  low  key, was humble certainly, and was  highly responsive not only to his con stituents but also to his colleagues in  the House.

We truly have lost a friend in JoE  ADDABBO.  I have known him since I  have been here  in  the Congress.  I  serve as the vice chairman of the New  York bipartisan delegation and as the  dean of the Republican delegation. We  join in sympathy for his loved ones.  My wife, Nancy, and I  join with the  other Members in expressing our deep  sympathy  and  regrets  to  his wife,  Grace, and  to  the members of his  family.  We will truly miss JOE ADDABBO from  the Halls of Congress.  ",1986

241,4,6,Mr. STRATTON., I yield to the gen tleman from New York.  ,1986

Mr. Speaker, I would just like to join  with my  colleagues,  the gentlemen  from New York  [Mr. STRATTON and  Mr. HoRTON] and share their remarks.  I think probably the key to JoE An DABBO was that in all the years that he  the same time be a true American and  spent here, he was always fair, and I  would say to the public which is view ing  these proceedings  today that he  was truly a nice guy. I think that is  probably the hallmark of the gentle man from New York [Mr. ADDABBO] a  person who could be a nice guy and at  do what was necessary for our coun try.  ",1986
243,4,6,Mr. STRATTON.," I thank the gentle man.  Mr. Speaker, I would point out that  we will, sometime next week, have a  special order for our departed com rade.  In  the  interim,  let me advise  Members  that  the Speaker will ap point  a  congressional delegation  to  attend the funeral services on tomor row at 11 a.m. in New York City.  Members who desire to travel to that  ceremony are advised to contact the  Sergeant at Arms. The delegation will  depart the House steps for Andrews  Air Force Base at 7:30 a.m. The funer al mass will be in St. Patrick's Cathe dral on Fifth Avenue at 11 a.m., and it  is estimated that the delegation would  return by 3:30 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal ance of my time.

244,4,6,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn  to meet at 3:30 p.m. on  tomorrow,  Tuesday, April15, 1986.  ",1986

246,4,6,Mr. MICHEL.," Reserving the right to  object, Mr. Speaker, and  I will not  object, but might we have a little ex change here as to just what the pro gram might be following the return of  the Members from the funeral of our  good friend, the gentleman from New  York [Mr. ADDABBO]?  The way I gather it, and the gentle man can correct me if I am mistaken  here, after we return we will have one half hour of 1-minute speeches tomor row, and then move  immediately  to  consideration of the rule on the Con tras and on the supplemental appro priation.  0 1210  Then we would proceed with general  debate on the Contra issue. There are  2  hours  of  general  debate. There  would not be a  vote after general  debate, but I would caution Members  that after  the 1-minutes, and  then  after a discussion on the rule, there  could very well be a vote on the previ ous question and a vote on the rule  prior to our going into general debate.  So that would suggest then that the  session could last beyond 7 o'clock to morrow.  ",1986
247,4,6,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," What  the  gentleman has said is correct. I would  like  to  repeat what  the minority  leader said.  We go in at 3:30 on Tuesday. There  would  be  30 minutes  of  1-minute  speeches with 15 minutes on each side.  There could be a possibility on the  rule of two votes.  After the rule, we would take up 2  hours of general debate on the supple mental and Contra aid, and no votes,  and  it would probably be around 8  o'clock when we would finish our busi ness.  Also, the suspensions, if there would  be a vote called  today,  those votes  would lay over until Wednesday, not  Tuesday.  ",1986
248,4,6,Mr. MICHEL.," Then we will make a  decision tomorrow as to what time we  come in on Vlednesday, because under  a previous dialog with  the majority  whip, as I recall, we made a point that  any votes demanded on suspensions  would be the first order of business  supposedly on tomorrow, but now that  is being delayed 1 day. So we will make  a determination then in conjunction  with the majority leadership on time  which we ought  to begin  then on  Wednesday so  that we can proceed  with consideration of that supplemen tal.

Friday we learn that the Contras are  being investigated in Florida for gun running and drug trafficking.  Sunday we  learn  that  the White  House by withholding economic aid is  strong arming Costa Rica to support  us.  Sunday we learn that the CIA has  secretly funneled several million dol lars to the Contras, in addition to the  $27 million approved by Congress last  year.

271,43,6,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, today  is a magnificent spring day in the Na tion's Capital. I think it reminds us all  of how fortunate we are to be here to  represent our home States and  to  enjoy the peace and freedom of this  great country-indeed, to be alive.  That is why I would like to pay spe cial recognition to a very bittersweet  anniversary on this day. It was  this  day 41 years ago that forever changed  the life of one our most distinguished  Senate colleagues.  Back then, he was known simply as  2d Lt. Robert Dole, a brave, 21-year old platoon leader, who left the Uni versity of Kansas  in his premedical  studies and varsity athletics for  the  Jayhawks in 1943 to take on the Nazi  hordes.  His  athletic  prowess,  intelligence  and unusal leadership abilities made  him a natural for one of the elite units  of the U.S. Army-the lOth Mountain  Division, a crack group of Olympic class  athletes  and  college  students  whose unenviable job it was to storm  the  rugged  Italian mountains-often  times on skis-to root out the deeply  entrenched German forces. Soon after  he arrived  in  Italy,  the young man  from Russell, KS, became known as  the finest platoon leader his men had  ever had. Believe me,  I am not sur prised; nor are those of us that serve  with him on either side of the aisle. So  he is now my platoon leader. It is a  great honor to be his first sergeant in  these ranks.  And so  it came  that on April 14,  1945, Second Lieutenant Dole found  himself on hill 913, one of those name less battlefields  that can speak vol umes about heroism but is somehow  lost in the pages of history. But histo ry does tell us that the lOth Mountain  Division was indeed a legendary outfit.  It had  set high  standards  indeed,  having  never  yielded  one  inch  of  ground it had ever taken back from  the enemy. In fact, on that April day  in 1945,  the  lOth Mountain Division  took more casualties  than all other  allied forces in Italy combined.

It was  on this day 41 years ago-near a tiny  mountain  village  called  Castel  D' Aiano-that Senator BoB DoLE, our  superb majority  leader, was  struck  down by a torrent of enemy fire. He  had moved into a  foxhole  to try to  save a fallen friend. But in an instant  an explosion-a machine gun shell, a  mortar round, no one knows for sure tore into his body.

272,69,6,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute  the 1986 U.S. Military Academy Model United  Nations Team.  The U.S. Military Academy, located at West  Point in the 21st District of New York, has a  tradition of excellence, not only in its long and  distinguished record of service to the Nation,  but also  in  its reputation as one of the Na tion's leading colleges.  Its athletic teams are  well-known for their prowess, but I would like  to invite Members' attention to the extraordi nary  achievements  of a group  of  cadets  known as  the West Point Model United Na tions Team.  For some years, the Academy has encour aged cadets to participate in this highly spe cialized form of intercollegiate competition, in  which member colleges develop the legislative  and parliamentary skills of  their students  in  diplomatic simulations which test their under standing of the international political, military,  and economic environment. Under the spon sorship  of  the Academy's Department  of  Social Sciences, the West Point Model United  Nations Team has established a reputation as  one of the top teams in the country, winning a  string of individual and team awards in region al collegiate model U.N. conventions.  The  ultimate  test  of excellence  in  this  arena, however, has always been the National  Model United Nations Convention, held each  year over 5 days  in New York City, which  brings together the Nation's best students in  political  international  relations  from more than 140 colleges and universities.  This year,  the West Point Model United Na tions Team achieved an unprecedented honor  when,  for  the  third consecutive  time,  it was  named outstanding delegation in the nationals  competition. I should emphasize that this na tional  intercollegiate title was won by cadets  who voluntarily sacrifice their limited free time  for this most demanding  form of extracurric ular activity, and who in no way are excused  from the even more demanding requirements  of the training regimen at the Academy.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe  it was Will Rogers  who said that the United States never lost a  war nor won a conference. This group of  cadets has clearly shown  that their skills as  warriors will be complemented by their abilities  as our  future statesmen, and  let me add,  stateswomen. I know that Members will share  my satisfaction that this latest cadet victory is  but another example of West Point's record of  excellence  in developing our Nation's most  outstanding young men and women  into the  s~ience and  7419  ""Long Gray Une"" that has served this country  for so long and so well. Before introducing the  members of the championship  team,  let me  pay particular  tribute  to  their  leaders-the  team's captain, Cadet Jonathan Millen, and  their coaches, Maj. Marvin S. Searle  II, and  Capt. Mike Simone. Well done, gentlemen.  1986 WEST POINT MODEL UNITED NATIONS  TEAM  CLASS OF 1986  Cadet Jonathan B. Millen <E-2> Team  Captain.  Cadet Scott Pierce <H-4>.

273,69,6,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am intro ducing  legislation  that would  revise current  House voting procedures. My bill would  re quire a rollcall vote of two-thirds for passage  on measures raising spending or taxes includ ing  resolutions making appropriations,  joint  resolutions making continuing appropriations,  and conference reports.  Consider the following:  In February 1985, an emergency  famine  relief and recovery in Africa bill appropriating  $1 billion was passed by voice vote. In other  words, $1 billion of the taxpayer's money was  spent without them knowing how their Repre sentatives voted.  Last July, an energy and development bill  appropriating $15 billion was passed by voice  vote. Again, huge sums of money are being  spent and constituents can only guess as to  how they are being represented.  In December, passage of the Tax Reform  Act of 1985  left constituents  in  the  ""dark""  once again. The tax measure alone was esti mated to affect over $141 billion in taxes from  individuals and corporations over the next 5  years.  At midnight on October 3, 1984, just before  Congress adjourned  for the year, a massive  $4 70 billion continuing appropriations resolu tion was passed by voice vote; an appropria",1986

The bill  provides monetary authorizations for  fiscal years 1987 and 1988  to enable  the National Park Service to continue  to provide services as directed in the  John F. Kennedy Center Act.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of  the letter transmitting that legislation  from Acting Assistant Secretary P.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,  OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY,  Washington, D.C., March 28, 1986.  Hon. GEORGE BUSH,  President of the Senate,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. PREsiDENT: There is enclosed a  draft bill,  ""Authorizing appropriations  to  the Secretary of the Interior for services  necessary to the nonperforming arts func tions of the John F. Kennedy Center for  the Performing Arts, and  for other pur poses.""  We recommended that the draft bill be in troduced, referred to the appropriate com mittee for consideration, and enacted.  Under subsection <e> of section 6 of the  John F. Kennedy Center Act <72 Stat. 1698,  1699; 20 U.S.C. 76 h, 76 D. the Secretary of  the Interior is required to provide all serv ices necessary  to  the nonperforming arts  functions of the John F.

However, the  Congress has only appropriated funds to the  National Park Service through September  30, 1986, for the nonperforming arts func tions of the Kennedy Center.  The draft bill would amena the appropria tion authorization in subsection <e>  to au thorize an appropriation of $4,771,000 for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987,  and such sums as are necessary  for  the  fiscal year ending September 30, 1988. Such  an authorization and appropriation would  enable the National Park Service to contin ue to carry out its responsibilities for the  nonperforming arts functions for the Kennedy Center as provided in the President's  1987 budget.  The Office of Management and Budget  has advised that this legislative proposal is  in accord with the program of the Presi dent.  Sincerely,  P.

A bill to make foreign na tionals  ineligible  for certain agricul tural program loans, payments, or ben efits;  to  the Committee on Agricul ture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM INELIGIBILITY FOR  FOREIGN NATIONALS  e ",1986
278,147,6,Mr.  PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  prohibit the payment of farm program  benefits to foreign landowners or oper ators. Under current law, any farm land owner or operator is eligible for  farm program benefits if they comply  with the various requirements. My leg islation would prohibit foreign owners  and operators of farms from receiving  benefits.  Currently, 8,760,300 acres of farm land  is owned by  foreign  investors.  This represents a relatively small per centage of total farmland, but if all of  the land was placed in farm programs  the payments  to the foreign owners  could  total  several million  dollars.  With the strict budget requirements  farm programs face we cannot afford  to subsidize these foreign investors.  The eligibility of foreign investors to  receive farm program benefits also in creases the incentive for them to pur chase U.S. farmland. In recent years  with farmland values declining, there  has been a decline in foreign invest ment in farmland. But with farmland  prices bottoming out the number of  foreign  investors  purchasing  U.S.  farmland is bound to increase. Prohib iting  these  investors  from  receiving  farm program payments on their land  would make U.S. farmland less attrac tive to foreign investors.  Finally, the majority of the foreign  owned farmland  is held by corpora tions. These are not family farm cor porations but huge multinational cor porations who do not need farm pro gram subsidies. For many years I have  argued  that  farm program benefits  should be directed to family farmers  and restrictions placed on payments to  huge corporations. This would achieve  such a goal.  As I have outlined, this legislation  has several advantages. It will reduce  the cost of  farm programs.  It will  reduce the incentive for foreign inves tors to purchase U.S. farmland. And it  will prohibit payments from going to  huge multinational corporations.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  support of this  legislation and work  for passage of it.  ",1986
279,160,6,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  should  like  to  recognize  a  great  achievement by the Edgefield Adver tiser, a weekly newspaper in Edgefield,  SC. This newspaper is currently cele brating its sesquicentennial anniversa ry.  In the 150 years  in which  this  newspaper has been  in operation,  it  has never missed an issue or changed  its name.  In fact,  for  the past 114  years, it has been owned by the same  family.  The history of the Edgefield Adver tiser is filled with colorful and historic  stories. For example, it was the only  newspaper  to publish  the  letter of  Colonel Travis,  commander  of  the  Alamo,  to Gen. Sam Houston. This  historic press coverage prompted the  Governor of Texas and the mayor of  San Antonio to send their congratula tions  to the Edgefield Advertiser  in  commemoration of  its  sesquicenten nial.  The Edgefield Advertiser combines a  strong sense of history with a dedica tion  to excellence  in  reporting  the  events that currently impact on Edge field and the surrounding area. I offer  my most sincere congratulations on a  job well done.e  NAUM AND INNA MElMAN:  SUPPORT IN CONGRESS  e ",1986

As Lisa Paul, a  young Minnesota woman who went on  a 25-day hunger strike for  the Mei mans, said, ""The Meimans have this  incredible  energy  and vitality."" To  think of  Irma suffering  in pain  in  Moscow is a chilling thought. Naum is  a 7 4-year-old man. He has not per formed ""sensitive"" work in 30 years.  The Meimans are persecuted for ex pressing  their  desire  to  leave  the  Soviet Union. What good does  it do  the Soviets  to  keep  the Meimans  there?

281,160,6,Mr.  DOMENICI.," Mr.  President,  schizophrenia strikes 1 percent of the  American people. It is devastating dis ease. Of the hundreds of thousands of  homeless Americans, from one-third to  one-half are mentally ill, most of these  afflicted with incurable schizophrenia.  The costs of this disease to this Nation  annually exceed $20 billion. We are  now spending $27 million annually on  research.  Science tells us it is a brain disease,  that is does not come about from bad  parents or ""toxic"" families. Nor is it  necessarily character flaw  in the af flicted person, as it was once believed.  Because of psychotropic medication,  schizophrenic citizens are no  longer  hospitalized for endless years. They  are stabilized and returned to the com munity. Unfortunately,  communities  are poorly prepared to receive  them  and to provide the rehabilitation serv ices  that  can  and will  help  them  achieve their potential for independ ence and self -care.  The care givers today are, in the ma jority of cases, the families. They need  help in understanding the illness,  in  providing a  therapeutic environment  in the home, in financial support, and  in  respite  from  the  day-in-day-out  regime of care.  Mr. President, these remarks are to  introduce an excellent four-part series  on schizophrenia that appeared in the  New York Times, March 16-19, 1986. I  offer them because there is a lot of ig norance across this land about schizo phrenia,  as well  as  other  serious  mental  illnesses  such  as major or  manic depression. The Times  series  gives an up-to-date report of the state  of scientific research on this disease. It  details the emerging family movement  that is achieving historic growth as a  force  in  the Halls of Congress, our  State capitals, city halls, and court house. It describes the treatment and  rehabilitation needs of these mentally  ill citizens. It describes the gaps in our  mental health system.  I commend the editors of the New  York Times for focusing on this im portant topic at a  time when policy makers must face the consequences of  mental illness in our society, particu larly among the homeless whose num bers continue to grow.  I ask that the articles from the New  York Times be printed in the RECORD.  The articles follow:  SCHIZOPHRENIA PuZZLE: TOLL RISES AMID  HOPE  <By Philip M. Boffey)  WASHINGTON.-Schizophrenia  is emerging  as the worst mental health problem facing  the nation. Yet it has long been the most  neglected.  Never before in American history have so  many  schizophrenics  been  seen  on  the  streets of American cities, screaming aloud  to voices only they can hear, proclaiming  themselves God, warning passers-by  that  the Central Intelligence Agency has bugged  their brains, or simply sitting, mute and  withdrawn, sunk in an apathy so deep that  no emotion crosses their faces.  But street people are only a part of the  problem. Far more victims of this shattering  disease are now in the homes of their fami lies,  in  the nation's hospitals,  in nursing  homes, halfway houses or seedy hotels either forgotten or given care that, health  experts  agree, has brought only  limited  relief of their suffering.  SIGNS OF NEW UNDERSTANDING  But  there are now  important signs of  change.  Interviews  and an extensive  review of  medical journals and scientific papers reveal  that the nation is moving toward a new era  in both understanding and treating schizo phrenia. The new insights are paradoxical,  the news,  to some degree, both bad and  good:  Not only are more people suffering from  schizophrenia than ever, but medical and  behavioral scientists believe that the disease  itself is far more complicated and resistant  to treatment than had been realized. More over, though much has been learned about  its manifestations, the basic cause remains a  mystery.  On the other hand, for the first time in  decades, scientists are expressing cautious  hope that progress can now be made toward  unraveling  the  inner mysteries of schizo phrenia and finding more effective  treat ments.  ENORMOUS COST TO SOCIETY  All  told,  two million  to  three million  Americans,  1 percent of  the population,  either have the disorder or will develop it at  some point in their lives, according to the  National Institute of Mental Health.  The cost to society is enormous, with au thoritative estimates ranging from $20 bil lion annually, as calculated by the N.I.M.H.,  to $48 billion reported by the Institute of  Medicine of the National Academy of Sci ences. The estimates are of expenses  in curred  in providing  treatment and social  services, as well as the staggering amount of  ",1986

290,186,6,Mr.  BONIOR  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat baffled  by the intensity of the opposition to  this rule, and I will tell my colleagues  why. Everyone on that side of the aisle  understands that we voted last year to  provide a special vote on the Contra  aid issue when we voted the so-called  $27 million.  The President submitted his request,  it came up before the House, and it  was defeated. It was defeated. There  were no obligations to provide another  vehicle. There were no obligations to  provide other accelerated procedures.  But the Speaker, in fairness to the ad ministration, said on the next vehicle  that moves through this House, that  will become law-and I disagree with  the gentleman from Illinois; he knows  that  the  supplemental  is  going  to  become  law because  there  are  too  many  important issues  in this thing  that the President will not veto-the  Speaker said, in all fairness, that he  would give the opponents who had al ternatives a chance.  Quite frankly, there was a hue and a  cry from many on my side of the aisle  who said, ""Why are you giving them  another chance? Let them go through  the  regular  legislative  process,  the  committees, the Committee on Rules,  and then to the House floor."" But the  Speaker said, ""Let us be fair.""  So we went up to the Committee on  Rules and we  allow  the gentleman  from Oklahoma, who has an alterna tive, we allow the gentleman from Illi nois, who has an alternative, and we  allow  the gentleman  from  Indiana,  who has an alternative,  to express  their will in this first part of the sup plemental.  In addition, we separated out  the  Contra aid from the supplemental appropriation. We think that is fair, and  I think the Members of this body will  respond that this rule is a fair one.  The gentleman  from  Illinois  sug gests,  in  the great  tradition of  the  Democratic Party, that we stand with  Harry Truman. I would point out to  the gentleman from Illinois that when  Harry Truman involved himself in the  Marshall plan and  the containment  doctrine, he had the American people  with him. You do not have the Ameri can people with you on this issue.  The latest polls today that came out  in the gentleman's own State, the Chi cago Tribune, pointed out by a 2-to-1  majority the American people oppose  this administration in aiding militarily  the Contras in Nicaragua. And those  same findings were found in the New  York Times poll.  0 1710  There  is  a  distinct difference be tween what Harry Truman did and  what you are trying to do here in this  bill.  ",1986

304,212,6,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Speaker, our cattle men have been suffering from years of eco nomic stress and  it  is  time  that we send a  signal  to the Canadians that their ""backdoor  brokering""  import policies are placing the re sults of an unfair trade practice right at the  front door of the United States producer.  A major concern of America's cattle indus try is Canada's import policy, particularly sub sidized imports from the European Communi ty. This can cause a disproportionate amount  of  imports  into  the  United  States  from  Canada. The extra imports into Canada from  the EC  displaces Canadian  beef  into  the  United States. We are essentially a safety  valve for anything Canada cannot consume.  Subsidized beef imports from the European  Economic Community to Canada may be dis placing  the Canadian market  to  such  an  extent that Canadian beef products are being  imported  in  the United States  in  increased  quantities. This substitution or ""backdoor bro kering"" needs immediate attention.  For example,  in  1983, Canada  imported  around 13 to 14 million pounds from the EC.  In 1984, this rose to almost 50 million pounds.  The Canadian  cattlemen  have  fought  this  practice.  April15, 1986  The irony of this situation is that the Canadi an  livestock producers commissioned Can ada's equivalent of our  International Trade  Commission  [lTC]  to study whether EC beef  being imported into Canada is subsidized. The  preliminary findings by  the Canadian  tribunal  have determined the EC beef is subsidized.  Today  I am  introducing  legislation to stop  ""backdoor brokering"" from Canada. The legis lation places a moratorium on Canadian beef  products. This moratorium  includes both  live  cattle and fresh, chilled, or frozen beef.  The moratorium remains in place while the  lTC  undertakes  and  completes  within  6  months a study under section 201  of  the  Trade Act of 1974 to determine if beef prod ucts are being imported from Canada in such  increased quantities as  to be a substantial  cause of serious  injury to America's industry  producing  live cattle and  fresh,  chilled, or  frozen beef.  Upon completion of  the study,  if  the  lTC  does not find serious injury to the livestock in dustry, the moratorium will be lifted. If, howev er, serious injury is found, the moratorium will  remain  in effect. The  lTC will  periodically  update  the study-not less  than  twice each  year.  If, as a result of any study update, the  lTC finds that the injury is no longer serious,  the moratorium will be lifted.  The EC's export subsidies have brought  some cheap beef into Canada, which has dis placed local production. Ultimately, the surplus  ends up in the United States.  Unless Canada does something about  im porting subsidized EC beef, we will bear the  brunt of it in the long run.  SHEET-METAL JUSTICE  HON. ROBERT T.

306,225,6,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today, as  chairman of the House Select Committee on  Aging, to call the members' attention to an im portant  report  released at  the committee's  April 8 hearing on the interdependence of the  generations.  This  report,  ""The  Common  Stake: The Interdependence of Generations,""  is  the definitive statement on  the common  bond of generations  in  the health and eco nomic security of Americans of all ages. Yes terday,  I distributed copies of this  report  to  each member of the House on behalf of its  author-the Gerontological Society of America  [GSA]. Today, I urge the Members to carefully  review the report's findings.  The results of the committee's April 8 hear ing and the GSA report highlight the emotional  and  economic  interdependence of  families  across generations and their common stake in  programs for both young and old. They also  alert the Nation to the serious problem of pov erty among children  that threatens their and  America's  future. Most  important,  they warn  against the divisive and destructive notion of  ""intergenerational conflict"" that has been re cently popularized in the media.  Clearly, we  face a  serious  challenge  in  meeting the needs of today's and tomorrow's  children, young  families and elderly-a chal lenge that calls for a reassessment of current  funding  priorities. Where  some,  however,  would pit the generations against one another  in  funding decisions, the GSA report offers a  responsible framework for public policy based,  instead, on the interdependence of young and  old within the family and i'l society at large.  Few would deny  the common bond  that  exists among family members of all ages and  the benefit to older generations of investing in  their own  children and  grandchildren. Few  would deny  the  relief  that programs  for  the  aged provide  families on whom  the elderly  would otherwise depend. Yet, after 5 years of  cutbacks in programs for America's vulnerable  citizens,  rising  inflation and a deplorable  in crease in poverty among children, a notion of  ""intergenerational inequity"" has emerged.  This is a frightening notion  that defies the  strength of traditional family bonds and draws  an artificial, simplistic parallel between poor  young and ""well-off"" elderly. The issue is not  whether one generation has been assisted at  the  expense  of another,  but whether  the  needs of all vulnerable Americans will be met  now and  in the future. To the extent that we  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  have made progress in improving the econom ic security of older persons-the Nation can  be proud. To  the extent  that older persons  and their families remain unprotected against  the catastrophic costs of long term  illness the Nation must move quickly to provide pro tection. To the extent that children are being  driven into poverty-the Nation must move im mediately to pull them out.  The GSA report provides us with the means  for educating ourselves and the public on the  common bond of generations. With this report  in hand, it is my hope that we can redirect the  notion of  ""intergenerational conflict""  toward  what, in reality, are serious problems of pover ty and health-related financial destitution that  strike Americans of all ages and carry a heavy  toll for the entire family.  I urge you, as Mem bers of Congress and as spokespeople  for  Americans of all ages, to join with me in this  effort.  Mr. Speaker, the attached summary of the  GSA's report follows:  ""THE COMMON STAKE: THE INTERDEPENDENCE  OF GENERATIONS""  PREPARED BY THE GERONTOLOGICAL  ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [GSA]  Released April 8, 1986 at House Select Com mittee on Aging hearing ""Investing  in  America's Families: The Common Bond of  Generations""  This fact sheet outlines four key  issues  that are covP-red in the Gerontological Soci ety  of America's  <GSA)  report,  ""The  Common Stake: The  Interdependence of  Generations"", and that the Society consid ers essential to a proper framing of the up coming policy debates on the growing needs  of an aging society.  Responsible use of data  It is undoubtedly  tme that the elderly  population of the U.S. is growing and will  continue  to  increase. This  leads some  re searchers and policy makers  to question  whether there will be sufficient resources to  support a retired baby boom generation and  whether  future  taxpayers will  have  to  shoulder  unreasonably  heavy  burdens.  These fears are being used to justify short sighted policies and are helping to create  the very conflict between generations that  this group hopes to avoid. However, these  arguments  are based on  ""voodoo  demo graphics ' and ignore a significant part of  the picture. Specifically:  Their assumptions do not  take  into ac count the effects of economic growth. Given  a  realistic  assumption  of  two  percent  growth, the real costs in 2030 of supporting  each dependent could be 5 to 6 times greater  than in 1960 without increasing the burden  on society.  This view also ignores the fact that the  aged dependency ratio is only part of the  overall dependency ratio. According to the  Census Bureau,  the dependency burden which includes underage dependents as well  as the elderly-will remain below the levels  of the mid-1960's, even at the height of the  retirement of the baby-boom generation.  Lastly, this view fails to account for the  increasing proportion of  the elderly who  work. The aged dependency ratio assumes  that the elderly do not contribute to  the  economy and that all persons 18-64 are pro ductive-obviously not true. One-quarter of  men aged 65  to 69 worked in 1984 and, in  the future, a larger proportion of the elder ly will continue to work.  7575  Interdependence of generations  Fifty years ago the framers of our Social  Security Act understood that the genera tions are interdependent. They realized that  ""old age pensions are in a real sense meas ures in behali of children,""-that societally  guaranteed benefits to the elderly benefit  children and young adults because  those  public dollars relieve younger generations of  heavy financial burdens. The elderly like wise benefit from programs aimed primarily  at the young. Each generation has a stake  in social policies targeted at those in other  age groups:  Younger generations have two important  stakes in programs which assist the elderly  maintain a decent quality of life. First, pro grams which assist their grandparents and  parents to remain as autonomous as possible  in old age relieve younger families of finan cial burdens and intra-family stresses. And  second, they will be served by those pro grams when they become old.  By providing cash benefits to older family  members, Social Security frees up younger  and middle-aged family members to concen trate more financial resources on their chil dren to help them become productive mem bers of society.  Social Security stabilizes family and com munity life by enabling family members to  partially protect themselves from major fi nancial risks.  Social Security provides disability and sur vivors protection to young families.  The elderly benefit directly and indirectly  from education,  training, and health pro grams which help increase the productivity  of  the workforce. The eventual contribu tions to economic growth and tax revenue  will benefit current workers as they age.  A July 1985 Harris poll  indicates  that,  given  a  choice  between  cutting defense  spending or cutting Medicare, more than 70  percent of adult Americans  respond  that  they would prefer to see defense cuts.  Family care  Contrary to myth, the elderly have not  been deserted by their families. However,  current public policies are putting extreme  pressure on already overburdened caregiv ing families. If the government does not re spond to these growing pressures many fam ilies will be overwhelmed by the stress of  providing care to relatives. This could effec tively undermine the family and ultimately  add to the economic and social costs to the  nation.  Families, not  the government or social  agencies,  provide  80-90  percent  of  the  health/social supportive services: medically related care and home nursing, hands-on  personal  care,  household  maintenance,  transportation, and shopping.  Only 4.3  percent of  the daily  services  needed by older people are provided by Gov ernment or social agency workers. The rest  is either purchased or given by the family.  Families nowadays provide more care, and  more difficult care, over longer periods of  time to more older people than ever before.  They also strenuously avoid placing older  people  into  institutions, often exhausting  themselves emotionally, physically, and fi nancially before taking that step.  When adults aged 18-64 are asked to indi cate which public programs they would sup port, even if an increase in taxes were re quired,  they overwhelmingly favor  income  security and health care for the old.  71-()59 0-87-8 (Pt. 6)  ",1986

As patriarch of a hockey  program that could have catered to outstand ing  foreign  talent, Snooks always  looked  to  this country's youth first for hockey talent and  then taught them as much about life as he did  about skates, slap shots, and forechecking.  This man, a New England sports  legend,  was the first college hockey coach to win 500  games. He did  this while compiling an as tounding record of 501-243-15 during his 36  years at Boston College. Only three other col lege hockey coaches can boast of 500 or  more wins.  This was  not  the  only  record  Snooks  achieved. During his distinguished career, he  coached nine teams to the national champion ships and  that  record  stands  to  this day.  Snooks, a BC alumnus himself, coached his  first  team  to victory and continued winning  from that point on.  Snooks Kelley was also a founding father of  the now famous Bean pot Tournament and led  eight of his own teams to victory in the cele brated New England hockey fest. The awards  and distinctions he received during and after  his career are  far  too numerous  to  list but  bear testament to the commitment he made  to a sport that is truly part of New England.  His  record  is not one  that will  soon be  matched and I have no doubt he will long be  heralded for his accomplishments by the stu dents and athletes whose lives were changed  by his persevering optimism.  Beyond hockey, Snooks Kelley stood  for  education and development of sound, well rounded American youth. He taught at Cam bridge High and Latin School  for 30 years,  giving young scholars  the same encourage ment and  insight he  instilled on  the hockey  rink. This was a man who cared about people,  a man who  developed  young minds and  bodies to their fullest potential while maintain ing the good heart that his friends and associ ates will remember him by.  Snooks Kelley, member of  the National  Hockey Hall of Fame, member of the Boston  College Hall of Fame, friend, coach, pioneer,  and above all Great American, will be sorely  missed.

GOODLING  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April15, 1986  ",1986
310,251,6,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker,  is today just  the first of a series of deadlines this House  will miss under  the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Reduction Act of 1985?  Congress was to have completed action on  a binding budget  resolution  for  fiscal  year  1987 by today. The majority side of the House  Budget Committee has not even produced  such a resolution to date.  Before we know it, June 1 0, the deadline for  all appropriations bills to be through the Ap propriations Committee, will  be past. Then  June 15, when the Congress is to have com pleted action on budget reconciliation, will be  gone .. June 30, when all appropriations bills  are to have cleared the House, may slip by. If  we miss those last deadlines, we may miss an  extended  Independence Day  district work  period, because technically we cannot adjourn  for more than 3 days until we have cleared all  reconciliation and appropriations legislation.  The purpose of the accelerated deadlines  for  consideration of budget  legislation  this  year was to insure that everything was done  by mid-August, when  the economic agencies  are  to  take  the economic snapshot that will  show whether we are within the required defi cit reduction target and can avoid sequestra tion on necessary programs.  Every deadline we miss brings us closer to  the sequestration we wish  to avoid. Let us  start meeting the deadlines instead of ignoring  them.  A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO DR. H.  CLAUDE HUDSON  HON.AUGUSTUSF.HA~NS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April15, 1986  ",1986
311,251,6,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, on April 19,  1986, the distinguished son of a former slave  and Louisiana sharecropper, Dr. H. Claude  Hudson,  shares his 1 OOth  anniversary with  four generations of relatives, community asso ciates, and friends from all walks of life.  The phenomenal career of this  libertarian,  successful  dentist,  civil  rights  leader,  and  president of a $50 million savings and loan in stitution  exemplifies  the  finest  tradition  of  American life.  Dr. Hudson was elected to the presidency  of the Shreveport, LA, branch of the NAACP  in 1921 at a time when being president of the  NAACP in the South was not only unfashiona ble, but suicidal. Whenever  referring  to his  membership in the NAACP, he identified it as  a citizens' committee. He was so active  in  fighting segregation and police abuses that in  June 1923 he was ""called on the carpet"" by  the power structure.  Immediately, he went to  the office of the chief of police and found him  with the sheriff discussing what to do with Dr.  Hudson. Dr. Hudson argued the situtation with  them and they finally admonished him to, ""Go  home, be a good boy, and don't give us any  more trouble.""  That visit to the chief of police and sheriff  saved his  life. Having already obtained a  li cense  to practice dentistry  in California, he  moved his family to Los Angeles without caus ing further disturbance. That incident gave rise  to  the  rumor  that he had been  run out of  Shreveport. He never denied it because it was  a good story and gave everyone who heard it  a good laugh.  In November 1924, due  to  this  record of  service during his 2 years with the Shreveport  branch of the NAACP, he was elected to the  presidency of the Los Angeles branch. Even  though he had changed his  residency,  he  didn't miss a year of service with the NAACP.  During his second term as president of the  Los Angeles branch, Dr. Hudson faced a seri ous civil rights problem. At this time the Pacif ic Ocean was segregated: Black people, with  one minor exception, could not go  to  the  beach without being molested. So in 1925, he  and  seven other members of  the NAACP  waded  in  the ocean at Manhattan Beach,  were arrested and fined $500 for defying the  no-swimming ordinance. He  immediately ap pealed the decision, and thereupon the Man hattan Beach court called him in and wanted  to throw the case out of court. He agreed, but  asked what was going to be done about the  parking ordinance which allowed only 15 min utes for bathers to undress, swim, and return  to their cars. The court reminded him that it  would take about 90 days to repeal the ordi nance. Dr. Hudson informed him that he was  aware of that, as well as the fact that the ordi nance was not being enforced against anyone  else. The court responded that if he dropped  the case  they would not enforce  the ordi nance against black people. On the following  day Dr. Hudson  took a  little black boy with  him to swim on the beach to see if they would  be arrested, but they were not and from that  day on the beaches have been open to every one.  Dr. Hudson served 10 consecutive years as  president of the NAACP Los Angeles branch,  which he developed  into one of the  largest  and most effective in the Nation. Since 1934,  Dr. Hudson has served  the  local branch as  either vice president or as a member of the  executive board.  In 1950, he was elected to  the national board of directors of the NAACP  and has served continuously since that date.  He is at present a member of the executive  committee of the national board of directors.  In 1927, Dr. Hudson enrolled in the Loyola  University School of Law and was awarded  the LL.B. degree in 1931. His interest in the  study of law was to broaden his education to  better enable him to carry on the work of the  civil rights organization.  Dr. Hudson  assumed  the  presidency of  Broadway Federal Savings & Loan Associa tion in 1949 when the association had assets  of less than $3 million. The association, with  Dr. Hudson as its leader, broke the strangle hold of white savings and loan associations in  Los Angeles, who refused to lend money on  property located in neighborhoods where they  felt black people should not  live. Broadway  made so many loans until the white associa tions  reversed  their  position  and  began  making loans to people under better terms.  Under Dr. Hudson's  leadership, Broadway  Federal Savings grew into a $57 million com pany. During his tenure as president of the as sociation, he enrolled in the American Savings  and Loan  Institute evening school and ob tained a graduate diploma  in  the operation  and management of savings and  loan asso ciations. Dr. Hudson is now president emeritus  of Broadway Federal Savings and Loan Asso ciation of Los Angeles, having retired from the  presidency in 1972.  In  1962,  at  charter  day  exercises,  Dr.  Hudson  received  the Distinguished Alumnus  Award from his alma mater, Howard Universi ty, for distinguished service as a dentist, busi nessman, and civil rights advocate.  He serves as a member of the Los Angeles  County Real Estate Advisory Commission and  as a member of the board of trustees of the  Martin Luther King Memorial Hospital. The au ditorium of King Hospital was named in honor  of Dr. H. Claude Hudson. Loyola University,  ",1986

323,264,6,Ms. FIEDLER.," I  thank the gentle man.  Mr. Chairman, we spend billions and  billions of dollars on our national de fense, and yet when there  is a  real  threat in our own back yard, we refuse  to acknowledge that it exists.  Now in just the past couple of days  we have seen what happens when we  recognize a threat. The threat in this  case was Qadhafi's support of terrorI  thank  ism, and Congress saw the effective ness with which the United States can  respond when it is necessary.  After all, he armed, supported, and  trained terrorists in another part of  the world. Yet we  see  a  situation  taking place in Nicaragua with many  of the same terrorist groups that are  involved with Libya and some liberals  propose that we do nothing to stop  them.  0 1050  The threat of terrorists working out  of Nicaragua is compounded by a tre mendous buildup of troops by the San dinista government that did not exist  prior to their taking over.  In 1979, there was only 16,000 troops  in the country of Nicaragua; yet today,  there are 120,000  troops  there. The  Soviet Union has invested, along with  the Cubans, more than $500 million in  military  equipment  for  Nicaragua.  They have provided military hardware  in the form of tanks, artillery, helicop ter gunships, patrol boats, a whole  host of other  things,  to help work  toward exporting terror in that part of  the world. In Nicaragua we are dealing  with the issue of the Sandinistas ex porting  terrorism  to  a  neighboring  country, El Salvador, which is trying  to stabilize a democracy. They have  also put their arms around and dealt  closely with the PLO, the Libyans, the  Iranians, all of whom comprise  the  greatest elements of opposition to the  United States and its citizens. They all  advocate World terror.  Terrorist activities are taking place  within Nicaragua  itself. They have  slaughtered numerous Miskito Indians  in Nicaragua;  they have burned the  only synagogue in Managua, and the  entire Jewish community had to leave  Nicaragua because  it was no  longer  safe there. There is also a tremendous  level  of  religious  repression  taking  place there today.  These are the people who have con trol over the Nicaraguan Government.  These are the same enemies that we  were dealing with in Libya. And for  this Government not to recognize the  enormous threat that exists, not thou sands and  thousands of miles away  from our shores, but right here in our  hemisphere, is a  terrible mistake for  us and the American people.  I urge  this body to support aid for the Con tras so that they can establish a de mocracy in Nicaragua, instead of per mitting the continuing expansion of  influence by the same terrorist groups  we are dealing with in Libya.

Here  is  the report which I signed  and put out together with my distin guished colleague from the majority  side,  the  gentleman  from  Texas,  CHARLEs WILSON, the gentleman from  New York [Mr. SoLOMON] and myself  on the prison system in Nicaragua.  At the height of Somoza's cruelty to  his own people, the deposed and mur dered dictator, he had a high-water  mark of 500 people  in his prisons.  There are now between 11,000 and  13,000 people in prison in Nicaragua.  I had the opportunity to debate a  nun of my faith by radio in San Anto nio. She told me that she has a friend  who visits all of these political prison ers and that they are getting sensitivi ty training on their crimes against the  people under Somoza.  The fact  is  the majority of  people fought against Somoza.  The map, which cannot be seen too  well by Members in the back of the  House, shows 10 major prisons and 4  suspected prisons. We do not yet have  all the intelligence we need on Nicara gua-a country which is closer to my  district in southern California than we  are here in the Capital City.  But here is a graph that no one on  the majority side who votes against  the President has  refuted.  It says  there were 20,000 square feet of prison  footage under Somoza. It is now way  over 100,000 square feet,  locking up  people who fought with the Commu nists who were part of the Sandinistas  to free that country.  Look at these pictures. This is hard  evidence.  I have offered several times in this  to resign from  well  the Congress  if  somebody can show me this is a mas sive conspiracy between the leadership  on both sides of the aisle, the CIA, the  Defense Intelligence Agency, and that  somehow or other it is a coverup.  0 1225  Without sufficient time to adequate ly cover this issue I urge, Mr. Chair man, my colleagues  to please watch  my special order, following that of the  gentleman from Georgia  [Mr. GINGthese  RICH] tonight, where I talk individual ly about each prison camp.  ",1986
329,277,6,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Chairman,  this  is  the fourth time within a year that the House of  Representatives  is considering  the  issue of  aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. A year ago last  April the House decided that assistance to the  Contras was wrong. Today, such aid still  is  wrong, and  I urge the House to support the  substitute to the Senate resolution offered by  our colleague  from  Indiana, LEE HAMIL TON,  which does not provide any aid  to the Con tras.  There is no political, strategic, moral, or in tellectual value in supporting the Contras. The  administration's policy of seeking a military so lution  to our differences with Nicaragua  is  wrongheaded and it is doomed to failure. Yet,  the administration persists in its efforts to pro mote the Contra cause. The administration is  pressuring Honduras and Costa Rica to coop erate with our backing of the Contras. Recent  news reports have now informed us that the  CIA has given the Contras several million dol lars during  the past year  for various Contra  political projects.  Notwithstanding this enthusiastic support by  the administration  for the Contra cause,  the  hard  truth  is  that  the Contras do not have  popular appeal  in Nicaragua. Many of  the  Contras are viewed, correctly, as being former  members of the hated Somoza national guard.  The Contras have repeatedly engaged in ter rorist campaigns against Nicaraguan civilians  and their atrocities have been well document ed  by  various  human  rights organizations.  Even President Reagan,  last June, belatedly  acknowledged the acts of brutality committed  by the Contras.  The Contras have no political legitimacy in  Nicaragua. They are fighting a losing cause.  There  is no popular uprising on  their behalf.  They have not been able  to hold a single  town in Nicaragua, and, by themselves,  they  cannot dislodge the Saninistas.  The President has told us that our credibility  will collapse and our alliances will crumble if  we fail to aid the Contras and prevail in Cen tral America. But,  it is the President, and no  one else, who has made our credibility and  our alliances an  issue. None of our major  allies throughout the world support the Presi dent's promotion of the Contras. In particular,  our friends and allies in Central America, who  know this region best, do not back the Presi dent's policy. On the contrary, heads of state  throughout Central and Latin America have  called  the Reagan  administration's military  support  for  the Contras wrong. The newly  elected President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias,  has stated his desire to prevent the Contras  from using Costa Rica as a base, and he has  said  that the President should use the $1 00  million that Mr. Reagan is seeking in military  aid to the Contras for economic aid to United  States-allied  governments  in  that  region.  President Reagan, however, with  the wrong  kind of farsightedness,  ignores the advice of  our neighbors to the south.  The $1 00 million which the President asked  for the Contras is nothing more than an addi tional downpayment to try to keep the Contra  cause alive. I doubt that anyone in this Cham ber seriously believes that this $100 million is  going to help topple the Nicaraguan Government The administration has failed to tell us  what the upper limit is of financial aid to the  Contras. It is inevitable that we will see addi tional  requests  in  the  future  for escalating  amounts of money  to prop up  the Contra  forces.  Mr. Chairman, the President's policy toward  Nicaragua is also very dangerous. It is danger ous because it permits the Reagan adminis tration  to  inexorably push  the United States  deeper and deeper into a Central American  quagmire. For those of us who remember the  steps which  led  to our  involvement  in Viet nam,  the parallel with Nicaragua  is striking,  and  the  lessons of our tragic experience  in  Vietnam must not be ignored.  If this request  for $100 million is approved, the President will  interpret such support as a blanket congres sional endorsement for whatever he seeks to  do against Nicaragua. This, I fear, will eventu ally result in the involvement of our Nation in  a military action against Nicaragua once it be comes obvious to the administration that the  armed aggression by the externally financed  Contras cannot succeed. At  that point,  this  war by proxy against Nicaragua will cease  being a war by proxy.  There, however, is an alternative to the ad ministration's policy of unleashing the dogs of  war in Central America.  It is a process for a  negotiated peace  in Central America which  has been proposed by the Contadora group of  eight Latin American states. This Contadora  peace process offers  the best prospect  for  obtaini1:1g a  long-term commitment  to peace  and stability in Central America and we should  become a willing partner in the diplomatic pur suit for peace.  ",1986
330,277,6,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Chairman,  I would  like  to  make a brief observation about our policy  toward Nicaragua and  some  recommenda tions.  In a representative democracy it is impera tive  that  foreign policy  in particular  receive  broad support if it is to work. This is especially  important when  it involves a long-term com mitment, such as in the case of Nicaragua.  That the American people are split on  in creasing aid  to  the Contras  is clear. Most  polls, in fact, show that the majority of Ameri can people oppose increasing aid to the Con tras.  While the American people may not agree  on a policy toward Nicaragua, Mr. Chairman,  they are united on policy goals. The American  people, by and large, would like to see Nicara gua decrease  reliance on  the Soviet Union  and Cuba; they want Nicaragua to reduce the  size of its armed forces so that it no longer  would in any way threaten its Latin neighbors;  and, Mr. Chairman,  they want Nicaragua  to  move  toward  a  representative  government  that respects the rights of its citizens.  How do we accomplish our shared goals,  Mr. Chairman? Well, I do not believe there is  any policy guaranteed to work. I am convinced  that continuing the current policy or escalating  U.S. military support for the Contras will not  do  the  job.  The  administration's  policies  toward Nicaragua have only worsen the situa tion. Compared  to 1980, Nicaragua  today  is  far more  reliant on  the Soviet Union and  Cuba,  its military force is double in size and  ",1986

337,316,6,Mrs. BOGGS.," I  thank the Speaker  so much.  As the House of Representatives pre pares to consider the supplemental ap propriations bill and the disapproval  of a number of proposed deferrals,  many related to housing assistance for  lowand moderate-income Americans,  I thought it a most appropriate time  to call our colleagues' attention to the  very real success story of BUD's Sec tion 202 Loan Program, which assists  nonprofit organizations or sponsors in  providing housing for the elderly and  handicapped who are of low or moder ate income.  I am deeply concerned that the ad ministration has requested rescission  of funds for the Section 202 Program  in fiscal year 1986 and has requested  no funds for the program in fiscal year  1987. Along with many of our col leagues, I continue to subscribe to the  goal,  first expressed  in the Housing  Act of 1949, of decent, safe and sani tary housing for all Americans. Good  quality,  affordable housing  for our  growing elderly population is in short  supply, yet the kind of housing provid ed through the Section 202 Program  over 1,800  has often been found to help the el derly live independent lives, avoiding  the need for confinement in nursing  homes.  There  are  many  202  projects  throughout  the Nation  that deserve  our praise. I  should especially like to  compliment the initiative and leader ship of the archdiocese of New Orle ans in making use of the Section 202  Program to provide fine housing for  elderly and handicapped  area residents. The kinds of projects  developed  in  the New Orleans area  and operated by  the Sisters of  the  Holy Family and other religious orders  and nonprofit organizations offer in spiring examples of  the great gains  that can be made with a little Federal  help and encouragement.  I would like to share with you some  excerpts  from an article which ap peared in the March 8, 1986 issue of  America Magazine written by Joseph  H. Fichter, S.J., a sociologist at Loyola  University  in New Orleans. Father  Fichter tells the story of the success ful  archdiocesan  effort  to  provide  housing  for  the elderly and handi capped  in  the New Orleans  area  through the Section 202 Program. He  highlights  a  residential  community  known as St. John Berchmans Manor,  operated by the Sisters of the Holy  Family.  In addition,  I would  like  to share  with our colleagues a  letter  to  the  editor of America submitted by our es teemed colleague, the gentleman from  Texas [Mr. GoNZALEZ] chairman of the  Banking Committee's Housing Sub committee. Chairman GoNZALEZ notes  the many accomplishments of the Sec tion 202 Program and urges that we as  a nation make certain that we can pro vide more St. John Berchmans Manors  for Americans.  I certainly share his  views.  St. John Berchmans Manor in New Orle ans, La., is a high-rise, 150-unit residence for  elderly persons of low income, built with a  Department of Housing and Urban Develop ment <H.U.D.> loan and managed by the sis ters of the Holy Family. The tenants must  be at least 62 years of age and have an  annual income of no more than $9,650. The  sisters have been approved for another 40year Federal H.U.D. loan, this time to build  a 50-unit high-rise next door to their Lafon  Nursing Home. All plans and blueprints  have been completed, but the specific allo cation of funds has been delayed. The pro portion of needy elderly is increasing in the  New Orleans population, while the Federal  commitment to such housing appears to be  gradually eroding.  The 1971 White House Conference on  Aging had recommended the construction of  120,000 units of housing for the elderly an nually. In no single year since then has Con gress appropriated sufficient funds to pro vide more than 30,000 such housing units.  In 1984, the Federal Government approved  only 12,000 units of Section 202 housing for  the elderly. For 1986, the allocations across  the country are for only 14,000 units of el derly housing, but there was  included on  the agenda of the Appropriations Committee an item to freeze all section 202 alloca tions. While the need is immense and grow ing, the Federal retrenchment of funds for  elderly housing is exacerbating the problem.  Nevertheless, the long-term loans and rental  subsidies  from H.U.D. made possible  10  archdiocesan  housing  projects  providing  1,835 apartments for the elderly poor and  handicapped in the New Orleans area. The  Archdiocese now boasts one of the largest  privately  sponsored housing programs  in  the United States.  The sisters undertook this venture  into  congregate housing for the elderly poor at  the  inspiration of Archbishop Philip M.  Hannan, who was alerted to the shortage of  housing from his first days in New Orleans.  On his arrival in 1965, he was greeted with  the  devastation wrought  by Hurricane  Betsy, especially on the homes of the poor.  He was met by Eugene McManus, S.S.J., a  trained  sociologist with  long  experience  among the local black parishes, who urged  application for Federal loans under Section  202  of  the  1959 Housing Act.  Father  McManus, a member of the Mayor's Hous ing Committee and local chapter president  of  the Urban League, contacted Michael  O'Keefe, William Guste, Clarence Jupiter,  Louis Reed and others to organize Christo pher Homes, Inc., a nonprofit corporation to  develop housing for low-income people.  The  residents of St.  John Berchmans  Manor are among the fortunate minority of  low-income senior citizens able  to obtain  such housing accommodations. Sister Rose  de Lima Hazeur, S.S.F., manager of  the  Manor, reports increasing numbers of frus trated  applicants.  St.  John Berchmans  Manor exemplifies the ingenuity and cour age of the Holy Family Sisters who own and  staff the facility that was built on land be longing  to  their religious community. All  the other Federally financed projects under  diocesan sponsorship were built on land ac quired by the Archbishop for this purpose.  Assuming the administration of these hous ing complexes constituted a new and addi tional apostolate for the religious sisters of  six different communities.  The  residents of St.  John Berchmans  Manor are among the fortunate minority of  low-income senior citizens able  to obtain  such affordable housing accommodations.  They are the envy of thousands of similarly  qualified  ""outsiders""  looking  for  similar  housing that simply does not exist.  There are positive benefits  that accrue  beyond  the  routine of moving  into safe,  comfortable,  affordable  living  quarters.  James Broder points out that such nonprof it housing  for  the  elderly can  increase  healthy  lifespans. He states: ""Because of  social involvement, emotional and physical  security, and the services that can be pro vided, people occupying such housing tend  not to deteriorate in many of the ways asso ciated with aging. Residents of such housing  tend to live more active, healthier lives and  require less institutionalization.""  The promotion of this expanding social  ministry may provide apostolic opportuni ties for other Catholic dioceses and religious  communities.  In response to this splendid article,  Mr. GoNZALEZ wrote  the  following  letter to the editor of America.  CONGRESSIONAL VOICE FOR THE POOR  I wish  to commend Father Joseph H.

339,329,6,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  today 20 colleagues and I, Democrats  and Republicans alike, introduced leg islation to promote competition in the  natural gas market,  to provide con sumers and producers with access to  transportation and to make available  ample supplies of natural gas at the  lowest reasonable price. This legisla tion,  the Natural Gas  Policy Act  Amendments of 1986, has been submit ted  to the Congress by the Depart ment of Energy. It is an excellent bill  that would do much to improve our  Nation's energy  security and would  expand the use of a clean-burning and  abundant domestic fuel.  The Department  of Energy  esti mates that if this bill were passed, nat ural gas prices would be lower by 10 to  20 cents per thousand cubic feet per  year between 1987 and 1995. Allowing  producers of gas from old fields to get  market prices for that gas would result  in the production of 30 to 34 trillion  cubic feet over the next 40 years. This  is equivalent to nearly 2 years of do mestic natural gas consumption. With out legislation decontrolling old natu ral gas, this 2-year supply of gas will  never be produced.  Passage of this bill will not be easy.  It will take political courage to over come the inertia, bogymen, and parti san politics  that have blocked good  natural gas legislation. The Secretary  of Energy is serious about this legisla tion. The President  is serious about  natural gas decontrol. He said so in his  State of the Union Address. The other  body held a hearing on this bill and  other natural gas legislation this week.  I and those cosponsoring this legisla tion are serious about it and we plan  to work for it.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle  to  look at this  legislation.  Let's work together to get it passed. A  section-by-section  analysis,  a  fact  sheet on the bill and an editorial from  the April 7 oil and gas journal follows:  FACTSHEET-NATURAL GAS POLICY ACT  AMENDMENTS OF 1986  SUMMARY  The Administration bill will promote com petition in the natural gas market and will  ensure  that  consumers  receive  adequate  supplies of natural gas at reasonable prices.  The Administration  bill will  result  in  lower average gas prices, increased domestic  gas production and consumption,  reduced  payments for imported oil and gas supplies,  and an improved balance-of-trade.  Reduced prices for high cost supplies and  increased production of low-cost old gas sup plies will lower gas prices by an average of  about $0.10 to $0.20 per thousand cubic feet  per year between 1987 and 1995.  Market prices for old gas will result in in creased production from existing old gas re serves of about 30 to 34 tcf over the next 40  years, including about 12 to 14 tcf from de layed abandonment, 15.5 tcf from infill drill ing, and 2.5 to 4.5 tcf from production en hancement.  The Administration bill will result in net  economic benefits of about $16 billion <1984  dollars> over the next ten years relative to  current regulations.  PROVISIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BILL  The Administration bill  includes ""open  access"" provisions  that require  interstate  pipelines  to provide  transportation on a  nondiscriminatory basis and to the fullest  extent practicable.  Upon enactment, the Administration bill  decontrols all natural gas wellhead prices  subject to new or renegotiated contracts. All  remaining Federal wellhead price controls  are to be removed on April1, 1987.  The Administration bill will prevent con tracts containing an area rate clause, with  no other indefinite price escalator clause,  from reverting to extemely low fixed prices.  Provisions in current law that arbitrarily  restrain the demand for natural gas, includ ing certain provisions of the Fuel Use Act  and the incremental pricing provision of the  NGPA, are repealed.  BENEFITS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BILL  The Administration bill will open access to  available interstate pipeline transportation  capacity.  Open access will increase the competition  between pipelines and producers and there by ensure least-cost gas supplies to consum ers.  Open access will ensure that the benefits  of increased competition in the natural gas  market extend to all consumers.  The Administration  bill will  result  lower average natural gas prices and  creased gas market flexibility.  After partial decontrol, average wellhead  prices declined by about 5 percent in real  terms during 1985. Under full decontrol, av erage prices are projected to fall by about 14  to 17 percent in the first year after enact ment, or by about $0.25 to $0.45 per mcf.  Decontrol of all gas prices will result in  the production of 30 to 34 tcf of old gas re serves that would not be produced under  current regulations. This additional produc tion will occur at the rate of about 750 to  850 bcf per year for the next 40 years.  Increased production of old gas reserves  will lower gas prices and encourage renego tiation of contracts that hold high-cost gas  prices above market-clearing levels.  Lower gas prices, increased consumption  and production of old gas reserves, and re negotiation of high-cost contracts will rapid ly dissipate the inefficient surplus of deliv erable gas supplies.  Lower domestic gas prices will also force  prices for imported gas to decline, reducing  payments for imported gas by about $3 bil lion to $5 billion between 1987 and 1995.  Lower prices  for natural gas will also  reduce oil imports by about 300 to 350 thou sand barrels per day on average from 1987  to 1995, resulting in an annual reduction of  $1.6 billion to $3.2 billion in the U.S. bal ance-of-payments deficit.  Repeal of demand restraints will allow all  consumers  to choose  the least-costly fuel  available.  in  in SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS-NATURAL  GAS POLICY ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1986  TITLE I-GPEN ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION  Section 101 would  revise Natural Gas  Policy Act [NGPAJ section 31l<a> to expand  voluntary  transactions for gas  transportation. This, and  the  following  section on  ""Open Access Carriage,"" are  intended  to  open the transportation system to competi tion. As a result, all gas supplies, including  low-cost  gas now  shut-in, would become  available at prices that reflect the highly  competitive nature of  the wellhead and  burner-tip markets for natural gas.  NGPA section 31l<a> currently permits  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  to authorize  transportation by  interstate  pipelines on behalf of an intrastate pipeline  or local distribution company, and by an  intrastate pipeline on behalf of any inter state pipeline or local distribution company  served by an interstate pipeline. Section 101  would  expand NGPA  section  31l<a>  to  permit  the Commission  to authorize any  pipeline to transport gas on behalf of any  person. The use of the phrase ""any person""  is not intended to reflect any view concern ing the persons on whose behalf gas cur rently can be  transported under  section  31l<a>. but rather to indicate the broadest  application of section 3ll<a>.  Section 101 also would add a new para graph <4>  to NGPA section 31l<a> to make  clear  transportation  under  that  section  must be non-discriminatory. There is no le gitimate  reason  to  discrimination  in an  open, market-oriented system. Discrimina tion hinders competition, and  thus  is at  cross purposes with the Congressional deter mination in the NGPA that the wellhead  market is competitive and that consumers  are best served by letting competitive forces  work.  In addition, new paragraph <4> would re quire any natural gas company which re ceived gas pursuant  to section 31l<a>  to  offer section 31l<a>  transportation service.  It is intended that those who benefit from  section 31l<a> transportation services must  offer the same service to others.  These changes would not affect the basic  thrust of the Coxnmission's recent action in  Order No. 436. Rather, these changes are in tended to codify the spirit of that action  and to reinforce the Coxnmission's generic  authority to promote and provide for volun tary  transportation  arrangements,  and  thereby to increase the competitive flow of  gas in commerce at market-sensitive prices.  Section 102 would add a new section 316  to the NGPA providing for ""Open Access  Carriage."" Section 316 would provide that,  upon application by any person, the Com mission shall direct an interstate pipeline to  transport gas unless  the pipeline demon strates to the Coxnmission it is incapable of  rendering the service. This section is intend ed to open the natural gas market to the op eration of the laws of supply and demand to  the fullest extent. It would remove barriers  to open transportation that now exist, and  would allow willing buyers and sellers  to  deal directly  to bring low cost, currently  shut-in gas to market. This section responds  to the failure of most interstate pipelines to  participate in Order No. 436, and to the con ditions that precipitated Order No. 436  in  the first place: the inability of consumers to  obtain transportation for gas purchased di rectly from producers.  In determining whether a pipeline is ""in capable"" of rendering service the Commis sion, it is intended, would avoid interpreta tions that prevent carriage. The Commis sion should consider such factors as full  pipeline  utilization,  full  use  of pipeline  interconnections and compression, and dis placement or other ways of  facilitating  transportation. The primary concern of the  Commission, in making this determination,  ",1986
340,355,6,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, there are  times when we wish to recognize some one whom we admire and appreciate.  This is the case regarding Stephen B.  Roman, a Canadian citizen who on  April 17 attains the ripe young age of  65.  his  Stephen's biography is replete with  one  basic  theme: He  has  done  it  mostly all by himself. Emigrating from  Czechoslovakia, a country I know so  well, because I served there as a For eign Service Officer in the late 1940's,  Stephen  changed  destiny  from  being an ordinary farmer to becoming  one of Canada's most enterprising and  successful business  leaders as Chair man and CEO of Denison Mines, a  multi-billion dollar multi-venture cor poration with worldwide investments,  including in the United States.  How did he do it-to accomplish so  much in such a relatively short time?  Stephen  says  ""By  faith  and  good  farmer's common  sense,"" which he  still practices. ""If you treat people as  though they were the most important  people in the world       they, too, will  respond  positively,""  is  Stephen B.  Roman's motto.  And, he has proved his motto over  and over. Most recently during the Ca nadian Papal visit, he prevailed in get ting Pope John Paul II to come and  bless the cornerstone of a Slovak Byz antine Rite Catholic cathedral, while  Canadian hierarchs sought to prevent  such a side trip. It was no easy task to  overcome such an obstacle.  He has a great passion for his Slovak  ethnic roots. He was primarily respon sible for unifying all the various small  emigre  groups  into  one  cohesive  Slovak World Congress headquartered  in Toronto. The Communist govern ment  in Czechoslovakia  has  been  ceaselessly trying with all kinds of un derhanded maneuvers  to  embarrass  Stephen Roman and those who work  for the Congress. Despite that, in the  United States alone, some half million  members of fraternal, civic and social  associations belong to and support the  Slovak World Congress, which  he  founded 15 years ago.  Since we have not forgotten our brethren  who are still suffering religious persecution  and denied  their basic human and civil  rights, we get together periodically to bring  to world public opinion a  record of those  abuses. And it is a sorry record for the once  most progressive country of Czechoslovakia,  to deny their own peoples-the Slovaks and  Czechs-the basic freedoms which are so  ",1986
341,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY., The statute is very  clear that it has to be wrongful.  ,1986
342,368,6,Mr. SPECTER., Is not a punch in the  nose wrongful?  ,1986
343,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY.,"  I could take the  Senator's question more  seriously and I know that it is a serious question  from his point of view-if he were will ing to admit that we have a problem  when confronted with the facts of the  Enmons case. That case involved a ter rific  amount of damage  and harm  done to individuals, yet the Supreme  Court said that was all right-if the  goals that were behind the extortion  activity at that particular time were  all  right. The Supreme Court  said  that.  If the Senator from Pennsylvania  were willing to tell me that he thinks  that those instances should be pros ecuted by Federal law, then I would  say that he would make a case for the  points he is bringing up. But he does  not  accept  the  premise  that  the  Enmons case was wrongly decided.  ",1986
344,368,6,Mr. SPECTER.," The Supreme Court  did not condone the conduct in that  case. The Supreme Court said it did  not fall under the provisions of the  Federal statute. This Senator does not  condone that conduct. This Senator is  very much opposed  to  it. My  long  record as assistant district attorney in  Pennsylvania,  in  the convictions  in  labor violence cases, supports what I  am saying.  The issue is whether this language  would permit prosecution of a simple  assault and battery case, and I submit  to the Senator that it does.  ",1986
345,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY., I do not know how  I can make it any more clear cut. It  does not.  ,1986
346,368,6,Mr. SPECTER.," What  in  the  lan guage of the statute precludes Federal  prosecution, under this bill, of simple  assault and battery?  ",1986
347,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY., Because it does not  have extortion intent.  ,1986
348,368,6,Mr. SPECTER.," That is a jury ques tion. That is a question to be decided  by a jury, as to what is intended. That  subjects somebody who engages in a  fistfight on a picket line to a prosecution in the Federal court, arrest by the  U.S. marshal, for a jury to decide the  question of intent. That is a fact ques tion.  ",1986
349,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY., There is a bar to  prosecution in those instances.  ,1986
350,368,6,Mr. SPECTER.," But the bars to pros ecution do not bar a fistfight. It says  in subsection <c><3> that it is peaceful  picketing. But if you have a fistfight,  that is not peaceful picketing.  If you  look at subsection (d), you  have  to have all  three. Again, you  refer to peaceful picketing, so a  fist fight is not peaceful picketing.  The gravamen of  this bill amends  the term ""extortion,"" saying:  ""The term 'extortion' means the obtaining  of property from another, with his or her  consent, induced by use of actual or threat ened  force,  violence, or  fear  thereof, or  wrongful use of fear not involving force or  violence, or under color of official right."".  That language says directly that ex tortion covers the use of actual force.  A  fistfight  constitutes actual  force,  and that is the concern I have, and  that is my objection.  If this bill went to organized crime and I have started to ask the Senator  the question about organized crime-if  you have a limitation in this bill to or ganized crime, this Senator would take  a very different view, as I said during  the course of the hearings.  I compliment the Senator from Iowa  for his tenacity in bringing the meas ure forward and for the hearings he  has held. But I raise this point in this  manner to put on the record what is  the essence of this bill, and that is  that it makes subject to Federal pros ecution a fistfight on a union picket  line, and I believe that is unwise.  ",1986
351,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY.,"  I  suggest  to  the  Senator  from Pennsylvania  that at  this point we will have to part compa ny. He has his point of view, and I  have expressed my point of view.  I  have expressed the point that the At torney General agrees with my point  of view,  and  I  have expressed  the  point that the President's Commission  on Organized Crime agrees with my  point of view. And from  that point  there just has to be honest disagree ment of opinion. I do not know how  else to handle it.  ",1986
352,368,6,Mr. SPECTER.," I will not take the  time to go into the opinions of the At torney General and the Commission  on Crime, except that those views do  not control in the face of clear statuto ry language to the contrary which is  expressed in S. 177 4.  I  thank the Senator for remaining  on  the  floor  and engaging  in  this  dialog because I think it sets the pa rameter, and certainly establishes the  reasons, that I have objection to this  bill and refuse to go along with the  motion to proceed.  In essence, when the bill in its lan guage  says,  ""the  term  'extortion'  means force"" period, an assault and  battery case is force and the bars on  prosecution do not preclude unpeace ful picketing. A fistfight is not peace ful picketing, and this bill would make  it a violation of Federal law to have a  fistfight. That is what the bill says  and no amount of interpretation by  the Attorney General or  legislative  history, even of the author of the bill,  in  the face of that language would  change it.  If you want to amend this language  to say that it does not cover assault  and battery, simple assault and bat tery, that would do  it. But this bill  just makes it a Federal offense to have  a fistfight, and I do not think that is  an appropriate Federal case.  I  thank the Chair and I yield the  floor.  ",1986
353,368,6,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, at  this point I yield  to Senator THuR MOND, chairman of the Senate Judici ary Committee who  is  in support of  the legislation and happens to be a co sponsor of it as well.  ",1986
354,368,6,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise  in support of S. 177 4, a bill to  amend the Hobbs Act. This particular  measure was  sponsored by Senator  GRASSLEY and introduced on October  18, 1985; however, this issue has been  the subject of several bills and  re ceived extensive review during the last  few Congresses. In the 97th Congress,  I introduced an almost identical meas ure, S. 2189. In the 98th Congress Sen ator GRASSLEY  introduced S. 462 on  which three hearings were held. Earli er in this Congress, Senator GRASSLEY  introduced S. 300.   S. 177 4 is necessary to undo the ef fects of the 1973 Supreme Court deci sion, United States versus Enmons,  which drastically limited the applica tion of the extortion provisions in the  Hobbs Act with  respect  to violence  which occurs during the course of a  labor dispute. Violence or  intimida tion, regardless of its source, should  never be used  to disrupt commerce.  The Hobbs Act, as originally written,  was meant to apply to everyone; there  was never any congressional intent to  provide an exception for any group or  individual.  Samuel Hobbs,  the  author of the act, stated at the time  the bill was passed, ""Crime is crime,  no matter who commits it: robbery is  robbery,  and  extortion  extortion,  whether or not the perpetrator has a  union card."" S. 1774 would ensure that  those union officials and their agents,  who are not lawabiding, are subject to  the same  laws  that apply  to every  other American.  Of course, the Federal Government  should not become  involved  in rela tively minor physical altercations and  vandalism  that may occur during a  labor dispute in the wake of charged  emotions or  flared  tempers. Where  such action is insignificant to the over all coercive effect of  the  legitimate  As  ",1986
355,381,6,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I yield myself such time as I may need.  Mr. President,  today was a major  moment in the history of the effort to  repeal the Hobbs Act. Just repealing  the Hobbs Act is probably not exactly  the right phraseology, but actually to  reverse the exemption which is provid ed in the Hobbs Act. It is a major day  because, in an effort to move forward  in connection with the bill, I myself  confess  that  I would have  thought  there would be more votes than there  were.  But I think that the fact that there  were only 44 votes in the affirmative  indicates that the Senate has a con cern both about the substance of the  bill as well as the manner in which it  was called up.  The manner in which it was called  up is shocking. I was on the floor the  other  day when  somebody  talked  about prerogatives of the leadership,  which I would always be prepared to  respect. But there are also preroga tives of the U.S. Senate. I also respect  those.   This bill was voted on in committee  and the committee failed to report it  out. Yet the sponsor of the bill put it  on  the  calendar  and  the majority  leader called it up.  That totally undercuts the commit tee system. I think when it does, it cer tainly creates problems for the body  and we all have to question the use of  that procedure.  As a matter of fact, I am told that  the chairman of the Judiciary Com mittee, who is unable to move forward  in connection with another bill, is fol lowing a similar procedure in order to  try to get that measure to the calen dar.  Why should the Senate spend time  on a bill that has already been defeat ed in committee? Would anybody sug gest that this is a matter of national  importance compared to other issues  we need to debate such as the budget,  tax reform? Those are the issues that  ought to be on the floor of the U.S.  Senate, not the Hobbs Act.  This is not the first example of ig noring the committee system during  this Congress. One of the worst bills  this  Senate  has  acted  upon,  the  McClure-Volkmer  bill  gutting  our  country's gun control laws, was put on  the calendar without going  through  committee.  The  budget  resolution,  If a  which went  through  the committee,  and which, under the law, was to be on  the calendar and disposed of as of yes terday, has not as yet been put on the  calendar. We proceed backward. We  travel in reverse.  What about the bill itself? This bill  will not do anything about stopping vi olence. This is  just a  fun-and-games  bill for some to try to force through  and claim that they are prepared to  provide some protection against vio lence.  First of all, I have been in tune with  what has been happening  in  labor  matters over the course of many years.  Certainly, there have been times when  there have been confrontations on the  picket  lines,  as  happened  in  the  Hormel strike. But  this bill  is not  going  to stop violence  if it were  to  pass. It will not do anything about  strengthening law enforcement. This  bill is packaging. It is packaging only.  It sounds good, but it does nothing.  The kind of conduct the proponents  of this bill say they want to stop is al ready  illegal under State  law.  worker in a picket line shoots out a  window during a strike, that is a crime  under State  law. Since when do we  need the Federal Government to pros ecute shooting out windows?  If there is a fistfight that breaks out  during a strike, that may or may not  be a crime under State law. But if it is  a crime at all, then it is a crime under  State law. If there is any type of vio lence during a strike that rises to the  level of criminal conduct, the local law  enforcement officials can already pros ecute, under the law.  The supporters of this bill are quick  to support States rights, and that is a  subject I would like ~o talk about for a  moment.  Every single one of those who voted  to invoke cloture and who are support ers of  this bill-every single one of  them-is in that crowd in the Senate  that bleats as loudly and as clearly as  they  possibly  can,  claiming States  rights,  ""the  Federal  Government  ought to get out of the State's busi ness.""  But when it comes to the State, this  bill,  the Hobbs Act,  then  they say,  ""No, no, we need the Federal Govern ment to get in. We ought to make it a  Federal crime to have violence on the  picket line."" They want to turn things  back over to State and local govern ments.  I think that somewhat indicates the  absurdity and  ridiculousness of  this  position taken by those who are pro moting this bill.  They believe that the State ought to  have more responsibility in all other  areas, so why not with respect to vio lence on the picket line? But here they  want to throw the book at them under  Federal law.  The fact is that the dispute over the  Hobbs Act application  to  labor violence is a tempest in a teapot. There is  no general exemption for labor unions  under the Federal extortion criminal  statute. Labor unions can be prosecuted just like anyone else.  The whole debate about the Hobbs  Act arises because  the statute only  covers attempts to obtain property to  which  the defendant has no  lawful  claim. The Supreme Court held 13  years ago in the Enmons decision that  the Government could not expand the  meaning of the statute to cover cases  where  the defendant had  a  lawful  claim to the property.  The Court said:  The Government's broad concept of extor tion-the ""wrongful"" use of force to obtain  even  the  legitimate  union  demands  of  higher wages-is not easily  restricted.  It  would cover all overtly coercive economic  conduct in the course of an economic strike,  obstructing,  delaying  or  affecting  com merce. The worker who threw a punch on a  picket line, or the striker who deflated the  tires of his employer's truck would be sub ject to a Hobbs Act prosecution and the pos sibility of 20 years' imprisonment and a  $10,000 fine.  In other words, the Hobbs Act could  not be used to bootstrap the jurisdic tion of the Federal criminal law to or dinary assault or vandalism  just be cause it took place in the context of a  strike and the strike affected  inter state commerce.  Yet we have the proponents of this  bill anxious to expand the long arm of  the Federal law.  The bill says it is not intended to  chill legitimate labor activity and that  Federal prosecution is not authorized  for minor  bodily  injury  or minor  damage to property. But-and it is a  big but-there  is a qualification.  It  does not cover minor injury or damage  only  if it  is not  intended  to obtain  property. But the Hobbs Act itself re quires an intent to obtain property. So  this exemption means nothing. If an  act of violence  is not  intended  to  obtain  property  it  is  not  covered  anyway.  And  that  language  raises another  problem. What  are  ""minor  bodily  injury"" and ""minor damage to proper ty""? These are vague terms to set a  standard for a criminal violation. And  if it turns out that the court decides  someone has violated the law, he or  she is subject to a $10,000 fine and im prisonment up to 20 years.  Much is made of the fact that this  bill is going to stop labor unions from  using  violence  to  force  payoffs  of  ghost employees or to obtain bribes.  The truth is that the Hobbs Act al ready prohibits that kind of activity  under Federal law.  Here  is what  the Supreme Court  said in the Enmons opinion:  . . . the Hobbs Act has properly been held  to  reach  instances where union officials  threatened force or violence against an em ployer in order to obtain personal payoffs,  and where  unions  used  the  proscribed  ",1986

I  think with  this amendment we  have taken a step forward, to partially  correct the inadequacies that some of  the public utilities and small privately  owned utilities find themselves in on  dealing with the opportunity for ap plying for wheeling orders.  That was my goal and without the  cooperation of the two distinguished  Senators it would have been very diffi cult, probably impossible, to obtain.  I appreciate the cooperation of the  distinguished Senator from Kentucky  in examining the amendment and par ticipating in its drafting.  I hope the amendment can be ac cepted.  ",1986
401,446,6,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, I wish to  ask the distinguished chairman of the  Energy Committee and manager of  the bill a question or two. Will the  Senator yield?  Mr. McCLURE. I am happy to yield.  ",1986
402,446,6,Mr. FORD.," It is my understanding  that this amendment deals only-and I  repeat, only-with the ability of a util ity to file an application for wheeling  prior  to  the  termination of a  rate  schedule. It does not authorize any  wheeling order  to be  issued and go  into  effect  in  violation  of  section  211<c><2><B>.  It does not provide  a  basis for termination of a rate sched ule.  The only thing this does is clarify  that an applicant does not have  to  wait until a rate schedule actually ter minates before filing.  Mr. McCLURE. Will  yield?  ",1986
403,446,6,Mr. FORD., Yes.  Mr. McCLURE. The Senator is per fectly and absolutely correct. This is  only a procedural clarification that an  application can be filed prior to a rate  schedule  terminating. No wheeling  order could go  into effect until the  rate schedule on file is terminated pur suant  to  its  terms and by order of  FERC. This is not an opportunity to  abrogate contracts and rate schedules.  ,1986
404,446,6,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, I would  like  to  ask  the distinguished  floor  manager an additional question. May I  inquire as  to whether  this provides  any modification or change  to  the  standards under section 206 or 205?  Mr. McCLURE. Will  the Senator  yield?  ",1986
405,446,6,Mr. FORD., Yes.  Mr. McCLURE. Absolutely not. The  same  standards  and  criteria which  apply now would continue to apply.  the Senator  ,1986
406,446,6,Mr.  FORD.,"  I  thank  the  distin guished Senator  for  answering my  questions and entering into the collo quy. I have been able to learn how to  count tonight.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr.  President,  I  want to underscore what was just said.  The standards, the criteria, the proce dure by which a termination is sought  or a modification of a rate schedule  under section 205 or 206 are changed  in absolutely no way, with the single  exception of it being in order to file  application  for wheeling before  the  termination or modification of a rate  schedule. It does not affect the sub stance, it affects the time.  Second, it should also be clarified ab solutely in the RECORD at this point  that this amendment does not change  the standards, the process, the crite ria,  by which  a wheeling order  is  judged or processed. Those are abso lutely unaffected  and would go  in  every respect as existing law, with the  single exception that a wheeling order  could be  applied  for while  a  rate  schedule was in effect and prior to the  termination or modification of  that  rate schedule. But there is no interre lationship between the wheeling and  the modification or termination which  are separate issues under separate pro visions of the law.  I am happy to yield to the Senator  from Louisiana.  ",1986
407,446,6,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, let  me say I agree  totally with my col league, the distinguished chairman of  the Senate Energy Committee. He is  right that this makes no substantive  change. The  rules of  the  road,  in  effect, are not changed at all. Indeed, I  wonder,  there must be some hidden  significance of  this amendment, be cause it seems as though it is much  ado about nothing for this many hours  of working with the Senate. Neverthe less, we will not object to it largely be cause we think it has very little effect.  It simply allows you to make the appli cation a little earlier than you other wise could and that is,  I believe, all  that it does. The wheeling order, if it  were granted, could not  take effect  until after the termination took effect  or until the modification was ordered.  So, Mr. President, we will not object to  the amendment.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I cer tainly agree with the statement of the  Senator from Louisiana with respect  to the effect of this amendment. And I  also want to add further that a utility  can request a wheeling order which is  contingent upon obtaining a modifica tion of a rate schedule. The fact that  the modification  is  requested  and  granted, however, only would permit a  wheeling order  for  the amount of  power which was  freed up by  the  modification.  In  effect,  section  211<c>2<b> would no  longer apply  to  that increment, although it would con",1986
408,459,6,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, this week the  Pelham Parkway Citizens Council celebrates  an  important milestone-its 25th anniversary  as the umbrella organization for 16 organiza tions representing the diverse neighborhoods  that comprise the Pelham Parkway area of the  Bronx.  Since it was formed a quarter century ago,  the Pelham Parkway Citizens Council and the  fine fraternal, civic, religious, political, educa tional, and professional organizations it repre sents have been a major catalyst in stabilizing  the Pelham Parkway area and making  it a  great place to live.  As  the  Congressman  who  represents  Pelham Parkway, I am proud of the determina tion, perseverance, and community spirit of  those citizens who serve on the council and  work  to  provide  the  80,000  residents  of  Pelham Parkway with improved physical, cul tural, educational, and  recreational  facilities  and activities.  Many talented and creative people serve or  have served on the Pelham Parkway Citizens  Council. One of  those citizens  is Mr. Henry  Yuspeh, who has been a catalyst for commu nity  improvement  through  his  position  as  president of  the council. Through patience  and hard work, Mr. Yuspeh and his colleagues  on  the council have overcome bureaucratic  redtape  time after  time  to  rack up a  long  string of success stories that have contributed  greatly  to  the quality of  life  in  the Pelham  Parkway community.  Soon after it was formed, the council joined  forces with Public School No. 1 05 to push for  a new centrally  located  library for the area.  That building now stands as a symbol of what  organized community action can accomplish.  The council currently  is  fighting  to  force  major changes in the conditions at the Bronx  Psychiatric Center. So  far,  the council has  succeeded in seeing a new director appointed  and improvements in the center's facilities.  In other areas, the council: serves as a liai son between  the community and  the police  force;  is a driving force behind cultural offer ings in the area; and has been responsible for  numerous neighborhood cleanup and graffiti  removal campaigns. On a far-reaching  level,  the council is the catalyst behind a letter writ ing campaign to insure that our Nation's pris oners of war and those missing in action are  accounted for and not forgotten.  The Pelham Parkway Citizens Council  is a  wonderful example of civic responsibility that  should serve as a model for other grassroots  community  organizations  throughout  our  Nation.  I congratulate the Pelham Parkway Citizens  Council for their 25 years of outstanding serv ice to their community and I know I speak for  INTRODUCTION OF THE  INTERNATIONAL DEBT, TRADE, AND  FINANCIAL  STABILIZATION  ACT  HON. STAN LUNDINE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April16, 1986  ",1986
409,459,6,Mr. LUNDINE.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday I in troduced on behalf of  the majority of  the  members of the International Development In stitutions Subcommittee, which I chair, legisla tion to address the serious problem of devel oping  country  debt.  This  legislation  has  evolved after detailed oversight and legislative  hearings C!'l  the  ideas contained  in  the bill.  Our proposal  is aimed at strengthening and  expanding  the  Baker  initiative  on  debt  launched last October in Seoul, South Korea.  We have taken timely action on this matter so  that it can become part of the Speaker's trade  bill scheduled  to go  to  the House  floor the  week of May 12.  The effect of  the debt crisis on  the U.S.  trade deficit is clear. Since the onset of the  debt crisis  in 1982,  in order  to earn badly  needed foreign exchange to pay their interna tional debt, debt ridden developing countries  have closed  their economies to imports and  concentrated on boosting their exports. Over  one-third of the 1985 U.S.  trade deficit was  with developing countries. The United States  has experienced a 32 percent decline in ex ports and a 13 percent  increase  in  imports  since 1981 with  the key 15 debtor countries  recently identified in the Baker debt initiative.  The  trade deficit with  these same countries  has grown from $3.3 billion in 1981  to $21.3  billion  in 1985. The Overseas Development  Council has estimated  that 1.4 million U.S.  jobs have been lost due to the trade ramifica tions of the debt crisis.  The United States also has other reasons  to seek a solution  to  the debt crisis. Our  banks are dangerously overexposed to devel oping countries who will continue to have seri ous difficulties paying their debts unless they  can secure some breathing  room  from  their  debt burdens. Effectively addressing the debt  crisis  is  critically  important  to  preserving  United States foreign policy and security inter ests around  the world, particularly  in Latin  America where infant democracies are strug gling to maintain the support of their people.  The bill proposes steps to increase the ef fectiveness of the World Bank and other multi lateral development institutions. It is our belief  that the World Bank must play the key catalyt ic role in bringing about a satisfactory resolu tion to the debt crisis. The World Bank must  help increase the flow of capital into develop ing countries. To help achieve  this we urge  the World Bank to propose that a temporary  adjustment be made in its disbursement prac tices to forward World Bank capital to devel oping countries in an accelerated, but still re sponsibly monitored,  fashion.  In addition, we  call  for steps  to help developing countries  ",1986
410,472,6,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, on April 19, 1986,  the Snyder County Extension Service will pay  tribute to a man who has served as director of  the service for the past 18 years. Harold A.  Holt began his career with the extension serv ice in May 1959 as a county agent for Hun tingdon County.  In October  1968 Harold  became the director of the Snyder County Ex tension Service where he specialized in dairy  production. He served the dairymen of Snyder  and Union Counties as the DHIA adviser, ad viser  to  the Holstein Association, adviser to  the 4-H Clubs in Snyder and Union Counties  and conducted numerous classes and short  courses for dairymen.  Mr. Holt was honored in 1982 by the Na tional Association of County Agents with the  Outstanding Service Award for his work in the  service. Harold Holt has been a vital member  of  the extension service  for more  than 18  years and will be missed greatly by all those  associated with the service. I would like to join  with all those involved in the extension service  in  thanking Mr. Holt  for his dedication and  service  to  the people of Snyder and Union  Counties and wishing him good health and  happiness in his retirement.  NATIONAL FOOD BANK WEEK  HON. TONY P. HALL  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April16, 1986  ",1986
411,472,6,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased  that  the House of Representatives  passed House Joint Resolution 234, a resolution I introduced designating the week of May  18 as National Food Bank Week.  This resolution, which commemorates food  banks across  the country,  could not have  been possible without the help of my distin guished colleagues on the House Post Office  and Civil Service Committee: Chairman BILL  FORD and Chairman ROBERT GARCIA as well  as  the  distinguished Representatives,  the  Honorable GENE TAYLOR and  the Honorable  JAMES HANSEN. I would also like to point out  that my office  received countless hours of  support and hard work from Mr. Scott Broock,  during his service as a Washington Work shops student intern. Scott did an outstanding  job in helping us sign up over 220 cosponsors  of House Joint Resolution 234.  Mr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution 234  designates May 18 to 24, 1986 as ""National  Food Bank Week."" These dates coincide with  the National Conference to be held by Second  Harvest, Inc., the largest food bank network in  the country.  Food banks play an  increasingly important  role  in our communities across  the country.  Food banks collect surplus  food  that would  otherwise be wasted and distribute it to soup  kitchens, day care centers, homes for the el derly, halfway houses, church-operated  food  programs, and needy  individuals. These are  nonprofit organizations who obtain their food  primarily from private-sector sources.  In recent years, we have witnessed an ap palling increase in poverty and hunger in this  country. Over 35.5 million people are poor,  and estimates are that over 20 million people  in our country periodically go hungry.  Food banks work with private-sector com panies,  including our food and  transportation  industries,  to respond  to that need.  In 1985,  the Second Harvest network worked with over  250  private-sector  companies  to  distribute  over 1 00 million pounds of food products. This  is an excellent example of private sector re sponse to a serious need.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe that these nonprofit  food banks deserve to be commended. They  work quietly in communities across the coun try  to eradicate hunger and poverty.  I am  pleased that my colleagues in  the House of  Representatives joined me in passing National  Food Bank Week.  THE LOSS OF CAPT. FERNANDO  A.

A CONGRESSIONAL SALUTE TO  THE 15TH STREET ELEMENTA RY SCHOOL  HON. GLENN M. ANDERSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April16, 1986  ",1986
412,472,6,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay tribute to the 15th Street Elementary  School in San Pedro, CA, which will be cele brating its 85th year of continuous service to  the community at a  luncheon on April 25,  1986. Coincidentally, the observance also falls  during the Public School Month celebrations.  Built at a cost of just $25,000 on the origi nal site of the San Pedro High School,  the  15th Street Public School has achieved a  number of  tremendous successes  in  its 85  years. The San Pedro community is indebted  to  this great school  for the  fine work  it has  done  in educating  its children. The school,  which is the second largest of the 13 elemen tary schools in San Pedro, however, has done  more than merely educate our young people.  The 15th Street Elementary School has  the  oldest existing parents-teachers association in  California, which is the second oldest such or ganization  in  the entire country. Additionally,  the  school,  through  its  various  programs,  brings about $500,000  in State and Federal  funds into the community.  My wife, Lee,  joins me  in  recognizing  the  achievements of the 15th Street Elementary  School on its 85th anniversary, and in recog nizing the many contributions that its students,  staff and graduates have made to San Pedro  and other southern California communities.  I  would also like to take a moment to recognize  the staff and  faculty of the 15th Street Ele mentary School on  the  fine work  they are  doing under the  leadership of their principal,  Stanley Bunyan.

415,485,6,Mr. ROWLAND of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, my colleague from Missouri  [Mr. SKELTON] and I have introduced a  resolution today putting Congress on  record as giving its highest praise and  thanks  to Great Britain and Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher for aiding  the United States against Libyan ter rorism.  When  the  time came  to confront  ruthless terrorists, Britain stood with  us. No other ally wears that badge of  courage.  Mrs. Thatcher took enormous per sonal political risks  to do what was  right. By taking a stand in support of  free people everywhere, Mrs. Thatcher  risked criticism  from political oppo nents. She chose a courageous moral  path rather than political expediency.  Her actions will fortify and inspire us  to continue our fight against terror Ism.  The United States and the United  Kingdom have long been allied in the  great World Wars against tyranny and  are joined in the North Atlantic alli ance to deter aggression.  A loyal ally understands that coun tries have interests beyond their own  borders, and our British friends recog nize  this. And  for  that,  they have  America's enduring gratitude.  Mr. Speaker,  I  urge  all my  col leagues to join us in cosponsoring this  very important resolution.  AMERICA NEEDS A SENSIBLE  OIL IMPORT POLICY  <Mr. TAUZIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
416,485,6,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Speaker, following  the United States air strikes against  Libya, Colonel Qadhafi sent his minis ter to the OPEC meeting in Geneva  demanding an oil embargo against the  United States of America.  It is, of course, history now that the  Geneva meeting denied and, in fact, ig nored that request We should not be  surprised by that.  The fact is that the United States is  only about 10-percent dependent upon  OPEC oil today. We should, however,  be reminded that in the late 1970's,  when we were approximately 30-per cent dependent upon OPEC oil, a simi lar request for a U.S. oil embargo was  not only heeded, but adopted, with  awful effects on this economy.  Now my  father when  I was very  young gave me a good piece of advice.  He assured me that through my life I  would make a number of mistakes, but  he cautioned me not to make the same  mistake more than once. We in Amer ica ought to consider my father's good  advice as we approach the end of this  decade. Should we allow ourselves to  become so dependent upon OPEC oil  that the next request by the minister  from Libya for an oil embargo against  the United States would not only go  unignored, but in fact heeded, and the  United States might find itself in that  same awful position  It is time now, America, to wake up,  to guard against that type of depend ence on foreign oil. It is time now to  adopt a sensible oil import policy for  America.  0 1200  ELDERLY VETERANS CARE ACT  OF 1986  <Mr. RIDGE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
417,485,6,Mr. RIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, ensuring  adequate health care for our elderly  veterans is fast becoming one of the  most  critical  issues of  the decade.  With the average age of the veteran  population steadily rising, steps must  be  taken now  to prepare  the VA  health care delivery system for the in creasing demand for services. Conse quently, I am introducing the Elderly  Veterans Care Act of 1986.  This legislation provides a tax credit  to the families of elderly veterans who  need  home-based health  care. The  credit covers such expenses as home  health aids, adult day care,  respite  care, nursing  care,  and medical or  health-related  equipment  and  sup plies.  Credit amounts will be determined  by a  sliding scale based on annual  income, similar to the dependent care  tax adopted by Congress in the Eco nomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Fam ilies with $10,000 or less in income will  receive a credit for 30 percent of the  home health care expenses they incur,  up  to a maximum credit of $1,050.  Low-income families who do not pay  enough taxes will have any unusable  credit refunded directly to them. The  maximum amount of credit would be  gradually  reduced based on  income  over  $10,000, with  families  having  $50,000  or more  in  adjusted  gross  income  ineligible  for  credit. Conse quently,  the most needy families re ceive the greatest relief.  This legislation is important because  it represents a practical solution to the  VA health care problem without for saking our longstanding commitment  to  the men and women who have  served this country. This measure pro motes a compassionate alternative to  institutionalized medical  services by  providing for care in the most natural  environment-the veteran's own home.  Moreover, by granting the tax credit  directly  to  the family,  the proposal  recognizes  the  temendous  sacrifices  they make as the primary caregiver to  elderly veterans. It also recognizes the  need for Congress to relieve the con tinuing  financial  pressure  on  the  health care delivery system of Medi care and Medicaid.  The Veterans' Administration pre dicts that there will be more than 7  million veterans over the age of 65 by  1990. The VA itself has recommended  the creative development of program  initiatives  to help meet  the health care needs of our maturing veteran  population. My bill meets  this chal lenge by providing more flexible care  for veterans, while making more hos pital beds available for critically ill pa tients.  Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to  intro duce this important legislation, and I  invite my colleagues to join in support  of the Elderly Veterans Care Act.

421,498,6,Mr. ARMEY.,"  I  thank  the gentle woman for yielding. I appreciate her  courtesy and her consideration and  leadership on the committee.  Mr. Chairman, we have a very com plex piece of legislation here, and it is  particularly important because it deals  with what many of us consider to be  fundamental human rights.  We cherish in our country the right  to  freedom  of  association.  It  is  a  rather interesting freedom to be cher ished by Americans because a charac teristic of  the American spirit  is a  fierce sense of independence and au tonomy. Yet even within the context  of  that  fiercest  realization  that we  have been given the right to be our  own person by our Lord and Maker,  and that right is honored by our Con stitution and we cherish  that right  and will not give it up, we also recog nize there are times when associations  are important to us.  In labor law this right was honored.  I quote from the National Labor Rela tions Act:  Employees shall have the right to self-or ganization, to form, join or assist labor orga nizations,  to bargain collectively  through  representatives of their choosing.  Further quoting:  They shall also have the right to refrain  from any and all such activities.  We have to understand that there  are people who would prefer either  side of that coin in this country. In  recent years, we have seen that that  sense of fierce independence and self autonomy has reflected itself in the  choice made by worker after worker in  this country, to say, ""I choose not to  associate, I choose to go it alone, based  on my own merits, my own skills, my  own abilities, and my own powers to  negotiate for myself.""  I  think this body needs to respect  that right to that choice and to do  honor by not passing legislation that  even would prevent the risk of having  that right denied through the imposi tion of compulsory unionism.  Indeed, Samuel Gompers,  a man  whom I believe to have been one of  the most  important  leaders of  the  early  labor movement  in America,  made the point well when he said, ""A  ",1986

426,511,6,Mr. JEFFORDS., I thank the Chair  for that clarification.  ,1986

428,511,6,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Chairman, I yield to  the gentleman  from Alabama  [Mr.  SHELBY].  ",1986
429,511,6,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. Chairman, I join  with the chairman of the subcommit tee, the gentleman from Missouri, in  asking the Members  to support  this  amendment  that he  is offering on  behalf of himself and me.  Mr. Chairman, the amendment ad dresses a concern that enactment of  H.R. 281 might be unfair to contrac tors with construction projects already  underway. The  amendment  assures  that contractors  involved  in ongoing  projects have a year before  the act  takes effect.  H.R. 281 is basically a sound bill be cause it would put an end to the unfair  practice of double-breasting that has  plagued  the  construction  industry.  There  is no  reason  that consenting  parties to a contract should be allowed  to wiggle out of their agreements. Nev ertheless double-breasting has  flour ished  and  construction workers no  longer have the assurance that con tractors have  to  live by their agree ments. It seems to me unfair that all  other employers, once they sign a col lective-bargaining agreement, are  re quired by law to live up to it, while in  the construction industry contractors  can take advantage of a huge loophole  in the law that lets them walk away  from signed contracts to which they  voluntarily agreed. When people vol untarily promise in writing to do some thing,  the  law  shouldn't  let  them  ignore the promise. H.R. 281  simply  closes  the  loophole  that  has  let  double-breasting spread.  There has been a  concern  raised  that the bill would unfairly catch un suspecting  contractors  that  are  al ready at work on a project.  I have  sympathy with this concern and that  is why I offer my amendment. The  amendment gives everyone fair notice  before the bill takes affect. If enacted  H.R. 281 would apply to all projects  not yet in progress. The effective date  would be delayed however to accom modate  already existing contractual  obligations.  If the construction has  started and the contractors had relied  on interpretations of the law in effect  when the project began, it is only fair  to allow sufficient time to adjust to  the change in the law. One year from  date  of  enactment  gives  everyone  ample time to adjust.  I believe my amendment improves a  good bill.  ",1986
430,511,6,Mr. CLAY.," I  thank the gentleman  and I support the amendment. I think  his point is well made in that it is not  my intention to entrap those who may  be unable to make such adjustments  as may be required by this bill.  The amendment is well crafted, and  I  think  it  protects  the  legitimate  rights of workers as well as contrac tors, and certainly does not conflict  with  the  intent  of  the  legislation  under consideration.  Therefore,  I urge adoption of the  amendment.  0 1435  I  ",1986

432,511,6,Mr. CLAY., I yield to the gentleman.  ,1986
433,511,6,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I would say that I  have reviewed the amendment and I  would say at least personally, I have  no objection to it, as I think it is an  improvement in the bill; although it  certainly has not removed my objec tions to the bill.  ",1986
434,511,6,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman,  rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the amendment, and I have comment ed to my good friend, the chairman of  the  subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from Missouri, that he does appear to  be making some progress which we  were not able to make in committee, of  cleaning up the bill, at least in piece meal. I would comment that he has  chosen, I think, some of the least of fensive parts about the bill so far, but  I  do  commend  him  for  making  progress.  I  would  comment  that  similar  amendments and attempts  to  reach  agreements on what should be in the  bill were not able to be made in com mittee, and I regret that, and I know  that the ranking member of the full  committee and the ranking member of  the subcommittee had  tried at that  time, and have tried diligently since to  obtain some adjustment in the bill to  cause him to be much more of a com monsense bill.  The bill, however,  even with  this  rather marginal  amendment which  talks about date of enactment, still  does not make  any  sense,  because  what is essentially wrong with the leg islation is that it is unfair legislation  both to union employees and to non union employees.  Let me go in for a minute as to why  it is unfair to union employees. Be cause if we pass legislation as radical  as this is, if we pass legislation such as  this which in effect requires every con tractor in America to choose between  having a union shop subsidiary or an  open  shop  subsidiary,  then over  a  period of time the marketplace may  well cause those contractors to close  down their union shops. I think that  would be a regrettable result of this  legislation.  I  think  it would be an  inevitable  result of this legislation because the  contractors will  follow  the market place. I  think there is a clear and a  good market today for union construc tion, and I think that if we pass this  ",1986
435,524,6,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word, and I rise  in strong support of H.R. 281.  ",1986
436,524,6,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, the purpose  of labor laws of this Nation is to ensure that  the safety and fair treatment of each Ameri can worker are priorities of every employer.  These laws did not arise arbitrarily, but were,  rather,  the result of decades of exposure of  workers  to hazardous workplace conditions,  oppressive working hours and scant wages.  Many  in my northeastern Minnesota con gressional district can still remember the tales  told by iron ore miners who placed their lives  in jeopardy each day they entered the mines  during the earlier decades of this century. Our  region of the country faced the growing pains  shared  by every expanding  region  of  the  country; we recognized  the need  to develop  our manufacturing and mining  industries as  quickly as possible, but  in doing so,  issues  such as safety, compensation, and workcodes  were given minimal consideration.  But, as  this Nation became more devel oped, we learned to give higher priority to the  rights of our workers, that fair treatment of the  workforce is also good business.  It was a proud  time  in  this Nation, and a  good  indication of our priorities, when  the  Congress adopted measures  to regulate  the  treatment and compensation of  labor. The  Davis-Bacon Act,  the Fair Labor Standards  Act, and  the National Labor Standards Act  have  become measuring  sticks  by which  progress is judged, and constant reminders of  how far we have come.  But when these laws were adopted, certain  segments of  the workforce and of  industry  were overlooked, which now deserve atten tion. I refer specifically to the construction in dustry.  The very nature of the construction industry  makes its workers different from other types  of labor. Construction workers generally move  from  job to job, and may not remain  in one  position  long enough  to  fulfill a contractual  agreement with any single employer. That,  however, does not minimize  the need  for  these  individuals  to be protected and given  the same rights as other workers.  But that is not happening, and that is why it  is so  important that we pass H.R. 281,  the  Construction Industry Labor Law Amendments  of 1986, to end the practice of double breast ing, by which contractors can avoid union re quirements in their labor contracts.  Under current  law, a contractor who has  signed a collective-bargaining agreement can  establish a second, nonunion operation  to  perform work usually performed by the union  operation. This has been occurring because  the law has been interpreted to allow employ ers to escape contractual obligations to their  workforce.  Employers are also able to circumvent the  intent of prehire agreements, which contrac tors sign, promising to adhere to union con tract guidelines  in exchange  for access  to  skilled workers. But, employers can walk away  from  these contracts unless  the union can  prove to have a majority at all worksites, re gardless of the duration of the project.  This practice clearly undermines the integri ty of the labor movement, while simultaneous ly denying nonunion workers  the  rights of  union workers.  H.R. 281 addresses each of these issues in  an appropriate manner. Employers would be  required to apply the terms of collective-bar gaining agreements to all employees perform ing the work described in the contract within  the geographic area described in the contract.  The bill also prohibits double breasting, a  practice which  is an embarrassment  to a  nation which prides itself on fairness.  H.R. 281 embodies rights which should be  integral  to  the construction  industry  in  this  Nation. It is an extension and a clarification of  existing  labor law, and deserves the support  of this House.  ",1986

This  legislation  is es sential  in assuring the stability of labor rela tions  for  the  thousands of Americans who  work in the construction trades.  In 1935, Congress passed the landmark leg islation, known as the Wagner Act or National  Labor Relations Act. This law is the ""Magna  Carta"" for working Americans which promises  collective bargaining  to assure workers  fair  wages, safe working conditions, and job op portunities.

439,537,6,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, on Feb ruary 26, as you may recall, the House  voted in favor of two resolutions citing  Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, the di rectors and managers of the New York  Land Co. in New York, for contempt  of Congress as a result of their refusal  to cooperate with the Subcommittee  on Asian and Pacific Affairs, which  was then in the process of conducting  an  investigation  into  the  hidden  wealth  of  Ferdinand  and  Imelda  Marcos, of the Philippines, here in the  United States. Those resolutions were  adopted, in the case of Ralph Bern stein, by a margin of 352 to 34 and, in  the case of Joseph Bernstein, by a  margin of 343 to 50.  The -Bernstein brothers had refused  to answer a whole series of questions  put to them by myself and other mem bers  of  the  subcommittee  on  the  grounds that it would require them to  violate the attorney-client privilege if  they were to divulge the information  we were seeking.  It was  the opinion of  the House  counsel and the minority counsel of  the House, whose judgment we solicit ed,  that  in  fact  the attorney-client  privilege was not being properly  in voked.  For that reason, the subcommittee  voted to cite the Bernstein brothers  for contempt. The full Foreign Affairs  Committee then voted overwhelmingly  to cite them for contempt and, as I  just indicated, the full House voted to  cite them for contempt as well.  A few months later, after the resto ration of democracy in the Philippines  and the flight of Mr. Marcos and his  wife, Imelda, from Manila to Honolu lu, documents were discovered at Ma lacanang Palace clearly linking Joseph  Bernstein,  at  least,  to  President  Marcos and some of the real estate  owned by the Marcoses in New York,  which our subcommittee was investi gating.

443,550,6,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  today, along with 30 Democratic and  Republican cosponsors, I am introduc ing a  joint resolution  requiring  the  President to report to Congress on his  response  to the recommendations of  his Commission on  Industrial Com petitiveness, sometimes known as the  Young Commission.  We offer  this vital  resolution be cause the Young Commission did some  vital work for this Nation of ours, the  importance of which has been basical ly unrecognized by both the President  and Congress. And we offer this reso lution to help provide a catalyst for a  serious national debate on the com petitiveness of our economy, which is  fundamental to our country's future  economic prosperity.  President Reagan  appointed  the  Young Commission in June 1983, call ing attention  to  the new  reality of  global competition faced by American  industry at home  and  abroad. He  called for recommendations on ways to  improve the Nation's ability to com pete, and he selected a commission of  30 distinguished Americans from business,labor,government,academia,and  the public. He selected John Young,  chairman of Hewlett-Packard, one of  our premier industrialists, to chair the  Commission.  The Young Commission studied the  global economy for 15 months andre ported unanimously in January 1985,  just over a year ago. The Commission  has given us an unflinching picture of  where we are and where we must go.  Their report can be a focal point for a  national debate and the foundation on  which to build a new consensus for  needed policies. The report is persua sive because it is the work of a blue ribbon commission, representing a di versity of interests, with no partisan  ax to grind. And it is persuasive be cause  it  irrefutably summarizes and  reaffirms the evidence with which we  are becoming so familiar:  The American economy has become  fully  integrated in a world economy.  Fully 70  percent of  the goods we  produce  compete with merchandise  from abroad. We, however, have not  adjusted to the new world economy as  effectively as some of our competitors,  most notably Japan and the other Pa cific Rim nations.  Our problems are not confined  to  one region, or to only our basic indus tries. Our productivity  growth has  been outstripped by virtually all our  competitors  across  the  full  board.  Fully half the jobs in the U.S. steel in dustry have disappeared since 1979.  People know that. But we also have  lost market share in all the high tech nology or ""sunrise""  industries. Our  electronics  trade deficit with Japan  approached the magnitude of our defi cit in autos; we fell into deficit in tele communications where we have always  been the world's pacesetter.  While macroeconomic problems, no tably an overvalued dollar, bear some  of the blame for America's competitive  problems,  they don't explain every thing. The dollar was lower valued in  the 1970's, but our  trade deficit  in creased.  The  value  of  the  dollar  cannot be blamed for our slow produc tivity growth, stagnant wages, or high  capital costs.  Nor can the deterioration in Ameri can manufacturing be comfortably dis missed by the claim that we are be coming  a  service  economy. Services  and manufacturing are often inextri cably linked. If the United States loses  competitiveness  in  manufactured  goods,  it risks losing position in sup porting services. If other companies,  notably Japanese, dominate complex  manufacturing,  it is naive  to believe  that they will  rely on our financial  services, lawyers, or advertising agen cies.  We have neglected  investments  in  areas  fundamental  to our economic  future: The education and  training  crucial  for  a  skilled and adaptable  work force, and the requisite level of  science and technology needed to keep  us at the cutting edge of competition.  In  short,  the Young Commission  concluded:  Our  ability  to  compete  internationally  faces unprecedented challenge from abroad.  Our world leadership is at stake, and so is  our ability  to provide for our people the  standard of  living  and  opportunities  to  which they aspire.  The Young Commission  then of fered a series of thoughtful proposals  for government and private action: To  better create, apply, and protect new  technology; increase the supply of pro ductive capital; develop a more skilled,  flexible, and motivated work force and  make trade a national priority.  In my view, meeting the challenge of  a competitive world is the central eco nomic issue of our time. The economic  dominance that produced the prosper ity of the 1950's and 1960's for our  country is gone, and it will not be re turning. We have to build our future  prosperity in a world where many tal ented nations compete effectively. The  old habits and old policies will not suf fice for our new situation.  President Reagan points with under standable pride to the long-running re covery coupled with low inflation. But  the fundamental measure of our eco nomic condition in a world economy is  our trade picture. Our trade deficit hit  $148 billion last year. We can't go on  like that. A nation that buys $3 billion  more from abroad each week than it  sells is draining its economic strength.  Some may argue that the recent run  of economic good news-particularly  the sharp decline in oil prices and the  dollar-have made  any  competitive ness problems our country might have  a thing of the past. They are wrong. I  certainly agree  that the drop  in oil  prices should have the effect of stimu lating economic growth, and that the  reduction of the value of the dollar is  welcome-indeed,  long  overdue-and  indispensable  for  our  industries  to  compete at home and abroad. Treas ury Secretary Baker deserves great  credit  for  reversing  the administra tion's policy of stunning indifference  to  the damage  that  the overvalued  dollar was doing to our industries, and  for taking the lead in international ef forts to bring the dollar down to earth.  Since the overvalued dollar has been  a major  factor  in driving American  manufacturers offshore, keeping  the  dollar at a  reasonable  level  should  help  keep American manufacturing  and  jobs here at home.  If interest  rates stay relatively low, it should pro vide an attractive incentive for invest ment in plant and equipment that will  make our industries more productive.  All of us hope that the good economic  news can help produce what the U.S.  News & World Report has euphorical ly described as ""the brave new econo my."" My State of West Virginia, still  ",1986

458,589,6,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  today I am offering an amendment to  S. 1236 to make several changes in the  sentencing provisions of the Compre hensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  I am pleased to be joined in offering  this legislation by several of my distin guished colleagues on  the Judiciary  Committee-Senator BIDEN  of Dela ware,  ranking minority member,  as  well  as Senators LAxALT, KENNEDY,  HATCH, GRASSLEY, SPECTER, and EAST.  This  amendment  would  make  changes with regard to the duties of  the U.S. Sentencing Commission and  the appellate review of sentences im posed by district courts.  First,  the Commission's authority  would be expanded to authorize it to  promulgate policy statements regard ing the imposition of fines in accord ance with the applicable provision of  Title 18 of the United States Code.  This change would be consistent with  the Commission's present authority to  issue policy statements with regard to  matters such as the application of sen tencing guidelines,  the sanctions of  forfeiture, and plea agreements. In ad dition, this change would enhance the  usefulness of the Commission's work  to the Federal judicial system.  Second,  the  amendment modifies  the requirement for sentencing guide lines that provides for ranges in the  term of imprisonment. Currently, the  maximum  of  the  range may  not  exceed the minimum of that range by  more than 25 percent. S. 1236, as re ported by  the  committee,  provides  that when the maximum of the range  is life imprisonment, the minimum of  that range would be 30 years. This  amendment  would  change  that  number  to 25 years and would also  provide that when the maximum term  of the range is 1 year or less, the maxi mum shall not exceed the minimum of  that range by more than 50 percent, or  60 days, whichever is greater. When  the maximum term of the range is 1  year or  less,  a  25-percent variance  would not allow the Commission suffi cient flexibility to develop meaningful  guidelines for relatively minor crimes.  In this instance, the difference in the  range would only amount to a small  number of days which could possibly  encourage defendants  to stand  trial  rather than plead guilty. This change  would enable the commission to draft  meaningful,  realistic guidelines with  regard to the lower end of the impris onment sentencing scale.  The amendment would also amend  certain provisions pertaining  to  the  appellate review of sentences. Current ly, an appellate court may overturn a  sentence if it determines that the sen tence was imposed as a  result of an  ""incorrect application"" of the sentenc ing guidelines. This amendment would  change the standard of review to re quire the court to determine that the  sentence was the result of a ""clearly  erroneous construction"" of  the sen tencing  guidelines.  This  modified  standard, unlike the current standard,  is well defined in current law, more fa miliar to potential appellate litigants,  and gives more appropriate weight to  the sentencing decisions of Federal  district court judges.  Finally,  this  amendment  would  modify the current law which permits  the appellate court to resentence a de fendant. The  responsibility  for  sen tencing and  resentencing has  tradi tionally been reserved for the district  court in that the presence of the de fendant gives the sentencing judge the  opportunity to observe the demeanor  and attitude of the defendant. As well,  the presence of the victim, prosecutor,  and defense attorney, and any other  relevant witnesses gives  the district  court insight into the sentencing proc ess that an appellate judge could not  realize from a record alone. This bill  would, therefore, require an appellate  court that finds in favor of the defend ant, to remand the case with appropri ate instruction to the district court for  further sentencing procedures.

459,602,6,Mr. DENTON.," Mr. President, I bring  to the attention of my colleagues an  article which appeared on March 5,  1986, in the Independent Advertiser in  Clanton, AL,  about Marion Wesley  Easterling.  The article, written by Advertiser  correspondent Madge Mullins Wil banks, chronicles  the  life of one of  Chilton County and Alabama's most  outstanding citizens.  As most of my  colleagues know,  gospel music has held a special place  in southern life for decades. The arti cle  titled,  ""Gospel Legend Lives  in  Clanton,"" pays tribute to one of Amer ica's most beloved gospel song writers.  The songs composed by Marion Eas terling have been recorded by Ameri ca's most famous gospel quartets and  have been published in countless song books since 1937 when he composed  his first gospel song, ""Lord, Lead Me  On.""  Marion Easterling's contributions to  America have contributed to our one  nation under God concept.  I ask unanimous consent to insert in  the RECORD  this beautifully written  salute to Marion Easterling.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Independent Advertiser  <Clanton, AL>. Mar. 5, 19861  GosPEL LEGEND LIVEs IN CLANTON  <By Madge Wilbanks)  On October 25, 1973, the Chilton County  Chamber  of Commerce  honored Marion  Wesley Easterling ""for his accomplishments  in the field of gospel music and prestige and  dignity brought to our county."" The wooden  plaque complete with gold mounting is  in  the home Marion W. Easterling shares with  his wife, ""Mi..c;s Agnes"", in Clanton. It is a  warm house filled with tributes momentoes  of years, pictures of children and the four  grandchildren  and  there  is  also  golden  records by the Thrasher Brothers singing  songs written by this gospel giant of a song  writer who has a part of the Chilton County  scene since being born on March 12, 1910,  on a  farm near the Sunshine Community  ""Out Refuge Road"" to General Francis and  Dora Johnson Easterling.  In thinking back over the years, it seems  Marion was simply born to gospel music. He  attended  the  public  schools  in Chilton  County and  then attended various music  schools  including the Vaughan School of  Music. He studied with a number of famed  and excellent private  teachers of gospel  music schools as Adgar M. Pace, O.L. De Vaughan, W.B. Abert  and  ""Dad Speer""  <G.T. Speer> of the famed Speer Family. He  also took correspondence courses from New  York and Chicago to further his own musi cal education. With Marion W. Easterling, it  was not hard work nor hard study, it was all  part of his lifelong goal. . . . to bring gospel  music through the media of radio to his be loved Chilton County and to his cherished  homefolks . . . and he had done just that in  a most exemplary fashion!  He has realized his goal to bring gospel  music programming via radio to the people  of his home county. He has realized his goal  and yet he continues to write and dream . . .  an ever-working mind of a composer whom  gospel music ranks right up there at the  top.  How does he write his songs? ""Well, I get  a melody or words . . . most often the words  first . . . and it may be as long as two years  before I write it down, have it copyrighted  and send it to the publishers."" He is repre sented by SESAC. Year and years ago he  told me that he often sold his songs <all  rights and everything!) for as little as $10. I  reminded him of that the other day and he  remembered. He sold two of his all time big  hits for $10 ""and I might not even get that""  ... songs like ""Standing By the River and  Rainbow of Love."" Somehow you know how ever, without him even saying it, that he  never has written a song with the hope of  making money. He has written songs simply  becaue he had the God-given talent to do  ",1986
460,628,6,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  to  join with Senator HEINZ,  Senator GLENN and several other of  my colleagues in being an original co sponsor of S. 2331, the Medicare Qual ity Protection Act of 1986. It is abso lutely essential, during this transition al period in the health care field, that  we work to maintain and improve the  quality of health care for all Ameri cans.  Over the past several years, we have  instituted major changes in the Medi care Program. Most of those changes  were motivated by our desire to con trol the rapidly spiraling cost of pro viding care for the 37 million Ameri cans eligible to receive benefits under  the Medicare  Program.  Medicare  spending has been cut every year over  the last 6, contributing more than $30  billion to deficit reduction. As part of  those reductions and modifications in  health care payments, reimbursement  for inpatient hospital services is now  made prospectively according to diag noses; a system of payments known as  DRG's. Hospitals  and other health  care providers have been forced to un dertake  cost containment measures,  and a significant amount of waste has  been  trimmed from  the health care  system. Length of hospital stays have  been reduced and admissions have not  increased. In addition to the Federal  Government saving billions of dollars,  the forced  increase in efficiency has  resulted in record profits for a majori ty of hospitals across the country.  However, Mr. President, this is only  part of the story. While the Federal  Government  and  many  hospitals  might be benefiting under our new  Medicare Program, it is unclear that  the experience of our Nation's elderly  and disabled persons has been as posi tive. The House Select Committee on  Aging has recently completed an anal ysis of  the dollars America's senior  citizens pay for health care and con cluded  that  they  are  significantly  worse off in terms of health care costs  than they were in the late seventies.  During the earlier period, health care  consumed about 12 percent of senior  citizens'  income.  In 1986,  this had  jumped to just over 16 percent or an  average of $1,850 per person. What's  worse is that this figure is anticipated  to climb to 18.5 percent of income by  1991, or $2,633 per person. This com pares  to only $712  in 1977, $966  in  1980, and $1,526 in 1984. In fact, it was  recently announced that the Medicare  hospital  deductible will  increase  a  whopping $80 in 1987, after jumping  $92 this year-the biggest increase in  the history of the program. What is  ironic is that these recent increases in  the hospital deductible are directly re lated to the reduction in the average  Medicare length of stay and per ad missions costs.  Unfortunately, the increase in costs  for seniors and disabled beneficiaries  has not resulted in an increase in qual ity of care. I am increasingly alarmed  by suggestions that hospitals and phy sicians may be sacrificing patient care  in an effort to contain costs under this  new system. It is appalling that we are  hearing  reports  of  such  unethical  practices as prematurely discharging  patients and reedmitting them later,  and failing to hospitalize patients with  complex medical  problems. Actions  like these, in an attempt to squeeze a  few extra dollars out of  the DRG  system are disgraceful and must be  stopped. I believeS. 2331 is an important step in our efforts to assure that  our Nation's strong tradition of pro viding quality health services to our  Medicare  beneficiaries will  not  be  jeopardized.  I hope all of my colleagues will join  with us in supporting S. 2331 and in  other efforts  to guarantee  that our  Nation's Medicare beneficiaries receive  the best possible care that  is avail able.e  ",1986
461,628,6,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I am pleased to join my distin guished colleague, Senator HEINZ, and  several  other Members  from  both  sides of the aisle  in introducing the  ""Medicare Quality Protection Act of  1986.""  Just as prospective payment  was a critical safeguard for the fiscal  integrity of  the Medicare Program,  the bill we are introducing today will  be an important step toward improv ing safeguards of the quality of care  that is delivered under that program.  The aspect of the bill that I am most  pleased with is that it mandates expli city that the Secretary of Health and  Human Services thoroughly assess the  effects of PPS on access and quality of  care for Medicare beneficiaries.  It's time to stop talking about ""anec dotal  evidence""  of  problems  under  PPS and get the data. The General  Accounting Office reported a  lack of  data on quality and access under PPS  that cannot be ""ignored. This bill sets  up the mechanisms we need to find  out what is really happening.  Every  new  payment  reform may  have side effects. Retrospective cost based reimbursement had inherent in centives  to provide more and more  services, perhaps even  to  the detri ment of patients. Prospective payment  has  the  opposite  incentive-it may  lead to underservice if not appropri ately administered.  In order to set up quality safeguards  which are tailored for a changing pay ment environment, I led a push to re structure the PSRO program to create  Peer Review Organizations, or PRO's.  This program has more flexibility to  respond to the monitoring needs that  arise under PPS.  PRO's are trying, but they're going  to need help. We will have to go fur ther than  to call for expansions  in  their contractual responsibilities in S.  2331. We also must see that they get  more timely cooperation from the De partment of Health and Human Serv ices in issuing regulations and sharing  nationwide data essential to PRO op erations. And we must see that they  get sufficient funding  to meet their  scope of work. The PRO contract must  be reasonable, not HCF A's wish list.  '  ",1986
462,641,6,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, S.  2333  is an important bill, a bill that  will take us a long way toward improv ing  access  to  health  services  for  women and infants at risk. For several  years,  I  and a  number of my col leagues have worked to improve tar geting of Medicaid services  for  this  population.  I am pleased today to be a part of  yet  another  step  in our  effort  to  extend needed care  to a vulnerable  and often overlooked population. Gov ernor Riley of South Carolina and the  Southern Governors Task Force on  Infant Mortality are to be congratulat ed both for developing a set of policy  goals and  for  the educational cam paign which  they undertook  in an  effort to improve public understanding  of the need for these changes.  It is now general knowledge that sig nificant savings-financial as well as  social-are associated with early inter vention  through good prenatal pro grams and preventive care for infants.  As most of my colleagues are already  aware, numerous studies have shown  that an expenditure of $1 in prenatal  services can yield as much as $12  savings through reduced costs of in tensive neonatal care and  the  long term  institutional expenditures  that  often accompany the handicaps associ ated with premature birth and  low  birth weight.  As Governor Riley's task force has  shown, 10 of the 11 States with the  most severe infant mortality rates are  in the Southern region of the United  States. In the South, it is estimated  that 1 of every 15 mothers is likely to  have a child with a discernible mental  or physical handicap. While the na tional average is 6.8 percent, 7.6 per cent of all babies born in the Southern  States are low in birthweight-which  is, of course, closely correlated with  high rates of infant mortality, and the  incidence  of  lifelong  handicapping  conditions.  Technically, S. 2333  assumes  that  States will be offered the option of exin  tending coverage to those women and  infants whose incomes exceed the cur rent eligibility threshold for Medicaid,  but who, nevertheless, are below 100  percent of the poverty level. While I  am hopeful that we will be able to pro vide services to this entire population  on enactment, it may be necessary to  adjust eligibility to comply with final  Congressional Budget Office cost esti mates. However,  if such a change is  needed, I hope that members of the  Finance Committee will  join me  in  support of implementing this change  as quickly as costs allow.  In sum, Mr. President, passage of S.  2333 will permit States  to  improve  access to health care by restructuring  eligibility and benefits under the Med icaid Program according to local prior ities.  I  invite my colleagues  to  join  with us in support of that goal.e  ",1986
463,641,6,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr.  President,  today my colleagues and I are intro ducing legislation which represents a  major initiative  toward reducing the  high  infant mortality  rate of  this  Nation.  The United States has  a  higher  infant mortality rate than many other  developed countries such as Sweden,  Japan, Denmark,  Norway,  France,  Spain, Canada, East Germany, and the  United Kingdom. Recent statistics in dicate that for every 1,000 live births,  approximately  11  babies  die  before the age of 1 year. In my home  State of South Carolina the problem is  greater, with 15 deaths for every 1,000  live births.  Mr. President,  two-thirds of infant  deaths occur in the neonatal period the  first month of  life. The factor  most commonly associated with these  newborn deaths  is  low birthweight.  The smaller the baby, the poorer the  chances of healthy survival. A  low birthweight baby  is more  likely  to  need costly special care. In addition,  low-birthweight babies also have sig nificantly higher rates of rehospitali zation. To address the problem of low birthweight  infants,  the Medicaid  system needs to be improved. This leg islation is designed to accomplish that  goal.  Mr. President, Medicaid plays a criti cal role as the Nation's principal fi nancing source for the health care of  mothers and children who are finan cially unable to help themselves. How ever, as many as 3.4 million poor preg nant women a year are denied vital  prenatal care because they are ineligi ble for Medicaid. Without proper pre natal  care, many  unnecessary  low birthweight babies are born who need  significant ongoing medical attention.  This, of course, means additional med ical expenses. In many cases, the high  medical expenses associated with low birthweight babies drain the financial  resources of the mother until she then  becomes eligible for Medicaid. Medic aid then must pick up the tab for the  will  expensive institutional medical treat ment.  Mr. President, what is needed, and  what this legislation provides, is an ap proach  geared  toward  preventative  medicine. Under this  legislation,  the  Medicaid  law would be amended  to  allow States, with an Aid to Families  With Dependent Children  [AFDCl  standard of need above 50 percent of  the Federal poverty  level,  to  target  Medicaid  assistance  to  pregnant  women and infants, without the State  also being required to raise AFDC pay ments to this group. This action would  be  completely  optional  with  the  States. The idea behind this change is  to  remove  a  financial  obstacle  for  many States that want to provide a  compenhensive maternity and infant  health-care  package  to  indigent  women, but have not done so because  of the high cost of State matching re quirements for AFDC payments.  Mr. President, the cost of this bill  will be $100 million  to  the Federal  Government. This amount has already  been added  to  the Domenici-Chiles  budget plan to cover the cost of the  expansion, after the Budget Commit tee gave it careful consideration.  Mr. President, I want to emphasize  that  these moneys  spent now will  prove cost-effective over the long run.  The American Academy of Pediatrics  reported in 1984 that for every dollar  spent on prenatal care, $2 to $10 can  be saved down the road. ""An ounce of  prevention is worth a pound of cure.""  This is  the approach of this legisla tion, and I urge my colleagues to sup port this bill.  By Mr. THURMOND:  S. 2334. A bill to amend section 207  of title 18, United States Code, to pro hibit Members of Congress and offi cers and employees of any branch of  the U.S. Government from attempting  to influence the U.S. Government or  from representing or advising a  for eign entity  for  a  proscribed period  after such officer or employee leaves  Government  service,  and  for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Ju diciary.

465,654,6,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President, a  unique ceremony in the history of the  U.S. Congress is taking place today in  the Russell Senate Office Building ad jacent to the room where the late Carl  T. Hayden once had his office. At 4  p.m. today, a ceremony will be held by  the Joint Congressional Committee on  the Library  to dedicate  the portrait  bust of Carl Hayden which was com missioned pursuant to Senate Concur rent Resolution 7 of  the 98th Con gress. I had the distinct privilege of  authoring that resolution and seeing  its approval by passage in the Senate  on May 23, 1983, and passage in the  House of Representatives on August 1,  1983.  Mr. President,  the bust being un veiled today commemorates the truly  unique service in the Senate and the  Congress and the Nation by the man  who for so many years was my senior  colleague, Carl Hayden. Carl served in  Congress from Arizona for a  total of  57 years.  Carl Hayden became the first elect ed Member of the U.S. House of Rep resentatives from Arizona in 1912 and  he served there for the next 15 years.  In 1926 he was elected to the Senate  and served consecutive terms here for  a total of 42 years until he retired in  1968. In fact, Carl Hayden served in  the U.S. Congress  longer  than any  other person in history.  Mr. President, the contributions and  achievements of Carl Hayden are vir tually  unparalleled  in  history,  al though they are not well known be cause he always shared the credit and  worked for results, not for the publici ty. His legislative accomplishments in cluded a joint authorship of the 19th  amendment giving women the right to  vote and a major role in setting up the  original Interstate Highway System.  Carl Hayden's work was done for all  practical purposes before  legislation  ever reached the Senate floor. He did  not go in for flowery speeches aimed  at the Press Gallery or the evening  television news. He accomplished what  he set out to accomplish for his State  and the Nation and he did his real  work  in committee and behind  the  scenes.  Carl Hayden's family was among one  of the original settlers who entered  the Salt River Valley of Arizona, and  he was born in the territory of Arizona  35 years before  it became a State.  There is no one more qualified to re ceive this honor than the late Senator  Hayden.  Mr. President, I ask that the official  program  of  the  ceremonies may  appear in the REcoRD.

Mr. President,  when Rita Steinberg of Louisville, KY,  joined the National Council of Jewish  Women 20 years ago, she began an im pressive  accomplishments  and community service.  As a local council officer, she initiat ed an annual sale of donated used  clothing which grossed $7,500 its first  year, 1976. Last year, the event gar nered nearly $159,000. When she later  became president of the Louisville sec tion of the NCJW, she made member ship a priority for  the organization.  The NCJW consequently saw its ranks  jump from 860 members to more than  1,000. Mrs. Steinberg then became a  national board member of the NCJW  and helped a section in Chicago start  its own clothing sale. That section's  first sale took in $40,000 its first year.  Mrs. Steinberg has also served her  community as  commissioner of  the  Louisville  and  Jefferson  County  Human Relations Commission and as  a board member of Kentucky Youth  Advocates.  Now she works full time as executive  director of  the Kentucky Art and  Craft Foundation, a nonprofit organi zation providing educational and pro motional opportunities for the State's  artisans.  Mrs. Steinberg's contributions to her  community have not gone unnoticed.  Sunday, April 20, I will have the honor  of presenting, on behalf of the Louis ville section, the Hannah G. Solomon  Award to Mrs. Steinberg for her en deavors.  A recent column by Joan Kay of the  Louisville  Courier-J oumal  describes  Mrs. Steinberg's accomplishments and  captures her spirit of  service. Mrs.  Steinberg  says  in  the  article  that  through her work in NCJW, ""I've had  a feeling all the time that my life had  meaning-that what I was doing was  making a difference in the world.""  Mr. President, I ask that this article,  which  tells  the story of Mrs. Stein berg's work so well, be printed in its  entirety.  The article follows:  [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Apr.  17, 1986]  CoMMITMENT PAYS OFF FOR RITA STEINBERG  AND WOMEN'S COUNCIL  <By Joan Kay)  Twenty years ago, nudged by her family,  Rita Steinberg joined the National Council  of Jewish Women, Louisville Section.  Her  aunt,  Sylvia Goldstein, was  very  active in the group and ""probably paid for  my first membership,"" said Mrs. Steinberg.  ""My husband's aunt in St. Louis was a na tional board member at the time so I was  bombarded from all sides.""  Mrs. Steinberg had hoped to make new  friends. She found those all right and much  more. Through working on NCJW projects  that benefited the community, ""I've had a  feeling all the time that my life had mean ing-that what I was doing was making a  difference in the world.""  Sunday the Louisville Section will recog nize Mrs. Steinberg's contributions by pre senting her with the Hannah G. Solomon  Award.  The award is given ""to someone who has  shown dedication to improving the lives of  children, the aging and women,"" says Renee  Loeb, president of the Louisville Section.  Mrs. Steinberg's ""devotion to community  causes is just incredible. She was able to set  a vision and was able  to convince people  they wanted to be part of it. She strives for  the best and lets people know that is the  standard.""  Mrs. Steinberg remembers that her first  volunteer assignment was helping a  fifth grade class put on its first play. At the time  the organization sponsored many enrich ment programs in public schools.  ""It was a lot of fun. That's really what  turned me on.""  ",1986
466,667,6,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I am strongly op posed to the President's request for $100 mil lion  for the Contras who seek  to overthrow  the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. This  is a huge, nearly fourfold increase in funding  for the Contras since the first request 5 years  ago for $19 million. If this request is granted, it  will surely not be the last.  It will be a down payment of hundreds on millions more.  There is no doubt that the Sandinista gov ernment is repressive and has a dismal record  of human rights violations, and  I certainly do  not want continuation and strengthening of a  Marxist-Leninist regime in Central America But  the Contras have also committed brutal atroc ities and do not represent a viable or accepta ble alternative to the Sa.ndinistas. Just yester day we saw reports on dissension among the  top  civilian  leaders  of  the Contras  amid  charges of mishandling of funds, criminal ac tivity, and human rights abuses. They do not  inspire a popular, democratic movement inside  Nicaragua  but  instead  spread  terror  and  hatred among the innocent campesinos.  I firmly believe that the only effective and  realistic solution  is  through negotiation. De spite the recent setback, the Contadora proc ess is the policy we should pursue. It has not  really had a chance to succeed since the ad ministration has given only lip service to sup porting  it.  It  is  time  that we wholeheartedly  support it. We would have the support of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  rest of Central America to vigorously pressure  Nicaragua to reduce  its armed  forces, expel  its  foreign advisers, honor  its borders and  cease support for insurgencies in neighboring  countries.  Apart from the need to cease aid to an inef fective group of men who spread violence and  terror, it is appalling that aid should be sought  at a  time when  the President  is proposir.g  deep cuts in vital programs providing nutrition,  health, education, job training and other vital  services to our disadvantaged and vulnerable  citizens. It is inconceivable to me that we can  consider sending funds to support a suspect,  no-win  terrorist  group while  contemplating  budget  reductions  that would endanger  the  health and welfare of so many of our own citi zens. Continued funding of the Contras would  be counterproductive both to our national se curity and  to  the domestic stability of our  country.  CONGRATULATIONS CARROLL  BEAVER  HON. GENE CHAPPlE  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  Mr. CHAPPlE. Mr. Speaker,  I'd like to take  this  opportunity  to  recognize Mr.  Carroll  Beaver who will be retiring from the California  Department of Forestry. Throughout Carroll's  35 years of service in northern California, he  is best known for his leadership as captain of  the air attack base in Grass Valley. Due to his  spirit of compromise and adaptability, Carroll  successfully engineered  the merging of  the  California Department of Forestry with  the  Grass Valley Fire Attack Base. In doing so, he  helped to provide the most effective air attack  fire protection service in the State.  In addition to Carroll's active duty with the  forestry, he is respected in his community as  a model citizen and as a supportive  father  who has reared 1 0 children.  As Carroll approaches retirement this May, I  congratulate him on his many contributions to  northern California and wish him the happiest  of years to come.  THE TIDE OF FREEDOM RELIES  ON AMERICA'S STRENGTH  HON. JACK F. KEMP  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  ",1986
467,667,6,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, America's historic  destiny has been to raise freedom to its fullest  expression not just  in  the United States but  throughout  the world. This  is  the greatest  hope of oppressed peoples  throughout  the  world. Thankfully, since 1981, America has ex perienced a resurgence of confidence  in  its  ideals, and not surprisingly,  the tide of free dom is now just beginning to overwhelm and  overcome  the  forces of tyranny and  repres sion in many areas throughout the world.  Yet we are  in danger of undercutting  the  military strength that strengthens and embol dens the new march of freedom. Some are  8017  OKLA.-This  THAT  GRAMM u.s. MILITARY  even suggesting that the defense budget ex perience another  famine cycle  in  the years  ahead, threatening, once again, the deteriora tion of America's defenses and all that means  for the cause of freedom-fighters and democ racy throughout the world.  The  following article warns  that America's  defense preparedness and combat readiness  efforts are beginning to be sacrificed in some  significant ways as a short-term expedient to  reduce the deficit. I commend the following ar ticle to my colleagues, and earnestly urge that  this year and beyond Congress provide a de fense budget adequate to our weighty respon sibilities and historic destiny.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 8,  1986]  LoGISTICS  OFFICERS  FRET  RUDMAN  MAY  HINDER  COMBAT READINESS  <By Tim Carrington>  TINKER  AIR  FORCE  BASE,  sprawling archipelago of parts warehouses  and aircraft workshops is the military's big gest logistics center, keeping thousands of  warplanes and  related systems  ready  for  combat. But officers here are fretting that  Washington will scrimp on the funds needed  for military readiness.  The  source  of  apprehension  is  the  Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The  fear is that the Pentagon, as it did during  past budget crunches, will squeeze funding  for maintenance, repair, training and trans portation  in order  to  insulate big-dollar  weapons programs from cuts. Already there  are some early signs  that today's budget  pressures will hurt military readiness. More over, the threat that the U.S. arsenal will be  less ready comes at a time when the presi dent is using the military more often as a  diplomatic and political  tool around  the  world.  The fears appear to be well-grounded: Al though the overall Air Force budget would  grow by 7% under the Reagan administra tion's request for fiscal1987, proposed fund ing for Air Force spare parts would drop  40%  from  the levels planned a year ago.  Lloyd Mosemann, Air Force deputy assist ant secretary for logistics, says, ""I anticipate  that we won't fund spares as completely as  we did.""  ENGINE EXHAUSTION  ""When you have a reduction in logistics  money, you can't buy the spare parts tore place fuel controls, etc.,"" says Maj. Gen.  William Bowden, commander of the Tinker  logistics operation. ""At some point, you end  up with engine exhaustion.""  Others offer more dire prognoses. ""The  U.S. faces the real prospect of entering the  1990s with  shiny,  new,  high-technology  forces that look impressive but cannot roll  or sail or  fly  to where  they might be  needed,"" says the Committee for National  Security, an independent research group, in  a recent budget study.  Because it takes about two years for parts  to be delivered,  funding shortfalls  today  won't create noticeable readiness problems  until  about  1989. Nonetheless,  here  are  early signs that such problems may be brew ing:  The B-1, the Air Force's newest bomber,  already  faces  parts  shortages  here  at  Tinker, where the planes will be maintained  and overhauled. According to Gen. Bowden,  this year's Gramm-Rudman cuts dipped into  dollars earmarked for stocking up parts for  ",1986
468,693,6,Mr. DAUB.," Mr. Speaker,  the Consolidated  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985  was signed into law by the President on April  7, 1986, after considerable delay in the House  and in the other body. Section 13208 of that  act generally provides  that  the  transfer of  farmland by an  insolvent farmer to a creditor  in cancellation of indebtedness, or to a third  party under threat of foreclosure, will not give  rise  to alternative minimum  tax  liability. The  amendment is effective for transfers of farm land after December 31 , 1981 .  The normal 3-year statute of limitations for  timely filed 1982 calendar year returns expired  on April 15, 1986.  Insolvent farmers seeking  the protection of the new amendment with re spect  to calendar year 1982 were  required,  therefore, to file an amended 1982 return on  or before April 15, 1986, just 8 days after the  Budget Reconciliation Act was  signed  into  law. This obviously was not enough time for  those insolvent farmers seeking the protection  of  the amendment  to react to the new  law.  The  repeated delays  in passing  the Budget  Reconciliation Act has, practically speaking,  undermined  the clear  intent of  the act  to  assist insolvent farmers beginning with calen dar year 1982 transfers of farmland.  In order to more fully carry out the original  intent of the Budget Reconciliation Act,  I am  introducing a bill that would extend the statute  of limitations for a short period for purposes of  taking advantage of the insolvent farmer pro vision  in  the Budget Reconciliation Act. The  bill provides  that  if a  taxpayer  is prevented  from claiming a refund or credit resulting from  the  insolvent farmer provision  in  the Budget  Reconciliation Act at any time before October  16, 1986, then the refund or credit will never theless be allowed  if claim  therefor  is  filed  within 6 months of the date of enactment of  the bill.  I would urge my colleagues to join with me  in supporting this small but important change  to the Budget Reconciliation Act. Thank you.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  INTERNATIONAL  COOPERATION  NEEDED TO COMBAT TERROR IST THREAT  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  ",1986
469,693,6,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  it is  truly  regrettable  that  the French Government  re fused to allow United States aircraft to overfly  that country.  Margaret  Thatcher  of  Britain,  however,  stood firm. She is to be commended for taking  a brave stand. She held out her hand when  America needed her help.  In this age of terrorism,  international coop eration  is  needed  to  combat  the  terrorist  threat. The  free world cannot afford  to  turn  and run from terrorist dictators.  Although  the French Government had  re cently indicated a growing resolve to confront  terrorism, that Government refused a request  for overflight  rights  for  the U.S.  bombers.  When they were put on the spot, the French  blinked.  Their ambiguous attitude caused our pilots  to fly an extra 2,500 miles to skirt the coast of  Europe on their way to Libya. They were ex posed to possible detection by being in the air  that long. They arrived on target fatigued and  stressed.  No wonder the Libyan Ambassador in Paris  congratulated  the  French Government  for  turning down America's request. Fortunately,  America does have a friend over there.  When  the going got tough, Prime Minister  Thatcher stood firm. She defended our deci sion  and  said  that  those  bombers were  needed for the task at hand. Among our Euro pean allies, she kept the course.  In the fight against terrorism,  there can be  no weak hearts or partial commitments. Either  we confront this problem together, or we will  all pay the price of not acting against c:: grow ing  threat. We must all shoulder  the heavy  burden of fighting terrorism.  BUSINESS LIABILITY INSURANCE  CRISIS  HON. DAVID DREIER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April17, 1986  ",1986
470,693,6,Mr. DREIER.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  there  exists an acute crisis in the availability and af fordability of liability insurance for businesses  and municipalities  throughout the country.  In  fact, most of the State conferences leading to  the 1986 White House Conference on Small  Business cited the liability insurance crisis as  the most  threatening  to  the continued well8043  being of our economy. The crisis is so encom passing  that it has been  the focus of major  media coverage in recent months.  The extent  to which  the  lack of available  and affordable liability insurance has damaged  the economy underlies the need for immedi ate Government action, both at the State and  Federal level. In the last 2 years alone, liability  insurance premiums have increased by 50 to  900 percent. Between 197 4 and 1984,  the  number of product  liability suits  filed  in U.S.  district courts increased from under 2 million  to almost 11 million. The number of million  dollar awards for compensatory and punitive  damages in liability suits increased from under  50 in 1977 to over 400 in 1984.  As a  result,  thousands of companies are  abandoning their lines of business, operating  without insurance, or increasing the prices of  their products  to cover  insurance premium  costs. Municipalities  fare  no  better. Many  competent  and  effective  city  officials  are  second-guessing their decisions to seek mu nicipal positions out of fear of being sued.  In  California alone, as many as half of the cities  will  function without  liability  insurance cover age should nothing be done  to address  the  current crisis.  Unfortunately, the origin of the current liabil ity insurance crisis is undetermined. Some crit ics blame the tort justice system, particularly  the principle of joint and several  liability and  the increase, during the last 1 0 years,  in the  number  of  negligence  lawsuits  and  the  amount of  the awards made  in connection  with those lawsuits. Others view the account ing and management decisions of insurance  companies over the past decade, and the un stable cyclical nature of the industry, as being  responsible for the crisis.  In response, Mr. Speaker, to this uncertain ty, I am today introducing legislation to estab lish a commission on  the  liability  insurance  crisis. As you know,  the collection of data to  determine the cause of, and suggest a solu tion  to,  the  liability insurance dilemma poses  significant difficulties. The Commission  I am  proposing would examine  the system of tort  law  in  the United States, and  the  financial  structure of the insurance industry. The com mission would consist of representatives of in dustry, Government, and consumer groups,  who would be appointed jointly by the Presi dent, the Speaker of the House, and the ma jority leader of the Senate.  The commission would provide Congress,  the President, and State governments with a  list of recommendations for resolving the crisis  in the availability and affordability of liability in surance. Such a commission would not  re quire any appropriated money  from  the  tax payers.  It would draw upon  the existing  re sources of the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker,  the current  liability insurance  crisis warrants immediate action. I believe my  proposal offers the best vehicle to determine  what  legitimate actions can be  taken at all  levels of government to address this crisis.  I  urge my colleagues to consider the merits of  this legislation, and join me in moving forward  to solve what is potentially one of the most  critical dilemmas to face business and munici palities nationwide.

471,719,6,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I will not  move to proceed to the drug export  bill, and file cloture on the motion to  proceed. I  just had a discussion with  the distinguished Senator from Ohio,  Senator METZENBAUM. He has indicat ed that he has no objection to going to  the bill. He will have a number of  amendments, and extensive debate on  the bill itself if we bring it up after we  dispose of the budget resolution.  On that basis,  I  see no reason  to  move to that and file cloture, if we do  not need do it. It will take some time  to be on the bill itself.  I  guess with  that understanding  when we dispose of the budget resolu tion, at least as far as Senator METz ENBAUM  is concerned-somebody else  might object-there will be no objec tion to proceeding to S. 1848. It may  not come up right after the budget  resolution. It may come up later. But  that is no problem to Senator METz ENBAUM; if it never comes up, it will be  soon enough as I understand it.  So I guess we will be able to leave  here fairly quickly. Let me check a  couple of those items.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  GoRTON).

482,719,6,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I indicat ed earlier that there might be a possi bility on Monday of calling up S. 49,  the gun control bill. I am advised by  the distinguished Senator from Idaho  [Mr. McCLURE], who is the manager of  that bill, that he would prefer not to  try to do that on Monday; but he is  working with Members who have some  questions about the bill, and maybe  they can work it out later in the week.  There is still a possibility of bringing  up the budget resolution on Monday.  I have also indicated that we might  move  to proceed to the drug export  bill, S. 1848. But I have had a discus sion with  the distinguished Senator  from Ohio [Mr. METZENBAUM], and he  indicates that he would be willing to  let that bill come up after we dispose  of  the  budget  resolution, without  going through cloture on the motion  to proceed.  It is my hope that we can clear the  nomination of Donald Newman, and I  indicate for the RECORD that there is  no objection on the Democratic side.  The objection is coming from this side,  the Republican side. I hope that Sena tor HUMPHREY and Senator HELMs will  be able on Monday to let us dispose of  that nomination. It is a very  impor tant nomination.  It is also my hope that on Monday  we can take care of this little concur rent resolption that has been floating  around for a couple of weeks. There  are 38 cosponsors. In effect,  it  is a  sense of the Senate to indicate that  the Farm Credit System should use  certain practices to protect American  farmers. We believe  it  is  important.  We obviously have faith in the regula tory agency, but we believe that by  passing this legislation it would under score the concern Congress has when  we are dealing with farmers and credit  policies that affect farmers. So I hope  that on Monday, without  a  record  vote, we might be able to pass that.  Mr. President,  I  indicate  for  the  RECORD that there will be no votes on  Monday, as was announced previously.  We will do our best to protect some of  our colleagues on Wednesday, which is  the beginning of Passover, with no  votes after a certain hour that after noon-4 o'clock or 6 o'clock. We will  work that out to their satisfaction.  I  indicate that there could be late  nights on other days, particularly  if  we get into the budget, because it is a  50-hour process; and  I  assume  that  unless  there  is  some  agreement  to  reduce the time, we would need to stay  in late, at least to run the clock.  Friday session next week? Again I  am not in position to say there will not  be one.  I guess  I  just assume  that  there would be a Friday session next  week with votes but if something de velops  between  now  and  hopefully  Tuesday when we  have our policy  luncheons I will convey that to the  distinguished leaders.

484,797,6,Mr.  PRYOR.," Mr. President,  the  cover of the April 15, 1986, issue of Fi nancial World has a picture of Mr.  Sam M. Walton of Bentonville, AR.  Recently, he was named ""Chief Execu tive Officer of the Year.""  Starting from scratch, Sam Walton  built Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., into one of  the Nation's most profitable retailers.  His leadership has boosted Wal-Mart  Stores, Inc., to a whopping $8.4 billion  industry. There  is no question  that  Sam is one of the most innovative and  successful  businessmen  in America  today.  I congratulate Sam and his team of  over 110,000 loyal employees for work ing together to make Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc., a giant in today's business world.  It is my pleasure to submit for the  RECORD the Financial World article on  Sam being named ""Chief Executive  Officer of the Year.""  The article follows:  GOLD WINNER-SAM M. WALTON OF W AL MART SToREs TAKES THE ToP PRIZE  <By Stephen Taub>  Sam Walton's savvy, homespun success  probably hasn't fazed  his old Zeta Phi  brothers at the University of Missouri. In a  1940 profile entitled ""Hustler Walton,"" a  fraternity newspaper cited  the year's Big  Beta on Campus for numerous club mem berships, athletic prowess and a knack for  recruiting top-notch frat leaders. For good  measure, the story hailed his friendliness in  knowing virtually every janitor by name and  his community spirit in passing the collec tion at church services. ""There is little limit  to the number of things Sam has done,""  added the bedazzled writer.  More than four decades later, it is obvious  that ""Hustler"" Walton's fans were selling  him short. The 68-year-old chairman and  chief executive has parlayed  that energy  ""and those human skills""  into something  unique: Wal-Mart Stores, now the nation's  second largest mass merchandiser and one  of corporate America's greatest successes.  Today,  the  company  boasts  sales  that  exceed $8.4 billion and a staff of more than  110,000 employees. It is one of the nation's  most profitable retailers.  Perhaps inevitably, such accomplishments  inspired a panel of judges to elect Walton  FW's 1985 CEO of the Year. The recogni tion stems not from a single year's achieve ments, but from his company's long, unin terrupted, dizzying growth rate, particularly  in view of the economic problems afflicting  the farm belt and oil patch served by the  bulk of his stores. Over the past 10 years,  Wal-Mart's compounded  annual  revenue  growth has been 37 .5%, and its compounded  earnings growth has been 39.8% per year.  ",1986
485,810,6,Mr.  GEKAS.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  attack on Libya was an administrative,  Ronald Reagan, White House, Ameri can response to the problem of terror ism.  It was almost unanimously en dorsed by the people of the United  States as a necessary retaliation for all  of the acts of madness perpetrated by  Qadhafi and his people over a course  of decades.  Mr. Speaker, however, the Congress  has not done enough to address the  issue of  terrorism and we owe  it to  ourselves and to the American people  to hone out most of the issues that  remain on terrorism.  For  instance, before  the Judiciary  Committee is now pending a piece of  legislation that would apply the death  penalty to any terrorist anywhere in  the world who would kill an American  citizen. Through the extradition trea ties and through self-help on the part  of our own Government, we have the  right to try terrorists in our country  for killing an American citizen.  I urge every Member to urge the Ju diciary Committee to act expeditiously  on this, another method that we need  to deal with the scourge of terrorism.  OIL IMPORT FEE  <Mr. WEAVER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1986
486,810,6,Mr. WEAVER.," Mr. Speaker,  last  year,  I  introduced a bill, H.R. 1396,  that would have levied an import fee  on imported oil. I did so for two rea sons: One,  to raise money to reduce  the deficit, and two, as a conservation  measure.  Now, because of the convulsions in  the oil markets, I believe that such an  oil import fee would not be timely. I  also fear that it might be used not to  reduce  the deficit, but to accommo date other spending or tax loopholes,  and therefore, I withdraw my support  of this bill and ask my cosponsors to  find another vehicle to show their sup port for the bill because I no longer  support it.

I am  reassured that in the absence of this  body being able to come to grips with  this situation, Mr. Ortega has once  again come to the rescue and sent out  his deep and abiding commitment of  faith and solidarity to Mr. Mu'ammar  Qadhafi.  We thank you, Mr. Ortega.  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE  SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  FRANK). Pursuant to the provisions of  clause 5 of rule I, the Chair announces  that he will postpone further proceed ings today on each motion to suspend  the rules on which a recorded vote or  the yeas and nays are ordered, or on  which the vote  is objected to under  clause 4 of rule XV.  Such rollcall votes, if postponed, will  be taken on Tuesday, April 22, 1986.  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR  CONTROL OF PLAGUE  ",1986
488,810,6,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and pass the bill  <H.R.  4392),  to  amend  the Public  Health Service Act to provide Federal  financial assistance for the control of  plague.  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 4392  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. PLAGUE.  Section 317 of the Public Health Service  Act <42 U.S.C. 247b) is amended by adding  at the end the following:  ""(k) The Secretary, acting through the Di rector of the Centers for Disease Control,  may make grants to and enter into contracts  and cooperative agreements with States for  the control of plague. For grants, coopera tive agreements, and contracts under this  subsection there are authorized to be appro priated $1,000,000  for each of  the  fiscal  years 1987 and 1988."".  SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.  The amendment made by section 1 shall  take effect on October 1, 1986.  ",1986
489,810,6,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Pursu ant to the rule, a second is not re quired on this motion.  The gentleman from California [Mr.  WAXMAN] will be  recognized  for 20  minutes and the gentleman from Colo rado [Mr. STRANG] will be recognized  for 20 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from California [Mr. WAXMAN].  ",1986
490,810,6,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I might consume.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill  is simply to authorize $1 million a year  for the next 2 fiscal years for the con trol of bubonic plague. Although this  deadly disease  is rare  in the United  States, the Centers for Disease Con trol are now reporting an increase in  the number of cases. Animal cases  have been reported in 10 States and  human cases in 7.  The effects of this disease can be  devastating both in human terms and  in economic terms. Plague kills, and it  is expensive to treat. But with appro priate  educational  programs  and  better diagnostic techniques, the Cen ters for Disease Control believe  the  disease can be made even rarer to find.  H.R. 4392 provides the CDC and the  States with the opportunity to make  these needed improvements. Funding  for the CDC would allow continued re search,  evaluation, and  implementa tion of plague control strategies,  in cluding the development of improved  laboratory testing.  H.R. 4392  is a  reasonable and re sponsible approach to help solve a dif ficult and deadly problem that many  of our Western States are now facing.  I urge my colleagues to support the  bill and to vote for its passage.  ",1986
491,810,6,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from Utah  [Mr. NIEL SON].  ",1986
492,810,6,Mr. NIELSON of Utah.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in opposition to H.R. 4392, legis lation that authorizes appropriations  for grants to States to eradicate the  plague.  My opposition is not based on the  dismissal of plague as  a  legitimate  problem, but rather a recognition that  the Department of Health and Human  Services  already  has  authority  to  make  the grants authorized by  this  legislation. The Centers  for Disease  Control at HHS establish priorities for  those public health problems which  require Federal assistance. Congress  has already authorized appropriations  for the Centers for Disease Control ac tivities.  It is inappropriate for Congress to be  authorizing a million dollars for one  particular  public  health  problem,  when the experts at the Centers for  Disease Control have not even request",1986
493,823,6,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Speaker, between now  and 1990, over 170 hydroelectric projects will  come up for relicensing.  I have a deep con cern that the relicensing process be conduct ed  in a  fair and  responsible manner, and  I  have joined with over 180 of our colleagues  who share this concern in cosponsoring H.R.  44, the Electric Consumers Protection Act.  This legislation provides a simple solution to  the dilemma caused by conflicting Federal  Regulatory  Commission  decisions  handed  down on  the question of preference on reli censing. H.R. 44 would assure that any utility  which has properly built and operated a hydro electric project in the public interest and dem onstrates that it will continue to do so, will be  able to keep running it in the future.  H.R. 44 clarifies how relicensing questions  should  be  fairly  decided.  This  legislation  makes the all important distinction between a  utility which is applying for a license and the  original  licensee. During the relicensing proc ess under H.R. 44,  if FERC concludes  that  both applicants will do an equal job of using  the  public water  resource,  simply  fairness  would dictate that FERC break the tie in favor  of the original licensee who built the generat ing project and its customers who have paid  for it.  I believe H.R. 44 keeps  the consumer's  best interest in mind, by allowing the electric  customers who have paid  in their rates over  the years for construction, financing, operation  and maintenance of the project to continue in  the  future  to  receive  the  low-cost electricity  which is generated.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  vital, pro-consumer bill.  Mr. LEHMAN of California, Mr. Speaker, this  week  the House will consider H.R. 44,  the  Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1985,  legislation  clarifying discrepancies  regarding  the relicensing of hydroelectric power projects  by  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis sion.  As a Member whose district includes both  public and privately-owned utilities,  I applaud  the efforts of the House Energy and Com merce Committee, my California colleagues  who were a part of the compromise efforts,  and the representatives of the utility industry  for this important consensus legislation. I am  pleased to join a majority of my colleagues in  supporting H.R. 44 on the floor of the House.  While H.R. 44 clarifies FERC's role  in  the  relicensing process, includes a number of im portant environmental  safeguards,  and  ad dresses the role of the Public Utility Regula tory Policies Act [PURPA] in hydroelectric de velopment,  I would like to bring to the atten tion of the House my continuing concern re garding the issue of small hydro development.  In response to the energy crisis of the late  1970's, Congress passed legislation to foster  the development of renewable and alternative  energy sources. With  regard  to small hydro  development, Congress  intended  that  these  incentives were to apply only to existing facili ties or on facilities that would not have a neg ative  impact on  the natural qualities of a re source.  However,  the  subsequent  implementation  by FERC broadened the definition to include  new facilities and the number of small hydro  applications which were  filed with FERC  in creased dramatically. The most dramatic  in crease occurred  in  the West where  literally  thousands  of  small,  free-running mountain  streams became the target for energy devel opment.  Though many of the projects were for retro fitting  existing dams or on  streams which  posed only marginal threat to fish and wildlife,  a large majority were proposed on scenic or  environmetally  sensitive  streams. At  these  sites, speculators were  taking advantage of  both  tax incentives and  law requiring utilities  to pay  for the power at ""avoided costs"" of  generating electricity with  oil.  Furthermore,  many of these projects were clustered in one  area or in a watershed region which already  had serveral large hydroelectric projects. If al lowed to be constructed, many of these small  hydro projects would provide further deteriora tion of  the natural  resources and aesthetic  values of a watershed region.  Unfortunately, FERC has been consistent in  its role in facilitating the development of new  small hydro projects by providing little, if any  administrative  relief  in meeting  the environ mental concerns relating to the proliferation of  small hydro development. Only court actions  and  intense  congressional  pressure  has  forced either delays of comprehensive studies  of cumulative impacts on watershed regions.  H.R. 44 does provide some  relief  in  this  regard by requiring FERC to prepare a study  analyzing the need for PURPA and other ben efits on new facilities, as well as the environ mental impacts of both new and existing facili ties on watersheds.  However,  the  legislation grandfathers cer tain projects that have ""committed substantial  resources"" during the  licensing proceeding.  I  would  like to remind my colleagues that the  problems associated with small hydro devel opment have been  the result of the blatant  disregard  for congressional  intent by FERC  and further exacerbated by FERC's steadfast  unwillingness  to address  this problem  in an  early and equitable manner. To  leave this in  ",1986
494,836,6,Mrs. VUCANOVICH.," Yes, it is.  ",1986
495,836,6,Mr. GONZALEZ.," I see. Over in my  part of the woods, down in Texas, we  do not have  reservations, but  they  have  them up  in Oklahoma. They  have been giving  some mighty big  prizes away in the bingo games in the  Oklahoma Indian reservations. I had  the great risk of my wife being invited  by a fellow parishioner to go up there  where the winnings would be big. I did  not know if this was going to affect  that kind of activity or not.  ",1986
496,836,6,Mrs. VUCANOVICH.,  It will  affect bingo.  ,1986
497,836,6,Mr. GONZALEZ., Apparently  the  Oklahoma reservations have about a  thousand-percent  bigger  winnings  than the parish bingo games over in  my district.  ,1986
498,836,6,Mrs. VUCANOVICH.," Well, I think it  is a concern, and I think that perhaps  the study that GAO will do will maybe  turn up some information about that.  ",1986
499,836,6,Mr. GONZALEZ., I thank the gentle woman.  ,1986
500,836,6,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes  to  the distinguished gentle man from Ohio [Mr. SEIBERLING].  ",1986
501,836,6,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  want to commend the gentleman from  Arizona [Mr. UDALL]  for bringing up  this bill. There are no Indian reserva tions in Ohio, and yet this bill is of in terest  to every single Member from  every single State in the Union.  I discovered somewhat  to my sur prise a few years ago that it is possible  for an Indian tribe to buy land in an other State far from their normal geo graphic location and establish a bingo  operation on that land. It can be very  small, but it is still considered a reser vation that  is held  in trust for  the  tribe. It is exempt under present law  from local ordinances and State laws  that  regulate  gambling  throughout  the rest of the State or in the particu lar local jurisdiction.  So, having found that, it seemed to  me that this bill presented a very ex cellent opportunity to make it clear  that on that type of operation where  the Indian land is remote or separate  from an actual Indian reservation, it  cannot supersede State and local law.  Accordingly,  the  bill  provides  that  class II and class III gaming shall be  unlawful on lands acquired by the Sec retary after December 4, 1985, if the  lands are located outside the bound aries of such tribe's reservation, but  that this prohibition shall not apply if  the Governor of the State, the State  legislature, and the governing bodies  of  the  county and municipality  in  which such lands are located approve  the operation. So  this retains State  and local control over nonreservation  Indian gambling, and I  think that is  very important to every single State,  not only because it is important from  the standpoint of preserving the op portunity of a State to regulate gam bling activities within its own borders  on lands which are not on an Indian  reservation, but  it  is  important be cause certain elements that are unde sirable otherwise could take over and  you would in fact have a gambling op eration where  Indians were getting  some benefits, but since there was no  State  or Federal  regulation,  there  could be  organized  crime  or  some  other group skimming off the majori ty of the benefits, and also bringing  undesirable activities into your State.  This bill is extremely important to  every single State in the Union that  feels that it is desirable to maintain  State and local control over gambling  operations. I again want to commend  the chairman and the other members  of the committee for the hard work  they have done on this legislation.  ",1986
502,836,6,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 5  minutes  to  the gentleman from Ne braska [Mr. BEREUTER].  ",1986
503,836,6,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  begin by  thanking and commending  my colleague,  the very distinguished  and able chairman of the Committee  on Interior and Insular Affairs,  the  gentleman from Arizona [Mr. UDALL],  and all the members of the committee  that have worked to bring us this com promise legislation. I  think it is very  necessary and important legislation.  Accordingly, therefore, Mr. Speaker,  today I rise in support of H.R. 1920,  the Indian Gaming Control Act, and  to address two specific matters regard ing the legislation.  To begin,  this Member wishes  to  bring to the attention of the House a  provision in the legislation that came  about because of a plan developed by  an Indian tribe in my district in N e braska. Briefly, this tribe intended to  purchase a piece of property some 75  miles from the reservation, within the  city limits of a medium-size town also  in my district. The tribe then intended  to request that the Secretary of the  Interior grant this 22-acre parcel trust  status, for the purpose of establishing  an Indian bingo operation.  ",1986
504,836,6,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1986
505,836,6,Mr. BEREUTER.,"  I am pleased  to  yield to my colleague, the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. SEIBERLING].  ",1986
506,836,6,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, in  the case that brought this to my at tention, which was a proposal to estab lish a similar operation in the county  adjoining my own, the land was 1,200  miles  from  the  reservation  of  the  tribe, and the acreage that they were  going to acquire was only 8 acres and  was purely for a gambling operation,  and that really got my attention in a  hurry.  0 1315  ",1986
507,836,6,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank my colleague for that example.  I became aware of that example, too,  and I believe it set the long-distance  indeed  a  creative  record. We  are  people-all of us.  This Member was very opposed to  such a plan to create lands by acquisi tion strictly for the purpose of gam bling activities. While  this Member  recognizes that economic development  is one of the reasons used to justify  the addition of new trust lands by the  Secretary of the Interior, I most em phatically  believe  that  gambling  should not be considered an appropri ate activity to justify an extension of  trust status to land outside the reser vation area. Not only would such an  extension have to be considered bad  public policy, but the potential law en forcement problems and demonstrated  opposition were  both  considerable.  Therefore,  this Member  introduced  legislation which was then considered  by the committee during their hear ings on Indian gaming. My legislation  prohibits  any  tribe  from  acquiring  land that is not contiguous to the res ervation for the specific purpose of es tablishing a  gaming operation. Our  distinguished  colleague  from Ohio,  Mr. SEIBERLING, offered the provision  in committee, and it is included in the  legislation before us today. It is an im portant protection,  this Member be lieves,  for  the practice would create  practical problems that could not, in  the long run, be easily addressed. This  Member wishes to make it clear, how ever, that he does not oppose the cre ation of gaming operations on the res ervation under proper regulations and  management.  This  raises  another matter, Mr.  Speaker, which  I will  take only  a  minute to discuss. While this Member  recognizes that there is a  legitimate  need to address the issues associated  with nonregulated gaming activities,  including those that are operated by  Indian business persons on the reser vation, there are some concerns about  tribal sovereignty  that must be ad dressed.  Mr.  Speaker, while  this Member  does not believe  that the legislation  which will  emerge  from  the other  body on Indian gaming will necessarily  be less restrictive than on legitimate  matters of Indian sovereignty, it is my  hope that there will be an opportunity  in the conference to look again at the  impact of House actions on the rights  of tribal governments.  Thank you.  Our  distinguished  colleague,  the  gentleman  from Ohio  [Mr. SEIBER LING] offered the provision in the com mittee. It is included here today.  ",1986
508,836,6,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. CoELHo].  ",1986
509,836,6,Mr. COELHO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  distinguished  chairman  of  the  committee for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I  am pleased  to be  among those who are supporting the  ",1986
510,849,6,Mr. BEDELL.," The gentleman be lieves  that  in most  of  our water  projects, indeed the users are paying  full cost of the water unless it is taken  up by other private industry in some  manner, including the interest cost on  the investment; is that correct?  ",1986
511,849,6,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Chairman, if the  gentleman will yield, I would say yes,  and there is an evolution in western  water projects in which, as in the Gar rison proposal, there is a  repayment  for what is called M&I waters, munici pal and industrial waters, which make  the project even more feasible.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, will the gentleman yield?  ",1986
512,849,6,Mr. BEDELL.," I yield to the gentle man from North Dakota.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman  yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, my understanding on  that point, incidentally, is that 85 per cent of the cost would be borne from  revenues that come from  the power  that is generated. I cited on the floor  the power  that  Iowa has  received,  about $324 million according  to  the  Army Corps of Engineers, from that  Garrison Dam that was built in North  Dakota yields benefits  to others  in cluding Iowa.  But I asked the gentleman to yield  for two particular purposes. One is to  see if the gentleman will acknowledge  that what the gentleman is proposing  for  this project will mean  that the  acres irrigated under this project will  be the only acres in America that will  be subject to  the kind of surcharge  that  the  gentleman  is  proposing.  Would that not be the case?  ",1986
513,849,6,Mr. BEDELL.," I  think that is very  likely. I think the question is whether  we should start to have some sense in  the policies we have or whether we  should continue with policies, what we  are going to do is we are going to sub sidize people  to grow crops and,  re gardless of how it is paid, the more  crops they grow, the more the Govern ment is going to have to pay out to  other farmers not to grow crops. So,  either way, it is going to increase the  cost to the Government.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, if the gentleman will yield  further, I understand that.  I believe then the answer is ""yes,""  that  the  irrigated  land  in North  Dakota will be the only land out of the  over 10 million acres of irrigated land  under  the reclamation projects  that  will be subject to this kind of a charge.  In fact, in this compromise itself, we  agree to a 10-percent surcharge, and  the 10-percent surcharge, which will  represent about $50 an acre, will be  the only surcharge borne by any of  the reclamation land that is irrigated  in  the United States. We agreed  to  that.  The difference between what we are  suggesting  is  not  a  difference  in  whether we should do something. The  difference is in magnitude.  The gentleman is suggesting some thing that I think, in my judgment, is  unreasonable. We  suggested  some thing that philosophically is  in tune  with what the gentleman is trying to  do, but  that we  think makes more  sense.  Mr. Chairman, if I might make one  more final point, I do not know wheth er the gentleman is aware of it, but at  the present  time on  those acres  in  North Dakota that are privately irri gated, about 90 percent of what  is  growing on those acres are not excess  or surplus crops.  In fact, most esti mates are that we are not going to be  putting this kind of land into the pro duction of wheat or corn. It is more  likely to be forage crops, alfalfa, dry  edible beans, and other things.  But it seems to me that the differ ence between 10 percent and 100 per cent is the difference between first un raveling a compromise that has been  very  delicately  woven,  and  then,  second,  is probably preventing some  very critical  flexibility  in  the short  term on a small marginal amount of  land by some irrigators.  But I understand what the gentle man is trying to do. Those of us who  sat around a table and hammered out  a very difficult compromise not only  understood what the gentleman was  trying to do, but put it in the compro mise with a 10-percent surcharge so  that it represents  the only  irrigated  acreage in America that will bear that  surcharge.  Mr. Chairman, I submit to the gen tleman and I submit to the rest of the  House that what we did was responsi ble and solves the same kind of prob lem the gentleman is trying to solve but does it in a way that retains a com promise that we think is very impor tant for our State and for this Con gress and for this Nation.  ",1986
514,849,6,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to give the gentleman more time.  Mr. Chairman, will  the minority  yield time if we need time to complete  our debate?  ",1986
515,849,6,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Chairman, we  will be happy  to yield 3  additional  minutes to the gentleman from Iowa.  ",1986
516,849,6,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Chairman,  I do  not want to take more time than need  be.  Mr. Chairman, let me read from the  previous  legislation, Public Law 89108  the 1965 Garrison authorization  le~lation. It included a section which  reads as follows, section 5. I read this  so we do not think this is something  new that is being done:  SEc. 5. For a period of ten years from the  date of enactment of  this Act, no water  from  the project authorized by  this Act  shall be delivered to any water user for the  production on newly irrigated lands of any  basic agricultural commodity, as defined in  the Agricultural Act of 1949, as any amend ment thereof,  if the total supply of such  commodity for the marketing year in which  the bulk of the crop would normally be mar keted is in excess of the normal supply as  defined in section 30Hb><lO> of the Agricul tural Adjustment Act     .  This was passed in 1965. This did not  just say that you have to pay the full  cost of water. This  says  that you  cannot even grow those crops on this  project.  So I think for the gentleman to say  this  is  something new  that we are  doing is a little unfair. But the issue is  pure and simple. The issue is that we  have had water policy  that said, go  ahead, we are going to go ahead and  subsidize farmers to grow crops that  are in surplus.  Some of us feel that that is wrong,  and I am one of those. If it is wrong,  then we have to correct it.  Mr. Chairman, it is too bad that the  gentleman is first as we come forth to  that position. But I do not think I  would be serving the taxpayers proper ly if I said that since we have already  been doing it, and since I fought this  before in a similar manner, that now I  am going  to stop  just because-the  truth of the matter is I am a very good  friend of the gentleman from North  Dakota, or I consider myself to be a  friend of the gentleman from North  Dakota. But I  think that if we have  bad policy, that policy should be cor rected, and we have to correct it when  we can.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, will the gentleman yield?  ",1986
517,849,6,Mr. BEDELL.," I yield to the gentle man.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, I understand what the g~n­ tleman is trying to do. All I am trymg  to suggest to the gentleman, and it is  very important, is that we did consider  exactly those arguments in the forging  of this compromise.  I think the gentleman will acknowl edge  that we attempted  to describe  these acres, as acres that will have a  surcharge  if those acres produce a  crop that is declared in excess or sur plus.  It  is  important  to understand  that they will represent the only acres  in America under  these Bureau of  Reclamation  irrigation projects  that  will have a  surcharge  imposed with  them.  I  think that the gentleman is sug gesting something  that will unravel  this compromise completely; and yet,  what we have done in the compromise,  I think, solves most of the gentleman's  problems, at  least  I  think  it could  solve most of the gentleman's prob lems.  ",1986
518,849,6,Mr. BEDELL., Does  the gentleman  think the 10 percent will be enough so  that  it will not be  economical  for  farmers to grow surplus crops?  ,1986

528,875,6,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, I read the fol lowing editorial  from  the Detroit News which  succinctly says  that evidence  indicates  that  there is no substitute for old fashioned parent ing and that ""somebody has to be crazy about  the kid"" as an antidote  for teenage suicide.  There is great common wisdom in that editori al, but even more important is the early con viction  by  young  people,  from  whatever  source, that no one has the right to take his  own  life and no one  is an  island to himself,  and  that  the people who are most hurt  in  teenage suicide are people who are most  caring,  affectionate, and  loving  toward  the  people who take their own  lives.  If a person  can see that his body, his life, and even his  mere existence are things that are disposable  without thought of others, this can be a trage dy not only to the person who takes his or her  life but to people who are indeed loving and  concerned and trying to the best of their abili ty to be good parents or friends. This sort of  knowledge needs to be deep in the heart of  all young people, and similarly, they must feel  the same about the partial suicides that are  occurring throughout the country by the taking  of dangerous drugs and addictions therefrom.  The article follows:  [From the Detroit News, Thursday, Mar. 13,  1986]  WHY ARE KIDS KILLING THEMSELVES?  Last month, Omaha was shocked by three  suicides in a single week involving apparent ly  well-adjusted  teen-agers  from  solid  homes. Exactly why they did so  is still a  mystery. Yet Omaha is merely the latest  city to experience what has become a two decade long, 140-percent spiral in the rate of  teen-age suicide. This sad trend suggests we  may need to rethink how we as a society  raise our children.  Some  of  that  rethinking  already  has  begun. In an important article in the winter  issue of Public Interest titled The Declining  Well-Being of American Adolescents, soci ologists Peter Uhlenberg and David Egge been of the University of North Carolina,  question the conventional wisdom that life  would improve for kids as their ""environ ment"" improved.  ""The 1960s and 1970s should have been a  golden era for the development of American  youth,"" they write. ""After all, indicators of  what mainstream  social  scienstists  and  policy-makers regard as the important de terminants of child welfare <smaller family  size,  rising parental education  levels, and  higher family income> were all going in the  'right' direction.  . . . However, comparison  of youth in 1980 with youth in 1960 reveals  that what 'should' have happended, did not  happen.  Indeed most  indicators of well being show a marked deterioration.""  White teen-agers aged 16 and 17, the most  advantaged group, saw their family poverty  rate reduced from 25 percent in 1960 to less  than 10 percent in 1980, for example, while  the number of children  in  large families  (four or more siblings) fell from 21  percent. The poverty rate for those with fa thers and mothers without high school eduto 14  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cations fell from about 60 percent to about  25 percent. Overall. the researchers found  that  the percentage of white  teen-agers  with none of these ""disadvantages"" soared  from 32 percent of their population group  to 63 percent.  They also  found  that the per-pupil ex penditures on public education had doubled,  after inflation was  taken into account, as  had  the percentage of  teachers with ad vanced degrees. Class size, meanwhile, had  actually fallen by nearly 18 percent.  Yet all  this ""good news"" produced only  ""bad news."" Standardized test scores fell by  about 10 percent. Juvenile delinquency rates  rose by 131 percent, and illegitimate birth  rates jumped 141 percent. Drug and alcohol  use exploded, and white teen-age violence  soared, with homicide up 232 percent and  suicide up 140 percent.  Messrs. Uhlenberg and Eggebeen argue  that we must now question the traditional  social science view that ""environment"" is at  the root of youth problems, a view they say  has ""diverted attention from what may be  the most critical determinant of all;  the  bond between child and parent.""  In this area, we have seen a disturbing  breakdown as evidenced by the 140-percent  rise  in divorce rates and the  increasingly  self-centered attitudes of parents. As Daniel  Yankelovich found  in a 1981 poll, ""nearly  two-thirds of all American parents reject  the idea that parents should stay together  for the children's sake."" A similar majority  feel  that ""parents should be free  to  live  their own lives even  if it means spending  less time with their children.""  IDtimately, the only solution to troubled  teen-agers may well lie in what Cornell psy chologist Urie Bronfenbrenner calls the ""es sential prerequisite"" for healthy human de velopment:  ""Somebody  has  to  be  crazy  about the kid. . . . "" Crazy enough to super vise and nourish his or her development,  and to demand higher standards.  We don't suggest that the clock can be  turned back, or that ""a woman's place is in  the home."" Teen  suicide  no  doubt has  deeper and more complex roots than we can  suggest here. But the evidence does indicate  there's no substitute for old-fashioned par enting. How we come to grips with that in  our modem,  two-wage-earner  economy,  should be a priority issue.  BEST WISHES, FRANK  YANKOVIC  HON. WILLIAM F. CUNGER, JR.

WISHFUL THINKING ON TEST  BAN MORATORIUM  HON.E.THOMASCOLE~  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 21, 1986  ",1986
530,875,6,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," Mr. Speaker, in  the next few days we will consider an amend ment by Congresswoman SCHROEDER  to the  urgent  supplemental  appropriations  which  would cut off all  funds  for the U.S. nuclear  testing program unless the President joins the  Soviet moratorium on nuclear  testing. For a  variety of very compelling reasons, I intend to  oppose this measure.  In this regard, I recommend to all of my col leagues the following op-ed piece, written by  our colleague, HENRY HYDE of Illinois, on the  United States past experience with a testing  moratorium-a moratorium which the Soviets  broke unilaterally in 1961.  There are many lessons to be learned from  this  experience.  I  believe  Congressman  HYDE's article is well worth reading on the eve  of our consideration of a nuclear testing mora torium amendment.  [From the Washington Times, Feb. 26,  1986]  WISHFUL TEST-BAN THINKING  <By Henry Hyde>  In the past year the banning of nuclear  tests has become the new darling of some of  my liberal colleagues in Congress.  Identified by the freeze movement as a  priority arms control issue in 1986, this in fatuation has resulted in a proliferation of  bills and resolutions in both the House and  Senate calling for everything from the im mediate negotiation of a Comprehensive  Test Ban Treaty <CTBT> to instant partici pation in a nuclear-testing moratorium with  the Soviet Union.  Perhaps  sensing  that arms control-an  issue jealously guarded by the Democratic  Party as ""its own""-was slipping through its  fingers and gradually becoming the proper ty of President Ronald Reagan, some Demo crats have been scrambling to devise a new  Democratic  arms  control  strategy. As  a  result, nuclear strategy and the Strategic  Defense  Initiative  have  emerged  as  the  major targets of the Democratic arms con trol arsenal.  The Democratic leadership in the House,  urged on by liberal activists, is once again  considering bringing legislation to the floor  of the House of Representatives that will  direct the president to begin immediate ne gotiations with the Soviet Union on a Com prehensive Test Ban Treaty.  In the quixotic hope that some of my lib eral colleagues may recall Sen. Henry Jack son's advice that in matters of national se",1986

532,914,6,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President,  the  reaction of both Americans and Euro peans toward one another since  the  raid on Libya has been of great con cern to many of us. Our alliance with  our  NATO  partners  in Western  Europe is vital to our security as well  as to theirs. There is no reason for the  bond  to weaken  now.  Indeed, we  should  be  strengthening  our  ties  rather than loosening them.  But some in the United States argue  that many European countries have  not cooperated fully with efforts  to  identify  and deport  terrorists. And  many Europeans counter that NATO  is set up for the purpose of defending  the Atlantic community against Soviet  aggression, not  to conduct activities  ""out of area.""  The time has obviously come for all  of us to sit down and iron out our dif ferences and reaffirm our close friend ship. In an excellent article in the New  York Times of April 20, 1986, Flora  Lewis outlines the problem and warns  of the consequences if the allies fail to  resolve their differences.  I ask unanimous consent that ""Time  to Agree,"" the column by Flora Lewis,  be inserted in the REcoRD.  There being no objection, the article  printed  in  the  was  ordered  to  be  RECORD, as follows:  TIME TO AGREE  <By Flora Lewis>  MILAN,  ITALY.-Sitting  in  the  T.W.A.  lounge at Kennedy Airport waiting for the  overnight flight to Italy induced a dull fa talism. Passengers watched the news in si lence while Dan Rather  told about  the  warnings, the fears,  the precautions being  taken by the U.S. Government.  When the newscast was over, one young  woman blurted out, ""If my livelihood didn't  depend on  it,  I wouldn't  take  this  trip.''  Later another said with a nervous giggle:  ""There's  always been  terrorism  in  Italy,  hasn't there? We'll keep a low profile, not  let on that we're Americans.""  The night before, skimming the intensity  of American reaction, television had shown  a schoolchild grinning, no doubt because of  the camera trained on him, and asking, ""Are  we going to have a nuclear war new because  Russia  is a part of Libya?"" And  then it  showed  a  parent,  an  earnest,  heavy-set  woman with short brown hair, saying grave ly,  ""The kids are worried,  really worried  that there's going to be a war.""  Then there was a psychiatrist in a white  smock, identified as a stress expert, explain ing that people with high blood pressure, or  ulcers, or bad backs, were likely to feel a lot  worse in this period because they'd be tight ening up under the tension and that would  aggravate their maladies.  I wondered what we were doing to our selves. One day Americans were puffed-up  supermen, proudly telling each other that  nobody can push them around. The next  day people were quivering, not at terrorism  but in self-induced terror,  to a degree 'no  Libyan leader could possibly achieve.  The flight was uneventful and the arrival  tiring but routine. The conference here is  about East-West relations, attended mostly  by Europeans from both sides but also a  number of  prominent Americans  and  a  couple of Soviet officials. The atmosphere is  cordial, as usual, but there is an undercur rent of serious disturbance among the West erners.  Italian Labor Minister Gianni de Michelis  noted unhappily that thousands of students  were demonstrating against the U.S. in the  middle of Milan, the first big anti-American  demonstration since the period of the Viet nam War. ""We're all against terrorism, cer tainly in Italy,"" he said, ""but bombing that  kills women and children . . . ""  Another Italian said that may be the ex pression of youth, but older people were get ting fed up and were wondering why this  country, which finally took very stern meas ures to defeat its own decade of terrorism,  hadn't been readier to cooperate in isolating  Libya. A senior German expert on interna tional affairs said he was personally embar rassed at the allied refusal to show more sol idarity with the United States.  There was clearly concern that the depth  of angry feeling on both sides would do seri ous damage to the alliance, far beyond what  Moscow,  let alone Tripoli, could possibly  have provoked. That is the real issue now,  much more important to the future of all in  the West than the random, occasional inci dents of terrorism. It is harder to dramatize,  but it is a far greater danger.  The  recriminations and  the analysis of  who should have done what at which step  have to be set aside. The spilt milk must be  cleaned up. The urgent need now  is  for  clear, public show of allied solidarity so that  the peoples of the West and the opposing  regimes can see that the dispute has been a  limited one about methods, not about pur pose and determination.  The deadline for action is probably the  Tokyo summit  in a  fortnight. Otherwise,  the wounds will fester and take a long time  to heal. It shouldn't really be so difficult for  the major Western states to agree on some  political  and  economic  sanctions  against  Libya  to  show  they can and do  take a  common stand.  If the measures go further than Europe ans might really wish and not quite so far as  Washington would like, that won't matter.  That is the meaning of friendship and ac commodation. The point  is  to show  that  there really is basic agreement.  The immediate problem is weak govern ments in Europe. France, is virtually para lyzed by its internal politics, and Germany's  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, normally indeci sive,  is  in  added  personal  trouble. The  French-German axis which underpins the  European Community probably isn't up to  an initiative. Britain's Margaret Thatcher is  out on a shaky limb. Italy and Spain are  talking about taking a  lead  together, but  they're afraid of seeming inconsequential.  Leaders must stop dithering. The passions  they have stirred can fracture the bulwark  of the West on which they all rely.  SOUTH AFRICA AND ETHIOPIA  ",1986
533,914,6,Mr. HECHT.," Mr.  President,  the  Monday, April 7, 1986 edition of the  Las Vegas Review-Journal contained  one  of  the most  interesting  and  thought-provoking  editorials on  the  situation in South Africa and Ethio pia. This excellent editorial was writ ten by Mr. Rafael Tammariello and I  ask unanimous consent that it be in cluded in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the edito rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Las Vegas Review, Apr. 7, 19861  SOUTH AFRICA'S BAD BUT ETHIOPIA'S WORSE  Officials at the University of California at  Berkeley last' week were calling it the most  violent confrontation since protests against  the Vietnam War erupted on campus in the  1960s and 70s.

534,953,6,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to join with my colleagues Sena tor MITCHELL, Senator PROXMIRE, and  Senator HUMPHREY in support of legis lation which would amend Public Law  97-425, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act  of 1982.  The act instructed the Department  of Energy to develop guidelines and an  agenda by which the Federal Govern ment would study, select, construct,  and operate a high level nuclear waste  repository that will safely hold radio active waste for 10,000 years or more.  Congress deliberated for 5 years on  this critical issue before passage of the  Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The law au thorized the Department of Energy to  build a first repository site in either  salt basalt or tuff medium with a ca pacity for holding up to 70,000 metric  tons of radioactive waste. While the  law  instructs DOE  to  recommend a  second repository to be located in crys talline rock, Congress did not author ize the construction of a second reposi tory site.  I  The bill  have cosponsored  today  would require DOE  to proceed with  the selection of one  repository site,  removes the 70,000-metric-ton cap on  the first repository sites storage capac ity, and prohibits DOE from consider ing a second unauthorized repository  site. In addition, the current law re quires  the Federal Government  to  take title to all commercial spent fuel  by 1998. If the DOE is unable to meet  the 1998 operational deadline for the  first repository site, all DOE activity  under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act  would stop until an independent scien tific commission reviewed available op tions for the safe permanent disposal  of high level waste.  In 1982 the Department of Energy  projected  that  the  accumulated  amount of spent fuel from commercial  nuclear  powerplants  would  total  146,000 metric tons by the year 2020.  DOE's latest estimate, included in the  December 1985 document, ""Spent Fuel  and Radioactive Waste  Inventories,  Proje~tions, and Characteristics,"" con cludes that the amount of commercial  spent  fuel would be 126,000 metric  tons by the year 2020. We can already  see a substantial reduction in the esti mated amount of nuclear waste to be  generated in the next 35 years.  I believe we will see  lower projec tions in the years to come for several  reasons. First, it seems highly unlikely  that new commercial nuclear power plants will be ordered in this century  due to their expense and the availabil ity of other energy resources. In 1985,  16 percent of electricity used in the  United States was generated by nucle ar powerplants. Second, utilities are  extending the use of their fuel rods,  thus producing  less spent fuel. Cur rent law limits the first repository's  storage capacity to 70,000 metric tons.  I believe technology can be developed  to safely store an increased capacity in  one repository with an increased ca pacity, while saving billions of tax dol lars.  The future will demonstrate no need  for construction of a second repository  site. However, while our waste projec tions are declining, DOE expense for  the repository program  is escalating  dramatically. The current projected  costs for developing two repositories is  approximately $26.7 billion, up 36 per cent from the July 1983, cost estimate  of $19.6 billion.  DOE's schedule for  the crystalline  project, the siting of a second reposi tory  in granite, would  cost  in  the  range of $500 million to $1 billion for  each of 5 sites DOE will characterize  in detail between the years 1991-95.  Before five sites are selected, DOE will  spend up to $1 million on each of the  12 sites DOE is considering as poten tial candidates. It is quite illogical for  billions of taxpayers' dollars to be in vested in the analysis of a second re pository site when current data demonstrates that one repository may be  sufficient to hold all of the Nation's  nuclear waste projected at this time.  Mr. Chairman, I have serious doubts  about DOE's interpretation and imple mentation  of  the  Nuclear Waste  Policy Act. I believe DOE has deprived  the State of New Hampshire of a  meaningful role in the siting process,  and has acted contrary to congression al intent as expressed in the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act. DOE's arbitrary de cision to choose 12 potentially accepta ble sites for a second repository site  when by its own analysis the top 9  sites are clearly superior to the next 3  is an abuse of the agency discretion.  We are all very aware that the act re quired that the Federal Government  consult with affected States during  the siting process. This requirement is  supported by a rich legislative history  which make it abundantly clear that  Congress intended that the opportuni ty for public and State participation in  the siting process must be meaningful,  not merely theoretical. Because DOE  has failed to properly consider many  important factors in evaluating the ac ceptability of a second repository site,  the agency has cast doubt on  the  credibility of the entire site selection  process.  The  only way DOE  can  restore  public confidence in this process is for  Congress to swiftly put a halt to the  waste of millions of  tax dollars  in  siting a second repository. We should  instruct DOE to focus its energy and  personnel  on  one  repository  site,  expand the capacity of that site, and  have an  independent scientific com mission evaluate DOE's implementa tion of the guidelines set forth under  the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  This  legislation  is not  intended  to  remove one State from the selection  process. It is to get the DOE program  back on track and within the intent of  Congress. We must be fiscally prudent  and careful to ensure the public's con fidence with DOE's repository pro gram. I believe it is in the best interest  of the American public to revisit this  issue  to ensure the safest and most  cost-effective disposal of our Nation's  high level radioactive waste.e  e ",1986

538,979,6,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to commend the distinguished gentle man from Mississippi [Mr. MoNTGOM ERY] a member of the Committee on  Armed Services, and  the gentleman  from Indiana [Mr. HILLIS].  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution and I ask that House Joint  Resolution 604, which I have  joined  with my colleagues-the distinguished  minority leader, the majority leader,  and the majority whip-in sponsoring,  may be considered today by this body.  The measure proposes to provide for  the appointment to the service acade mies of children of members of the  Armed Forces killed  in the military  action against Libya on April 15, 1986.  By enacting this legislation, the Con gress recognizes the dedicated profes sionalism of members of the Armed  Forces  in  recent military action  to  combat state-sponsored terrorism and  particularly  expresses  its  profound  gratitude for the brave service of Capt.  Fernando Ribas-Dominicci and Capt.  Paul F. Lorence of the U.S. Air Force,  who made  the supreme sacrifice for  their country in action against Libya  on Aprill5, 1986.  Captain Ribas-Dominicci,  the pilot,  was born in June of 1952 and was,  therefore, 33 years of age when he  died a hero's death in the air attack  against Libya. Captain Ribas-Domin icci was married  to Blanca and had  one son, Fernandito, who is 4¥2 years  old. Hailing from MayagUez, Puerto  Rico Captain Ribas-Dominicci was the  recipient of a bachelor's d~gree in ci~l  engineering and a master s degree. m  aero science. With over 1,800  flymg  hours Captain Ribas-Dominicci was  highly experienced in flying F-lU's.  Stationed at Lakenheith Royal Air  Force Air Base  in England  since  March of 1983, Captain Ribas-Domin icci  previously  was  stationed  at  Cannon Air  Force  Base  in New  Mexico.  Capt. Paul Lorence, the navigation  weapons system officer, was 31 years  of age when he died serving his coun try. Born in February of 1955, Captain  Lorence  received  his  navigational  training  in  California  after  being  awarded a bachelor's degree in history.  Married  to Diana, Captain Lorence  had one son, Peter, who was less than  a year old when his father died. Also  stationed at Lakenheith since August  1981, Captain Lorence had been flying  F-lll's for 4¥2 years. Participating in  the attack on Libya was his first oper ational duty assignment.  Mr. Speaker, these two officers died  serving their country last week, and all  of America  is proud of  their brave,  heroic  deed. With  their  families,  friends  and all  the people of  this  Nation: I bow in sorrow at their pass ing, but  I  am humbly grateful  for  their undying courage and the mag nificent patriotism with which  they  lived.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  expeditiously passing this measure on  behalf of these two brave men.  ",1986
539,979,6,Mr. HILLIS.," Mr. Speaker, the reso lution before us  today-cosponsored  by  the bipartisan  leadership of  the  House-fulfills  the  request made  to  the President by Mrs. Fernando Ribas Dominicci  the widow of the pilot of  the F-111' bomber lost in last week's  military action against Libya. When  President Reagan asked Mrs. Ribas Dominicci if he could do anything for  her, she asked only that her young  son, Fernando, be able to attend the  Air Force Academy. House Joint Reso lution 604 accomplishes that goal.  We are deeply thankful that all the  other  American  aircraft  returned  safely from this decisive and success ful strike against a nation whose prin cipal export is terrorism and death. I  join with my colleagues in ex~e_nding  sincere sympathy  to  the fanulles of  the  two  crewmembers who did not  return. The  resolution  before  the  House today is a small token to ex press the Nation's grati~ude for .t~ei~  sacrifice.  Captains  R1bas-Donumcc1  and Lorence-and all the members of  the Armed Forces who participated in  the Libyan raid-represent the profes sionalism  of  our Nation's Armed  Forces at its finest.

545,992,6,Mr. CONYERS.,"  I  thank my  col league, the gentleman from Pennsyl vania [Mr. GEKAS], the ranking minor ity member on the Subcommittee on  Criminal Justice, for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House unanimous ly passed H.R. 3511  last October to  amend  the bank bribery offense so  that it does not sweep within its ambit  otherwise  legitimate  conduct.  The  bank bribery offense presently makes  it a crime for a person  to offer or  accept anything of value ""for or in  connection with""  any  business  or  transaction of a financial institution.  This sweeping  language makes  it a  crime, for exampleFor a bank to pay interest on an em ployee's account <and for the employ ee to accept the interest>;  For a company to donate free space  to a credit union serving its employees;  and  For an employee of a financial insti tution  to accept a promotional ball point pen given away at a business or  trade show.  H.R. 3511 would narrow the present  offense by requiring proof that the of feror or recipient of the thing of value  acted corruptly and with an intent to  influence or reward, or  to be  influ enced or rewarded. This approach is  modeled upon 18 U.S.C. 201, which de fines the offense of bribery of a public  official.  The other both has agreed with this  approach and has returned the bill to  us with three numbered amendments.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania and  I  have  reviewed  these  amendments  carefully and have consulted with the  other body about them. The gentle man from Pennsylvania and  I have  drafted  a  proposal  that we believe  fairly and  responsibly addresses  the  concerns raised by the other body. It  is this proposal now being offered to  the House.  Our  proposal  accepts  the  other  body's amendment No. 1 without alter ation. That amendment makes a salu tary change in that part of the offense  making it a crime for a bank official  corruptly to solicit or accept anything  of value. As passed by this House, the  prosecution would have to show not  only that the solicitor or acceptor of  the thing of value acted corruptly, but  also  that the donor acted corruptly.  Amendment No. 1 of the other body  modifies this provision to focus solely  upon the solicitor or acceptor. Thus,  amendment No. 1 requires the pros ecution to show that the solicitor or  acceptor acted corruptly and with the  intent ""to be influenced or rewarded  in connection with any business or  transaction"" of the financial  institu tion. The language of this amendment  is also modeled upon 18 U.S.C. 201.  Our proposal also  accepts  amend ment No. 2 of the other body. That  amendment makes a technical change  necessary  in order  to  accommodate  the new  language added by amend ment No.3.  The other body's amendment No. 3  makes a substantive addition  to  the  bill, adding a  requirement  that  the  Justice Department, after consulting  with  the  Federal  bank  regulatory  agencies, ""establish a unified set of  guidelines  for  identifying  conduct  which is prohibited by this section.""  Moreover, ""compliance with the stand ards contained in such guidelines shall  be relevant but not dispositive in de termining whether a violation of this  section has occurred."" This  amend ment was prompted by a concern, in  the words of  its sponsor,  that ""al though the current bill is not so vague  as to raise a constitutional problem, it  would be more effective in deterring  undesirable conduct if it were coupled  with guidelines for identifying prohib ited  conduct.""  132  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD S-944 <daily ed. February 4,  <remarks  of  Senator METz 1986>  ENBAUM).  In my judgment-a judgment shared  by the author of amendment No. 3the provision as passed by the House  provides adequate notice of the pro hibited conduct. The public official  bribery  provision  upon which  the  House-passed version is modeled seems  to be working w~ without such guide lines, and I see no reason to treat bank  officials and people who deal with  bank officials differently from the way  we  treat public officials and people  who deal with public officials.  I  recognize, however,  that amend ment No. 3 represents a strongly-held  conviction that further clarification of  the offense is desirable. That concern  is well-intentioned and  I believe we  ought to accommodate  it. I propose,  therefore, to modify the other body's  amendment No. 3.  I believe that the modifications are  necessary in order to avoid an inter pretation that amendment No.3 seeks  to delegate legislative branch or judi cial branch power  to  an  executive  branch agency. The sponsor of amend ment No. 3 sought to reassure his col leagues on this point, but I am afraid  that the language of his amendment especially the phrase ""guidelines for  identifying conduct which is prohibit ed by this section"" -is susceptible of  such an  interpretation.  I have pro posed  language  that will avoid  this  problem but will still serve the notice  function desired by  the sponsor of  amendment No.  3. My proposal  re quires the Justice Department, after  consulting with the Federal bank reg ulatory agencies,  to  issue guidelines  ""that describe conduct that the De partment of  Justice will  prosecute  under this section."" These guidelines  must be made available to the public.  My proposal does not mandate that  the guidelines are  relevant  to every  bank bribery case, as does amendment  No.3. I believe amendment No.3 goes  too far in that regard. The guidelines  can only be relevant on the issue of  whether the defendant acted corrupt ly. This is a subjective element, and it  would violate due process to hold a de fendant accountable under a guideline  that the defendant was unaware of.  Since the provisions of the bank brib ery offense cover the activities of the  members of the general public, as well  as bank officials and employees,  it  would not be uncommon or unusual, it  seems to me, for a defendant to be un aware of the guidelines.  By not directly addressing the issue  in my proposal, however, I have not  made  the  guidelines  inadmissible.  Whether a guideline is admissible in a  given case will turn on the particular  ",1986

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of this legislation, H.R. 4420-a  bill to amend title 10, United States  Code  to revise the retirement system  for ~ew members of  the uniformed  services,  and  for other purposes.  I  compliment our distinguished chair man, Mr. AsPIN  and his  leadership  ability in bringing this measure to the  floor today. I find it a distinct privi lege to participate with my hard-work ing colleagues of the committee and  with such a truly professional staff, to  preserve the commitment we have to  our servicemen and women who have  honorably served this great country of  ours in the past, to those now serving,  and to those who will serve America in  the future.  Additionally, the chairman, commit tee, and staff are to be complimented  on the manner in which this matter of  unauthorized  appropriations  have  been resolved. I believe, in this time of  fiscal constraints and efforts to reduce  the  deficit,  that  this  bill  provides  those resources so necessary  to pre serve and improve both our deterrent  and defense capabilities, as well as the  infrastructure  necessary  to  support  these weapons systems and quality of  life for  those service personnel who  defend our free Nation.  We need not be  reminded, based  upon the events of this past week, that  we need to support our Armed Forces  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  8355  with the materiel and tangible bene fits that:  Provide the resources to project and  enforce our national policies through out the world; and  Provide those tangible benefits that  let our service personnel and  their  families know that we support them  and that we will truly provide for their  welfare.  Truly,  this bill provides  those  re sources needed to improve our deter rent and defense capabilities, as well  as to honor our commitment to those  who have served, are serving, and who  will serve by providing retirement ben efits which will encourage the reten tion of physically fit, true profession als who comprise our Armed Forces.

549,1005,6,Mr. BATEMAN.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Before delivering my remarks which  will be certainly less than 5 minutes, I  would  like  to commend  the distin guished gentleman from Indiana and  the ranking member of the Subcom mittee  on Military  Personnel  and  Compensation who by his choice will  be retiring at the end of this session of  Congress. We will certainly miss him.  He is one of the grand and dedicat ed, conscientious, and effective Mem bers of this body.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to echo  the comments made by the gentleman  from Alabama about the quality of the  people who are serving  in  the uni formed services of the United States  of America at this time.  The quality has never been higher,  and it is a credit to the Congresses  which provided  levels of compensa tion, quality of life benefits and retir~­ ment benefits which have made this  possible.  We  should be  extremely nervous  about changing  it  in any way  that  would denigrate the quality of those  people.  .  I have visited  them on  the flight  lines,  in  their  submarines,  in  their  tanks, and I  just could not be more  proud of  the quality of  those who  serve us.  With reference to this bill today, Mr.  Chairman, I rise in support but most  assuredly in reluctant support of the  measure. We are, when we face up to  it, legislating a reduction in retirement  benefits for those who serve from 20  to 30 years in the military service, a re duction at least in terms of what they  would now receive under present law.  Why then do I support this bill? I  support it because in our last session  we enacted legislation which in effect  says to the Department of Defense:  Unless you make suggestions of changes  in the retirement system which will reduce  appropriations to the retirement a~c.r;uai ac count, we are going to take $2.9 bllllon out  of the personnel account of the Department  of Defense. We have got to enact something  that you recommended to us or a modifica tion thereof before May 1, 1986.  thank the  Well, we are near that date, we must  act or otherwise some very draconian  things would have to happen to the  personnel account and literally thou sands  and  thousands  of  qualified  people  in  the  uniformed  services  would have to be released from serv ice.  We cannot permit that to happen.  This bill, when passed, will prevent it  from happening.  For that reason it is entitled to my  support and, I believe, the support of  the full membership of the House. I  do however, utter my regrets that it is ne~essary for us to reduce these retire ment benefits. I certainly hope that it  is going to be possible that this be im plemented in a way that is going to  give  the maximum  encouragement  within these financial parameters for  people remaining in our services for  longer than 20 years.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1986

But I will offer an amendment at the  proper  time which  should be very  soon. I would like  to briefly explain  this amendment and  say  that  this  amendment which I will offer today  has the total support of all the Re serve  forces  in  this  country. This  amendment would add for the Army  National Guard $100 million, for the  Army Reserve $100 million,  for  the  Naval Reserve $25 million,  for  the  Marine Reserve $10 million,  for  the  Air Force Reserve $10 million, and for  the Air National Guard $40 million,  which totals out to $285 million.  Yes, that is a lot of money, but we  get a lot from our Reserve forces and  National Guard.  Let me point out to my colleagues  that this amendment I will offer con tains no big-ticket items, no purchase  of big airplanes, tanks, or ships; items  like simulators for the Marine Corps  Reserve back at the armories, training  aids for the Army Reserve, modifica tion kits for the A-7's in the Air Guard  and Reserve  to make  these planes  safer for our reservists flying  them;  and devices to improve safety on our  equipment.  The money will not go, Mr. Chair man  just  to 1 or 2 States  in  this  ame~dment, but the money will go to  all 50 States. It is a good possibility  that some of the equipment purchased  under this amendment will end up in  the armory in your hometown or your  municipal airport where the Air Re serve units are located.  ",1986
552,1018,6,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," That is exact ly  right. Also  included  is money  to  which  the Air National Guard has  about 15 squadrons. The planes have a  lot of age on them now. They need  modifications. There is some money in  here just to improve them, make them  safer for these pilots to fly.  ",1986
553,1018,6,Mr. HILLIS.," As I understand,  too,  the gentleman was saying originally  there was about $840 million that was  appropriated  for  Reserve  accounts  that was unauthorized, to begin with.  Now, the other body authorizing com mittee has seen fit to authorize $488  million, but in the House here, in this  bill we are only  talking $40 million.  And  the gentleman's request  is  for  $285 million, which is still less than  what  the other  body's authorizing  committee has authorized. Is that cor rect?  ",1986
554,1018,6,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," I think it is a  fair and reasonable approach.  I am  concerned about the cost of our mili tary. I could have made it $840 mil lion. We did not. We made it $285 mil lion, and the Reserve units agreed to  that, the associations agreed to it.  We could have asked for the whole  $840 million that has been appropri ated, but it has not been authorized.  We would still have been legal and we  would not have added to the cost of  the appropriations on the military for  1986.  ",1986

558,1018,6,Mrs. HOLT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Mississippi.  Members of the House Armed Serv ices Committee have worked long and  hard over the years  to  improve  the  status of our Reserve components. We  have done so because  there  is  little  doubt that reliance on the Guard and  Reserve  is an excellent way  to save  taxpayer dollars. Substantial savings  result from such factors as the lower  cost of pay and the lower tempo of  training required in Reserve units.  While I feel significant improvement  in the readiness of these units is evi dent, I also feel that there is much  that needs  to be  accomplished.  In  order for  the Reserve  forces  to be  I appreciate  truly effective elements in the defense  of our country, they must be ready to  fight. In order to be ready to fight,  they must be properly equipped. This  is what the gentleman from Mississip pi's amendment is all about.  The authorization called for in the  amendment is not intended for expen for critically needed combat and sup port items such as radios, medical kits,  various type vehicles, and simulators.  Mr. Chairman, quoting in part from  the House Armed Services Committee  report on the 1985 DOD authorization  bill:  sive or ""nice to have"" equipment. It is  Given  the Nation's limited defense  re sources, tradeoffs can be made between re sources for active and Reserve forces in the  future. In order to make full use of these  tradeoffs, however, the performance and ca pability of the Reserves must be improved  to the greatest extent possible,       If we are to improve the perform ance and capability of  the Reserve  components, we must provide  them  with the equipment necessary to per form their missions. Mr. MoNTGOMERY  is attempting to do so by offering an  amendment which authorizes a por tion of the funds which have already  been appropriated for these forces.  I hope the membership will support  this amendment.  ",1986
559,1018,6,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, we have worked on  this issue of the amount of money to  be authorized and appropriated under  this bill for a long time, and it seems  to me that if we start making excep tions here and there, we are going to  end up with a  lot more exceptions  than we have rules. So I rise in reluc tant opposition to the gentleman from  Mississippi  [Mr. MONTGOMERY]  be cause he is a good friend, and a good  friend of the Guard and the Reserve,  and the Guard and the Reserve de serve some support.  I would like to point out to the mem bers of the committee that the Guard  and Reserve have gotten a lot of sup port in the fiscal year 1986 authoriza tion bill. In fact we approved $658 mil lion more  than  the  administration  asked for in 1986. So before we do any thing with this bill, we are already at  $658 million higher than the adminis tration's request in fiscal year 1986 for  the Guard and Reserve.  The  gentleman  from Mississippi  would like to add another $285 million,  which in fact puts us a billion dollars  over  the Reagan administration  re quest for the Guard and Reserve for  fiscal year 1986. I am not saying that  there are not things that you can find  to spend that kind of money on, but it  does seem  to me  that in a  time of  fiscal austerity everybody has got to  take part of  the  cuts. When  the  Gramm-Rudman provision took effect  in 1986, the Guard and Reserve lost  probably about $250 million through  It seems to me that that is not right,  the Gramm-Rudman cuts  for  1986.  What we are doing here in effect is  saying  that  the Guard and Reserve  should be exempt from the Gramm Rudman cuts. The gentleman  from  Mississippi is adding a little bit more  money back than the Gramm-Rudman  cut.  that if you are going to have Gramm Rudman cuts-and a lot of people who  voted  for  the Gramm-Rudman cuts  certainly  understood  what  those  Gramm-Rudman cuts were going  to  mean to every line item in the budget,  and that meant the Guard and Re serve  line  items  in  the budget-it  seems to me that we ought to not now  go back and restore  the money  for  those things that were being cut under  Gramm-Rudman.  ",1986

561,1018,6,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, let me  make just one more point, and then I  will yield  to  the gentlewoman from  Maryland [Mrs. HoLT].  Mr. Chairman,  there  is one  final  point: Nothing  in  this  recommenda tion of the gentleman from Mississippi  cannot be dealt with in 1987. The 1987  bill is now just before us. As soon as  we get a defense number from  the  Budget Committee  and we  get  a  number  that we  an mark  to,  the  Armed  Services  Committee  will  produce an authorization bill that is  consistent with that number.  There is not a single item in the list  of  the gentleman  from Mississippi  that is of such urgency that we have  to put  it  into  the 1986 bill. Every  single one of those items could be con sidered under the normal budget proc ess of 1987.  It seems to me for all of those rea sons that it would be a very bad idea  to pass the amendment of the gentle man from Mississippi.  ",1986

571,1031,6,Mr. COELHO.,"  I  thank the gentle man for yielding, and I appreciate also  the  gentleman  taking  this  special  order to give  those of us who agree  with his position an opportunity to ac knowledge what has occurred.  I think, as the gentleman has point ed out, it is time for the Turkish Gov ernment to come of age and to under stand that what happened in the Otto man Empire does not mean that they  have to be responsible for it; that they  ought to be like the West Germans of  today, understanding what happened  in prior governments. They regret it,  but they are open about it and, conse quently, there is no ill will toward the  current government in Germany.  The current government in Turkey  refuses to acknowledge, accept, under stand a fact of life and, consequently,  there is a lot of ill will toward the cur rent government of Turkey by many  people who would not normally have  this feeling and it is unfortunate that  that is the case.  I would hope that at some point the  Turkish Government would  accept  historical fact. I  think that one of the  concerns that I have is that, starting  in 1982,  the current administration,  the Reagan administration, joined in  with the efforts of the Turkish Gov ernment to try to change history. As  the gentleman in the well knows, they  were successful in getting the Depart ment of State records changed to show  that the massacre did not occur.  That was rectified to some extent,  but not corrected. We still have the  situation today where our government,  the current government, is the first in  many, many years that has failed to  recognize that the massacre did occur,  and as the Governor of California and  the gentleman in the well, both of Ar menian ancestry, pointed out, all you  have to do is talk to those who went  through it, talk to Government offi cials here  in the United States and  other countries who went through it,  to know that it was a fact of life, but  to sit back and try to deny it is a sham  and it is something that this Govern ment of the United States should not  stoop to that level and should not even  be  requested by  the Government of  Turkey to do it.  It is a time to sit back and to recog nize Martyrs' Day and  to  recognize  that this is now the 71st anniversary  of Martyrs' Day, and for the Armeni an-Americans all across  this country  and, of course, people of Armenian an cestry  all  across  the world,  they  should know that many of us in the  U.S. Government do  recognize  that  the massacre did occur and that we  will continue to recognize this day and  to continue to try to work on the U.S.  Government to change its policy.  Mr. Speaker, I rise along with my colleagues  today in observance of a day which is impor tant to each and every one of us-Armenian  Martyrs Day which  is celebrated on April 24.  This date marks the 71 st anniversary of the  beginning of the genocide of 1.5 million Arme nians by the Ottoman Empire.  It is not just a  tragedy which is to be commemorated only by  the Armenians, rather it is an opportunity for  us as mankind to reflect on our history and  contemplate our future. The killing of 1.5 mil lion Armenians was an  intentional act by the  Ottoman government to eliminate a Christian  minority within the vast confines of a Moslem  empire  just  as Hitler  sought  to  eliminate  Jewish men, women, and children in order to  ensure the purity of the Aryan race. Both were  efforts to create a homogenous society.  Both of  these  tragedies are examples of  man's inhumanity to man. But more important ly, they both provide us examples of what may  arise  in extreme  instances of man's  intoler ance of man-perhaps because either one  group's language, religion, or culture may be  foreign to anothers.  We  need  to  constantly be  reminded  of  these  incidents  to prevent  them  from being  committed again. As a modern society, we like  to consider ourselv-=s civilized, and yet  this  concept has not prevented leaders from trying  to eliminate whole races of people who did  not fit into their plans.  This year is perhaps more significant than  others  in our efforts  to  recognize and com memorate  the Armenian genocide. As  the  71 st  anniversary, we  commence with  the  eighth decade of observing  this  tragedy. As  the years pass,  fewer and  fewer Armenian  genocide survivors remain. But the memory of  this tragedy remains.  The genocide  itself is well-documented by  its survivors as well as U.S. Presidents, Mem bers of Congress, Senators, and high-ranking  diplomats from the early 1900's through 1923.  I feel that it is a disgrace that the Reagan ad ministration has sought  to  ignore  this docu mentation and has continued to argue that the  evidence in support of an effort on behalf of  the Ottoman Empire to kill off 1.5 million Ar menians  is vague. Why  in 1982-almost 70  years after the event-did the administration  choose to change official U.S. position on the  Armenian genocide?  I offer  that  it has a  matter of convenience.  It is easier to rewrite  history than it is to confront the past and deal  with  it appropriately in  terms of our relation ship with the modern Republic of Turkey.  Despite the desire of the Reagan adminis tration  to  ignore  this history,  I feel strongly  that it is very important for us to be reminded  of it. We must not forget the lessons of this  tragedy-not only for the Armenian survivors  and the Armenian people, but for ourselves as  members of this brotherhood we call mankind.  ",1986
572,1031,6,Mr. PASHAYAN.,"  I  appreciate  the  gentleman taking his time, and would  add to his remarks that it is,  indeed,  puzzling and unfortunate that the ad ministration has  taken  the position  that it has through the Department of  State  to oppose  the efforts of  this  body to state a simple historical truth,  and it is especially puzzling and unfor tunate because the President himself,  in several remarks, has acknowledged  the existence of the Armenian geno cide and, therefore, the position taken  by the administration and the Depart ment of State appears, as I say, espe cially puzzling and especially unfortu nate.  ",1986
573,1031,6,Mr. COELHO.,"  I  think we need to  make clear, as  the gentleman knows,  that  the President  in some of  the  meetings with  the  leadership  and  others, has indicated his opposition to  what we were trying to do here in the  House. So  it is not just the Depart ment of State and others. It comes  from the White House on down.  But today is a day to recognize what  actually did occur, and to celebrate on  this day. So I applaud the gentleman  for taking this special order.  ",1986
574,1031,6,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  on  this  solemn occasion, I join with my colleagues in  today's special order to remember the fate of  hundreds of thousands of innocent Armenians  who died 70 years ago. This  tragedy was,  indeed,  one  of  the most  ghastly  crimes  against humanity on record.  In 1915, the Ottomans began a 9-year cam paign of bloodletting and massacre which re sulted in the death of some 1.5 million Arme nians. The  term  ""Armenian genocide"" was  born of this epic tragedy. This year marks the  71 st anniversary of the beginning of that sad  event and it is important that we focus atten tion on this and other genocides of the 20th  century.  I believe  that this special order will  serve to reaffirm American resolve to work for  the prevention of massive human suffering.  Time after time, man has dispensed with his  essential compassion  for his fellow man and  replaced  it with a horribly destructive malice  that has shaken  the very foundations of our  civilization. By remembering these past lapses  that defy the imagination, we can hope to pre vent  these abuses against  innocent people  from happening again.  Let us all reflect today on the needless suf fering that has historically taken place in the  world and continue to do our part to raise the  specter of past atrocities in an effort to pre vent future tragedies.  ",1986
575,1031,6,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  stand proudly today, with my colleagues who  also share my deep commitment,  to honor  and  remember  the victims of  the Armenian  ",1986
576,1057,6,Mr. HOWARD.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  friend and a  colleague whom  I deeply ad mired, Congress lost a Member with unques tionable  integrity  and  dedication  and  this  Nation lost a great American.  JOE ADDABBO worked endlessly on behalf  of his Sixth District in New York during his 25  years  in  the House. But his district was not  the only one to benefit from his public service.  To every American who wanted a guarantee  that tax dollars were being spent wisely, JoE  ADDABBO was the one person we could count  on to scrutinize defense spending. To Ameri cans who pursued the dream of owning their  own small business, JOE ADDABBO was one  Member who played a key role in making that  dream become a reality. And  to Americans  grateful that no more young men died in the  jungles of Vietnam, JoE AoDABBO was one  person who deserved thanks because he was  the  first  to successfully sponsor an antiwar  resolution.  The quality I remember most about JOE Ao DABBO  is his courage. When he was  faced  with his painful illness never once did he ask  for sympathy. He carried on his duties with  dignity and of course, still possessing a big,  warm smile.  The void left by JOE's departure will be diffi cult to fill. However, his legacy will remain with  us. We are all richer because JOE ADDABBO  touched our lives.  ",1986
577,1057,6,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, JOE ADDABBO will  be missed not only by his  loved ones and  friends but also by the Congress of the United  States. JoE was a very effective representa tive of his people, and his impact was felt well  beyond the borders of his New York district.  Although  there were many who disagreed  with JoE on certain issues, especially defense  spending, I do not know of anyone who per sonally disliked JOE ADDABBO.  I came  to know Congressman ADDABBO  very early in my first year in Congress. It was  with fear and trepidation that I went to see the  distinguished chairman of Defense Appropria tions about a problem in my district. From the  first moment  I met JoE,  I felt completely at  ease. The warmth of his smile and his friendli ness helped me emerge from the meeting not  only with a commitment to help with my prob lem but also with a good feeling of having met  a true friend.  During the 7% years I had the privilege of  serving with JOE  in  the House,  there were  many times when I found it necessary to talk  over issues with JoE. I always found him to be  understanding, concerned and  responsive  to  my needs.  I know that other Members found  JOE  to be the same way with  them  in  their  problems.  JoE ADDABBO was  a  friend  to  everybody.  The funeral service at St. Patrick's Cathe dral in New York City, which many of us had  the privilege  to attend, beautifully expressed  the affection that thousands of people had for  this man. Yes, JoE was a great American who  served his country well. He will be greatly  missed.  I add my sincerest sympathies to his family  in  their loss. May God comfort them  in  their  bereavement.  ",1986
578,1057,6,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to join  my colleagues in paying tribute to JoE ADDAB80. JOE was a leader of the House in every  sense of the word, and he was a man of great  courage. We will truly miss him.  In  this institution, with  its committee struc ture,  there is enormous pressure on each of  us  to conform  to  the accepted attitudes of  those who have  the greatest  interest  in our  Specific committees. As chairman of the Ap propriations Subcommittee on Defense, JOE  was always under enormous pressure not just  to work  for a strong defense but to provide  the Defense Establishment-both the Penta gon and defense  industries-with everything  they asked  for, which was generally  far too  much in a time of $200 billion deficits.  JoE resisted that pressure. He fought for a  strong defense, but he opposed waste and he  opposed excess. He won as often as he lost,  and when he won, it was the American people  who were the true victors. He was a thought ful,  tenacious battler for his constituents and  for the broader public, and he did the same  for the House  in  its disputes with  the other  body. The House and the entire Nation owes  him a debt of gratitude for his work.  Of course, we cannot define JOE only by his  role as a Member of Congress. His life, and  particularly the latter years of his life, stand for  more  than  just  integrity and competence  in  Government. They stand for human courage,  the will to live, and the will to make one's life  meaningful to the end. We are all aware now  that JOE  struggled with cancer  for several  years.  It became obvious only recently. JOE  never wanted  to be  treated differently; he  never wanted sympathy. He wanted to contin ue to be effective and to make a significant  contribution. He succeeded  in  that. And  in  doing so, he was an example to all of us of  human courage and strength. We will never  forget his bravery.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the New York  delegation for taking the time for this special  order.  I also want to extend my sympathy to  JoE ADDABBO's  family.  I am proud  to have  known him, and I hope that their grief is eased  at  least a little bit by  the genuine emotions  being expressed by his colleagues today.  ",1986

It is necessary to have this legisla tion to achieve a more balanced repre sentation of  religious  faiths  among  Armed Forces chaplains. When we ask  our men and women to serve in the de fense of our country-they in truth  are serving in our stead. And, in that  service  they should have  the  ready  availability of  religious counsel and  guidance-and  the comfort which  it  brings-from a representative of their  own faith.  I think that this is the least we can  offer  these men and women  in  the  Armed  Forces-this  as  a  religious  nation, we owe them this much when  we are asking so much of them.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my col leagues to join me in supporting the  military chaplains bill, H.R. 1875. We  should all be working for its passage.  OUR TAX CODE IS UNDERWRIT ING  OIL  COMPANIES'  PRES ENCE IN LIBYA  <Mr. OBEY asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
599,1096,6,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, as Ameri cans saw on the evening news Monday  night, the administration has permit ted United States oil companies  to  resume business in Libya, despite the  President's proclamation of economic  boycott.  What Americans may not know  is  that present law entitles those compa nies to claim credits on their U.S. tax  returns for taxes they paid to Colonel  Qadhafi. Last month they paid $130  million to his outlaw regime.  Mr. Speaker,  I do not understand  the wisdom of allowing United States  firms  to  support with our  cash  a  Libyan Government dedicated to ter rorism.  I doubt very much that the  American people, if they knew, would  want to subsidize Qadhafi's terrorism,  yet that is what they are being forced  to do. The administration has allowed  five oil companies to continue to do  business with Libya for the moment.  The decision was made without public  debate to bring this situation out into  the open so that the public can par ticipate  in decisions  about whether  they want their Tax Code to continue  to underwrite oil companies' presence  in Libya.  I am today introducing legislation to  end United States  tax  credits  for  moneys paid by American oil compa nies to the Libyan Government. Any  of you wishing to join me in cospon sorship are welcome to do so.  LEGISLATIVE LEAKS  <Mr. BURTON of Indiana asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1986
600,1096,6,Mr.  BURTON  of  Indiana.," Mr.  Speaker, last Monday something unex cusable happened. Legislative leaders  from both Houses met with the Presi dent to be briefed on the Libyan raid  from 4 to 5:45 p.m. Apparently, some  legislative leaders from the other body  told  reporters  the President would  then address the Nation at 9 p.m. At  5:59, Sam Donaldson of ABC News  asked Larry Speakes of  the White  House for confirmation.  At 6:30, on ABC Nightly News, Don aldson quoted  the  legislative  leader  from  the other body as saying  the  President would address the Nation at  9 p.m. ABC News went on to describe  the United States military movements,  including F-lU's in Britain and the  KC-10 tankers which had been moved  to Britain and the aircraft carriers op erating off the coast of Sicily. In a few  minutes, ABC had outlined everything  a Libyan defense planner would need  to know about  a  probably  raid on  Libya.  This all occurred 30 minutes before  the raid  took place. This was really  risking American lives.  Members of Congress must learn to  keep their mouths shut, at least where  national security is concerned.  HOUSE RESOLUTION 431  <Mr. DURBIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
601,1096,6,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, yester day the House of Representatives by  unanimous consent passed House Res olution 427. The effect of House Reso lution 427 was to amend the rules of  the House and to increase the limit on  outside earned income for Members of  the House from 30 percent of their  salary to 40 percent.  In addition, while  it increased the  limit on honoraria income, it effective ly repealed the limit on other forms of  outside earned income.  This morning I filed with the Clerk  of the House, House Resolution 431,  which would have restored rule 47 to  exactly the same language that exist ed before  the House's action yesterday. It would have continued to limit  outside earned income to 30 percent of  a Member's salary and all other limita tions that were in existence yesterday.  There  is an orderly procedure for  changing the rules and Members' sala ries. Those of my colleagues who agree  with House Resolution 427, which I do  not, can approach the Rules Commit tee requesting the change contained in  House Resolution 427.  Unfortunately, this morning when I  made a unanimous-consent request to  consider my resolution, which would  have rescinded the action of the House  yesterday,  there was  an  objection  heard from the minority whip.  I do not believe this matter should  be considered by unanimous consent,  and I have taken the Speaker's advice  to take this matter to the Rules Com mittee later today. I am hoping we can  undo and rescind  the action of  the  House yesterday.  DEFICIT REDUCTION  INSURANCE PROGRAM-DRIP  <Mr.  JEFFORDS  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
602,1096,6,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker, today  is the day when the Gramm-Rudman  Deficit Reduction Act is being argued  in  the Supreme Court. Also  it  is 1  week after April 15, the date we were  supposed to have our budget before us.  Sadly, we did not.  When this body approved the Bal anced and Emergency Deficit Control  Act of 1985, it made a bold statement  about the fiscal mood both here and  throughout the Nation. The act  im poses some difficult cuts that will be  implemented automatically if we fail  to meet the designated deficit reduc tion targets we approved.  The  law did not spare cuts  in de fense  spending,  in  social  programs  dear to our constituents,  in congres sional offices themselves. What it did  spare was us, our own wallets and  pocketbooks.  Today I am introducing legislation  to correct that slight oversight. It is  called the Deficit Reduction Insurance  Program  [DRIP].  Its  budgetary  impact will be micro, but its incentive  will be macro to do our job; hopefully  more successfully for the budget than  the trickle-down theory.  Seriously, what my measure does is  simply  this. In the event we fail  to  make  the  budgetary  targets  in  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings,  then  our  own salaries will be cut equal to the  automatic across-the-board percentage  cuts that will require others to endure.  And  the measure will  require  the  salary cuts even if Congress fails to ap prove a sequestration order under the  fall-back procedures within the law.  ",1986
603,1109,6,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I  rise  in support of the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, first to all, I would  like  to  begin  by  commending  the  people who were responsible for nego tiating out the bill that is before us. It  is a very good bill, and I urge commen dation of this House for them finally  breaking a logjam which we have had  in this area for quite a while, and get ting it behind us.  Mr. Chairman,  the author of  the  amendment, our beloved friend from  Iowa, Mr. BEDELL, has decided to retire  at the end of this session, his amend ment will improve this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the gentleman's amendment.  I am aware that penalties for sur plus  commodity  production  are  al ready in the bill. However, I have my  doubts  that  the bill's penalties are  severe  enough  to  ensure  that  the  newly irrigated lands won't be used for  surplus crop production. There is no  reason  the  Federal  Government  should provide any irrigation subsidy  to farmers who use  these  lands for  producing surplus commodities.  Farm programs are costing the tax payers billions of dollars a year.  It  seems  to me  that we  should make  every effort to make sure that other  Government programs don't result in  increased production of commodities  that are already in surplus. This genIt  to  the gentle If a  Chairman,  I  for his state tleman's amendment gives us the op portunity to do just that.  The new farm bill established a huge  conservation reserve under which we  will pay farmers  to  take 40 million  acres out of production over the next 5  years,  in addition to the millions of  acres of annual set-asides under the  wheat and  feed grains program.  would be  ridiculous  for us  to  turn  around and pay irrigation subsidies to  farmers in North Dakota for bringing  new land into production of those sur plus crops.  farmer still wants to produce  these crops, let him pay the full costs  of production  as  farmers  in other  States do. Let's make sure we aren't  spending the taxpayers money to add  to the surplus with these newly irri gated lands when we're already spend ing their money to reduce it. I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment.  0 1205  ",1986
604,1109,6,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1986
605,1109,6,Mr. PETRI., I yield to my colleague  from Iowa.  ,1986
606,1109,6,Mr.  BEDELL.," Mr.  thank  the gentleman  ment.  I would like to point out just one or  two  things. First of all,  the House  clearly has spoken on  this  issue  in  1982 when we passed in the House a  provision with regard to water policy  that said you simply will not deliver  water for surplus crops. This is less on erous than that. And the only way we  are going to get it if that was knocked  out  is each  time come  through and  keep it in, since the House has already  spoken. This  is an effort to comply  with what the House has already said.  The biggest concern that this gentle man has goes way beyond the cost of  the subsidy for growing crops. It is  that it will cost us about $2 more in  additional subsidy to get other farm ers not to grow those crops that we are  paying farmers to grow.  ",1986
607,1109,6,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1986

609,1109,6,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Chairman, I re spect the gentleman's arguments, and  I understand that nobody in this body,  and would agree nobody in this body  wants to participate in a plan which  would simply have the Congress in the  position of stimulating vast acreages  of already surplus crops.  Mr. Chairman,  I would  ask my  friend to listen to the words of our col league from North Dakota, who point ed out that when you can put irriga tion into a community and you have a  community  in which  the only crops  available are surplus crops because it  is dry  land, you cannot  reasonably  expect the crops to come irrigation to  ",1986
610,1122,6,Mr. COBEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I join my  colleague and  friend, Mr. BROYHILL,  in  intro ducing  legislation  to  amend  the  Nuclear  Waste Policy Act of 1982. This bill would  remove the requirement of the second reposi tory for the disposal of high-level radioactive  waste and spent nuclear fuel. As you know,  the NWPA calls  for the  implementation of a  first repository with a 70,000-metric-ton limit in  which waste will be collected. The act also  designates a selection process to begin  the  search for the second repository site.  There has been adequate data to indicate  that  the need  for storage  facilities  for over  140,000 metric  tons  of high-level  nuclear  spent fuel is highly overestimated. This figure  assumes  that  the number of nuclear power plants would double-approximately 131-be tween now and  the year 2020, when  the  second repository would begin operation. Con struction  for new nuclear plants have not  been initiated in the last 1 0 years. Therefore, I  believe it would be quite accurate to state that  our needs for this type of storage would be far  less than the 140,000-ton capacity as provid ed for through the NWPA in 1982.  The Department of Energy has already ex pended a great deal of  time, money, and  effort on behalf of the second repository that  first of all, has not even been approved by  Congress, and second, but even more impor tantly, is not clearly needed. I strongly encour age my colleagues  to support  this measure  and eliminate continuation of the second re pository program.  ",1986
611,1122,6,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be  an original cosponsor of the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act Amendments which eliminates the  need for a second nuclear waste repository by  expanding  the capacity of  the  first. Such a  move addresses two of my biggest concerns  about the selection process Congress began  with  the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982:  safety and cost.  What we have seen, as the second site se lection process has progressed,  is a clear  need  to  amend  the original  law. Yet we  cannot deny the need to build a long-term nu clear waste storage facility.  There are several problems with  the sites  chosen for the second round. First, the sites  chosen for further field work shall be potential  safety hazards.  Serious  geological  questions  have  been  raised  regarding  the natural  fracturing and  faulting of the granite rock formations which  characterize  the sites. These natural  flaws  could result  in  the contamination of ground water  near  a  repository,  endangering  the  water supplies of many towns and villages.  Furthermore, all  of  the potential  second  round sites are only accessible by train routes  and  highways  that pass  through  or near  densely populated areas.  ",1986

617,1161,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator has that right.  ,1986
618,1161,6,Mr. DOMENICI.," I thank the Chair.  Let me continue that discussion.  Senators are wondering what will  happen after the vote on the pending  amendment. It is my hope that we can  get an amendment, where the Mem bers involved will agree to reduce the  time limit to less than the 2 hours al lowed. We would not take a full hour  in opposition-so that we might have  one additional vote before  time the leader has set. This proposal  might  clearly  change  the  leader's  plans for the remainder of the day.  I will conclude by saying as I have  for well over an hour, today that the  propose of this amendment is to help  us understand what the terminations  the President has proposed mean in  terms of fiscal policy, and the extent  to which they will move us toward the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings mandatory  target of $144 billion for 1987 and the  outyears. This amendment does, in my  opinion,  serve  a  useful  purpose.  I  repeat that I have been trying to get  those who have amendments and have  concrete ideas, either because they are  partially or totally in opposition to the  pending budget  resolution,  to offer  them, to come to the floor and suggest  them and seriously debate them.  the 3:30  ELIMINATE 44 FEDERAL PROGRAMS  ",1986
619,1161,6,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to oppose an amendment to the  Senate budget resolution which would  eliminate the 44 programs the Presi dent recommended for termination in  his budget proposal.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that a  list of  these programs  appear at this point in the REcoRD.  Let me mention just a  few of the  programs  slated  for  elimination by  this amendment. The General Reve nue Sharing Program would be elimi nated, despite the fact that this impor tant means of Federal-local coopera tion helps towns and cities in my State  of Vermont provide essential services  without raising already high property  taxes.  The Work Incentive Program [WIN]  would be canceled. Yet, WIN  is  the  only Federal program with the specific  charge of removing Americans  from  welfare rolls and placing them in jobs.  WIN has been especially important in  helping single parents on welfare find  employment and a means of support  for  their children. Not only  is WIN  well-intentioned; but it works and it  works  in Vermont, where our WIN  Program was rated first in the Nation.  Federal support for libraries would  also end as a  result of  this amend ment.  I  cannot  think of a  greater  threat to an enlightened America or  an  informed electorate  than ending  support for  libraries-very often the  center of knowledge and information  in rural communities.  Passage of  this amendment would  also mean the end of passenger rail  service in Vermont. Since 1979, I have  fought  to maintain and  strengthen  Amtrak's Montrealer service  to Ver mont. This amendment would not only  put an end to the Montrealer; it would  eliminate Federal support for Amtrak.  These are just a few examples of the  ill effects of the proposed amendment  eliminating 44 Federal programs.  But, what  is worse-what  is more  compelling-is the fact that canceling  these programs would only save $4 bil lion. There is no doubt that $4 billion  is a great deal of money, but there are  far more  sensible and  less painless  ways of raising those funds than cut ting important programs wholesale.  Earlier  this year,  the General Ac counting Office reported to me that  more than $7.5 billion could be saved  in the Pentagon budget simply by cor recting incorrect inflation assumptions  in major defense contracts. That is,  GAO found $7.5 billion in padding and  waste in defense contracts.  It is beyond me, how the administra tion could ask us to gut programs that  help people-that help people in Ver mont-to reduce the deficit by $4 bil lion, when almost twice that much can  be  saved by  teaching Pentagon ac countants to add.  For  this  reason, Mr. President,  I  urge my  colleagues  to  defeat  this  amendment soundly.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the  in  list  the  PROGRAMS To BE TERMINATED  Work incentive program <WIN).  General revenue sharing.  Conrail.

Advocacy of educa tion is not up to the Budget Commit tee. It is this body that has to speak to  the advocacy of education as a matter  of national priority.  That is what is at issue here, not the  Budget Committee, not the Secretary  of Education, but each individual Sen ator saying, yes, in the course of the  overall budget, education now deserves  an emphasis which has been lacking  over the past several years.

637,1174,6,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with Senators ANDREWs  and HOLLINGS in sponsoring this very  necessary amendment  to  the budget  resolution <S. Con. Res. 120).  Mr.  President,  I  am,  no  doubt,  viewed as one of the more fiscally con servative members  of  this  distin guished body. I do not apologize for  being  concerned  about  the Federal  deficit. We must work  together  to  ensure  that our  children  and our  grandchildren are not burdened with  our debts.  We must also provide our children  with a quality education. As a former  schoolteacher,  I  can assure my col leagues that a dollar spent wisely on  the education of our youth is an in valuable  investment  in our Nation's  future.  Mr. President, in my State the vast  majority of those who puruse a post secondary education rely upon Federal  financial aid. Without adequate funds  for  these important programs, many  students in South Dakota and across  the Nation will be denied access to a  college education or vocational train ing.  Additionally,  programs  which  serve to assist disadvantaged students  [TRIO]  and developing  institutions  will suffer  if we  fail  to adopt  this  amendment. Surely we cannot deny  our young people the opportunity to  realize their hopes and dreams for a  bright and promising future.  As my colleagues know, I have long  been an outspoken proponent of the  impact aid program. Our Nation's fed erally  impacted schools, particularly  those which are heavily impacted with  military dependents or Native Ameri can children, whose parents do not  contribute to the local tax base, can ill  afford any reductions in funds. Cer tainly the Federal Government has an  obligation  to  reimburse  local school  districts that are unable to generate  sufficient revenues due to Federal ac tivity.  Mr. President, there are a number of  other vital education programs which  are provided for through this amend ment, including Chapter 1 compensa tory education, chapter 2 ECIA [Edu cation Consolidation  and  Improve ment Act], vocational education, and  handicapped  education.  I  commend  the distinguished Senators from North  Dakota and South Carolina for devel oping this sensible and well-balanced  amendment. I urge our colleagues to  join in supporting the amendment.  ",1986
638,1174,6,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be an original cosponsor of  the Andrews amendment to  increase  education funding by $1.2 billion  in  fiscal year 1987. Our amendment re stores funding for the basic education  programs to current services-a freeze  on the fiscal year 1986 appropriation  plus inflation. This amendment would  insure  that services and aid  to stu dents would not be reduced from cur rent  levels,  recognizing  that Federal  education programs are essential  to  the collective educational needs of our  500  $30.8  1986  600,000  the 1985-86  nation's students and should,  there fore, be protected from further cuts.  Mr. President, in my view, Federal  education  programs  have  absorbed  their  fair  share of budget cuts  in  recent years. Between fiscal year 1980  and the fiscal year 1986 actual appro priation, all Federal spending grew by  65.9 percent. During this same period,  Federal  funding  for  all  elementary  and  secondary  education  programs  except vocational education, chapter I,  and education for the handicapped de clined in actual dollars.  Because  funding has not kept up  with  the  inflation,  approximately  fewer  students  are  being  served by chapter  I  in  school year than were being served in  1980-81. Between 1980-86, the Federal  share of education of the handicapped  fell from 12 to 7 percent, even though  the original Federal commitment was  to provide 40 percent of the funding  by 1980. Clearly, education has not  added  to  the  Federal  deficit  and  should be allowed to keep pace with  inflation.  The  Senate  Budget  Committee  Budget Resolution sets the function  funding  level  at  billion,  which  is  essentially  an  across-the board freeze on the fiscal year 1986  actual appropriation. The budget reso lution also contains a $100 million cut  in chapter II funding. Our amendment  would restore the funding for Federal  education programs at the fiscal year  current  services  appropriated  level. With current services  funding  maintained, States will be able to con tinue to serve those children who are  already participating in a Federal edu cation program. Current services fund ing for chapter I is particularly impor tant. Although the number of disad vantaged children has increased by 2.2  million since 1980, only 40 percent of  the eligible chapter I children are cur rently being served.  In increasing function 500 by $1.2  billion for education programs, we are  placing education  in a high priority  position. Our amendment can make  the difference between whether mil lions of Americans continue to have  access  to federally supported educa tion programs or whether they  lose  access to educational opportunity.  The strength of our Nation rests in  its people, and we cannot strengthen  the Nation without  investing  in the  human infrastructure. As we consider  this amendment, let us keep in mind  that  if the United States wants  to  maintain its position as the greatest  nation in the world, if we are to keep  pace with modern  industrial nations  like Japan, and West Germany, if we  are to keep pace with the Soviets, we  must make realistic expenditures on  our greatest capital asset, our most im portant domestic defense weapon-an  educated citizenry.

640,1200,6,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to take advantage of an opportunity  arranged  by my  colleague,  Congressman  KINDNESS,  to express my continuing support  and concern about  the courageous Jewish  community in the Soviet Union. I want to point  out that as the preeminent moral force in the  world today, the United States is obligated to  vocally  support Soviet Jews-a community  confronted by rampant anti-Semitism and sub jected to mass humiliation.  The fact that pressure has been successful ly brought to bear on the Soviets in an effort  to gain the freedom of Russian Jews, tells us  that the U.S.S.R. is not impervious to interna tional opinion.  It  is precisely for this reason  that we must not let up on our rhetorical, dip lomatic, and economic support at  this  time.  We can be certain that the Soviet authorities  would  love  to have our support die a quiet  death by effectively ignoring the issue. Howev er,  to do  this would be  to condemn Soviet  Jewry to a future of immobilizing despair and  would encourage the KGB  to continue com pletely undeterred in their objectives of cultur al genocide. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow  ",1986
641,1226,6,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, although much  has been said and written about the lack of in tergenerational communication in our society,  few will dispute the fact that a special relation ship exists between children and the elderly.  The students and staff of Canterbury Ele mentary School of Cleveland Heights, OH, lo cated  in my district, have made a special  effort to encourage and cultivate that relation ship by annually sponsoring a Senior Citizens  Day.  In  recognition  of  that  program,  the  school was  recently  awarded  a  ""Golden  Achievement Award"" by the National School  Public Relations Association.  Mr. Speaker, Canterbury School is complet ing  its  first  successful  year as a magnet  school with a special emphasis on communi cations skills. One of the goals of the school  is to increase communications with the com munity, of which senior adults are a very spe cial part. Because many seniors are  retired  and are longtime residents of the community,  the Canterbury students believed that seniors  would  welcome  contact with  the  school  beyond their yearly visit to vote. They decided  to invite not only the grandparents of Canter bury students to Senior Citizens Day, but ex tended the invitation to all senior adults of the  school area.  Through extensive planning and the partici pation  of  students,  teachers,  parents,  the  community liaison coordinator and public rela tions director, the word was spread through out the senior community through senior adult  groups,  local churches and  temples and  the  distribution of posters and flyers. Soon, Senior  Citizens Day had grown  to Senior Citizens  Month.  Mr. Speaker,  it was a smashing success.  Working  under  the  theme  ""Communicating  With  the Young at Heart,""  the Canterbury  family  honored  senior  citizens  during  the  entire month of November 1985. Some of the  activities included:  A senior adult who was a former television  show host gave a television production work shop with  fifth  grade  students  using  the  school's video equipment.  Several senior adults were invited to share  the art of storytelling with many classes.  A grandfather showed fourth grade students  the art of glass designs.  A senior adult who is a world traveler and  museum docent shared pictures and adven tures from his recent trip to Europe and Asia.  Kids on the Block, a touring puppet show,  presented a show on aging which heightened  student awareness of the capabilities and de sires of some senior adults.  Senior adults were  invited  to  join students  and  the Canterbury art  teacher  to work  to gether on projects.  Municipal Judge Jean Murrill Capers spoke  to an assembly of senior adults, students and  parents.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Mr. Speaker, as a result of Senior Citizens  Month, many senior adults have stayed on at  Canterbury School as permanent volunteers,  others  have  come  in  to  conduct  special  projects and still others have donated books  to the school library. The students have bene fited also, by gaining a better understanding of  the aging process, increasing their respect for  senior adults, and increasing sensitivity toward  our senior adult population.  On behalf of the residents of the 21st Dis trict of Ohio,  I wish to congratulate Principal  Katie Shorter, students,  teachers, staff and  parents of Canterbury Elementary School on  receipt of the National School Public Relations  Association 1986 Golden Achievement Award  and on its successful efforts to communicate  and interact with one of our community's most  valuable resources-our senior adults.  TORT LAW CRISIS  HON. DON RIITER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 23, 1986  Mr. AlTIER. Mr. Speaker, continuing in my  effort to bring pertinent information on the tort  law crisis to the attention of my colleagues, I  trust they will  find  this commentary from  the  December 1985 issue of Financier, written by  Robert D. Kilpatrick, chairman of the CIGNA  Corp., of interest.  SUPERFUND INSURANCE PROBLEMS SYMPTOM  OF FLAWS IN TORT SYSTEM  <By Robert D. Kilpatrick)  Superfund legislation, because of its ex traordinary extension of personal responsi bility  and  retroactivity,  is making  even  worse  the problems  the property-casualty  insurance industry already faces, Mr. Kilpa trick contends in this article written for Fin ancier, and is making insurance for environ mental  liability exceedingly difficult and  costly to obtain. The Chairman of CIGNA  puts the environmental difficulties  in the  larger context of the fundamental crisis in  the US tort system, which must be dealt  with as a matter of economic and financial  urgency.  Last month, newspapers across the US re ported that as many as 35 hazardous-waste  facilities might be forced to close because  they could not secure the liability insurance  they needed to remain open.  To insurers and their customers, the story  was not new, but a reiteration of many arti cles that have appeared over the past year  describing  the  plight  of  such  disparate  groups as municipalities, doctors, truckers,  day-care center managers, business involved  in high-risk enterprises, even the members  of corporate boards. Each one of these sto ries reported on the difficulties these groups  faced in finding liability insurance and, once  they did find it, the increased expense they  incurred to obtain it. Many of the stories  left the reader with an impression that the  insurance industry was the principal villain.  That simply is not true. Certainly, we are  responsible for making the decisions that a  particular  risk  is no  longer  insurable, or  that to take on the risk we must charge a  great deal more than we did when the policy  was originally written.  What is missing from the discussion is a  description of the root cause of the prob lem.  April23, 1986  It is not the major losses suffered by the  property-casualty  industry  during  the  recent  cyclical  downturn-although  they  were the worst in history.  It is not a new underwriting philosophy  that says we only accept business from cer tain kinds of clients.  SERIES OF DEBILITATING EVENTS  It is a recognition of a major and deeply  concerning change in our legal system that  has been developing over the past 20 to 30  years and now has triggered a series of de bilitating events affecting many businesses  and individuals.  Consider  the  following  facts  regarding  only one class of  insurance: Medical mal practice:  From  1974  through  1983,  the  average  medical malpractice  plantiff's award  in creased by more then 400%.  The  number  of medical  malpractice  awards higher  than $1 million  increased  from four in 1974 to 70 in 1983.  During the '70s there were two to three  medical malpractice suits filed for every 100  doctors; in 1983, there were 16 for every 100  doctors.  To help void malpractice suits, doctors  now order more tests than in the past, at an  additional cost estimated by the American  Medical Association to be as high as $40 bil lion a year.  Even a lawsuit defended successfully by a  doctor  involves  substantial  cost  to  the  doctor and his or her insurer.  One of the reasons for the continuing es calation in the number of court actions asso ciated with liability and personal injury in  this country is  the contingent-fee system.  This  arrangement  frequently  allows  a  lawyer to reap a  reward from bringing a  lawsuit that is completely disproportionate  to the reasonable value of his services.  Moreover,  there  is  little disincentive  to  filing  non-meritorious  claims. Under  the  legal system used  in most countries,  the  loser in a court battle has to pay all legal  costs for both sides. In the US, each side is  ordinarily  required  to pay  its own  legal  costs, regardless of the outcome.  STRETCHING THE ANCIENT RULE  The situation  in  this country has been  complicated by a series of court decisions  that have  interpreted  insurance contracts  far more broadly than the parties' original  intent and expectation, thus creating insur ance coverage where none had existed or  was expected when premiums were collect ed. Further,  in underlying  tort  litigation,  courts have severely stretched the ancient  common-law  rule  that  faults must  be  present before liability is assigned, and that  defendants should be liable only for dam ages that they actually caused.  Against this background, insurers increas ingly find themselves caught in a  juridical  twilight zone-a gray area in which the laws  of probability and the established contrac tural elements which make  it possible  to  insure risk have  lost  their substance and  meaning.  This unpredictability, coupled with  the  extraordinary financial awards being grant ed by courts and juries, has struck at the  very heart of the insurers industry's exist ence: Its ability to estimate the probabilities  and extent of loss, to spread the risk and to  define with some precision the nature and  type of risk against which  the  insurance  contract is written.  These concerns-the lack of predictability,  judicial expansion of insurance policies and  highly inflated jury awards-are compelling  ",1986

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 521  Whereas, the President and the Congress  of the United States support the continu ation of the program for peacetime registra tion for the Selective Service System; and  Whereas, in approving funds for such reg istration,  Congress  has  recognized  that  peacetime  registration contributes  to na tional readiness by reducing by up to two  months the time required for a full defense  mobilization; and  Whereas, the registration program is an  important  signal  to  our North Atlantic  Treaty Organization allies and to our poten tial adversaries of the seriousness of United  States defense commitments at home and  abroad; and  Whereas, over one million United States  citizens have sacrificed their lives in mili tary service to protect the rights and free doms of all Americans; and  Whereas,  the  registration  for Selective  Service is an integral part of current pre paredness to preserve these rights and free doms in the future; and  Whereas,  the Legislature of Mississippi  notes with pride that over 175,000 Mississip pians have  registered with  the Selective  Service System since resumption of registra tion and by so registering are contibuting to  the national defense prepardness of  the  United States:  Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate  of the State of Mississippi, the House of Rep resentatives concurring therein, That we do  hereby reaffirm our support of the Presi dent and Congress  for  the provision of  peacetime registration which has strength ened our national defense preparedness, sig naling to our allies as well as our adversaries  the seriousness of the United States defense  commitments at home and abroad, and we  commend the young men of this state and  nation who have recognized their obligation  to serve their country in time of need.  Be it further resolved, That a copy of this  resolution be sent to the President of the  United States and to the Mississippi Con gressional Delegation, and  that copies be  made available to the press.  NORTH CAROLINA STUDENT  LEGISLATURE  ",1986
644,1252,6,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, there is  a  group of young people  in North  Carolina who have just observed their  50th birthday-and if that seems to be  a contradiction, let me explain: I refer  to the North Carolina Student Legisla ture which is the oldest such entity in  the Nation.  I am very proud of the young people  who  today are participating  in  this  very constructive and practical study  of how the legislative branch of their  State government functions. There are  more than 250 of them involved this  year. They come from more than 20 of  North Carolina's colleges and universi ties.  Mr. President, I am told that more  than 5,000 young people have partici pated in the activities of the North  Carolina Student Legislature during  the past half century. Some of them  later became leaders of my State; all  of them have gained a better under standing of how  their State govern ment works. They have learned parlia mentary procedure. They have learned  how the legislative process functions  in a democratic society.  Small wonder that the Student Leg islature  is so highly  regarded. Each  year,  the governor of  this  student  group presents to the North Carolina  General Assembly a compendium of  legislation  enacted by  the Student  Legislature. Copies of this document  are delivered  to the Speaker of the  House  and  the  President  of  the  Senate. Not surprisingly, members of  the general assembly take careful note  of  the actions  taken by  the young  people,  because nearly half of  the  members of the general assembly were  once members of the Student Legisla ture.  The Student Legislature has an im pressive  track record. Nearly 40 per cent of the legislation enacted by the  young people has found its way to en actment  by  the  general  assembly,  thereby becoming laws of the State of  North Carolina. In the process, many  student legislators have been consult ed by their elders. Many others have  testified before committees of the gen eral assembly.  Mr. President, it is interesting that  numerous alumni of the Student Leg islature have gone on to serve in the  Federal  and/ or State  governments.  For  example,  U.S.  Attorney  Sam  Currin served years ago in the Student  Legislature. Two  former mayors of  Charlotte got their start in the Stu dent  Legislature-Ken  Harris  and  Eddie Knox. Eddie Knox later served  ",1986

652,1278,6,Mr. MOYNIHAN., Will the Senator  yield for a question?  ,1986
653,1278,6,Mr. JOHNSTON., I certainly will.  ,1986
654,1278,6,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," We earlier heard  the Senator from Tennessee speak of  this as a tax shifting measure, if we go  ahead as indicated by the budget reso lution; in other words, that local gov ernments will have to raise the taxes  they loss to replace the revenue.  The Senator is saying in the city of  New Orleans there is no capacity to  raise  the  taxes; you simply cut the  services. They have closed the libraries  and they may close  the fire depart ments as well.  Mr . .JOHNSTON. The Senator is ex actly correct. To say to New Orleans,  ""Go raise your taxes,""  is very much  like saying, ""Let them eat cake."" The  sales tax in New Orleans is already 9  percent, one of the highest rates in  the country. If it is raised any higher,  then it will discourage tourism, which  is the last bit of business we have. You  cannot raise revenues effectively from  an income tax increase in New Orle ans. People commute from  the sub urbs. Such a tax would have to be au thorized by the State legislature. They  would not do that any more for New  Orleans than you would do it in Wash ington, DC. It would be vetoed.  Mr. President, we  have very  few  places to turn. Washington is one of  those few. Do you know what we get  when we turn to Washington? We get  the Reagan budget. If you look at the  Reagan budget superimposed on the  difficulty we now have, we in Louisi ana will lose 9,000 guaranteed student  loans, almost 5,000 Pell grants, almost  2,600 State student initiative grants;  and we would have lost 750 jobs in the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program  had  the Reagan budget ""rescission""  gone forward. Thankfully, we reversed  that. We would also,  in the Reagan  budget, lose 2,820  jobs on Red River  and 290 jobs in the Cooperative Extension Service. In historic preservation,  we would lose 4,000 jobs; for dislocated  worker assistance, so-called T AA,  in  Shreveport, alone, 3,000 workers who  have lost their jobs would not get ben efits; 125,000 kids would be removed  from the school lunch program; and  from the summer feeding program, we  would lose 40,000 kids.  Mr. President, we in Louisiana need  help. We do not need in the kind of  budget  President Reagan  proposes  that takes away the remainder of Lou isiana economic lifeline and allows us  to go into economic ruin.  The PRESIDING OFFICER  (Mr.  GoRTON). The  time of  the Senator  from Louisiana has expired.  ",1986

658,1278,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Two  minutes.  ,1986
659,1278,6,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, the  distinguished chairman of the commit tee has risen.  ",1986
660,1278,6,Mr. DOMENICI.," I thank the senior  Senator from New York.  Mr.  President,  clearly  I want  to  permit the senior Senator from Wash ington, who  currently occupies  the  Chair, who was here in my stead for  most of  this debate,  to discuss  the  matter with the Senate for as long as  he needs. I understand we have about  60 minutes remaining.  I do want to  comment. I yield myself as much time  as I use off the amendment itself.  In my absence, I understand the dis tinguished junior Senator from Louisi ana  [Mr.  JoHNSTON]  discussed my  statement earlier  this morning with  reference to a CBO study on the eco nomic effects of various energy taxes  and the combination of a 6-cent gaso line  tax and a $2.50-a-barrel  import  fee. He discussed that in morning busi ness, I am told, but nonetheless I want  to  thank him for  the comments he  made.  Once  again,  with  an  additional  number of Senators on the floor and  obviously others who are not interest ed in the debate,  I do commend  to  them the CBO report which I under stand will  be  delivered  sometime  today. It will be on every desk in the  Senate, and it will be available for the  offices, for the press, and for various  committees.  <Mr. GRAMM assumed the chair.)  ",1986
661,1278,6,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  want  to  repeat  two points.  I make  these also  for my good  friend,  the  junior Senator from Texas, who occu pies the Chair.  I believe,  regardless of where one  stands on any kind of energy  taxes,  there are  two very, very  important  findings which, if they are not refuted,  are  rather dramatic  for  the United  States.  As we all know, one of those findings  assumed oil would get down to $13 a  barrel. In many instances, it is already  there. They assumed that the depend ency of the United States on imported  oil will rise from 30 percent today to  50 percent by 1991. I think that is a  very,  very  important  issue  for our  country. For all of us who were con cerned  in the early 1970's when we  had a boycott of less than a million  barrels a day at a time when our de pendence was  less  than 50 percent  clearly they should be very signficant ly  concerned  about  a  situation  in  which our vunerability is much great er.  There is another fact that is very  startling, and that is that 500,000 bar rels a day by way of stripper produc tion will be lost at current price levels.  I think their assumption is right. They  have, obviously,  talked  to people  in  ""Oilpatch."" Most of wells will be lost  forever. That is also a very important  fact.  The CBO also concludes that if you  mix a revenue raiser between a $2.50  import fee and a 6-cent gasoline tax,  you have equalized disparity in bur dens among regions that arises with a  straight import fee.  In addition, the CBO concludes in terestingly enough, that one-third of  the import tax would not be borne by  Americans at all; that in its final mix  it will be borne by the foreigners who  supply us with oil.  The import tax I have just described  would yield $10 billion  in  the  first  year, $11 and $12 billion in the next 2  years  respectively. And  I  only use  those numbers because quite by coinci dence they match up very well with  some of the assumptions we make in  our budget  resolution of ways and  means to arrive at a revenue change.  Finally  CBO  concludes  the  tax  would have  little or no discernible  effect on the American economy, and  that is an interesting conclusion. Obvi ously, as I indicated this morning, that  would be debated by a number of  people. But I also was intrigued with  their  analysis.  Perhaps  everybody  knew this; I did not. Their approach to  this tax change which yields no signif icant economic change is an extrapola tion of the current practice. When the  Finance Committee talks about, let us  say, a new excise  tax of $10 billion,  they use the same contention which is  called a static evaluation. This also ap plies  to other new  taxes  and  tax  reform. It would appear to me-l have  said  it different ways  before-that  what is good for the goose is good for  the gander. For those who think that  some revenues in this budget resolu tion of  the  type  just discussed will  have this significant negative impact  on  the economy,  I  suggest  that we  assess all taxes in a similar way they  are going  to budget reduction on to  ",1986
662,1291,6,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I strongly  support general revenue sharing and I  am pleased to  join my colleagues  in  sponsoring  this  amendment, which  seeks to continue full funding for gen eral  revenue sharing  through  fiscal  year 1989.  The general  revenue sharing Pro gram provides assistance to America's  39,000 general purpose  local govern ment units. This program has enjoyed  strong bipartisan support. It was pro posed by a Republican President and  enacted by a Democratic Congress in  1972. Three times-in 1976, 1980, and  1983-this program has been extended  and amended with strong bipartisan  support. And  through such actions,  the program has been fine tuned and  has become more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  local  governments. Funds  have  been  increasingly  targeted  to  local units of government. States have  been provided greater flexibility in de veloping formulas for allocating funds  to local governments. And provisions  have been  included which  recognize  the special needs of  those  localities  with severe economic dislocation.  Last year, when confronted with the  President's fiscal year 1986 budget rec ommendation that the program be ter minated,  the 99th Congress  instead  chose to reaffirm its commitment to  this program by appropriating $4.185  billion for fiscal year 1986.  But despite general  revenue shar ing's history of deep bipartisan sup port, the President's fiscal year 1987  budget once again proposed to strike a  death knell for the program: It sought  to terminate the program upon expira tion of  its authorization  in 1986.  also requested a rescission of $760 mil lion of the program's fiscal year 1986  post-Gramm-Rudman appropriation.  The budget  resolution now before  us, proposes a solution but it is only a  halfway measure. It would accommo date reauthorization of the program  for 1 year and fiscal year 1987 funding  of $1.8 billion. But I am convinced  that the predicaments of many of our  local governments dictate that this is  It  not enough.  I  believe we need  full  funding of general revenue sharing.  Mr.  President,  throughout  this  Nation, millions  of Americans  and  thousands of local communities are in  serious economic trouble. Their needs  are genuine and highly visible. Al ready, 16 States have enacted cuts in  their fiscal year 1986 budgets and 7  States have deferred fiscal year 1986  expenditures to later years.  Where are  these communities and  who are these people? They are locat ed  throughout  those  States with  economies that are highly dependent  on the gas and oil industries and coal  and  steel. They  are  found  in  the  bayous of Louisiana, and the fields of  east Texas and Oklahoma;  they are  cities  and  townships  and  villages  throughout the States of Alaska and  Colorado. And the farm belt is full of  distressed communities populated by  farmers  facing  unmanageable  debts  and unemployed farm workers.  And there are other types of commu nities and people who are in deep eco nomic trouble, but whose needs are in creasingly ignored by this administra tion. These are the States and commu nities and families who have failed to  reap the economic fruits of the nation al economic  recovery of  the past 3  years. They are the victims of deep  economic dislocations associated with  industrial and  technological change.  They are ex-employees of a  town's  closed  factories. They are  the  long term unemployed. They are the never employed young men and women.  I  know  these  communities  and  people, because my State of West Vir ginia contains many of  them. West  Virginia has an unemployment rate of  over 13 percent-that is almost twice  the national rate.  In fiscal year 1985, West Virginia re ceived $44.9 million in general revenue  sharing  funds. Under  the proposal  made by the Senate Budget Commit tee, West Virginia's fiscal year 1987  funding would be reduced to an esti mated $18 million. This represents a  cut of nearly 60 percent. Most other  States will experience even higher per centage cuts.  Due  to  the State's economic  West Virginia counties and municipali ties would be dramatically affected by  such  a  funding  cut. The  ""Federal  funds information for States"" service,  reports that in West Virginia during  fiscal year 1984, general revenue shar ing funds constituted 7 percent of the  expenditures of counties and 5.5 per cent of the expenditures of municipali ties. Indeed, in some smaller West Vir ginia counties, general revenue shar ing represents nearly 30 percent of ex penditures.  West Virginia is not alone in its need  for general revenue sharing. There are  many other States where fiscal year  1984 general revenue sharing funding  represented more  than 5 percent of  ills,  county, municipal, or  township  ex penditures. Among such States are Ar kansas, Delaware,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri,  Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota,  Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah,  and Vermont. I might add that 10 of  these States  along with  22  others  project  fiscal year 1986 budget bal ances equal to less than 3 percent of  their expenditures.  A drastic reduction in funding for  revenue sharing will create economic  hardships  for  many  communities  across the Nation, compounding an al ready  serious  fiscal  situation. Mr.  President, I hope the Senate will act  to help our  local governments  that  form the foundation of this country.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I  rise to speak b opposition to the Moy nihan amendment as a Senator who  has seen first hand the good work rep resented by general revenue sharing  funds. While  judge/executive of Jef ferson County, KY, as much as $9 mil lion  or  10  percent  of  the  county  budget was funded by revenue sharing.  My colleagues have spoken eloquently  today about how that money is used  around the country. And I am pleased  to report that the funds have always  been allocated for beneficial initiatives  in Jefferson County as well. Revenue sharing funds have contributed to the  maintenance of roads,  the construc tion  of  drainage  projects,  and  for  police  and  fire protection-all good  and worthy efforts.  But, Mr. President,  today's debate  should have very  little  to do with  whether or not the money  is being  well spent-it is, and no one disputes  that point. The issue we should be dis cussing is whether or not the Federal  Government  should  foot  the bill whether or not a government that is  $2  trillion in debt, with $200 billion  being added annually, can or should be  asked  to pay  for  local  services. Or  whether, as the Moynihan amendment  requires, we should ask our constitu ents to pay higher taxes-to send a  greater portion of  their  income  to  Washington.  Mr. President, I cannot support the  Moynihan amendment because  I do  not believe that Kentuckians want the  Federal Government  to  raise  their  taxes yet another time to pay for a  program  that  is  most  efficiently  funded at the local level. That is not  to say that there is not a great deal of  talk about a  tax increase on Capitol  Hill. Not only is there talk, but the dis cussion  invariably  turns  to  excise  taxes. I have raised objections to these  regressive  taxes-which  hurt Ken tucky disproportionally-in  the con text of tax reform and I will continue  to do so in the context of our budget  debate. The reality is that any vote  which adds spending to the budget by  an arbitrary  tax  increase,  increases  ",1986
663,1304,6,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield?  ",1986
664,1304,6,Mr. BUMPERS., I yield.  ,1986
665,1304,6,Mr. DOMENICI., There was  one  other major difference. That amend ment added $200 million in new taxes.  ,1986
666,1304,6,Mr. BUMPERS.," I understood that,  and that is the reason I did not do  that.  ",1986
667,1304,6,Mr. DOMENICI.," The other amend ment says to the appropriators, there  is $200 million more  to spend. The  Senator does not say that. The Sena tor says, ""I do not want to spend more  money. I am asking that you take it  out of foreign affairs for the purpose  of this first go-round and put it in the  health care program."" I think the ap propriators will make the decision, es pecially when the amount is small.  ",1986
668,1304,6,Mr. BUMPERS.," The Senator is cor rect.  I did not want to ask the Finance  Committee  to raise  taxes  to finance  this amendment, so  I went  through  the budget, and I looked every place I  could  to see what kind of offset  I  thought would be appropriate to fund  $25 million.  However, before I get into that, let  me also say that all we can ever do  here on an amendment is simply send  word  to  the  appropriators.  If the  Senate speaks  loud and clearly  this  afternoon that we believe funding the  immunization program at $56 million  or $57 million  is not going  to be  enough in 1987, then we are saying to  the appropriators, ""When you get into  funding discretionary health care pro grams, we want to make sure that you  put in $81 million for the immuniza tion program? We are saying that $56  million is not going to be enough next  year.  If we do not do anything-if I pull  my amendment down or if we insert  some  language  in  the RECORD-the  chances are that it will be influential  enough  to get the  job done. But it  seems  to me  that everybody under stands the meritorious nature of this  amendment, and we ought to accept  the amendment, so that the appropri ators will have a message that they  understand clearly. They will know  the Senate has spoken on this issue.  That is all we do in any amendment  when we debate the budget. Nobody  has any assurance here that because  an  amendment  is  adopted,  that  is  going to be the way it winds up in ap propriations.  Mr. President, when I first started  debating this amendment, the Senator  from Colorado was sitting in the man ager's seat on the majority side. He  made the point that there was about  $37.9 billion  in  the Domenici-Chiles  budget for function 550; and the implication was, ""What on Earth  is  the  -portant to our national security than  our good health and the health of our  children.  So I have not asked for a  tax in crease. I have simply asked for a shift ing of priorities to make sure that this  program which has the highest bene fit to cost ratio of anything we ever  vote on is not underfunded.  Mr. President, I am going to ask for  a  quorum  call  unless  the Senator  wishes to speak.  I suggest the absence of a quorum,  Mr. President.  I withdraw that request.  I ask unanimous consent that Sena tor ExoN of Nebraska be added as a  cosponsor of this amendment.  ",1986
669,1304,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1986
670,1304,6,Mr. BUMPERS.," Now, Mr. President,  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",1986
671,1304,6,Mr. LUGAR., Will the Senator from  Arkansas withhold?  ,1986

675,1304,6,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, let me  mention  again  that  earlier  in  the  debate I made the point that South  Korea is not asking for concessional  assistance. South Korea is prepared to  borrow at market rates, which means  they would pay back  their loans at  rates equal  to what  it costs us  to  borrow  them.  I  appreciate  that the  Senator from Arkansas would be dis mayed  if the South Koreans were  asking for concessional assistance. But  they are not now, and they have not  been doing so. As a point of fact  I  want to reiterate that point again.  Mr.  President,  the  distinguinhed  Senator from Arkansas has described  this amendment as one that does not  start a roll of amendments attempting  to hit foreign aid. He has suggested  that he has aimed at the 150 account  instead of raising taxes.  Let me just say, Mr. President, what ever may be the problems in the 550  account,  I have been describing  the  150 account in which the Budget Com mittee has taken a hard look at our  military  securit~ problems,  the de fense of our country, and has made  some very tough judgments in this 150  account.  Let me point out once again for the  record  that  the President  of  the  United States and  the Secretary of  State have both commented on  the  needs of our country in terms of our  defense  in working with  front-line  countries. They have suggested securi ty assistance of $11.5 billion this year.  That  is  their  request. The Budget  Committee has reduced this to $9 bil lion, a $2.5 billion  reduction, and  I  have already pointed out that the vast  ",1986

677,1317,6,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection? Without objection, it  is so ordered.  KURT WALDHEIM  ",1986
678,1317,6,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, I rise to  address the matter of Kurt Waldheim.  Last night marked the beginning of  the Jewish festival of Passover. Our  Jewish colleagues, friends, and fellow  citizens gathered  in  their homes at  their tables, in the peace and freedom  of our beloved America, to participate  in  the  first of  two  ritual Passover  meals.  These meals-memorializing  ceremonies which once took place in  the high  temple  in Jerusalem-cele brate two great events in history: The  deliverance of the Jews from bondage  and the threat of extermination; and  the definitive appearance of the one  God before a multitude of ordinary  humanity-of whom He  intended  to  create a nation that would bear his  mark and hold his covenant. It is, ar guably, a seminal religious event, since  we may  trace from  it not only  the  lines that run to present day Judaism  but to the worlds of Christianity and  of Islam.  All those partaking of the Passover  Seder  are  deeply  aware  that  the  exodus  from Egypt was merely  the  first in a series of miraculous escapes  from certain doom,  across  the mil lenna and  right down  to our own  times, within  the memory  of  the  living. Indeed, it is our own epoch-the  epoch of industrial technology, of sci ence.  of  enlightenment-which will  carry forever the blot of having pro duced the single most concerted and  barbaric assault upon the continuity  of the Jewish people, and, indeed as a  member of other nations as well. The  record of Nazi activities during  the  Holocaust  staggers  the mind,  and  defies any explanation  that  ignores  the reality of Evil as a force at large in  the world.  That is why for me it seems unusual ly appropriate to take up, on this day,  the subject of Kurt Waldheim, former  Secretary General of the United Na tions and now candidate for the Presi dency of the Republic of Austria.  Every man's reputation must be held  sacred, and by none more than those  of us who speak in this Chamber with out fear of prosecution for libel. And  so,  I  shall restrict myself  to an ac counting of what I have learned.  In memoirs  and  in  biographical  statements, Mr. Waldheim claims that  he spent the wartime years of 1942 to  1944  recuperating  from wounds  re ceived on the eastern front and study ing for his law degree in Vienna. For  40 years, the world believed this. But  Nazi war documents bearing Wald heim's  own  signature  conclusively  reveal that during those years he con tinued to serve  in the Balkan coun tries,  and  that he was  involved  in  atrocities the likes of which we have  seen  in  the cases of Josef Mengele,  Klaus Barbie, and Adolf Eichmann.  Waldheim's Nazi connections can be  traced back earlier than 1942. Accord ing to documents found in the Austri an Archives, he joined the Nazi Stu dent Union on April 1, 1938, 3 weeks  after the incorporation of Austria into  the Third Reich. Later that year, on  November 18, he  joined a mounted  unit  of  the Sturmabteilung <S.A.),  better known in this country as the  Brownshirts. That same month,  the  Brownshirts were involved in a horrif ic night of violence and murder, the  Kristallnacht, where they killed Jews,  burned their homes and synagogues,  looted their shops, and kidnaped and  tortured the survivors in cities all over  Germany and Austria.  When confronted by this evidence,  Waldheim  first denied  it,  then said  that  these organizations were  only  garden variety parts of the Nazi social  structure, and finally claimed that his  father-whom he previously said had  nothing  to do with  the Nazis-had  signed him up.  In 1939, Waldheim entered the mili tary and in 1942, according to German  military records, was assigned to the  German Army  command  headquar tered in Salonika, Greece. He served  with rank of oberleutnant to Gen. Al exander von Lohr, under whose com mand numerous atrocities against Ser bian, Croatian,  and Greek  civilians  took place. Lohr was hanged as a Nazi  war criminal in 1947.  The  organizational  chart  of  the  German high command places Waldheim at the head of section 03, a divi sion whose  responsibilities  included  delivering intelligence briefings to the  chief of staff; carrying out the zunder auffgaffen-special tasks-such as de portations,  assassinations,  and mass  terror;  and  interrogating  prisoners,  which sometimes required the torture  of American, British,  French,  and  Balkan citizens.  While General Lohr and his ober leutnant directed operations  in  the  Balkans,  the Ustasha-Croatian  fas cists-brought about the wholesale de struction of  the Jews of Yugoslavia  and Greece-with direct aid from their  Nazi  friends. The Kozara massacre,  which is to Yugoslavians what Ausch witz is to Jews, was carried out under  the orders of the German commander  of the Southeast command. In June  1942, 45,000 troops were given the task  of encircling and destroying all Serbi an and Jewish partisan units in the  Kozara  and Posara mountains. All  those captured were to be shot dead  and the male population over the age  of 14 was to be transported to concen tration camps. By  the end of July,  German  and Ustasha  soldiers  had  combed the mountains, set fire to the  villages, and killed 500 of the wounded  partisans. Out of  70,000  villagers mostly  women,  children,  and  old  people, 25,000 were dead or left to die  of starvation. Others were  taken  to  the Ustasha camp, where only a few  prisoners escaped.  On September 9, 1942, the Ustasha  awarded Waldheim with  the King  Zvonimir medal for ""merit under fire.""  Of the 45,000  troops, only 3 soldiers  received this honor from fascists-one  of them was Waldheim.  Six months  later, Waldheim  left  Croatia for Greece, where  the Ger mans  began  to  deport  Salonika's  46,000 Jews, 45,000 of them to Ausch witz and  the rest  to Bergen-Belsen.  Waldheim claims that, living 4 miles  outside of Salonika, he knew nothing  of  this mass deportation. He claims  that he was only an interpreter, not  mentioning that he would necessarily  be privy to intelligence about such a  major ""special task."" In his position as  head of section 03, he would have been  expected to help supervise the oper ation.  Another campaign  in which Wald heim took part was the ""Black Oper ation"" of May 1943, where prisoners of  the German and Italian commands in  the area were shot en masse. Wednes day's Washington Post cites a Yugo slavian report stating that Waldheim  took part in ""murder"" and ""putting  hostages to death"" from April 1944 to  May 1945.  ",1986

680,1356,6,Mr.  THE DEFENSE BUDGET  SIMON.," Mr.  President,  the  Senate  Budget  Committee  voted  wisely when they approved a defense  budget giving the Pentagon $295 bil lion in spending authority for the 1987  fiscal year. In a letter to the Budget  Committee prior to their vote, I advo cated adoption of a zero real growth  for defense, close to the level the com mittee eventually voted for.  Defense spending is an emotionally  charged issue. I support a strong de fense,  as do all my colleagues. We  differ on how to get there, but we all  agree on the end goal. With Gramm Rudman, we have no alternative but  to pass a responsible budget to avoid  the automatic cuts. This means that  growth in defense spending, which has  grown more  than any other budget  function since President Reagan took  office, must be constrained.  The argument  is often made  that  cutting defense, or keeping spending  authority level, harms us by encourag ing our enemies. Nothing could be far ther from the truth. Our adversaries  do not focus on how much we spend;  they focus on what we get for these  expenditures. This point  is  all  too  often overlooked.  We have a good example of mis placed priorities in the events of the  past few days. In the aftermath of our  military strikes against Libya, we have  to ask ourselves  if the never-ending  nuclear arms race in being waged at  the expense of the war against terror ism. Even some of our spending on  conventional weaponry has to be re evaluated: Are we buying  the right  kinds of equipment and conducting  adequate training to combat the new  threats posed by international terror ism?  When you include our allies in the  balance of forces between East and  West,  the numbers  look much  less  frightening, and in fact start to look  encouraging. Our allies spend much  more  on  defense  than  the Soviet  Union's Warsaw Pact allies. NATOEurope would be much more political ly reliable in the event of external ag gression. And our troops in Europe are  not policing the local populace, as are  many Soviet troops in Eastern Europe  We  too  seldom consider  that  the  U.S.S.R.  has  real vulnerabilities: A  weak economy; a long and sometimes  hostile frontier with China that re quires one-fourth of the Red army's  manpower-contrast  this with  our  long  and  peaceful  borders  with  Canada and Mexico  that do not re quire any real defenses; a draining war  in  Afghanistan;  and  economically  weak allies, from Cuba to Poland.  These and other good points are  made in a recent article in the Balti more Sun by Jeffrey Record, entitled  ""Reckoning the Military Balance."" We  have  to start getting more bang for  the buck, through defense reorganiza tion, procurement reform, arms con trol, and a more realistic assessment of  the military  balance  and  the  real  threats facing us  today.  I commend  Mr. Record's article to my colleagues,  and ask  that  it be printed  in  the  RECORD in full.  [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 1, 19861  RECKONING THE MILITARY BALANCE  <By Jeffrey Record>  WASHINGTON.-During the past weeks the  Reagan  administration  has  treated  the  nation to a plethora of pessimistic assess ments of the U.S.-Soviet military balance.  The  immediate purpose of  these  assess ments, most of which are the truth but far  from the whole truth, is clear:  to restore  eroding public and Congressional support  for major  real  increases  in U.S. defense  spending.  The administration's argument is twofold.  First, that the U.S.-Soviet military balance  has continued to deteriorate during the past  several years, despite a U.S. military buildup  of a magnitude unparalleled in peacetime.  Second, and because of the worsening bal ance, the Defense Department's fiscal 1987  budget, which represents an increase after  inflation  of  8  percent  over  last  year's  budget, ought to be exempted from congres sional spending cuts aimed at reducing over all federal budgetary deficits that are also  historically unprecedented.  Once again,  the administration wants a  strong national defense but is unwilling to  pay for it. Never mind that the present defi cit crisis is attributed in large measure to  the Reagan administration's own voodoo  economic policies (you can lower taxes, in crease outlays, or balance the budget, but  you cannot do all  three simultaneously).  And never mind that declining public confi dence in Caspar W. Weinberger's Pentagon  stems mainly from the Pentagon's predict able  inability  to  absorb  efficiently  the  mountains of cash thrown so abruptly and  indiscriminately at it by an administration  that still seems not to have grasped the fact  that the U.S. military has become simply  another vast government bureaucracy.  The U.S.-Soviet military  balance may  indeed have deteriorated since 1981, justify ing the administration's proposed increase  in defense spending. But how is that bal ance to be measured? Administration assess ments,  complete with pretty charts and  graphs, focus on simple numerical compari sons between U.S. and Soviet forces;  raw  numbers of men, tanks, ships, planes, divi sions, and so on. And, to be sure, it turns out  to no one's surprise that in almost every  index of things that can be counted the So viets have more than the United States. The  Soviets have 5.3 million men under arms to  our 2.2 million; 55,000 tanks to our 14,000;  289 major surface naval combatants to our  200; 8,000 tactical aircraft to our 5,400; and  209 army divisions to our 27.  But such numerical disparities, while dis turbing, hardly tell us much about the out come of a future war. First of all, to com pare only U.S. and Soviet military power is  to ignore what is perhaps America's greatest  remaining  strategic  advantage  over  the  Soviet Union-namely, the presence of rich,  militarily powerful, and politically reliable  allies. For example,  in Europe, which re mains the principal military focus of both  superpowers, a confrontation between the  United States and the Soviet Union would  automatically engage their respective Euro pean allies, and the size and fighting power  of America's NATO allies dwarf  that of  Moscow's Warsaw Pact allies, most of which  are,  in addition  to being a drain on the  Soviet treasury, small, poor, and of uncer tain political loyalty. The NATO alliance as  a whole suffers no pronounced numerical  disadvantages  in major categories of mili tary forces vis a vis the Warsaw Pact.  The balance of respective allies in the Far  East is even more favorable to the United  States. Leave aside the fact that most Soviet  forces in the Far East are deployed against  a  foreign ally, China. In a war with the  United States the Soviet Union could at best  hope  to count on only North Korea and  Vietnam-rather  sorry  compensation  for  South Korea,  Japan, Australia,  and  the  Philippines. Moreover,  the Soviets would  face formidable logistical problems in Asia.  With  the exception of the  trans-Siberian  railroad, some stretches of which run peril ously close to the Chinese border, there is  no continuous land line of communication  connecting the Soviet Union's military and  industrial heartland with her Far Eastern  provinces.  Second, much of Soviet power cannot be  fairly counted  in  the U.S.-Soviet military  balance because it is allocated to the protec tion of the Soviet empire from threats other  than those ""posed"" by the United States  and its allies. Soviet military problems are  far more numerous and quite different than  those facing the United States. For exam ple, whereas U.S. forces in Europe are bur dened by no internal police functions, many  of the 30 Soviet divisions deployed in East em Europe are stationed there to enforce  that region's political  loyalty  to Moscow.  Additionally,  in  contrast  to  the United  States, which has no enemies along its bor ders,  the Soviet Union deploys fully one quarter of its army opposite China. Indeed,  it has been said that the Soviet Union is the  only country  in the world surrounded by  hostile  communist  states.  The  United  States, rich in allies and secure along its  own borders, does not need 55,000 tanks and  a 209-division army.  Third, and perhaps most important of all,  numbers are but one of many  indices of  military power, and not necessarily the most  important. History  repeatedly has shown  that numerical inferiority can be more than  offset by superiority in such crucial intangi bles as strategy, tactics, organization, train ing, leadership, group cohesion, combat ex perience, and individual morale. If numbers  alone were decisive, Alexander the Great  would never have made it across the Bospo",1986
681,1382,6,Mr. HAMIL TON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington Report for Wednesday,  April  23,  1986,  into  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD:  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE  The Internal Revenue Service <IRS> is the  federal agency everyone loves to hate. Every  member of Congress hears a litany of com plaints about  the  IRS-especially at  this  time of year. Taxpayers have trouble get ting tax advice from the IRS, and many feel  harassed by  it. They complain  they are  treated as if they are guilty until they prove  their  innocence. Tax counselors complain  that the IRS is far behind in writing regula tions to clarify the law. Errors plague the  system, and phone calls and letters to the  IRS go unanswered.  Once regarded as a paragon of efficiency  among federal agenices, the IRS is quickly  losing the respect that has kept taxpayers  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  in line. A shortage of funds, manpower, and  political support has taken its toll at the  agency, and increasing numbers of Ameri cans believe that they risk little by cheating  on their taxes. All of us have an interest in  an IRS able to administer effectively the  nation's tax laws and to collect its revenues.  When one American cheats on his taxes, the  rest of us have to pay more.  The most immediate concern facing the  IRS is avoiding a repeat of the 1985 debacle  when, at the height of tax season, its new  computer system broke down. Thousands of  taxpayers were dunned for taxes they did  not owe, millions of refunds were delayed  for months,  and understaffed  IRS  tele phone lines went unanswered while inquir ers fumed. But the mishap cost the IRS  more than frazzled nerves. IDtimately, an  additional $69 million was  spent by  the  agency to cover interest on delayed returns,  employee overtime pay, and productivity  losses.  The most  costly  result  has been  the  damage done to IRS credibility. Traditional ly, the agency has relied largely on volun tary compliance in revenue gathering, but  cheating is now on the rise as growing num bers of taxpayers are tempted to test the  IRS's scrutiny. Contrary to popular belief,  illegal activities and large corporations ac count for only a small portion of tax cheat ing, just 10% and 7% respectively. Ordinary  citizens are responsible for the vast majori ty-over 80%-of the tax cheating that goes  on in the U.S.  The rapid decline in tax compliance is par ticularly alarming  in light of the federal  budget deficit crisis. Compared to a deficit  of $180 billion this year, tax cheating cost  the Treasury an estimated $107 billion in  1985, up from $23 billion in 1973. By 1990, it  could reach $160 billion. In the frantic at tempt to reduce the deficit without raising  new taxes, many members of Congress are  realizing  that  improved  tax  compliance  could bring large sums into federal coffers  with no pain to the honest taxpayer.  Reducing the ""tax gap"" will not be easy,  as the agency has suffered years of neglect.  In the early 1970s, after the IRS was used  to harass political enemies of the adminis tration, its funding was curbed. The request  for the new IRS computer system originat ed in 1970, but funding was delayed until  1982, and the new system came on line only  last year. Chronic funding shortages have  also made  it difficult  to hire and retain  qualified personnel. In any given tax season,  only 40% of the seasonal employees-those  primarily handling returns-have had previ ous experience at IRS. Audit staff has dwin dled, and the proportion of returns audited  has fallen steadily, from 5% in the 1960s, to  1.2% last year.  If tax compliance is to improve, the IRS  must reestablish  its reputation as an effi cient and credible federal agency. Toward  this end, the agency has taken steps to pre vent a repeat of last year's confusion. Soft ware bugs have been removed, enabling IRS  computers  to work 68%  faster  than  last  year,  and overall computer capacity has  been increased by 40% over 1985. The Presi dent has proposed adding 7500 auditors by  1988, which could have a large payoff in rev enues. A Congressional Budget Office study  concluded that every additional $1 spent on  compliance enforcement could generate as  much as $16  in unpaid revenues. In addi tion, the House-passed tax reform bill, now  pending in the Senate, includes measures to  boost penalties for tax evasion. That could  generate an additional $8.3 billion by 1991,  April 24, 1986  and, like expanded audit coverage, creates  added incentives for compliance by taxpay ers.  Far more will have to be done, however, to  assure the smooth operation of the IRS on  into the next century. It has been under staffed, underfunded, undertrained, and un derequipped. The IRS is planning to expand  its  conputerized auditing  systems, which  nabbed 6 million faulty returns last year. It  is also experimenting with computerized tax  filing services, which, for a small fee, will  feed tax returns directly into IRS comput ers, eliminating the need for cumbersome  paper returns. But such modernization pro grams will go nowhere without adequate po litical and fiscal support. The Administra tion,  realizing  that previous attempts  to  limit funds for the IRS have cost the gov ernment billions in lost revenue, requested  $340 million in additional funding for the  agency for 1986. In my view, adequate fund ing for the IRS must continue despite cur rent attempts  to  reduce federal spending  and the deficit. Members of Congress must  remember that the IRS can increase reve nues just by being able to enforce the law.  On a more fundamental level, the problem  of tax evasion lies less with the IRS than  with the tax code itself. As long as the tax  code is so complex that even two IRS tax  counselors can  interpret it differently, as  long as taxpayers with the same income pay  widely different taxes, as long as wealthy in dividuals and successful corporations can  avoid taxes altogether, and as long as spe cial interests appear to receive tax breaks at  the expense of all others, compliance with  the tax code will continue to decline. Over hauling the IRS will not solve the problem  if most taxpayers believe  the tax code  is  fundamentally  unfair. That  is why  the  thrust of tax reform-to reduce tax rates,  plug tax loopholes, and ensure that all tax payers are paying their fair share of taxes is so important. Reforming the IRS is neces sary for improving taxpayer compliance, but  so is reforming the tax code.  ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  SPEECH OF  HON.

Before  it was over,  1 % million Armenians  were brutally slaughtered  in a rampage  that  lasted for 2 years.

The bill simply corrects  typo graphical errors and cross-references,  changes section and chapter numbers  to eliminate duplication, and deletes a  provision  that makes  a  conforming  change in a section that has been re pealed. All the provisions of the bill  are consistent with recommendations  made by the Justice Department and  have been reviewed by other interest ed parties.

692,1408,6,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker. I rise in support  of H.R. 4600, the ""Indian Health Care Amend ments Act of 1986."" As  chairman of  the  Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and  Control, I would like to focus my remarks on  title VII, section 702,  ""Juvenile Alcohol and  Drug Abuse.""  Drug and alcohol abuse among our adoles cent population has reached epidemic propor tions. The National Institute on Drug Abuse's  annual survey of high school seniors indicates  that more than 60 percent of the students sur veyed had used drugs. While only a few studies have  focused on subgroups of minority  students, the available evidence indicates that  drug involvement among Indian youth is very  high, particularly for marijuana, alcohol, inhal ants and stimulants.  Moreover, although the treatment admission  information available is also very limited, indi cations are that the ratio of treatment in the  Nation per 1 00,000 population  is greater for  American Indians than whites. The most com monly  reported drugs of abuse are heroin,  marijuana, PCP, and  ""other""-usually desig nating inhalants.  The need  for drug abuse prevention and  education programs-now commonly referred  to as ""demand reduction"" strategies-across  the Nation  is generally accepted.  I have at tempted to address this problem in H.R. 4155,  the ""Drug Abuse Education Act of 1986.""  In  order  to provide such programs  for  Indian  youth, several additional obstacles must be  addressed. Section 702 begins to address the  problem of providing drug and alcohol educa tion  and  prevention  programs  for  Indian  youths by responding  to some of those bar riers.  First, no agency is designated to provide al cohol and drug abuse education  for  Indian  youth. Rather,  the  responsibilities are  dis persed among  three agencies-the Depart ment of Health and Human Services (Indian  Health Service), the Department of the Interior  (Bureau of Indian Affairs), and the Department  of Education. Section  702,  addresses  the  problem of coordination by mandating that the  Secretary  of Health  and Human Services  enter into an agreement with the Secretary of  the Interior and the Secretary of Education to  coordinate the efforts of their Departments re lated to alcohol and drug abuse among Indian  juveniles. The agreement will provide for the  identification and coordination of available re sources and programs to combat Indian juve nile alcohol and drug abuse through preven tion, education, counseling, and referral.  A second barrier to drug and alcohol educa tion and prevention programs for Indian youth  is the lack of teachers and counselors trained  to deal with these problems. Section 702 also  requires  the  three Secretaries  to develop a  program to provide training in preventive edu cation, identification of abusers, and counsel ing  techniques. This training would be made  available  to  teachers and counselors  in BIA  schools,  schools  under BIA  contract,  and  public schools on or near Indian reservations.  Third, essential  to good programming and  an effective response is an understanding of  the problem and an awareness of what has  worked. Accordingly,  section  702,  requires  that  the BIA,  in consultation with  the  Indian  Health Service review  the relevant  literature,  including  the  literature on  school  curricula.  This  information would  then be made avail able to the appropriate schools.  Fourth, section 702, addresses the problem  of implementation. It provides  for the estab lishment of an Office of Alcohol and Drug  Abuse within the Service. This office would be  responsible for all Indian Health Service alco hol and drug abuse programs.  I would, however, emphasize  that section  702 is just a first step in the fight against drug  and alcohol abuse among  Indian youth. Ac cordingly,  it does not eliminate the need  for  comprehensive legislation such as H.R. 1156,  the ""Indian Juvenile Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Prevention Act."" This  legislation, which  I am  proud  to cosponsor, was  introduced by  the  gentleman from Nebraska. It provides not only  for drug and alcohol abuse education  for  Indian youth, but for treatment and rehabilita tion, family services, and crisis intervention. By  addressing  the problems of resource coordi nation, teacher training, and the assessement  of available information, section 702 lays the  groundwork  for such a comprehensive ap proach.  At this time, I would like to endorse strongly  section 702 of H.R. 4600. Drug and alcohol  abuse education and prevention programs for  Indian youth are a special and critical need.  Section 702 provides the necessary founda tion from which we can begin to confront this  problem.  I would urge my colleagues to sup port this measure.  0 1250  ",1986

705,1421,6,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, Panama known to every American schoolchild as the  site of the Panama Canal, one of the great  engineering marvels  of  our  time-has  emerged as the drug laundering capital of  the western  hemisphere. The  enormous  profits churned by narcotics trafficking re quire  safekeeping, circulation,  investment  and sporadic movement from one location  to another to accomplish specific objectives.  Sometimes the money is used to invest in le gitimate businesses or  real estate,  some times to buy more drugs or sometimes to oil  the transportation machinery needed by the  drug  fraternity,  things  such  planes,  as  boats, warehouses, or  simple  bribery of  public officials. At other times the money is  simply deposited in banks to earn interest,  which later will be plowed into various en terprises. At times, it figures in foreign cur rency exchange or as a means to buy weap ons and ammunition earmarked for terror ists or insurgent groups.  Panama's drug abuse problem centers on  marijuana, cocaine, and paint thinner. Mari juana is grown locally and also is imported  from Colombia. Colombia  is  the major  source country for cocaine, consumption of  which is increasing and causing concern to  Panamanian authorities. Panama serves as a  transfer point for narcotics moving from  South America to the United States and for  chemicals used in drug processing enroute  from the U.S. and Europe to South Amer ica. Drugs come  into Panama from  light  planes and small coastal vessels, and then  are switched to other aircraft or vessels for  movement to the U.S. Panama also serves as  a warehouse for storage of drugs prior to  shipment somewhere else.  Panama's main role in the murky world of  international narcotics  trafficking  is as a  giant money laundering machine. Some 120  banks operate in Panama with total deposits  of more than $30 billion. Financial institu tions are attracted to Panama because of fa vorable banking conditions, notably  that  profits  earned  outside  of  Panama  are  exempt  from  local  taxation.  In addition.  Panama has strict banking secrecy  laws,  stricter even than those of Switzerland. Cor porations can be set up quickly and easily  and the American dollar is the currency of  the day. All of these factors add up to a very  favorable climate for money laundering of  all kinds, particularly  laundering  the  ill gotten proceeds of the illicit narcotics trade.  Most of the money enters Panama in bulk  cash and leaves via electronic transfer. That  marvel of the high-tech age allows for a lot  of financial hanky-panky.  Other banking centers with tight secrecy  laws, such as the Dutch Antilles, Cayman  Islands, or Switzerland, have agreements  with the United States to reveal financial  records  in major criminal cases. But with  Panama, there are no agreements, and se crecy  is absolute. Many of  the bank ac counts are numbered. And many bankers do  not ask questions when armored cars pull  up to their doors with suitcases or crates of  $20 bills or  larger denominations. Small  wonder that drug traffickers are drawn to  Panama's banking system.  The arrogance of drug traffickers has no  bounds. In one instance, they brazenly set  up their own bank. Gilberta Rodriguez Or juela, a notorious Colombian drug smuggler,  acquired controlling  interest  in  the First  Inter-Americas Bank of Panama. But his  luck ran out. Spanish authorities jailed him  and he is awaiting action on extradition re quests filed by both Colombia and the U.S.  The Panamanian Banking Commission, re sponsible for overseeing liquidation of bank  assets, took control of the bank, which was  literally awash in millions of narcotics dol lars. A Banking Commission official  re marked whimsically, ""It's the first time in  history that a bank was closed down be cause it was too liquid.""  Another  factor  that makes Panama  a  haven for money laundering is the anonymi ty with which a company can be organized  and the laxity of its financial reporting re quirements. There are more than 150,000  corporations on file. It is easy to go  into  business. For a fee of $1,200, a local law firm  will set up a paper corporation and name di rectors to the board to camouflage the iden tity of the real owners. The net result is  that Panama is virtually a magnet for nar cotics dollars looking for a place to hide.  Many of the large drug deals are made in  Panama hotels, bars, and law offices. One  senior law enforcement official observed re cently that Panama ""is not only the center  of laundering proceeds, but it's a center for  cutting the deals, for making payments, for  meetings. It's like the corporate center for  drug trafficking.""  Mr. President, more and more I am con vinced that we are not going to gain ground  in  the war against drugs unless Panama  tightens up on  its banking practices and  banks are compelled to accept their social  responsibilities  in  helping  combat  drug  money laundering.

718,10,14,Mr. HARTNETT.," Madam Speaker,  today we will be faced with the deci sion as to whether or not to override  President Reagan's veto of a very im portant piece of legislation.  President  Reagan's  philosophical  consistency is  laudable, but it is ex tracting too great a  toll from a very  important American  industry. We  have been at a disadvantage in this  country, and we are quickly and rapid ly  losing  the craftsmen,  the skilled  workers, and those workers who work  in this vital industry every year.  In the event of an all-out national  emergency, we will need thill vital in dustry, and I am afraid that it is going  to be too late.  I would say that there are very few  of my political persuasion who do not  stand shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan and admire the great suc cesses which he has enjoyed during his  term and a half in office. But I would  say to the President in this case, ""I  think that your political consistency is  wrong, Mr. President, and I, who have  considered myself to be one of your  most loyal soldiers, will leave you and  urge my colleagues to vote to override  your veto on this most important piece  of legislation.""

I stand before my colleagues today  as one person whose entire  life has  been surrounded by textile mills. As a  schoolboy growing up  in Sylacauga,  my first  job was in the textile mill.  When I served in the Alabama Legisla ture,  I  represented a county whose  major livlihood depended on the tex tile  and  apparel  mills  scattered  throughout  the  area. And  today,  Madam Speaker, I am proud to repre sent, in Congress, one of the largest  textile districts in our entire country.  My words today are not just my own,  but come from the some 25,000 textile  workers who live and work in my dis trict. From the northern part of my  district in Calhoun County, I speak for  the residents of Eastaboga, Piedmont,  Oxford,  and  Anniston.  southward  toward Randolph County, I speak for  those textile and apparel workers in  Roanoke, Rock Mills, and Wedowee.  Madam Speaker,  the valley area of  Alabama's Third Congressional Dis tt:Jct includes the towns of Shawmut,  Langdale, Lanett, and Lafayette, and  in this area is one of the largest con centrations of  textile workers  to be  found anywhere  in America.  In the  southern part of my district, I speak  for those textile workers in Opelika,  Tallassee, Phenix City, and Alexander  City. And, Madam Speaker, I would be  indeed remiss today if I did not men tion my home county of Talladega and  the hundreds and hundreds of friends  who are employed in textile cut-and sew plants. All of those who live  in  these communities are represented on  this floor today and the message they  are sending is loud and clear, ""Foreign  imports are taking our jobs-we need  relief.""  Madam Speaker,  in  the  last  few  dreds of handwritten letters pointing  weeks, I have had hundreds and hun out that Alabama has lost more than  10,000 textile and apparel employees  just  in  the past 12 months due  to  plant closings, and they have all called  my attention to the recent trade fig ures released ,by the Commerce De partment showing that textile imports  from Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and  China have increased this year more  than 20 percent over last year's figure.  I beg of my colleagues, in the name  of saving American jobs and protect ing our industrial base of these United  States, to vote with me today in over riding the Presidential veto of our tex tile bill.

The national strength of this coun try is not only in its missiles and its ar maments and its men and women who  defend  our  shores;  the  national  strength of our Nation is made up of  the ability to clothe ourselves and feed  ourselves. Agriculture,  textiles, steel,  rubber-basic industries of the United  States of America-make up the na tional strength of our people. If we  lose a part of that national strength,  we lose an overall part, a key part, of  the national security of our Nation.  This is an important vote today be cause it is a vote for national strength  and national security. I am extremely  pleased with the bipartisan efforts of  my friends on both sides of the aisle to  make the case for overriding this Pres idential veto for the national strength  of this Nation.

729,23,14,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of overriding the Presi dent's veto of H.R. 1562. Today is the  day this House either votes to take a  stand against unfair trade practices or  joins the administration in running up  the white  flag of surrender  in  the  international marketplace.  In the 8 months since the President  vetoed this legislation, there has been  ample opportunity for him to demon strate a willingness to take a strong  stand against dumping and the delib erate assault on the textile and shoe  industries. The U.S. Government  in stead has pursued a policy character ized by inaction and neglect.  The  results of  the current  trade  policy are clear. In the footwear indus try, for example, 32 factories and 6,200  jobs have been lost since  the Presi dent's veto. Imports rose another 14  percent over last year's recordbreaking  levels,  accompanied by a  10-percent  drop in domestic production. When I  last spoke in favor of this legislation,  imports controlled 78 percent of the  domestic market. They now control 81  percent of  the domestic market.  In  spite of the threat of this legislation,  our  trading partners  remain  unde terred.  I would suggest  to my colleagues  that we're not just observing a trend  with these figures, it's a death watch.  For if we cannot take action on behalf  . of  this  industry, which was granted  relief by the ITC yet ultimately reject ed by the President, when will we ever  act on trade?  That's why  it  is crucial  that  the  House override  the President's veto.  The footwear provisions in this legisla tion are hardly onerous. It still allows  imp~rts to represent 6 out of every 10  pairs of  shoes  sold  in  the United  States,  still  an  astonishingly  high  level.  Mr. Speaker, when measured against  the import and export policies of our  trading ""partners,"" H.R. 1562 is a mod erate, restrained approach. Some have  labeled it protectionist. The President  has labeled it destructionist. I label it  as nothing more than survival, and I  thus urge my colleagues  to  join  in  overriding the President's veto.  ",1986

731,23,14,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, oppo nents of textile-import relief say that  quotas will trigger a war with our trad ing partners. Well, first of all, they are  not partners, they are trading adver saries. In case the administration and  others have not noticed, there is a war  already under way, and we are losing  it. America has become a  dumping  ground  for  the unemployment and  other economic problems of our trad ing adversaries. We have closed over  550 steel plants, laid off 400,000 steel workers, and we have virtually shut  down  the domestic copper  industry.  You can hardly find a shoe made in  the U.S.A. Brazil provides 27 tax subsi dies for the export of iron ore. And  this administration has still to meet a  foreign  tax subsidy that it does not  like.  Several years ago the Arrow Shirt  Co., shut down the last of five shirt  factories in my northeastern Minneso ta district because of  imports, and  within  a week  shirts made  in Sri  Lanka, Singapore,  and Hong Kong  were  showing  up  in  communities  where those shirt factories were shut  down.  the  late  seventies,  President  Carter put a quota on specialty steel  imports which had taken 80 percent of  the U.S. market. Within 3 years the  domestic specialty steel industry had  recovered and regained 80 percent of  the market, with 9,000 people back to  work. Our trade deficit is deindustrial izing America. Let us stop that slide  down the slope of destroying America  as an industrial nation.  ",1986

But the answer is trade law reform.  The answer is strong enforcement.  industry we now  For  the American  textile  have strong agreements providing more com prehensive and enforceable protection than is  afforded any other American  industry. We  have a strong commitment  to enforcement  here and by Jim Baker, who in a recent letter  to me said:  I can also guarantee that the CUstoms  Service will firmly enforce the provisions of  these and all our bilateral  textile agree ments to prevent quota evasion.  My colleagues should remember the grain  embargo and  the pipeline embargo, and  re member how long it took us to shake the label  of ""unreliable supplier,"" to earn our way back  into the confidence of the international commu nity, because we had unilaterally abrogated  contracts.  Today we consider unilaterally abrogating  not contracts negotiated by  individuals, but  international agreements negotiated by our  Government. If ""unreliable supplier"" was hard  to shake, think how much harder it will be to  shake ""unreliable negotiator.""  Our vote today is not on textiles, shoes, and  copper. It is a statement about how this House,  this Congress,  views  international  commit ments. Do we believe ourselves bound by the  tradition of diplomacy and negotiated agree ments that has governed trade and internation al  relations historically?  Let  us  reject  the  temptation to deal with our failure and frustra tion  through an erratic, destructive gesture  which is called here on this floor of the House  ""overriding the President's veto,"" but which is  the real world, in the international community,  levies a body blow at bilateral negotiations who  alone can bring order to trade relations, protec tion  for all American  jobs, and peace  in a  nuclear age.

735,23,14,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of overriding the President's  veto of H.R. 1562, the Textile and Ap parel Trade Enforcement Act.  Sure, there are many good reasons why the  textile and apparel  industry needs  the relief  provided  in  this bill. After all, since 1980,  388,000 textile and apparel  jobs have been  lost due to the flood of foreign imports.  However,  that's not the only reason why  this vote is so important. Simply put, today we  have an opportunity to tell the world that the  United States won't be anybody's sucker any more when it comes to foreign trade. We have  been  too generous  for  too  long and  look  where it's gotten us. Our U.S. trade deficit for  this year is expected to be $170 billion, and  for the last 5 years, it has exceeded $600 bil lion.  While we've opened our trade doors about  as wide as  they can go, our foreign  trading  partners have slammed  their  trade doors  in  our face. The result, millions of lost American  jobs; and billions of lost U.S. dollars due to  plant closings, unemployment assistance, and  so many other ills that come from the decima tion of a vital U.S. industry.  Some have argued that the Multi-Fiber Ar rangement and other bilateral agreements be tween the United States and foreign nations  provide all  the protection  that  is necessary.  Wrong! The MFA and other bilateral agree ments are inadequate and are not being en forced. In fact. all this bill does is require the  ",1986
736,49,14,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my col leagues today in supporting this effort to over ride  the President's veto of H.R. 1562,  the  Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Act of  1985. This bill represents only the first step in  developing a comprehensive trade policy that  we so badly need.  It is  time  that  this Nation stops exporting  American  jobs. For too long we have drifted  aimlessly on  the high seas of  international  trade without  the strong  rudder of a  trade  policy. It is time that rudder becomes proudly  labelled ""Made in the U.S.A.""  Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this bill,  I  joined a large majority of my colleagues last  October  in passing  this  legislation.  I remain  steadfast in support of the American textile in dustry by rejecting the President's veto, and I  ask my colleagues to join me today.  The fiber, textile and apparel complex is not  only  this country's  largest manufacturing  in dustry, but it is also the world's most produc tive and modern textile industry. Fiber, fabric,  and apparel workers represent 1 0 percent of  the U.S. manufacturing work force. They com prise a fifth of the work force in seven States  and a number of large cities and more than 5  percent of the work force in half the States.  Yet, although  its workers are  the most effi cient in  the world,  it simply cannot compete  against  foreign governments  that subsidize  their  industries, pay workers as  little as 16  cents per hour, and impose severe restrictions  on imports from the United States and other  countries.  Mr. Speaker, given the textile and apparel  industry's significant industrial role,  it is very  troubling that in  the last 3 years,  imports of  fiber,  fabric, and apparel have surged at un precedented rates. Last year, apparel imports  climbed  to almost 50 percent of  the U.S.  market. Textile and apparel imports surged in  1984 at a staggering 32-percent growth rate.  Imports captured 71 percent of the American  footwear market in 1984 and have continued  to increase.  The impact of these changes on the textile  industry has been dramatic. By 1985, more  than 250  textile mills had closed,  thereby  eliminating more than 200,000 textile and ap parel jobs. Since 1973, textile employment is  down by half a million.  Import penetration is  causing massive  disruptions  through U.S.  plant  closings and  cutbacks. Every billion  yards lost to imports represents 1 00,000 job  opportunities lost to American textile, apparel  and fiber workers.  My colleagues, I am concerned that imports  will capture virtually the entire U.S. market by  1990.  If  import growth continues at current  levels, cotton producers,  in  four years, will  face elimination of most of  their domestic  market. Wool growers, whose production has  dropped 75 percent since World War II, export  almost no product at all, leaving every import ed item of fabric or apparel to be added to the  negative trade imbalance.  I should hope  the President  realizes  that  hundreds of thousands of American workers  will  lose their jobs if his veto of the Apparel  Trade Enforcement Act  of  1985  remains  intact.  Mr. Speaker, the administration continues to  be  insensitive to the needs of this American  industry and  its workers. Just last week the  administration announced  that  it completed  negotiations on a bilateral  textile agreement  with South Africa which allows the South Afri can  textile industry to increase its exports to  the United States.  H.R. 1562 does not represent protection ism.  Instead,  it esablishes measures to pre serve orderly,  free  trade  in a world in which  some nations do not compete fairly. If our for eign trading partners do not trade fairly,  free  trade has little meaning.  We need a policy that will benefit American  workers, not one that will scratch names from  local payrolls. Given the significant role of the  textile industry in this country, and considering  the damage that would result by its elimina tion, I ask my colleagues to support this veto  override.  Mr. Speaker, the rapid growth of textile ap parel imports, as troubling as it is, represents  just a small piece in the U.S. trade imbalance.  Trade figures released last week indicate that  the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of  $170 billion, nearly seven  times higher than  when the Reagan administration took office.  The Commerce Department reported that in  June alone, Americans imported $14.2 billion  more  than  they exported. For  the  first 6  months of this year,  the deficit climbed to a  record half-year level of $83.9 billion. My col leagues, this is a crippling situation that needs  a prompt and proper remedy-the implemen tation of an active, rather than a retroactive  policy. If left uncorrected, this Nation will slide  into a dismal abyss of recession.  President Reagan soon plans to orchestrate  another drop  in  the dollar, hoping  that  this  scheme will produce results. Unless a mas sive world expansion gets underway, some  economists say, the dollar will have to drop by  another 25 or 30 percent to produce the nec essary correction in the trade deficit.  We cannot wait that long. For even if the  dollar devaluation  is successful,  the United  States will still face an enormous trade deficit  for years to come. This country needs to take  a comprehensive approach to reduce foreign  trade restrictions, beef up U.S. export promo tion, and  improve our long-term competitive ness through better education and training.

743,62,14,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.," I  did not spread it over the remaining,  because in my best judgment, and I  think that of those with whom I have  worked on the amendment, the per centage cut  required would be  too  deep to sustain, and to make the cuts  in the accounts within the Treasury  Department  that  produce  revenue  would be unwise, because in fact our  net deficit would go up because our  collections of revenue would go down.

744,62,14,Mr. FRENZEL., I thank the gentle man for his explanation.  ,1986
745,62,14,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, it is rather easy for  any Member to take the floor to rec ommend that a budgetary request be  reduced by any particular amount.  The truth of the matter is that in this  instance the maker of the motion has  exempted, and to his credit, some very  important agencies, the Internal Reve nue Service and the Customs Service,  and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  Bureau. These are revenue-producing  departments, and I think they should  be exempted.  On the other hand,  if his amend ment were to prevail, we would also  find ourselves  in a  situation where  other departments would  suffer se verely. For example, he would reduce  the funding for basic law enforcement  training. This is training that is defi nitely necessary, not only for our law  enforcement  agencies,  ATF  and  others, but it is also training that is  needed so that we can combat the ter rorism that is going on not only here  in the United States but throughout  the world. Training would be reduced  under this amendment by 54 percent  of the necessary cost. This is a tremendous reduction.  Mr. MORRISON  Mr. Chairman, will  yield on that point?  of Connecticut.  the gentleman  ",1986
746,62,14,Mr. ROYBAL., I yield to the gentle man from Connecticut only on that  point.  ,1986
747,62,14,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.," I  think that it is important to empha size  that  the Federal Law Enforce ment Training Center, to which the  gentleman refers, in 1986 had a level  of funding of $22,779,000. The pro posed increase, which  is a very sub stantial one, almost 30 percent, would  take  it up  to $29,499,000. The cut,  after application of my amendment,  would take it down to $26,623,000-in  other words, a 17 -percent increase over  last year's level.  I think that it is misleading to sug gest that there are not resources here  to deal with the priority items that  the training center should deal with.  ",1986
748,62,14,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Chairman, I will  not yield any further, because I think  that the gentleman, while his figures  seem to be correct, has not really ana lyzed the entire matter correctly. First  of all, he has not been a member of  the committee; he has not taken part  in the deliberations that took place; he  did not hear any of the testimony that  was presented  to the committee; he  has not heard, for example, that ter rorism has increased, not only here in  the United States, but throughout the  world; he has not heard that rioting  continues to increase; and he did not  hear from expert witnesses  that we  must provide  the necessary  training  for our own law enforcement agencies  in the United States.  D 1525  So the 17 percent that he makes ref erence to can very well not be enough,  since all these other things have in creased so tremendously.  Another thing that is also in a dan gerous situation, and that is that for eign missions  in Washington, DC,  right here in our own city, will have to  be reduced. We would have to reduce  also, under this particular amendment,  the Government's effort to investigate  illegal international arms transactions.  I  think  that  that  is  an  important  matter that must be considered. Be cause of testimony that was presented,  the committee, in its wisdom, made a  recommendation to the full committee  and now to the House that these funds  be included in the bill.  As we go further, we also find that if  this amendment prevails we will have  to reduce the number of arson task  forces by one-third. Arson, Mr. Chair man, had  increased  in  the United  States tremendously, and if this pre vails we will have to make that reduc tion.  I can go on to other departments. I  realize I only have 5 minutes to do it  in. But the truth of the matter is that  the  recommendations made by  this  committee are not only my recommen dations,  these are  the recommenda tions of every Member of the committee who, after discussion, after debate,  after careful consideration, came  to  the conclusion that there were certain  necessities  that had to be met, and  that  is exactly what we have done  here.  These departments are funded based  on recommendations that have been  made, and in some instances they are  above  the budget. But  in most  in stances they are justified by the great  need that arises.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY KR. FRENZEL AS A SUB  STITUTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY  KR. MORRISON OF CONNECTICUT  ",1986

",1986
750,62,14,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, if the  distinguished chairman of the subcom mittee did not like the amendment of  the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr.  MoRRISON] he will probably not be en amored of this one either.  As a matter of fact, the amendment  of the gentleman from Connecticut is  for sissies. It cuts a little over $100 mil lion in BA and outlays, and attempts  to conform the appropriations bill to  the 302<b> allocations.  My amendment is a bit sterner. It  will cut about $690 million out of  budget authority. It does take the bill  back to the 1986 BA levels for discre tionaries only. About half of this bill  of over $13 billion is discretionary. A  little more than half is mandatory.  The discretionaries, as is customary  for appropriation bills, are increased,  however, at a much greater rate of in crease than the mandatories. There fore, this amendment is able to take a  pretty good $690 million bite by re stricting discretionaries only.  My amendment is not going to be for  the  faint of heart. The gentleman  from Connecticut reduces across the  board, but  in his exceptions he  re moves  at  least  one  account  that  amounts to one-third of the bill, and  the three others amount to very sub stantial additional pieces of it. I do not  blame him  for exercising discretion  rather  than valor, but I believe an  across-the-board cut should cut across  the board.  As a statement to the committee, I  would suggest that their committee re ports are very hard to interpret, par ticularly  in  distinguishing  between  mandatories and entitlements.

751,75,14,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to say to  you, and the ranking minority member,  Mr. SNYDER,  that I am pleased with  both the content of this legislation, and  the fact that we are bringing it before  the Members of the House at this time.  This bill extends the basic programs  of  highway  construction,  highway  safety, and public transit for 5 years.  The funding  levels  included  in  this  measure are consistent with what will  probably emerge from the budget con ference. For the outyears of this bill,  the  funding  levels  reflect  the con straints of Gramm-Rudman, and the  projected revenues into the trust fund.  These reauthorizations constitute by  far the bulk of this measure.  The work on this legislation began  months ago. Using as a base, H.R.  5504, which died during the final days  of the last Congress due to the other  bodies in action, the committee fash ioned H.R. 3129. Last week at the sub committee markup, it was my pleasure  to  introduce  the substitute  to H.R.  3129 which is before you today.  The timing of this legislation is of  great importance. We must not fail to  reauthorize  these  programs  during  this Congress. The authorizing legisla tion expires on September 30, 1986. It  would be unthinkable to not extend  these programs and the trust funds  which back them up; unfortunately,  the  unthinkable  does  sometimes  happen. We must not leave anything  to chance, nor should we leave any ex cuses out  there  for anyone on  the  other side of the Capitol to delay this  process. We must move ahead quickly  and forcefully. Mr. Chairman, I  look  forward to acting on this must legisla tion.  ",1986

754,75,14,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in strong support of this legisla tion, the Surface Transportation and  Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of  1986.  H.R. 3129 must be enacted by Sep tember 30 at which time our Nation's  highway, highway safety, and public  transit programs expire. So,  this bill  which we have before us does reau thorize  these programs for 5 years.  Among its key features are the follow ing: it assures completion of the Na tion's Interstate System, it establishes  a 4R Discretionary Program to help  assure that our Nation's 4R moneys  are focused on projects most in need,  it provides  some  flexibility  for  the  States to shift 20 percent of their 4R  money to the primary system, it con tinues and makes permanent our 85percent  apportionment  program,  it  provides a program  to provide addi tional obligational authority for those  States most in arrears, it helps assure  that our Nation's highway system con tinues to be a safe one, and it allows us  to more fully utilize  the transit ac count of the highway trust fund.  The transportation needs facing our  Nation are great. It has been said by  the organization  representing State  highway and transportation agencies  that our highway needs exceed $20 bil lion a year in Federal assistance. Our  transit needs  total about $35 billion  over the next 5 years. This legislation,  frankly, will not meet those needs. But  given the budget circumstances which  we must work under, it is the best we  can do.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3129  is not a  perfect  bill.  I  support  that  every  Member in this Chamber might like to  see some changes in it. But, it is a bill  that is in balance. It has been careful ly and fairly crafted. It is a bill that  should comfortably command the sup port of all our colleagues. I urge its  prompt passage and enactment.  ",1986

Mr. Chairman, I would like to identi fy with the sponsor of  this amend ment. I think it is an excellent offer ing here today. It seems to me that it  is important for our friends who live  in the more congested parts of  the  country  to  remember  the enormous  differences that exist on the interstate  system.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania,  [Mr. SHUsTER], made the point that it  is a Federal system; it is funded by the  Federal Government;  it  is an  inter state system that moves from State to  State. But there are enormous differ ences between circumstances, for ex ample, in eastern Pennsylvania or in  the Washington, DC, metropolitan  area and a State like Wyoming.  In Wyoming we have half a million  people  living  in an area of almost  98,000 square miles where we are ap proximately  the size of the Federal  Republic of Germany. The notion that  somehow we should operate the same  way on our  Interstate System  that  States do in far more congested areas,  it seems to me, is extremely unwise.  I would like to also endorse the re marks of ",1986

Mr. Chairman, I  think the amend ment is a good one. It seems to me  that it does preserve the State option.  It does place a certain amount of trust  in our State legislatures and our Gov ernors. A great many Members who  serve in this body used to serve at the  State level. I am certain they would  not want to suggest that somehow our  State  authorities  are  incapable  of  making these decisions.  I think we ought to let the authority  revert back to the States.

762,114,14,Mr. HANSEN.," If the gentleman will  continue to yield, I think the point I  may be driving at, if I may bring this  up, is in the West, I cannot speak for  the East, but when we did the Presi dential Commission on Drunk Driving  we found that the average speed was  about 65 miles an hour and has been  for a long time. So I appreciate what  all  these gentlemen have said when  they stand and say, ""55 miles an hour  saves  lives;""  the facts of the matter  are, we are not driving at 55 miles an  hour. A better and more correct state ment would be 65 miles an hour saves  lives because that seems to be the av erage speed.  Out in our areas, as you made the  very great distinction between Wyo ming and the East or Utah and the  East, people, when there is a straight  shot, will  travel  for miles without  seeing another car in some instances  on a wide open space. I guess in effect  55 does not save lives if the average  speeds in the Western States seems to  be 65 miles an hour.  ",1986
763,114,14,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1986
764,114,14,Mr. CHENEY., I yield to the gentle man from Pennsylvania.  ,1986
765,114,14,Mr. SHUSTER.," I thank the gentle man.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to point  out that the National Safety Council  indicates the fatality rate in Wyoming  is 3.2 which is about 50 percent higher  than the national average. Something  must not be being done right in the  State of Wyoming on the highways.  ",1986
766,114,14,Mr. CHENEY.," I am sure all of those  accidents do not happen on the inter state, Mr. Chairman.  ",1986
767,114,14,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, one of the original  authors of the 55-mile-per-hour speed  limit in the other body was a former  senior Senator from my home State of  West Virginia, Jennings Randolph. He  acted at that time with good reason  and based on what has proven to be  sound fact.  I shall not go into all those facts and  figures and polls. My colleagues from  Pennsylvania and California have very  adequately done that as have others  who are in opposition to this amend ment. Those facts indeed do show that  55-miles-per-hour does save lives and it  is working.  My good  friend  from Oklahoma's  amendment, as I understand it. is di the  rural  interstate  rected  toward  highways of  this Nation as he has  stressed in his opening remarks. In a  mountainous State such as  I  repre sent, we do have rural interstate high ways, particularly in my congressional  district, and upon the completion of  Interstates 64 and 77, we hope to have  even more rural interstate highways in  the years ahead of us.  One of those is currently the West  Virginia Turnpike for many of my col leagues  that may have  transversed  that road in going to their congres sional districts from Washington. We  have severe curves on many of our  rural interstate highways in a moun tainous State such as West Virginia.  For us to allow the speed limit to be  increased to 65-miles-an-hour on these  curves I say creates a very dangerous  and unsafe condition.  If we  allow  the  65-mile-per-hour  speed  limit  to  take effect, my col leagues must remember that we are  talking about in reality 70 or 75 miles  per hour because we know the leeway  that  law  enforcement officials give  when the speed limits are set at cer tain limits.  I  realize,  and  the gentleman will  come back and say that the State has  the option not to raise the speed limit  to  65-miles-per-hour  on  such high ways. But that, in my opinion, is only  going to create a very crazy-quilt pat tern of different speed limits through out our States. It has been referred to  that we are  talking about interstate  travel; we are talking about interstate  highways  funded 90 percent by  the  Federal Government.  I believe what  we need here  is consistency  in our  speed limits.  Motorists coming from the western  part of the United States, accustomed  to traveling perhaps 65, 70, 75 miles  per hour are going to find it, are not  going to be concentrated enough to re alize  the dangers  they are entering  into when they start driving on these  rural interstate highways in a moun tainous State such as Pennsylvania,  Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, West Vir ginia and the neighboring States  in  the Appalachian region of this coun try.  I submit that it is going to create  very uncertain and unsafe conditions,  and why should we even open the door  and that is what this amendment does  really, is to open the door for future  increases in the speed limits to a 70miles-per-hour speed limit.  Mr. McCURDY. Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1986
768,114,14,Mr. RAHALL.," I yield to the gentle man from Oklahoma.  Mr. McCURDY. I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman. I just want to state at  this point that those of us in Oklaho ma who happen to come to West Vir ginia and see all these mountains, it is  such a monumental sight to us that I  can guarantee you that we will not  ",1986

829,166,14,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, during  consideration of the fiscal year 1986  Department of Defense appropriation  bill, I was the principal coauthor of a  letter to the distinguished chairman of  the Defense Appropriations Subcom mittee, Mr. STEVENS, dated September  18, 1985, and signed by 36 Senators, in cluding the distinguished junior Sena tor from New York  [Mr. D'AMATol  urging that funds be added to the De fense  appropriation  bill  for Coast  Guard military equipment,  including  several C-130 aircraft.  Subsequently, the committee, in re sponse  to this request and with the  strong support of  the subcommittee  chairman, Mr. STEVENs,  added $375  million to the fiscal year 1986 Navy  appropriation for Coast Guard equip ment, including funds for several C130 aircraft, parts of which will be as sembled  in  the Lockheed-Clarksburg  plant in West Virginia.  Again, with  the strong support of  Senator STEVENs, the conferees adopt ed  the Senate amendment and  the  provision was enacted into law on De cember 19, 1985, as part of the fiscal  year 1986 continuing resolution.  The amendment now being proposed  by Senators STEVENs, D' AMATO,  and  myself follows up on the above-men tioned effort during fiscal year 1986  and would  authorize  an  additional  $300 million for fiscal year 1987 for ac quisition  and maintenance  of U.S.  Coast Guard inventories as well as op erating funds related to the increased  national defense readiness of the U.S.  Coast Guard.  The amendment would also  facili tate the law enforcement functions of  the Coast Guard, especially with re spect to drug interdiction.  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of  the amendment.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr.  President,  I  would like to commend Senator STE VENS for his outstanding leadership in  making these dollars available during  this very difficult time and also thank  the chairman of the committee, Sena tor GoLDWATER, and Senator NUNN.  I think we move in a very positive  step and positive direction.  I  have  heard Senator NUNN's  admonitions  about the future, but certainly I would  like the Senator from Georgia for his  support in the law enforcement efforts  in terms of interdiction, particularly  as it relates to the drug area.  I believe, in time, the actions that  the Senate undertook last year and we  make today by way of this legislation  will have some very meaningful results  in drug interdiction efforts and really  begin to put the muscle in what here tofore has been rhetoric in fighting  for that.  So I am pleased to see the commit tee move in this direction.  ",1986

831,166,14,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, may I say  that the Senator from New York has  been a real leader in this area. Senator  CHILES from Florida and the Senator  from New York and the Senator from  Alaska have really taken a great deal  of initiative that has resulted in much  improved drug enforcement efforts.  I would say also that the mayor of  New York. Mayor Koch, has been out spoken in this area and has been a real  leader. I met with both the mayor and  the Senator from New York on at  least one occasion; I believe two occa sions. I would like to take the opportu nity to commend Mayor Koch for his  concern and for his outspoken support  for a vigorous drug enforcement pro gram.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr.  President,  I  know the mayor will appreciate that,  as he has been very active  in  this  effort in moving us toward this histor ic occasion.  I  think Senator WILSON would like  to speak on this.  ",1986

I want to also commend the staff Bob Bayer, 'Russ Milnes, and Marie  Dickinson-for their excellent work in  preparing  the military  construction  parts of this Department of Defense  authorization bill.

858,179,14,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, as I  was  indicating  to  the Senate,  the  amendment that I have sent to the  desk calls for the deletion of $141.6  million, which  is designated  in  the  pending bill for two new Navy home  ports, one at Staten Island, NY, and  one at Everett, W A. The proposal in  my amendment  is  to  transfer  those  funds  to the Navy weapons account  for purchase of munitions  for  the  Navy.  My colleagues and I, who are offer ing  this amendment,  are  convinced  that the strategic rationale for this so called strategic homeporting initiative  is really very much lacking.  This is a program, in my view, which  the Navy on its own should have cut  from its budget long ago. Yet, as its  budget has shrunk  from  the  levels  that were expected, and as this pro gram has come under increasing criti cism from many fronts. the Navy has  come forth with nothing but addition al rhetoric about how critical the pro gram is.  To hear the Navy's point of view on  this, particularly the Secretary of the  Navy's, it would appear that this is the  highest priority  item  in  the Navy  budget, more  important  than  the  people needed  to man  the 600-ship  Navy, more important than the muni tions needed to sustain the 600-ship  Navy, and more important than the  readiness of the 600-ship Navy, per haps more important even than the  shipbuilding program.  The reason for this attention to this  particualr  item  in the Navy budget,  and  the priority given  to  it by the  Navy, has much more to do with do mestic politics,  I  fear,  than it does  with  the  fighting capability of our  Navy or with deterrence of the Soviet  threat.  Today, we are asking the Senate to  reject  the politics  that  traditionally  have prevailed in favor of maximizing  the Navy's warfighting potential. We  are  asking  the Senate  to  join  the  House  in rejecting this homeporting  plan of the Navy.  I note that the House rejected the  funds for homeporting on a bipartisan  basis. Both the Democrats and the Re publicans  by majority  vote  turned  thumbs down on this proposal when it  was discussed in the House on July 25.  Let me discuss the Navy homeport ing plan for those who are not familiar  with it. This is a plan, very simply, to  build nine new naval bases. The Navy  is proposing  to open a new port in  Staten Island, NY, for the battleship  Iowa's surface action group of seven  ships. They are proposing to open a  new port  in Everett, W A,  for  the  carrier battle  group  of  13  ships. They are proposing to place 27  ships, including a carrier battle group  and the battleship Wisconsin's surface  action group in the Gulf of Mexico at  seven new ports and one existing port.  Finally,  strategic  homeporting  in volves the placing of 17 ships, includ ing the battleship Missouri's surface  action group, at existing ports in Pearl  Harbor and California.  Thus, we are talking about how best  to  accommodate 64  ships many of  which are already in our fleet today.  Those of us who oppose the opening  of new ports believe that the Navy is  seriously overstating the benefits of  this proposal, and they are also grossly  underestimating the costs involved, es pecially the ongoing base support and  personnel costs of the new ports.  We do not oppose that part of the  Navy's homeporting plan that involves  existing ports in San Francisco, Long  Beach,  and Hawaii,  and we  rather  think  that  should  have  been  the  model which was used around  the  entire Nation.

887,192,14,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, I am  most appreciative of that. I once again  congratulate my  distinguished  col league from Texas for what I thought  was a very comprehensive and very  able speech on this subject, and I will  try not to be too repetitious.  I have heard some remarks about  this being a pork-barrel project. I am  on the Environment and Public Works  Committee.  I  have  seen some pork  barrel projects, but I sure have not  seen any pork-barrel projects which  have called on the local community to  spend 37 percent of the money to put  in that home port. But that is what we  have seen down in Corpus Christi, TX,  where the Government would pay for  63 percent and  the State and  local  community, which  really  does  not  have a very rich tax base, are coming  up with 37 percent of that money.  I  heard  some  comments  earlier  about what kind of  reception, what  kind of quality of life those Navy folks  would have if they were not in Norfolk  or they were not in San Diego. Well, I  watched these nuclear protests being  put on around  the country, and  I  think it is time we give some consider ation to those communities which wel come these servicemen with open arms  rather  than clenched  fists. And we  have seen the reception along the gulf  coast-one of hospitality and welcom ing those folks.  Yes; there is some economic benefit  to those of us who would have a home  port, but I do believe in this instance  we see the benefit to the national se curity and overwhelmingly so. There is  no question about the fleet being over concentrated.  Mr. President, may I have the atten tion of the floor.  ",1986

Last year, when this Senator agreed  to the unanimous-consent request to  allow certain provisions to be stripped  out of S. 655, it was done so with the  understanding that we would have the  opportunity early  this year  to have  full consideration of the pending PAC  amendment. The distinguished majori ty leader has made that commitment  and  is  certainly operating  in good  faith on it.  I just say that I appreciate the com ments  just made  by  the minority  leader that that agreement will be pro tected. If we continue to postpone that  action until after the recess, when we  come back we would not have time for  the House to act in a timely fashion. I  hope whatever agreement  is entered  into would protect our right to start  on that matter on Monday. We are  willing to enter into an agreement to  lock that in so that the distinguished  majority  leader would know exactly  what time that would be. Then any  votes on the matter would be on Tues day.  I appreciate the remarks of the dis tinguished minority leader and I hope  that all of this agreement can be ar ranged to get all of these issues con sidered in a timely fashion.  ",1986

900,205,14,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise in  opposition to the amendment to strike  funding for the Navy's strategic home porting plan.  I  consider  the strategic home porting concept, my mind goes back to  the time that I was a Pfc, in the U.S.  Marine Corps. That was during World  War II. A Pfc was a private first class.  He had been elevated from the posi tion of private. On one occasion we  were going through some training and  As  were putting ourselves in a battle situ ation. Something happened to the cor poral who was the squad leader so I  was designated to be the squad leader.  While in the training we were sup posed to be in battle conditions, but  we all of a sudden were informed of  our conditions, so I stopped and gath ered all of the eight men of my squad  together and  I began  to give  them  there orders. They were all bunched  up together.  About that time, a gunny sergeant  came by. A gunny sergeant  in  the  Marine Corps is an unusual animal. He  proceeded to chew me up one side and  then down the other. Then when he  got through, he spit me out in little  pieces.  That chewing by a gunny sergeant is  a rare experience and it is an experi ence that will be indelibly engraved in  your mind forever.  What he was  telling me was  that  when you are in battle formation and  you are supposedly going through a  situation where you think the enemy  is in front of you, you do not bunch  up. The proper procedure  is  to de sperse. Never bring your men together  in a bunch. You disperse.  The idea and concept of dispersal is  a key point in the issue of strategic  homeporting.  There was criticism, and probably  unjustly so-l am not going to argue  that-in regards to the marines being  all located in one barracks in Lebanon  when we lost over 200 marines in the  recent bombing of those barracks. The  idea was that they ought to have been  dispersed.  The idea is not to put all your eggs  in one basket or not to put them all in  one, two, or three. If one cracks, then  the others begin to crack around it.  If a mortar shell were to fall on a  squad of marines that were bunched  up together, it is going to be able to  injure or kill more than one.  You  are  going  to  cause  serious  damage to that squad of marines.  The idea of dispersal was an issue in  Pearl Harbor. It was an  issue  then  when we felt we should have been dis persing our fleet and not have it all  concentrated  in one  location. So  I  think we  should have  learned our  lesson by then.  0 2010  I think what we are doing now is fi nally getting around to the concept  that we ought not  to put a great  number of ships together in one loca tion where the types of weapons that  we have today-nuclear or nonnucle ar-can cause tremendous damage.  There  is no question  that  if you  have five ships right here in one place,  it is easier to pick and to shoot those  five ships than if they are spread out  in various places.  ",1986
901,218,14,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I  join  my colleague in offering this amend ment.  We have a serious problem in haz ardous waste disposal throughout the  country.  This does, as Senator MITCHELL indi cated, simply restore the funding level  requested by  the President and the  Department of Defense.  I hope the amendment will be ac cepted.  Mr. President, the amendment I am  jointly offering with my  colleague  from Maine  simply  restores  to  the  levels requested by the President the  funding  for  the Department of De fense hazardous waste cleanup pro grams. It is crucial that DOD partici pate in the on-going nationwide clean up of hazardous waste sites, and I be lieve it is important that we provide  the Department with adequate fund ing to carry out this mission.  The amendment at the desk will add  $15.3 million to DOD's environmental  restoration fund and $5 million for the  construction of hazardous waste stor age  facilities. The  funding will be  taken from the Operations and Main tenance accounts for the Army, Navy  and Air Force, a cut of about three hundredths of 1 percent. We have not  directed the services to make specific  cuts within their O&M accounts, but  rather leave it to their discretion, so  that the reductions will be as painless  as possible.  Mr. President,  the Department of  Defense is one of this Nation's largest  In a  530,000  producers of toxic waste, yet its record  at meeting State and Federal environ mental protection laws is deplorable.  This fact has become quite obvious to  citizens in Maine, where each of the  defense installations in the State has  been  found  to  be  in  violation  of  Maine's waste disposal  laws,  to  the  detriment of the health and safety of  nearby residents. In fact, one site in  northern Maine,  the result bf  inad equate dumping  techniques, has  re cently been cleaned up with the help  of Superfund money, and another is  on  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency's list of  this Nation's worst  known hazardous waste sites. I suspect  that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  A recent report by the General Ac counting Office indicated that the De fense  Department  generated  over  tons of hazardous waste  in  1984, but  its  information collection  system is so faulty that it does not  know how many installations might be  in violation of the law.  The  Defense  Department  itself  admits  that the problem of defense  waste is a large one which demands at tention.  report  to  the Depart ment's inspector general, it was found  that:  First, hazardous waste programs are  fragmented and ineffective.  Second,  there are  inadequate haz ardous waste storage facilities at most  military bases.  Third, DOD's management of haz ardous waste storage is unsatisfactory.  Fourth, cleanup costs are escalating  more  rapidly  than money  is made  available to meet them.  Without adequate storage facilities,  the DOD tends to look for the easy  way out, finding ""hidden"" dump sites  or storing the waste inadequately for  a~ indefinite period of  time.  It is,  therefore, essential that funds for the  construction of storage facilities not  be reduced just at the moment that  DOD has begun to recognize  its re sponsibility  to act according  to  the  law.  The  administration  requested  $21.4 million  for  such construction,  and our amendment will ensure that  this amount is authorized by adding $5  million to the committee's authoriza tion level.  The bulk of the funds in our amend ment, $15.3 million, is earmarked for  the Department's environmental res toration account, which pays for the  cleanup of military hazardous waste  funds. A portion of this account will  also go toward hazardous waste reduc tion, recycling and reuse efforts. The  administration  request  for  this  ac count was $385.9 million, but the bill  before us reduces that request by $15.3  million, leaving the program with $8.5  million less than last year.  It is quite clear to me that this is an  extremely serious issue which deserves  our immediate attention. In light of  our recent hard work on the issue of  safe civilian hazardous waste disposal  and cleanup, I think that to cut these  defense waste cleanup accounts at this  time will leave a gaping hole in our  effort to ensure a clean environment  for ourselves and our children.  I urge the passage of this amend ment.  ",1986
902,218,14,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  this amendment has been requested  by the President and while it is a little  more money than we like to say ""yes""  to, this side takes it.  ",1986
903,218,14,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, I support  the amendment. I know it is for an im portant purpose. It was requested by  the administration. We are going to  have some real funding problems. Ev eryone should recognize that.  The amendment of the Senator from  Maine basically offsets this agreement  which is a worthy increase for environ mental cleanup but he offsets it with  operation and maintenance cuts. That  is my understanding of  the amend ment.  We are going to have some real prob lems in both the conference and as we  move along  in the process with the  overall funding as I already tried to  make clear.  I think this is a worthy amendment  and we support it.  ",1986
904,218,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.  ,1986
905,218,14,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I think  this is a very important amendment  and I hope it will be agreed to.  Protecting the public's health and  safety is one of the primary functions  of Government. Our children's future  is too valuable to allow any delay in  facing up to nuclear waste problems.  Delaying action will only cause more  extreme and difficult problems later.  The Federal Government should not  be excused from its responsibility. In stead we should be setting an example  for the rest of the country. I support  this amendment which deals with the  serious problem of nuclear waste gen erated  by military  facilities.  This  amendment will restore $15.3 million  for the Department of Defense's Envi ronmental Restoration Fund. It will  also provide $5.0 million for construc tion of waste storage facilities. Unfor tunately, much of the waste disposed  of at military  installations has been  done in ways which create health and  environmental hazards.  Our Nation needs  to move ahead  with all due speed on this challenge.  By taking this action we help to pro tect our Nation's natural heritage and  the health of generations to come.  ",1986

921,244,14,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing a bill which would  partially restore  the  limited circula tion postal rate which was  recently  eliminated in the consolidated Omni bus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.  That  rate  allowed  newspapers  and  other publications to mail at a less ex pensive postal rate if and only if they  circulated  less  than 5,000  copies of  their publication out of the county of  publication. The act repealed section  4358(g) of title 39 of the United States  Code.  This elimination has caused unin tended havoc to community newspa pers not only in Alaska but through out  the United States, particularly  those located on or near county lines.  As we all know well, these small news papers play a crucial role in the rural  areas of America, and in many areas  are the sole source of local news and  essential  information. As such,  they  are the bedrock upon which our infor mation system rests, and their impor tance to their communities and to the  Nation is without question.  Although  the National Newspaper  Association and  its members under stand the need for and support our  effort  to balance  the budget,  they  have asked for relief from the unin tended devastation that has hit the  many  small newspapers  that cover  more than one county. The elimina tion of the limited circulation rate to tally by the Omnibus Reconciliation  Act was the vehicle which caused this  unintended negative impact.  According to press reports, a number  of  local  newspapers  have  already  ceased publication because of the lack  of ability of rural newspapers to pro vide outside-of-county papers. For in stance, according to the June 18 issue  of the Louisville Courier-Journal, the  Robertson County Review folded on  June 5, 1986. Although a number of  reasons were given  for  the paper's  demise-as is always the case in these  situations-first on  the  list was  the  high  cost  of mailing. The paper's  demise  has  left Robertson County,  KY, without a  local newspaper. We  cannot afford to have this repeated in  other parts of the country.  While our concern was and has been  to see that large commercial publica tions are not subsidized by the taxpay ers  during  these  times  of massive  budget deficits, the rural press should  not . be  included among  that group.  Therr key role in disseminating local  information is simply too important to  tamper with. This role has historically  been recognized by Congress and is a  cornerstone of  this Nation's postal  policies.  Indeed, a recent study of preferred  rates by the Postal Rate Commission  ",1986

927,283,14,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, Fidel Cas tro's atrocities often go unnoticed. Here is an  illustration that should rate Mr. Castro along side Mr. Pinochet and Botha as one of the top  despots.  CASTRO, FAIR GAME  <By StephenS. Rosenfeld>  Each year on July 26, Fidel Castro cele brates the anniversary of the launching of  his revolution in Cuba. This year the festivi ties can be seen in a different light. The  price paid by Cuba's legions of political pris oners, who have made Castro the leading  jailer in the world, is finally becoming clear.  The  person most  responsible  for  this  change  is  Armando  Valladares,  whose  memoir of his 22 years as Castro's prisoner  came out here in May, following publication  in Europe. ""Against All Hope"" is a book and  a  political  event. For Valladares  is  the  Cuban Solzhenitsyn, another writer whose  report from a revolution's heart of darkness  burst through the haze of propaganda, inat tention and state debate and brought the  West's consciousness to a new place.  As happens, ""Against All Hope"" has pro voked reviews extending beyond the book  into the political culture. Many ask how the  phenomenon of  innocents held  in bestial  prisons could have existed into the third  decade of Cuban communism, yet only now  does the general political community start  to see it truly.  And only now does the mass of Cubans  become concretely aware of the unjust inEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  carceration and inhuman torture of their  fellow citizens, thanks to the 10 programs  based on the book broadcast to Cuba earlier  this year by  the American government's  Radio Marti.  The American right,  to account for the  broader public's ignorance of Cuban prisons,  pounces on what it sees as the propensity of  American liberals to view Castro  through  rose-colored glasses-for considerations of  sympathy,  ""peace,"" guilt,  radical chic or  whatever.  The left, which is embarrassed but per haps not as much as it ought to be, cites cir cumstances. For  instance,  it is suggested  apologetically  that when  the American  human rights movement got up steam in  the 1970s, its necessary priority was the im mediate and gory outrages of right-wing re gimes. Others suggest that the few releases  of prisoners Castro has recently made, and  the current possibilities of negotiating the  emigration of other Cuban prisoners, finally  sensitized our public to the issue.  It is evident that Ronald Reagan has pre sided over changes in the political atmos phere  that  have  finally made Castro's  crimes both fair and necessary game-and  not only  for Americans  concerned with  human rights but perhaps increasingly for  Latins, whom Castro is otherwise so ready  to instruct in anti-Yankee ways. But there is  another consideration, one that goes to the  peculiar relationship between politics and  literature.  I had lunch with Armando Valladares in  1982 a few weeks after Castro released him  in response to an appeal by French Presi dent Francois Mitterand. Valladares had  written prison poems; the French are good  about appealing for poets. Valladares was  thin and gaunt, a man of sad eyes and halt ing speech, quiet and rather calm, strangely  dispassionate: a victim of a terrible system,  but-how unfair it is to say this about him not a compelling figure or one with what  seemed to me a compelling story.  recall  thinking he was still sick and tired and in a  strange place;  translation added another  veil.  Only his book made plain that here was  one of the enduring works of prison litera ture, the century's distinguishing genre: a  record of state violence and individual re sistance, authentically told, inspiring, unfor gettable. Television may be the medium of  contemporary politics, but literature con veys the dimension of individual character.  The  one  creates  celebrities,  the  other  heroes, like Armando Valladares.  Some in the West still regard Castro as  the fun dictator, bask in the glow of six hour talks with him, consider him someone  we all need to understand better. Valladares  seems to me to understand him perfectly,  and closes his book with a lie Castro told in  1983, while Valladares was rotting: ""From  our point of view, we have no human-rights  problem-there have been no 'disappeareds'  here,  there have been no  tortures here,  there have been no murders here. In 25  years of revolution, in site of the difficulties  and dangers we have passed through, tor ture has never been committed, a crime has  never been committed.""  I  19615  EMERGENCY DROUGHT RELIEF  BILL  HON. BUTLER DERRICK  OF SOUTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 5, 1986  ",1986
928,283,14,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, tomorrow  the  House of Representatives will vote on  the  emergency drought relief  legislation. I rise  in  strong support of H.R. 5288, and would like to  take this opportunity to commend the chair man of the Agriculture Committee as well as  the other committee members for  their fine  leadership in bringing this measure to the floor  in such an expeditious manner. I would also  like  to express my appreciation to Chairman  DE LA GARZA for allowing me to have input  into  the  recommendations  reported by  the  committee.  The Southeast  is  experiencing  its worst  drought  in 1 00 years. Rainfall  in my home  State of South Carolina  is  some 15  to 20  inches below normal  since  the first of  the  year. Compounding this situation are the rec ordbreaking temperatures.  These conditions are expected  to cause  $200 million  in crop losses in South Carolina  alone. Our cattle and dairy  producers are  facing a very critical time. Pastures have dried  up, feed is scarce, and the livestock is starv ing. As a result, the State's livestock markets  are being flooded with cattle as farmers take  to slaugther those animals they can no longer  feed.  The Southeast is  truly suffering, and  it  is  heartwarming to note the voluntary assistance  that  is being offered. Over  the  last several  weeks, our farmers have seen and felt  the  generosity of others all  across  the country  through donations of hay, money, and man power. Governors, State agriculture depart ments, and transportation companies have all  joined together in the relief effort. This help is  greatly appreciated.  Just last week the Secretary of Agriculture  declared  that all but  two counties  in South  Carolina have sustained sufficient  losses  to  warrant a disaster designation,  triggering  the  general disaster relief laws. While low-interest  FmHA loans will help, the fact of the matter is  many of our farmers are in such dire straits  that they just can't afford to take on any more  debt. The Secretary has also announced that  USDA will  take some additional steps to aid  the drought-stricken farmers, but it is my firm  belief that we can do more.  H.R. 5288 will expand on existing authorities  to meet the needs of our farmers. The bill will  provide for an emergency livestock and poul try  feed program, disaster payments and a  delay  in payments of  the dairy assessment  program. This measure will go a  long way in  addressing  this desperate situation.  In addi tion, it will insure that we have in place emer gency steps should other areas be hit by simi lar drought conditions or by floods.  I wish to stress to my colleagues the seri ousness of  this matter  in my  region of  the  country. H.R. 5288 is vital to the livelihood of  all of our Nation's farmers, and I urge my col leagues to join me in  the bipartisan adoption  of this legislation.  ",1986
929,309,14,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker,  last  evening NBC nightly news carried a  special report on medical insurance for  the elderly. It found that the Ameri can elderly are not getting the kind of  insurance they need. Indeed, they are  paying dearly for the wrong coverage.  Last week the Department of Health  and Human Services said total spend ing  for health care  in  the United  States  rose  8.9  percent-S  percent  higher  than  the overall Consumer  Price  Index of 3.9 percent. Benefit  payments under  the Medicare Pro gram increased even faster than over all health spending-12.2 percent..  By 1984, health spending not paid by  Medicare again equaled 15 percent of  the  average  old  person's  income almost equal to the share by the elder ly prior to the enactment of the MecU care Program.  For all too many Medicare benefici aries, the cost of an acute and serious  illness has once again become cata strophic.  Mr. Speaker, last week I introduced  legislation to expand Medicare by of fering its beneficiaries two additional  supplementary medical insurance op tions. The bill is primarily designed to  protect the elderly from  rising cost  requirements  that have  in creased rapidly over the past decade.  The proposal will reduce out-of-pocket  costs  for  the elderly and eliminate  much of the confusion for both con sumers and providers. And it will not  result in any additional costs to the  Federal Government.  The time has come for Congress to  address this problem and restore the  health benefits  they were promised  under Medicare.  sharing  THE  SUPPORT A DELAY IN THE PRO DUCTION  OF  BIGEYE  BOMB  <Mr. PORTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
930,309,14,Mr. PORTER.," Mr.  Speaker,  last  month  the GAO  released  its most  complete report ever on the Bigeye  nerve gas bomb. After 25  years of  work,  they  clearly  state  that  the  Bigeye simply does not work.  After the Bigeye unexpectedly ex ploded  in 1982, many changes were  made to the bomb and its delivery tac tics. After a year of analysis, the GAO  stated:  What changes in bomb design and oper ational  tactics have done  to shift  the  burden       to the pilot by adding con straints, reducing his safety, increasing the  speed of calculations      <he has> little as surance that the bomb, once delivered, will  be effective.  is  I urge you to support the Fascell Porter-Roukema-Hoyer amendment to  the authorization bill to allow another  year's work on the Bigeye and better  alternatives. Rather than spend  the  billion dollars Bigeye  is projected to  cost, lets get to work on alternatives  that do not threaten the pilot and ac tually work.  Mr.  Speaker,  the GAO  says  it  doesn't work and the Europeans say  they do not want it; let's send it back  for improvements.  NEW SCREENING AVAILABLE  FOR BREAST CANCER  <Ms. OAKAR asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)  ",1986
931,309,14,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, the No.1  or No. 2 killer of women is still breast  cancer. One out of 7 to 10 women in  this country will acquire breast cancer  this year. I have introduced legislation  in Medicare to deal with prevention.  We do not have cancer screening, let  alone free physicals as part of  the  Medicare Program. I want to join my  colleague, Mr. BoNKER,  in addressing  this problem.  This week we have a unique oppor tunity in Washington to bring atten tion to the situation. The Benjamin  Franklin IJterary and Medical Society  will sponsor a mammobile which will  provide free breast cancer screening  by mammography for women over 35  years of age.  0 1020  This mobile unit will be parked at  the Senate  trolley car stop at  the  north end of the Capitol Plaza all this  week from 8:30  to 5:30 and at  the  House trolley car stop at the south  end of the Capitol Plaza during the  week of August 11 from 8:30 to 5:30.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all women who  work on the Capitol grounds and all  women who are visiting Washington to  take advantage of this mammography.  We need to know that it is free, it is a  simple  treatment, and  it can detect  cancer at its earliest stages and save  your lives.  LEGISLATION  JOBS, CRIPPLE  PROPOSED  WOULD COST  INDUSTRY  <Mr. KINDNESS  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
932,309,14,Mr. KINDNESS.," Mr. Speaker, legis lation which would take another step  in the crippling of U.S. industry and  threaten the jobs of American workers  is expected to be considered on the  floor of this House soon.  H.R. 1309,  the High Risk Occupa tional Disease Notification and Pre vention Act of 1986, would create a  complicated, duplicative system of no tifying workers of occupational risks.  The subject  is already regulated by  OSHA.  There are many provisions  in the  legislation which cause great concern,  but a potential increase in tort litiga tion is a certain result of enactment of  such legislation. The U.S. Department  of Justice has estimated that the cost  to  the Federal Government of such  additional  litigation could swell  into  hundreds of millions and perhaps even  billions of taxpayer dollars, in addition  to higher costs to produce U.S. goods  to compete with cheaper imports.  Our U.S.  courts  cannot  readily  absorb  this  additional  litigation  burden, and U.S.  taxpayers and con sumers should not be burdened by this  added expense.  Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that if  H.R. 1309  is enacted, we are talking  about a potential tidal wave of litiga tion, which threatens the livelihood of  U.S. employers and workers.  In the  State of Ohio, we simply cannot afford  to lose any more jobs or businesses.  The U.S. steel industry is fighting  for its life against intense competition  worldwide. By  imposing burdensome  requirements and  increased costs on  employers, H.R. 1309 further erodes  the competitive position of steel and  related  industries. Given  the mam moth trade deficits we are experienc ing, where would  this bill  leave us  down the road?  And the steel industry is just one ex ample.  I would  encourage my  col leagues to check with manufacturing  businesses  in  their own districts  to  find out how H.R. 1309 will  impact  jobs in their areas.  Worker risk notification is a proper  requirement, as already recognized by  OSHA in its ""Hazard Communication  Standard,"" but this is a bad bill which  ",1986
933,322,14,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to com mend my  colleague,  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. BIAGGI], for his  work on behalf of the gifted and tal ented students. As the gentleman so  eloquently  stated,  these  youngsters  will transform and invigorate our cul ture and economy.  In the sixties, our emphasis was on  those who were not receiving an equal  opportunity for a good education in  these United States. I think the major  responsibility of the Federal Govern ment is to make sure that each young ster, no matter where they live, what  their naLle is, what their color may be  or their language, have an opportunity  for a good education. I think we were  quite effective. We have a long way to  go, but I think that momentum is con tinuing to carry forth.  In the seventies, we did shift, tempo rarily at any  rate and  in  a  small  manner, our efforts toward the gifted  and  talented.  In  the more affluent  school districts, of course, this issue is  being handled and being handled very  well. Unfortunately, in many districts  with less ability to finance their edu-.  cational programs, it is not going forth  as it should.  Like the last bill, I wish I could jump  wholeheartedly in support of the legis lation, because the intention is good  and the need is there.  0 1140  Like  the  last bill,  I  really do not  need any demonstration projects,  I  know what  to do  in relationship  to  dropouts. If you give me $4 billion a  year, as a matter of fact, I can take  care of that working with 3and 4year-olds  and  their parents at  the  same  time, because unless we work  with both, we will not succeed in that  area.  Unfortunately, I must repeat what I  said the last time which I said I would  play that record over again. My con cern is twofold: If this legislation does  not get appropriated,  then we ha.ve  sent out false hope again. If it does get  appropriated,  then I have  that con cern of which existing programs will  be cut because of that $30 billion or  more that we are apparently going to  be over when that snapshot is taken in  this month of August.  In fact, we have been told by OMB it  is over. We have been told by CBO  that it is dramatically above the $144  billion. I support Mr. BIAGGI's efforts.  Unfortunately, again, I had hoped we  could take this money from the Secre tary's discretionary fund. One of the  gentlemen  in  the  committee  from  Michigan always says that we want to  make sure that we use all that discre tionary fund and that the Secretary  does not get an opportunity to use any  of it. The last one I had hoped we  would take from JTPA so that as a  matter of  fact  it could go  forward.  This, I had hoped, would come from  the Secretary's discretionary fund. Un fortunately, we  are asking  for new  money and a new program.  The idea is proper; the idea is good;  the idea is necessary. Will we be send ing a false signal?  Mr. Chairman, I would like to com mend my colleague from New York,  Mr. BIAGGI, for his work on behalf of  the gifted and talented students. As he  has so eloquently stated, these young sters will transform and invigorate our  culture and economy.  The Education and Labor Commit tee held a number of hearings which  raised Member's awareness on impor tant educational problems. These  in cluded illiteracy, school dropouts, drug  abuse, youth suicide, gifted and talent ed, and technology education. While  all of these are important issues facing  the Nation's schools, I don't feel Con gress is in the position to create a new  categorical program for each of these  concerns. In fact, because of my role  on the Budget Committee, I stated at  the beginning of this fiscal year that I  would not support any new program  which was not contained in the budget  or received its funding from an exist ing appropriation. In light of the pro jected increase in the fiscal year 1987  deficit, I feel more strongly about this  now more than ever. The worst thing  that could happen to Federal support  for education is to allow the sequestra tion process to unthinkingly cut our  finest programs.  So while I would like to again com mend Mr. BIAGGI  for his hard work  and concern, I will have to withhold  my wholehearted  support  for H.R.  3263 and work to maintain funding for  existing educational programs.  ",1986
934,322,14,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  BlAGG I].  Mr. BlAGG!. I thank the gentleman  for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I would first like to  thank the ranking minority member,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. GooDLING]  for his kind remarks  with relatio:::l to this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, as author of H.R.  3263,  the Gifted and Talented Chil dren and Youth Education Act, I rise  today in strong support of this impor tant education legislation.  I  am pleased  to note  that  I  am  joined in this effort by 89 of my col leagues on a strong, bipartisan basis.  They have joined me in this effort for  they beleive, as I strongly do, that the  Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that the best and bright est of our Nation's students are ade quately, effetively, and more specifi cally  served  by  our  educational  system.  This legislation will  target Federal  assistance to support State and local  programs that address the unique and  pressing needs of gifted and talented  children and youth. It is certainly leg islation that is long overdue.  A report issued in 1983, ""a Nation at  Risk,"" by the National Commission on  Excellence in Education, noted, ""over  half the population of gifted students  do not match their tested ability with  comparable  achievement  in  school""  and ""both the number and proportion  of  students  demonstrating  superior  achievement in the scholastic aptitude  test have also dramatically declined.""  One clear recommendation emerged:  ""The Federal Government in coopera tion with States and localities, should  help meet the needs of key groups of  students such as the grifed and talent ed.""  Until 1981, the Federal Government  provided for gifted and talented pro grams under the Gifted and Talented  Children's Education Act, authorized  by my distinguished former colleague  from New York, Senator Jacob Javits.  Until its demise, this program annual ly provided $6 million for these educa tional efforts. Today, programs for the  gifted and talented can be operated by  States through the chapter 2 educa tion block grant, funding this and 29  other programs, But it is clear that  under this funding method, gifted and  talented  programming  is  suffering  from acute educational neglect.  Consider for example, that only 13  percent of the school districts current ly receiving funds under chapter 2 al locate any money at all for gifted edu cation.  Consider that 36 States require no  certification or special coursework of  any kind for teachers of gifted and tal ented children.  Consider that there are only 56 full time gifted and  talented consultants  employed by State education agencies  across the entire Nation; 56 people to  serve 2.5 million of this Nation's most  promising students.  And consider that at this time, we  spend only $5 per child  in Federal  funds to support the best and bright est of our Nation's students. In addi tion, we are unable to serve 1% million  of these students who have been iden tified as gifted, but receive no special  education at all.  We must provide a national program  to specifically serve  these particular  students in need.

935,348,14,Ms. FIEDLER.," Mr. Chairman, in ad dition to these points, there is the fact  that they do not know where they are  going, and  they do not really know  what it is going to cost if they do not  know where  they are going because  th~y are talking about its being possi bly underground for part of the way  and possibly above ground for part of  the way, and they will find out when  they get there.  In addition  to  that,  they have al ready begun to waste some of our tax payers' money on this project. I refer ence anotht.  article in the .Los Ange les Times th~s week about the metro rail  system. Now,  remember,  this  project has not been finally  funded  and an agreement has not been made.  They are  talking about  spending a  half million dollars alone on art work  for the subway system. It seems to me  that if they cannot figure out what  the cost is going to be for the actual  construction and safety requirements  that have been suggested by the spe cial technical committee but they can  spend their time figuring out how to  waste a half million dollars on art  work, they are really running in the  wrong direction and it would be very  unwise of this House to approve this  system  today without adopting  the  Waxman amendment, which, I believe,  will provide the necessary protections  the House  for  future  approval  if  should deem it necessary.

938,348,14,Mr. WAXMAN.," I thank the gentle woman for yielding.  The gentlewoman does  speak cor rectly when she  indicates  that she  alone opposed  this Metrorail system  several years ago and the rest of us  supported it.  I am pleased now that  she is supporting my amendment, and  perhaps she  is pleased  that  I have  come to agree with her.  ",1986
939,348,14,Ms. FIEDLER., Absolutely.  ,1986
940,348,14,Mr. WAXMAN.," We are in agreement  that there are serious questions about  this whole system, enough so that we  ought not to go forward.  We had a technical committee look  at the first 4.4 miles. They are ready  to start digging for that first 4.4 miles.  The technical committee talked about  abandoned oil wells. There used to be  a  lot of oil in the Los Angeles area.  They had a lot of oil wells, and the oil  was pumped out. They asked what  would happen if they would hit an oil  well. VI ell, there would be a potential  explosion.  So they said, ""Well, they have got to  get some sensing devices.""  There is no such thing as a sensing  device that will alert them until they  hit one of those abandoned oil wells.  They are going to have to feel their  way through, put bells and whistles on  all the equipment and hope that they  are lucky.  It is a tenet of my liberal faith to be  for rapid transit, and I speak to my  Democratic colleagues who heard the  gentleman from California  [Mr. AN DERSON]  talk about why Los Angeles  needs rapid transit.  We need something desperately. We  have congestion, we have  too much  traffic and we have too much pollu tion from automobiles, but because we  want something does not mean that  this is what we ought to vote for and  ram through wh €n  it does not make  sense. We have got  to reevaluate  it  even though the RTD people are not  willing  to step back and  reevaluate  their own mistakes.  I  just want to point out to my col leagues  that  there have been  times  when we have voted for  things that  did not turn out to be what the most  optimistic supporters  indicated  they  should be. We should not repeat the  mistakes of other cities.  New York City is just completing a  $1 billion subway tunnel that has a  leaking roof and no connection points  to the subway system. Pittsburgh suf fered through many years of embarrassment with a multimillion dollar  bridge that went nowhere.  We do not need a tunnel in Los An geles that is going to explode and is  ",1986
941,361,14,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in strong support of H.R. 3129,  the Sur face Transportation and Uniform Relocation  Assistance Act of 1986. Passage of the bill  will provide  for a 5-year continuation of  the  Nation's highway and transit programs.  The bill, as reported out of committee, will  provide Arkansas over $100.4 million in fiscal  year  1987  for  highway  formula  programs  which include the interstate resurfacing, resto ration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction  [4R],  primary,  secondary,  urban,  bridge,  hazard  elimination, and railroad highway crossing pro grams. The State would also get $28.8 million  under the minimum allocation program, which  provides States with at least 85 percent of the  amounts they contribute to the highway trust  fund.  This means that Arkansas would receive a  total of about $129.2 million under the basic  Federal-Aid Program, exclusive of demonstra tion projects and any discretionary grants the  State may receive. Funding  in each of fiscal  years 1988-91 would be roughly the same.  The bill  contains a provision, authorizing  $45 million over the next 5 years to accelerate  construction of Highway 71  as a  four-lane  highway, with another $45 million provided for  U.S.  71  in Missouri. About one-half of  the  funding for the Arkansas portion would go for  design and preliminary right-of-way acquisition,  while the other half would go for construction.  The State would receive $5 million for the  project in fiscal year 1987; $5 million in fiscal  year 1988; $10 million in fiscal year 1989; $10  million in fiscal year 1990; and $15 million in  1991. The $45 million total is over and above  what Arkansas  received under  the  formula  and minimum allocation programs.  Another provision would allow Arkansas to  use interstate construction funds for planning,  design, and construction of Highway 71. Al though the State's interstate segment is com plete and normally  interstate  funds must be  used for 4-R work, the bill gives Arkansas the  option of using its interstate funds for Highway  71.  Also provided  in  the bill  is $8.5 million  in  fiscal year 1987 for a highway demonstration  project at Fort Smith, which involves widening  a segment of the highway connecting Westark  Community College and the New Central Mall  and improving signalization on the segment.  The bill approves $13.3 million funding for  construction of four grade separations on a  four-lane bypass route at Jonesboro to dem onstrate methods of improving highway safety.  The project would receive $2.5 million in fiscal  year 1987; $3.2 million  in  fiscal year 1989;  $2.6 million in fiscal year 1990; and $3.2 mil lion in fiscal year 1991.  It should be noted that all of these funds  come out of the highway trust fund and there fore do not add to the Federal deficit.  The legislation also directs the Secretary of  Transportation, in cooperation with Louisiana,  Arkansas, and Missouri, to study the feasibility  of constructing a highway  from Shreveport,  LA, to Texarkana. Fort Smith, and Fayetteville,  AR, and Carthage and Kansas City, MO. A  report on the study's results is to be submitted  to Congress within a year after the bill's en actment.  Arkansas would also be given  the option,  under the bill's provision, to utilize part of its  bridge replacement  funds  to replace existing  ferryboat service with a highway bridge, and  the Federal share for the cost of that replace ment would be 80 percent.

942,361,14,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr. Chairman,  any of us who has had occasion to use Wash ington's Dulles Airport in the 2 years since the  Dulles access  road was completed, knows  that the most modern airport is of little use  unless passengers can reach it easily. Before  Dulles had a fast, direct access road,  it was  an empty barn virtually ignored by most major  airlines and passengers. Since  then,  it has  quickly become the air travel hub it was first  envisioned to be two decades ago.  As quickly as Dulles is expected to grow, it  will not even come close to the explosion in  passengers which will be experienced by On tario  International Airport near Los Angeles.  The airport is expected to grow from a current  3 million passengers per year to 11 million by  the year 2000. To accommodate this increase,  Ontario  is undergoing a $300 million  facelift  which will give it the capacity to handle double  that number.  Unfortunately, Ontario faces the same prob lem which once plagued Dulles: space age  airport  facilities  coupled  with  stone  age  access. We are  fortunate  that  the  land sur rounding the airport is still relatively inexpen sive; it will not always be so. That is why the  $4 million contained in this bill is so crucial. If  we do not begin  to solve Ontario's access  problem, we will soon be talking about sums  far in excess of the current cost estimate.  Despite having  the second  largest popula tion and  the greatest surface area of any  major metropolitan area, Los Angeles  is still  basically served by one major airport, Los An geles  International. Meanwhile,  those who  travel  to New York have a choice of  three  major airports, as do travelers to the Nation's  Capital. Ontario International will soon be able  to provide  the much needed alternative  for  those who  fly  to Los Angeles, but only  if  ground access is  improved. This provision  in  this bill  is  the  first  step  in  this  important  project, and  I am delighted to see it moving  ahead.  0 1645  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. STENHOLM  ",1986

944,374,14,Mr. FAUNTROY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong support of H.R. 5081, the Assistance  for Democracy Act of 1986. As chairman of  the Congressional Task Force of Haiti  I will  confine my statement to title It-promoting de mocracy in Haiti. I do, however, want to con gratulate our distinguished colleague, Chair man STEPHEN J. SOLARZ, whose  leadership  on the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Af fairs and on our relations with the Philippines  is so well reflected in title I of this bill. I enthu si&atically support the authorizations provided  for in title !-promoting democracy in the Phil ippines and the aspirations of the people of  that nation for a democratic Mure.  I want  to express my appreciation  to  the  chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,  DANTE FASCELL, for the care and cooperative  spirit given and tended during the process of  crafting the sections of this legislation which  have as  their purpose assisting  the coura geous Haitian people in a transition to democracy. I also want to commend the staff repre senting  the members of  the Congressional  Task Force on Haiti who put in many hours  and proceeded carefully and artfully  in  their  work on title II.  Section 202 earmarks $1 09 million in eco nomic assistance for Haiti in fiscal year 1987.  not less than $36 million in economic support  funds, not  less  than $37 million  in develop ment assistance, not less than $35 million in  Public Law 480 food assistance, and not less  than $1 million for the inter-American founda tion for programs in Haiti. The funds author ized in section 202 are to be used to support  job creation,  rural development, health care  and sanitation, small scale irrigation, reforesta tion and land conservation, and literacy edu cation.  I am very pleased also that the committee  in its report recognizes the efforts of the inter im Government of Haiti to take legal actions  throughout  the globe attempting  to  recoup  funds and other properties allegedly stolen by  those associated with  the Duvalier dictator ship. The return of such resources in signifi cant amounts could have a major impact on  the Government of Haiti's fiscal position and  on efforts to promote economic recovery and  national reconstruction. With this in mind, the  committee report notes that Haiti has experi enced difficulty in accumulating the collateral  required  to attain  court adjudication of  its  claims. Therefore, the committee in its wisdom  believes  that our Government should seek  every appropriate method to assist Haiti with  this  problem  including  providing  economic  support funds to Haiti for meeting this objec tive.  Section 202 also reflects a proper and nec essary concern for a democratic transition and  human rights in Haiti by stipulating a number  of  important benchmarks. Funds earmarked  for Haiti  in economic support and develop ment assistance may be obligated only if the  President determines that the interim Govern ment of Haiti is:  Implementing its timetable for completion of  a  new  constitution  that promotes genuine  democratic reforms and guarantees the funda mental principles of democracy;  Establishing a framework for free and open  elections leading to a democratically elected  civilian government, which would include free  and  function:ng political parties and associa tions,  free  labor unions, and freedom of the  press;  Continuing  its  investigation  of  alleged  human  rights abuses and corruption by  the  Duvalier government and is prosecuting, in ac cordance with due process, those responsible  for human rights abuses and corruption; and  Maintaining a free and independent judiciary  system.  Additional,  conditionality  seeks  to  insure  that the resources authorized  in  this section  are used efficiently. Specifically, the President  must also determine that the interim Govern ment of Haiti is:  Cooperating  fully  in  implementing United  States development, food and other economic  assistance programs  in Haiti  (including pro grams for prior fiscal years); and  Maintaining a system of fiscal accountability  to ensure that all resources allocated to the  development of Haiti are used in the most ef fective and efficient manner.  Economic support  funds authorized under  section 202 and provided to the Government  of Haiti are required to be deposited in a seg regated account and maintained separately  from other financial resources of the Govern ment of Haiti.  Section 203 seeks to promote a dramatic  transformation of the Haitian Armed Forces, to  define through this authorization the purposes  and delineate with strict and tight conditional ity the provision of any appropriations for mili tary assistance  to Haiti. Section 203 sets a  ceiling of $4 million  in such assistance, and  restricts  this assistance  to  international mili tary  education  and  training  and  nonlethal  forms such as transportation equipment, com munications equipment,  and  uniforms. The  Congressional Task Force on Haiti's concern  that such assistance only be used to reform  and  reorganize  the  security  forces  in  a  manner congruent to democratic and constitu tional government  is  reflected  in  the condi tions that must be satisfied prior to the alloca tion of such assistance.  Under these provisions assistance can be  provided only if the President certifies that:  The Government of Haiti has submitted a  formal  request  specifying a  comprehensive  plan for the reform and reorganization of the  mission, command, and control structures of  the Haitian Armed Forces consistent with a  transition to democracy, the rule of law, con stitutional law, and an elected civilian govern ment.  It should be noted that a considerable  effort has been made by  the Congressional  Task Force on Haiti  to analyze  the Haitian  Armed Forces. It has been concluded that it is  imperative that such units as  the Dessalines  Tactical Battalion, the Leopards, the Presiden tial Guard, and  the Service Detective be re structured to perform functions other than in ternal security, such as securing the borders  of Haiti, and civic action, such as  rebuilding  the physical  infrastructure of Haiti.  It is also  clear that such a restructuring will require new  command and control and  the dispersal or  dismantling of  these units  into other newly  formed units. We don't want this assistance in  the wrong hands.  Additionally, and also prior to the allocation  of any appropriations under section 203  the  President must certify  to  the Congress  that  the Government of Haiti is making substantial  effort:  To prevent the  involvement of the Haitian  Armed Forces  in human  rights abuses and  corruption by removing from those forces and  prosecuting, in accordance with due process,  those military personnel  responsible  for  the  human rights abuses and corruption;  To ensure that freedom of speech and as sembly are respected;  To conduct investigations into the killings of  unarmed civilians in Gonaives, Martissant, and  Fort Dimanche,  to prosecute,  in accordance  with due process, those responsible for those  killings and to prevent any similar occurrences  in the future;  To provide education and  training  to  the  Haitian Armed Forces with respect to interna tionally recognized human rights and the politi cal and civil rights essential to democracy, in  ",1986

These are two giants from Iowa that  are  leaving us, and I have had  the  privilege to serve with these two gen tlemen on the House Agriculture Com mittee,  and  I  believe  that CooPER  EVANS and BERKLEY BEDELL have not  just served farmers and their respec tive districts, but I  feel that CooPER  and BERKLEY  have  served  farmers  throughout the State of Iowa.  COOPER EVANS and BERKLEY BEDELL  frankly have served production agri culture in America and across Amer ica, because of the giants they are.  Now,  the time that I have had to  spend with these two gentlemen has  been brief; it has just been one term.

950,400,14,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, it  is difficult to follow all those people  who have made these wonderful state ments, but I want to thank my col league for this opportunity to join in  this grand occasion of not only paying  respect, but I guess saying a heartfelt  ""Thank you"" to two very distinguished  Members of this body.  There is a card that I  think every  one of us has either looked at in the  Hallmark shops; we have purchased it,  we have given it or we have received it.  It starts out to a man or to a lady and  one opens the card and on the inside it  says, ""who is out standing in his field""  and it has this lonely person in this  wide field of oats or hay or whatever  the case may be.  You think of the sprawling fields of  Iowa. You  think of  these  two men.  You quickly think of these two men,  you quickly  think of  two gentlemen  who are  truly outstanding  in  their  many fields; in the fields of Iowa and  in the fields of government.  I have had the unique opportunity,  like so many of those who preceded  me, to work with these gentlemen on a  very close professional basis.  I came to the Congress with CooPER  EVANS and had the opportunity to sit  next to him in the House Agriculture  Committee. So unlike anyone who has  spoken  thus  far,  I have been  right  there;  through  the  1981  farm  bill,  through the 1985 farm bill,  through  all of the legislation in between, to sit  and  listen  to CooPER and his anec dotes, his insights, his perspectives, his  mountains of amendments.  The chairman of the Ag Committee  would want to know how long it was  going to take to finish a bill, and the  first  thing you would do  is  look at  CooPER EvANs to figure out how many  amendments he had today, and that  would probably give him the signal of  exactly what was going to occur.  CooPER, I think, will be remembered,  as my  distinguished  colleague Mr.  RoBERTS said, for probably his legisla tive expertise, and the guy who says it  does not matter who gets the credit as  long as we do it correctly. He was the  guy who, time and time again, would  tell us how we could implement what  we wanted to do.  In particular, I think we are going to  look at him in the area of the agricul ture budget, because he loved to serve  on that budget task force of the House  Agriculture Committee, and go over  the minute details of those numbers  and make recommendations.  Then I think we are going to remem ber him for his absolute commitment  to conservation, which was such an  overriding  concern with  him,  that  many have mentioned before, and I  think is indicative of his long insight  into where we want to go as a society.  Third, I  think we are going to re member him  in  the area of Farm  Credit Administration, for his exper tise in financial matters for that legis lation and what was involved in it; and  Fourth, I think we are going to re member him not only for those three  areas, but we are going to remember  him for the commodity futures legislation; something which is very compli cated and has only probably three or  four people in the entire House who  can be considered experts on  that.  CooPER is one of them.  CooPER was able to, constantly back  in 1981 and again this year when we  reauthorized the futures trading legis lation, to provide the kind of expertise  and insight our committee needed.  CooPER also  is very special  in the  fact that for me, unlike the rest of  you, he has family as his constituents.  My sister and brother-in-law and their  family happen to be constituents of  COOPER.  I think they put it best. It was my  sister who said, ""You know, CooPER  grows on you. You get to know him  initially and you  say he's a  rather  quiet,  reserved man. The next  time  you  talk  to him you  realize  there's  some depth there and as you talk to  him, your appreciation, your respect  and your good will  to this guy only  continues to grow and grow.""  That  is  really what CooPER  about.  He has been there, he has been out standing, he has been credible to each  and every one of us, and I am going to  miss that guy just to the left of me on  the Ag Committee; I am going to miss  his expertise; I am going to miss his  counsel.  is all  0 2235  The other gentleman  that we are  saying ""thank you"" to and ""good-bye""  to today is everybody's friend, BERK LEY BEDELL. BERKLEY, if he has any en emies, I do not know who they are. He  may have some opponents but I do not  think he ever had an enemy.  PAT ROBERTS suggested, and I think  ""ToM"" TAUKE suggested as well, that  we know BERKLEY for his efforts first  and  foremost  in  the plight of  the  farmer. Whether you agree or disagree  with BERKLEY's commitment as to how  you are going to raise that money, this  guy and I wish the rest of you, and I  wish every farmer in this country had  been  in  that Agriculture Committee  not just in 1981 but since then, last  year as we fought and agonized over  the 1985 farm bill, to watch the abso lute total commitment of mind, body,  and soul to the plight of the American  farmer which BERKLEY  BEDELL  ex pressed and articulated so eloquently.  Somehow or another the farmers of  this country would feel a lot better of  what this Government was trying to  do if they knew and realized the com mitment  that  people  like BERKLEY  bring to that.  Second,  though,  I,  too,  remember  BERKLEY not only for his work on the  Agriculture Committee because we all  have districts with particular parochi al needs and we try to represent those  to  the best of our ability. BERKLEY  went well above and beyond his com",1986

992,426,14,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  recently had the pleasure of attending  a dinner at which White House Chief  of Staff Donald T. Regan was present ed with the coveted Iron Mike Award  of the Marine Corps League. I know  my colleagues join me in congratulat ing Mr. Regan on receiving this pres tigious award. He has served with dis tinction in the Marine Corps, partici pating in five major battle campaigns,  and retiring as a lieutenant colonel.  During his 5% years of active duty,  Mr. Regan was awarded  five battle  stars, a commendation ribbon, and a  theatre  ribbon. Following his active  duty, he was in the Marine Reserves  for 2 years. Donald Regan has contin ued his fine record of service to his  country as the 66th Secretary of the  Treasury and  as  the White House  Chief of Staff.  I ask unanimous consent  that the  fine speech which Mr. Regan made  before the Marine Corps League upon  his acceptance of this award be includ ed in the RECORD at the conclusion of  my remarks.  There being no objection, the speech  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  MARINE CORPS LEAGUE DINNER  <By Donald T. Regan>  We Marines have a saying: There is no  such thing as an ex-Marine. And standing  here,  this evening-with people like your selves and the members of this great Marine  Corps League-! can assure you: The heart  knows how true that saying is, as true as it  was 40  years ago when a young  recruit  proudly wore his first globe and anchor.  It's a deeply humbling moment for me: to  accept this award-a most coveted one. To  stand here tonight is also to realize that in a  world of confused allegiances and divided  loyalties, some  things never change,  that  some traditions like those embodied by the  Marine Corps League live on; and that there  are those who remain upright, who remain  always faithful.  But if I  feel as one with you tonight, I  must act as one as well. So I must live up to  the Marine code and tell the blunt truth.  Ladies and gentlemen, I confess I am sorely  tempted this evening-like any good Marine  on such an occasion-to reminisce, to tell  some stories.  Now I realize that to do so in such distin guished company runs a considerable risk,  particularly as I  look out and see some of  the most prominent members of the defense  establishment, not  to mention  so many  medals,  ribbons,  and stars. Of course,  I  learned as a young Marine how to defer to  rank. Well, not always. I remember a story  that a great American,  the  late Admiral  Rickover liked to tell about being an Admi ral. You know, I don'.t know why the Navy is  always coming up at Marine events, it's just  one of the oddest things. But anyway Admi ral Rickover  liked  to note  that  the day  before he received his promotion to Vice Ad miral, a horse named Rickover also won the  5th  race at Belmont Park. And Admiral  Rickover commented: no other Admiral in  history has had a whole horse named for  him. But as I say Marines are a little differ ent. I remember seeing another naval offi cer break in a Marine who was doing his  first duty on board a ship. And the officer  of the deck asked what he would do if a man  fell overboard. "" 'I would yell, Man over board!'"" the Marine said. The officer then  asked what he would do  if an officer fell  overboard. The Marine was  silent  for  a  moment  and  then  asked,  "" 'Which one,  sir?'""  So, with all the military experience out  here tonight, I'll be careful of my chutzpah;  I won't make the same kind of mistake. So I  don't think I should tell any stories tonight:  well, maybe one.  1943. New Georgia.  It  is hot. Captain  Regan, sitting in his tent in a pair of field  shoes and shorts, hears a huge commotion  outside. His Sergeant Major ducks  in and  says, ""Captain, you better come quick and  bring your sidearm.""  Outside a large group of troops have gath ered; the commotion is about an iguana who  has been driven high up a coconut  tree.  Some of the Marines are shouting, others  are throwing rocks; some of the Marines are  from Brooklyn and think they have treed a  man-eating crocodile. There is a hue and cry  to shoot the reptile.  At this point, it is important to explain  that sometimes when  troops were being  moved or replaced in combat zones an order  would go out restricting ammunition clips to  only a few authorized individuals. This was  to avoid the kind of jumpiness and acciden tal firings that occur in the jungle, especial ly in darkness. As good Marines, we took it  as a matter of faith that this was the sort of  thing that only Army troops did, but we also  had to obey the orders.  So in a Marine company only one person  was authorized to shoot. And, as you have  guessed by now, only Captain Regan could  use his weapon. Now, ladies and gentlemen,  every officer has one such moment in his  career-a moment of truth, a moment when  it is all there, right on the line. See Captain  Regan surrounded by his Sergeant Major,  his first sergeants and his troops. See Cap tain Regan  take out his 45 and begin to  pray. See Captain Regan aim his 45 and  begin to sweat. See Captain Regan fire and  get  lucky. Watch  the  iguana fall. Watch  Captain Regan return to his tent and only  then begin to breathe again.  Permit me to turn now from reminiscing  to a subject of vital importance: the defense  budget. As you know, in his first term the  President expanded defense spending great ly. He did so in light of a pressing and obvi ous need to rebuild our Nation's defenses and he did so with broad political support.  ",1986

996,439,14,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  I  am glad to yield to the Senator from  New York [Mr. D'AMATO].  ",1986
997,439,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from New York is recognized.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise  not only to support this amendment,  but to commend the Senator from Ari zona, Senator DECoNciNI, for his con stant attempt to help utilize and mobi19,000  lize resources of this country in the  battle against drugs.  We talk about a drug war. The fact  of the matter is there is no drug war.  That  is, we  are not waging a war  against  those who bring drugs  into  this Nation. It is absolutely ludicrollti  to say that because we have undertak en some action, that we have begun to  wage war that we have really mobi lized, given the significance of what is  taking place in our communities today.  This proposal is a logical next step  in  the comprehensive drug  interdic tion strategy that we have been work ing  on-Senator  STEVENS,  Senator  CHILES,  Senator HAWKINS,  Senator  ABDNOR, and others-for years.  If we  are  serious about  stopping  more  than 1 percent of  the almost  flights  that carry drugs  into  this country, then endorsing and sup porting this initiative is the only logi cal step to do that.  Mr. President,  I  understand  that  there is a squeeze in resources on the  defense side. I vote for those defense  budgets. I am going to continue to do  so.  However, I cannot think of a more  important mission in the way of train ing, in the way of using our resources  to interdict those 19,000 planes that  carry their cargo of death and destruc tion into our neighborhoods and into  our communities. It is about time that  the Department of Defense  under stood that this is as important a mis sion as interdicting those who would  spread alien philosophies and  those  who would come and pose a threat to  our national security, whether it be  the Qadhafi's or  the Soviet Union  with their KGB people.  If we cannot  interdict  planes that are carrying these drugs,  then all of our wonderful defense sys tems go for naught.  This amendment, as Senator DECON CINI indicated, is in keeping with the  national  security  decision  directive  signed by the President on April 18. It  represents a plan agreed to by Attor ney General Meese  in  the National  Drug Enforcement Policy Board  in  June.  Senator DECONCINI  has  just  set  forth,  in a very clear and detailed,  manner, the history of bipartisan con gressional  support  for an  increased  Department of Defense role  in drug  interdiction.  I  think if we are going to do more  than just give rhetoric to the so-called  war against drugs,  then we have  to  support the adoption of this legislative  initiative to give to those who are in  this battle the tools to see to it that  we interdict the drug runners, to make  it more than a slim possibility  that  they may be apprehended, to begin to  say that, ""If you are running drugs  into  this country,  there  is  a  good  chance that we are going to interdict  the 19,000  you, prosecute you, and put an end to  this.""  0 1200  I hope that whatever difficulties do  exist in terms of accepting this amend ment could be worked out prior to a  vote because I would like to see this  amendment adopted unanimously, be cause we  then show concrete proof  that it is not just rhetoric, that we are  prepared  to mobilize nationally  this  war against drugs.  I urge my colleagues  to give  this  amendment their full and overwhelm ing support.  I thank the Chair.  ",1986
998,439,14,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that my name be  added as a cosponsor of the amend ment offered by the Senator from Ari zona.  ",1986
999,439,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1986
1000,439,14,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, I want  to take this opportunity to commend  the distinguished junior Senator from  Arizona  for  sponsoring  this amend ment. We have worked together very  closely over the past 5 years to develop  an air interdiction effort. He has been  a key player in the effort and deserves  much credit. We have made strides,  but we have a  long way  to go. The  assets provided by  this amendment  will help considerably.  Yesterday  the  President  of  the  United States declared war on drug  abuse. It is a major problem facing  this Nation today. No one can deny  that. We have tried as hard as we have  to provide support  to  the men and  women on this country's front lines of  defense against  the drug  trafficker.  Quite  frankly  the support we have  given has been modest at best. I am  sure my good friend, Senator DECON CINI, will agree with me when I say we  are glad the administration is coming  to our aid.  I am just sorry to say it has taken  too long. We have a long way to go.  The drug problem is epidemic in this  country. There are many steps which  must be  taken. These steps  include  education of our people. We must cut  down on the demand. That, however,  is a  long term process. In the mean time we must interrupt drug traffick ing. Detection and interdiction provide  the means  to  that end. The dopers  have had the upper hand  too  long.  They have been better financed and  better equipped. The assets provided  in  this amendment will provide  the  state of the art equipment to the good  guys. It will make an impact.  I am very happy to be a cosponsor of  this  amendment  and urge my  col leagues to join in its support.  e ",1986

1005,452,14,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  as I remarked earlier, the administra tive branch of our Government does  not get their things down here in time.  I just received, about 5 minutes ago, a  letter from the Secretary of State en dorsing our position on chemical weap ons.  I ask unanimous consent that it be  printed in the RECORD.  ",1986
1006,452,14,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, I ask my  chairman, the Senator from Arizona,  should we also stipulate that the letter  made a profound difference in the out come of the vote?  ",1986
1007,452,14,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Oh, it made it.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  THE SECRETARY OF STATE,  Washington, DC, August 6, 1986.  Hon. BARRY GOLDWATER,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR BARRY: The United States faces a se rious challenge to our national security and  that of our allies on the issue of chemical  weapons modernization. The threat is real  and growing. The Soviet Union has persist ed in its build-up of chemical weapons far  beyond any defensive need. There are only  two effective responses to this threat: arms  control-a total and verifiable ban on chem ical weapons-and, in the absence of such a  ban, maintenance of an effective U.S. deter rent capability.  The foremost objective of this Administra tion  remains a  comprehensive, effectively  verifiable, global ban on all chemical weap ons. We have been pressing  the Soviets  since  1977  to negotiate  a  ban, without  result, and the Soviets have not yet con structively  addressed  critical  verification  issues in response to our 1984 Draft Treaty  in Geneva. The Soviets lack any real con crete incentive to negotiate seriously on a  chemical weapons ban as long as they retain  a vast superiority in chemical munitions and  face an aging and deteriorating U.S. chemi cal weapons retaliatory capability. Unilater al restraint for the last 17 years has not  been reciprocated.  After  last year's authorization by Con gress to begin the modernization of our re taliatory chemical weapons stockpile,  the  Soviets,  in their characteristic manner, at  first  refused  to  participate  in  chemical  weapons treaty negotiations and then imme diately attacked the action with polemics  and posturing. Since that initial reaction,  however, the Soviets have negotiated more  seriously, even though they have yet to ad dress all relevant issues.  Until a comprehensive ban on chemical  weapons is achieved, we must maintain de terrence through a strong defensive posture  and a  credible retaliatory capability. Our  aging unitary chemical weapons stockpile is  deteriorating. Only a  small percentage  is  militarily useful. The production of new  binary munitions will provide the U.S. with  the  strong  and  effective deterrent. The  threat of chemical weapons attack against  U.S. forces is not limited to a Soviet attack  in NATO Europe; it is a world-wide threat.  Binary munitions which are safer and easier  to transport than unitary weapons will pro vide the United States with the flexibility  necessary to deter the threat of chemical  weapons attack against U.S. forces wherever  that threat may occur.  As you know, the President has certified  to Congress that certain conditions required  by Congress for the release of Fiscal Year  1986 funds for the binary chemical weapons  modernization  program  have  been met.  NATO adopted the chemical weapons mod ernization  force  goal  addressed  to  the  United States. The U.S. has also developed a  contingency deployment plan  for binary  munitions, and we have consulted NATO  Allies on that plan.  The unitary chemical munitions currently  in Europe provide an extremely limited de terrent and  retaliatory  capability. These  munitions and the rest of the current uni tary CW stockpile will be destroyed in con junction with the acquisition of binary mu nitions by September 30, 1994, as directed  by  the Congress. We appreciate  the con cerns  some  have  expressed  regarding  a  chemical retaliatory capability  in Europe,  and we have weighed such considerations  carefully  in  proceeding with  discussions  with our NATO Allies. We are convinced  that even without peacetime deployment in  Europe, the new binary munitions will pro vide  a CW deterrent clearly superior  to  what we now have. Binary munitions will ef fectively protect our forces and the forces of  our allies not only in NATO but throughout  the world.  The production of binary munitions  is  crucial to U.S. security, and supports our  arms control efforts. On this issue, so criti cal to our Nation's safety, I sincerely wel come your support.  Sincerely yours,  GEORGE P. SHULTZ.  ",1986

It is my understanding that  the  bill,  as  reported  and  further  amended by the committee, provides  new direct spending authority.  0 1640  For example, section 1214 of the bill  provides for an increase in capitaliza tion of the special defense acquisition  fund and affects direct spending  in  functions 050 and 150 according to the  Congressional Budget Office.

1027,465,14,Mr. HATFIELD.," Given  this, along  with the fact that the Senate Armed  Services Committee has not yet filed  its required report under 302(b) of the  Budget Act,  this bill violates section  302<c> of the Budget Act which pro hibits consideration of such legislation  until the committee has filed  its re quired 302<b> report. Am I correct that  this bill is subject to a point of order  under section 302<c>  of  the Budget  Act?  ",1986

Can  the Chair  please advise  this Senator how  this  body  is  to know  if such a point of  order  is  available  to  its Members  under this provision of the Budget Act  if a committee has not yet filed its re quired 302(b) report under that act?

Mr. President, another provision of  the Budget Act, as amended-section  401<a)-prohibits the consideration of  any measure providing new contract  authority or new borrowing authority  which is not limited by appropriations.

1034,465,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator is correct.  ,1986
1035,465,14,Mr.  HATFIELD.,"  Mr.  President,  these are the points I wanted to raise  relating to the particular application  of the Budget Act to the defense au thorization bill. As I indicated earlier,  having been a Member of this body  when the Budget Act passed and also  when  the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  provisions were passed, I have been on  this floor trying to make certain that  every appropriations bill measured up  to the Budget Act requirements. We  have gone through various exercises of  tabling,  referring, and all  the other  procedural motions members are quite  familiar with. I merely want to point  out that we are in violation here today  of  the Budget Act.  I would  like  to  know what  the Budget Committee's  views are on this.  Also,  if  the majority  leader would  permit me to do so, having yielded the  floor merely for a parliamentary in quiry,  the chairman of  the Budget  Committee has indicated that he has  an amendment to correct one of this  bill's provisions  relating  to contract  authority  that violates  the Budget  Act.  I  wonder  if  there  are  any  thoughts that could be expressed at  this moment or shared that could clar ify the situation as to the other viola tions of the Budget Act this particular  bill represents.  ",1986
1036,465,14,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I  thank  the  distinguished  Senator  from  Oregon, the chairman of the Appro priations Committee. I wonder if we  might have an agreement  that  the  Senator  from New Mexico and  the  Senator from Florida might be recog nized for 5 minutes each if they desire,  not to exceed 5 minutes each.  ",1986
1037,465,14,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection? Hearing no objection,  it is so ordered.  The Senator from New Mexico  recognized.  ",1986
1038,465,14,Mr. DOMENICI.," I thank the distin guished majority leader. I do not need  5 minutes.  I say to my friend from Oregon the  Senator from New Mexico is aware of  what I consider to be a very serious  violation of the Budget Act with refer ence to new spending authority as de fined in section 401<c)(2) of the Con gresssional Budget Act.  I am aware of the fact that provi sions of the bill are out of order if  indeed they are construed to be enti tlements, contract authority, or direct  spending. I have an amendment pend ing at the desk that I filed 2 days ago.  is  I have not called it up because I would  like to see more of the bill evolve, but  basically,  I have checked it through  with the manager and the ranking mi nority member.  I  intend to offer  it.  They  said  they did not  intend  to  object to it.  Basically, it provides that any new  spending authority, as defined in sec tion 40l<c><2> of the Budget Act, pro vided by specified sections of this bill,  shall be effective for any fiscal year  only  to  such  extent  or  in  such  amounts as are provided in appropria tion acts. My amendment lists the var ious  sections of  the bill which  the  amendment applies to-611, 625, 631,  635, 636<f>. 931 1006, 1214, 2175, and  2183. Those are  the sections where  this Senator has  found  in  this bill  either direct  spending authority or  contract authority or entitlements.  If not amended, they would be con strued to be direct expenditures in vio lation of the Budget Act.  I am pre pared  to offer  the amendment. The  managers know it. I will furnish my  friend, the chairman, with a copy of it.  As to the section 302(c) contention  he made, it is true there are no cross walks  filed  by  this  committee.  I  assume if someone desires to make a  point of order under section 302<c>  they  could.  I  hope  the  committee  would file a 302(b) allocation. I do not  believe it is very difficult, not like the  appropriations crosswalk.  I will assist the committee if they  desire to comply on the technical mat ters. If they do not, I will consult with  them.  If it appears  to  the Senator  from New Mexico as one Senator and  chairman of  the Budget Committee  that they violate the Budget Act as it  operates to get things under control, I  shall raise appropriate points of order.  ",1986
1039,465,14,Mr. HATFIELD.," I state again, Mr.  President, that I raise these points at  this time as the bill is under consider ation so there will be opportunity to  correct them. I wanted to make cer tain that, again, we do not go through  the whole exercise up to third reading  without some kind of action.  Again, I think if we are going to ob serve the Budget Act in any one area  of legislation, it ought to be observed  in all areas. Usually, the Budget Com mittee has been very helpful  in re minding the rest of us where we have  been in violation or potential violation  of the Budget Act. I am glad to know  the chairman has taken action on at  least one of  these violations.  I  am  hopeful  the committee will  comply  enough so that when we get to third  reading,  we  will  not  have  any  technicalities  on  violations  of  the  Budget Act.  If I had to vote for a question of  waiving the Budget Act in order to get  to this bill, I would even consider that.  I want to point out that the Budget  Act ought to be applied to every bit of  ",1986
1040,478,14,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President, I  think I understand full well what the  Senator  from Missouri  is  talking  about. I happen to have served on the  first Space Committee of the Senate. I  have great admiration and respect for  and realize the extreme importance of  space to the future of our country and  the future of the world. But we have  some problems, Mr. President.  We are talking about $556 million.  The Armed Services Committee has al ready  taken $30 billion  in cuts and  right now, we are trying to find an other $10 billion to comply with the  recent Budget Committee  judgment.  There is no question that when we get  into conference with  the House, we  are going to be asked to take maybe  another $6 to $8 million.  So what the Senator from Missouri  is asking the Armed Services Commit tee to do, I have to say, is an absolute  impossibility. We  do not have  the  money.  Now, Mr. President, we could get the  money by not buying some equipment,  and I am not even going to refer to the  Senator's hometown. We do not have  to buy all the main battle tanks. We  do not have to provide money for the  Navy. We can cut some troop strength,  which we do not want to do. But, Mr.  President, the actions of the commit tee with respect to shuttle flight dis charges we  took  for budgetary  rea sons. There was certainly no prejudice  with respect  to NASA's requirement  for these funds, which constitute an  important source of  their operating  revenues for 1987.  We cut the money out because we  were told, and we are still being told,  that there will be no flights so the  money is not needed.  At issue in this bill is the tradeoff  between valid military  requirements  on the one hand and an agreement be tween NASA and DOD that provides  budget and program stability to our  national Space Transportation System  on the other. We know that NASA re quires these funds to implement their  shuttle recovery efforts. But we also  know that the DOD has already trans ferred  to NASA during  fiscal  year  1983-86 payments  for more shuttle  flights than NASA currently projects  to fly  in fiscal year 1986 and fiscal  year 1988.  The committee is strongly commit ted  to  the  recovery  of  our  space  launch posture at the earliest possible  time and our recent actions with re spect  to expendable  launch vehicles  attest to this commitment. But under  the  current  budget  constraints  on  DOD funding and the increased fund ing requirements to meet DOD's mili tary space launch requirements, I just  don't see where we are going to get the  money.  I keep saying that, Mr. President, be cause  it  is  the God's truth. We are  broke.  I do not see where we are going to  get the money to keep DOD's commit ment  to NASA  for  shuttle  launch  charges  for  launches  that unfortu nately will not  take place as sched uled.  In the fiscal year budget, the admin istration  requested $268.8 million  in  Air Force O&M, $32.9 million in Air  Force RDT&E, and $297.9 million in  Air Force missile procurement to reim burse NASA for fiscal year 1988 DOD  shuttle missions.  Mr. President, I do not want to go on  on this but we have just talked to Mr.  Aldridge,  the Secretary of  the Air  Force, and he has told us he wants the  money, but do not take it out of the  defense budget. I know he has told the  Senator from Missouri another tale. In  fact, the last paragraph of the letter  he has written to a large number of us  says:  In summary the Shuttle accident and the  recent ELV  failures have dealt a  serious  blow to this Country's capability for launch ing payloads into space. Recognizing that  funding stability was necessary in order for  NASA and the DOD to plan an expeditious  recovery, we agreed to keep fiscal year 1986  and fiscal year 1987 reimbursements intact.  This approach will permit appropriate prep aration and planning for DOD missions to  proceed in an orderly and efficient manner.  It is our joint recommendation, therefore,  that the Congress endorse the ongoing ef forts of both DOD and NASA for the over all STS recovery, for the orderly and mutu ally beneficial reconstruction of the DOD  STS flight planning, and for the application  of credit adjustments for DOD reimburse ments in the fiscal year 1988 budget.  Mr. President,  I  know  there  are  others who want to talk on this, but as  chairman of the Armed Services Com mittee, I just have to repeat: My heart  is with  them.  I wish we had  this  money.  I wish we had a  lot more  money than we have. If they insist on  getting this out of this budget, as I say  to my friend, we are going to have to  take it out of equipment or take it out  of personnel, and I know that the Senator does not want to do that. I know  Colonel Gam does not want  to do  that, and neither do I.  So, Mr. President, we have our prob lems. I hope we can solve them.  I have said all I care to say on this. I  yield to the Senator from Virginia.  ",1986
1041,478,14,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President before  the distinguished chairman yields the  floor, I listened carefully to his state ment, and I am certain he meant that  NASA does need the money. There is a  very legitimate requirement for these  funds, and his opposition is solely on  budgetary considerations as it impacts  on the DOD budget.  0 1910  10  the  chairman  ",1986
1042,478,14,Mr. GOLDWATER.," I could not de clare in strong enough language how  badly I know NASA needs the money,  but at the same time I could not de clare in strong enough language how  broke we are.  ",1986
1043,478,14,Mr. COHEN., Will  yield?  ,1986
1044,478,14,Mr. GOLDWATER., Yes.  ,1986
1045,478,14,Mr. COHEN.," It is my understanding  that the Department of Defense has  already  provided NASA  reimburse ments  for  shuttle  flights which  have yet to be flown, and if we are to  provide another half a billion dollars,  it  is  the proposal  that DOD get a  credit for that amount of money.  The difficulty is that next year and  the year after and the year after that  we are going to be facing more con strained budgets  than we have  this  year, and  in all  likelihood  they will  never be able to reimburse DOD for  this half a billion dollars, not to men tion the 10 flights which have yet to  be flown.  So I would agree with the chairman  that as much as we would like to fund  this program, it seems to me it is in cumbent upon the administration to  clearly specify where they are going to  come up with the money for the pro gram itself. We all support it, but I do  not know how we can come up with  another half a billion dollars, on top  of what we have added today and yes terday and the day before, and have  any kind of a budget that is going to  survive not only the budget conference  but be subject  to a point of order  when we come back with the appro priation process.  ",1986

1048,478,14,Mr. NUNN., I concur with what the  chairman has said and what the Sena tor from Maine has said.

1053,556,14,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, every now and  then we come across a magazine article that  eloquently and memorably  illuminates some  important aspects of our lives. In a recent arti cle in Newsweek, Vickie L. Sleiman, who hap pens  to work  for  the House of Representa tives Select Committee  Narcotics  and  Abuse and Control, has reminded us all of the  link between the hard work of parents and rel atives and a college student's ability to pursue  his or her studies. Ms. Sleiman with her calcu lations of how many hamburgers have to be  flipped and how many lube jobs have to be  done  in garages  to pay  for college  tuitions,  has done a really great job. As a father who  has sent four of his children  through college  and as a son who has benefited from the hard  work of his father and the rest of his family, I  deeply appreciate Ms. Sleiman's  tribute  to  those who work so others might learn.  At  this  point  I wish  to  include  in  the  RECORD,  ""A Salute  to  'Burger Flippers'"" by  Vickie L. Sleiman, Newsweek, June 30, 1986.  A SALUTE TO ""BURGER FLIPPERS""  <By Vickie L. Sleiman>  Last month I was awarded the honor of  being escorted to the first row of seats at  my university's graduation exercises. I  lis tended to the guest speaker talk about our  responsibility as citizens of the world, and I  listened, too, as our valedictorian informed  the class of '86 that it was better to be here  than out ""flipping burgers."" The ceremony  finally ended,  I  returned my  rented cap,  hood and gown;  then, when I was back in  my parent's house, I began to calculate the  number of burgers that had been ""flipped""  by my family so that I could attain the title  of ""doctor of philosophy."" After hours of  working with means and medians, my calcu lator  indicated  the  total was nearing  the  number  illuminated beneath  the Golden  Arches.  For example, at $3.35 an hour, it took my  mother almost 10 hours of flipping burgers  to buy ""Moral Development and Socializa tion"" <$31.43, plus 6 percent sales  tax), a  textbook she purchased to help me study  for my Ph.D, qualifying exams in education.  Simply stated, Mom flipped 2,984 burgers  working the grill in a bustling coffee shop to  buy me this one book <5 burgers per minute  x 10 hours= 3,000 burgers).  I then estimated that if she had paid for  only  three books a  semester for  the last  seven years, at an average cost of $25 per  book. she would have flipped over 94,030  burgers. However,  by  also  counting  the  money she gave me to ""put towards"" my car  insurance, school supplies, registration fees  and dissertation expenses, I know she had  to turn an additional 250,746 patties. Thus,  my mother's total contribution during those  seven years was 344,776 rare, medium and  well burgers.  The larger these numbers grew, the better  I understood the cause of the chronic bursi tis  in her right shoulder and elbow  hashslinging has its own rewards. As  the  hours passed, I became entranced by the  magnitude of the numbers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  My fingers danced across my calculator as  I computed how many burgers were flipped  by Aunt Micky so she could present me with  a graduation bouquet <2,100>; by my godpar ents and Aunt Marlene so they could buy  me  the gold bracelet I promised to wear  when I accepted my diploma <13,500>.  GRADUATION CEREMONY  I had entered a  state of mathematical  frenzy.  It ""cost"" my  brother-in-law  900  burger flips for a  tank of gas so he could  drive from his job at a McDonald's in Los  Angeles to my graduation ceremony in San  Diego, and a total of 1,800 burgers for the  graduation cards cousins, uncles and aunts  had sent to me.  As graduation day turned into graduation  night, I calculated the number of lube jobs  and oil changes my dad, a mechanic, per formed at his job at Sears so he could help  pay for my lunch tickets at the university  cafeteria.  I added  to that the number of  buckets I  filled with wings,  legs and side  breasts at Kentucky Fried Chicken,  the  number of dog kennels I scraped and the  number of fish fillets I dunked in vats of oil  at Mr. Fish and Chips-all to pay the per sonal and educational expenses that student  loans, fellowships and scholarships did not  cover.  The following morning I inserted new bat teries  into my  calculator,  paused  for  a  moment and thanked God for the privilege  of having so many burgers flippers in my  family-an honor the valedictorian at my  university did not have. For if she had, she  would have expressed her graditude to each  and evey one of them sitting in that stadi um on graduation day;  she would have  thanked them for the moral and financial  support that allowed so many of us to be in cluded in the class of '86.  INSENSITIVE AND FLIPPANT  Now, as the self-proclaimed president of  the Children of Burger Flippers of America,  I say ""thank you"" to all the parents, broth ers, sisters husbands and wives who stood  over smoky grills and hot ovens. Through  your labor we gained insight into the rigors  of life on a minimum wage, we learned the  value of a dollar and, given your support, we  are now able to make more money in one  year than you were able to make in five.  I hope other college students will become  honorary members of my  club.  If they  would  take  time and  look up  from  their  books, they might learn that their position  of privilege is sustained, in part, by burger  slingers-taxpayers who help support  the  nation's public-university  system. Future  valedictorians would then salute the contri butions of the blue-collar employee instead  of making insensitive and flippant remarks.  In the end, though, the flippers may have  the last laugh. Theirs  is  the face of  the  future,  according  to  some  labor-market  studies. If 1 out of every 3 meals consumed  by Americans will  be  eaten  away  from  home, as projected for the next 10 years,  then flipping burgers may become a source  of employment for those college graduates  unable to secure a ""professional"" position.  But do not fret, dear students. As Ralph  Waldo Emerson once wrote: ""The differ ences between men in natural endowment  are insignificant in comparison with their  common wealth. Do you think the porter  and the cook have no anecdotes, no experi ences,  no wonders  for  you?  Everybody  knows as much as the savant.""  As the proud daughter of a flipper, I know  how to say thank you. To everyone in my  family who ever swung a spatula so that I  August 7, 1986  could ""succeed,"" your generosity made my  graduation so much sweeter and so much  more appreciated.  A TRIBUTE TO AMERICA AND  THE STATUE OF LIBERTY  HON.BERNARDJ.D~  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, August 7, 1986  Mr. DWYER of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to share with my colleagues the el oquent  thoughts of one of my constituents  from Ed1son, NJ, Mr. Louis Fuzak, Sr. Mr.  Fuzak,  the son of an  immigrant couple, who  was so inspired by the Liberty Weekend Cele brations that he has written two very moving  and touching essays on America,  the Statue  of Liberty, and what being an American citizen  means to him.  AMERICA  As I watched television this week I was  very thrilled to be an American. I was born  in the twenties to a hardworking immigrant  couple, as were my buddies and friends with  whom I grew up with in the streets. World  War II broke and all of us joined the differ ent branches of the service. It was time for  our generation to stand up and keep the  torch lit-it was passed down to us from the  previous generation. As I listened to some of  the comments made about the next genera tion I said ""Thank God we have them to  pass the torch on to!"" If we all walk with  God and keep His truth alive we will always  be able to celebrate tributes to our Lady. In  our generation  there were  all  kinds  of  ethnic backgrounds  and  colors;  it never  bothered us. In all, I  think we did a good  job-as long as we never took our freedom  for granted. It is not easy to come by.  I  know for I miss some of my friends who  gave their lives for our country. For them I  say ""Keep the Peace."" If you are forced to you must fight to protect our country and  our lady, the symbol of our freedom. Free dom never comes cheap. Every generation  paid the price, heavily at times. So when  your time comes do not be afraid. Stand up  and be counted-but make sure that God is  along side you.  God Bless America!  The  sun  always  brightens the way after the darkness.  The  immigrants  gave  of  themselves sweat and many tears shed for their boys,  who are buried on plots in the South Pacific  and Europe. Their white crosses mark the  landscape of the earth where they now rest  in peace. They were sent  to protect our  safety and gave their lives for our freedom.  The ultimate sacrifice that protects our lib erty and freedom.-Louis Fuzak, Sr.  THE LADY  What a wonderful party! What stands out  most in my mind:  The children-the future guardians of the  Lady.  The young black boy who sang the Na tional Anthem.  The young Vietnamese girl who recited  what freedom and liberty and becoming an  American meant to her and her family.  The young ones who took up collections of  pennies, nickels and dimes.  The young boy who collected thousands  of dollars.  ",1986

1055,569,14,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Chairman, it  pains me to come  to the well  today  and to support a cut in the budget au thority for the defense budget, just as  it pained me to be one of the 19 Mem bers to vote to eliminate the COLA's  for military and civil service retirees;  just as it pained me to vote for the  $170 million  in outlay reductions  in  order to conform the ag budget to the  target of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.  Just like it will pain me when the op portunity, should it arise,  to vote no  COLA's for Social Security recipients  this year. That, too, will pain me and  incur the wrath that I am incurring.  I  am here  today  to  support  the  Spratt amendment, because it is time  we do that which the Packard Com mission  suggested we  have not yet  fully  appreciated  the  necessity  of  doing, and I quote:  Today there is no rational .system where by the Executive Branch and the Congress  reach coherent and enduring agreement on  national military  strategy,  the  forces  to  carry it out and the funding that should be  provided in light of the overall economy and  the competing claims on national resources.  That  is  the bottom  line, my col leagues.  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  I  thought was  serious.  I  thought we  were  serious  about  recognizing our  economy, the money we have to spend,  and tryi: 1g to put together a package  to do it within that budget.  If we do not support  the Spratt  amendment, we are just saying to the  world: Forget it. There is no way we  avoid sequestration. To my colleagues  who suggest that $286 is not enough in  budget authority, we are going to have  much less for defense, if we go the way  it is being suggested in the substitute  amendment.  This is ""gut-up"" time for a lot of us,  and I hope folks on my side of the  aisle  that have  literally done every thing to stop the Davis-Bacon Reform  Act will also ""gut-up"" when it comes  time to doing hard time.  The only  thing  that we have cut  with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings so far,  it appears to me, is Hollings.  ",1986

1058,569,14,Mr. KASICH.," Mr. Chairman, let me  just say very quickly that there are  two methods  that are used  in  the  Aspin-Spratt amendment to try to get  down to the budget authority /budget  outlay numbers.  We have  two additional ones; one  that delays progress payments; those  are payments that we make  to con tractors, and second, we prohibit the  early delivery of systems so that we do  not have to pay money out up front.  What does that allow us to do? Well,  when we combine  the  two methods  that the Aspin-Spratt amendment uses  along with our two methods, we are  able to hit $292 in authority and $279  in outlays.  0 1115  Let me tell you, last year we had a 6percent reduction in budget authority.  Last year's budget represented a nega tive  6-percent  growth. The Spratt Aspin amendment will give us another  additional 4-percent negative growth.  And those people who have been the  most critical and the most analytical  about what we ought to do within the  Department  of  Defense,  including  former members of  this administra tion who  have  come  forward with  plans  to cut defense spending, have  told us that if we consistently move to  reduce the outlay figures or to reduce  the authority figures for defense, we  are going to roll back all the gains we  made for the last 4 or 5 years.  So what do we do in our budget? We  simply  take  the  two methods  that  Aspin-Spratt  take, we add  to  them.  One is prohibit early delivery. We do  not need  to  take early delivery on  these  systems  because we  end  up  having to have storage space problems  and everything else until the systems  can be  joined  together and we also  delay  the payment  for  10  days of  progress  payments  to  contractors.  Contractors have been getting 90 per cent  progress  payments  for  longer  than what they needed. It is now down  to 80 percent. We do not reduce  it  below 80. \Ve just simply say we delay  the payments for 10 days and are able  to meet $292 in budget authority and  $279 in outlays. So it gets us right on  our target and also assures that we  ",1986

We have a number of people  who are interested in catching planes.  So we are going to try to hold down on  our side. A  lot of Members want to  speak.  Mr. Chairman,  I  cannot speak  for  the minority. He has the time, and he  can do with it what he wishes.  But on our side we are going to try  to hold it down.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as  he may consume  to  the gentleman  from Florida [Mr. FASCELL] the chair man of the Committee on Foreign Af fairs.  ",1986
1060,582,14,Mr. FASCELL.," I  man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  last February,  the House of  Representatives passed, by an overwhelming  bipartisan vote of 268-148, House Joint Reso lution 3, legislation urging the President to re quest  the  ratification of  two nuclear  testing  limitation  treaties signed  in  the 1970's and  urging the President to propose to the Soviet  Union  the  resumption of negotiations on a  comprehensive  test ban  treaty. The other  body just yesterday passed House Joint Reso lution 3 as an amendment to the fiscal year  1987 Defense authorization bill by a vote of  64 to 35.  .  In passing  this  legislation,  the House and  Senate have sent a very clear message. A bi partisan majority in Congress firmly supports  an end to the arms race fueled by the unlimit ed continuation of nuclear testing. By continu ing to add new nuclear weapons to our arse nals, both  the United States and  the Soviet  Union cancel out the effectiveness any reduc tions might make in their nuclear arsenals. We  are saying what every President since Eisen hower has been saying: We must put an end  to this escalation through a mutual, vertifiable,  and comprehensive test ban.  As a follow-on to House Joint Resolution 3,  this amendment calls  for continued action  toward  that arms  control  policy objective.  Under  this amendment, effective January 1,  1987, we would engage  in a moratorium on  nuclear testing above a certain level-1 kilo ton-unless the President certifies to the Con gress that the Soviets have tested above this  level.  If the Soviets choose to resume their test ing, funds are immediately released for the re sumption  of  United  States  testing.  This  amendment reflects a grave concern on  the  part of  the American people and  the world  community that something desperately needs  to be done to stop the proliferation of nuclear  weapons and the nuclear arms race between  the superpowers. One way to begin this proc ess  is  for the United States and  the Soviet  Union to limit tests of their high yield nuclear  weapons.  For almost a year now,  the Soviets have  not tested. They are sending us a ""message.""  Some view  this as a propaganda move on  their part I say we should question their seri ousness by calling their bluff. Let's send them  a signal that we are serious. By continuing to  test, as we have since the Soviet moratorium,  we send the wrong message. In my judgment,  there is very little time to reach an agreement  with the Soviets in this area. Mr. Gorbachev is  being  pushed  just  as  hard  as President  Reagan is being pushed by certain elements  in  their defense establishments who oppose  any  agreement  at  all  in  this  area.  The  ""window of opportunity"" is closing fast. Let's  see if the Soviets will negotiate a genuine and  effective nuclear test ban.  The Soviets have pledged  to accept en hanced verification arrangements in the nucle ar testing area.  In fact, as part of an agree ment with  the Natural Resources Defense  Council,  a private organization,  the Soviet  Union has accepted and has  in place  right  now equipment onsite to monitor nuclear tests  and earthquakes. This could be expanded to  incorporate a wider network of monitoring sta tions on  their  territory which would provide  even greater monitoring confidence. At issue  is not the technical ability to monitor testing,  but the political will  to reach an agreement.  The onus should be on the Soviet Union not  the United States to deliver.  What this amendment does is to call for a  moratorium on testing above 1 kiloton as long  as the Soviet Union doesn't conduct such a  test. If they test, we are free to test.  We have much to gain and nothing to lose  by limiting the addition of new nuclear weap ons into the Soviet arsenal.  I urge my colleagues to support this reason able and effective arms control amendment.  ",1986

Those of us in Congress who support  arms  control-LEs  AsPIN  and  PAT  SCHROEDER,  my  cosponsors,  TOM  JOHN SPRATr,  and so many others-are vitally con cerned with protecting our rights and  freedoms.

Our amendment secures so much for  us that I have a hard time understand ing the arguments posed against us.  Let me outline why I  think this legis lation is necessary and prudent.  Both we and the Soviets have more  than enough missiles and bombs to de stroy the world as we know it. That's  why deterrence  is so necessary and  that's why deterrence works. At the  same  time, America's nuclear  forces  have never been stronger: Our weap ons are more accurate than the Sovi ets' and our warhead modernization  programs are substantially complete.

1064,595,14,Mr. COURTER.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I Just would like to  make the point eminently clear that  the idea that you can stop building nuclear weapons by stopping or eliminating nuclear tests is a fallacy. The Soviets, as everybody knows, for whatever  1 t.  th t  th  bli  c  re a IOns  reasons  a  ey  have in their mind, have decided not  to test weapons for a period of time.  During the period of time that they  have not  tested weapons  they have  built 100 intercontinental ballistic missUes with warheads, at the same time  the United States is producing none;  125  intermediate-range ballistic missUes, 450 short-range ballistic missiles,  and 50 sea-launched ballistic missiles,  and 50 strategic bombers, all during  the  time  their tests.  So there is really no relationship beProliferation of weapons.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1986
1065,595,14,Mr. DICKINSON.," I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, in closing let me say  without getting  into  the  technology  involved here, I think the most perti nent point that could be made was  made by Dr. Robert Barker, who is the  head of the delegation to the nuclear  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:  appreciate your  concerns for tangible progress towards the  eventual goal we all share-a world free of  nuclear weapons. However, that goal is not  furthered by the measures concerning nuclear testing being considered by the House  today. Now, and for the foreseeable future,  the security of the United States and our  allies must rely on a credible and effective  nuclear deterrent. In my view, that makes  our carefully structured program of nuclear  testing imperative.  Moreover, the heart of the problem we  face in working to preserve peace and stabil ity is not the testing of nuclear weapons but  the size and composition of the Soviet offensive nuclear forces. We are energetically  pursuing negotiations with the Soviet Union  in Geneva to sharply reduce the number of  nuclear weapons on both sides. This is our  highest priority.  As you know, we have recently begun ex perts discussions with the Soviet Union on  nuclear testing issues. We hope those discussions will lead to the resolution of our  concerns about verification. Satisfaction in  this area would allow us to move forward on  ratification  of  the Threshold Test Ban  Treaty <TTBT> and the Peaceful Nuclear  Explosions Treaty <PNET>. The President  hopes these meetings mark the beginning of  a  constructive dialogue with  the Soviet  Union on nuclear testing.  I am convinced that Congressional limitations on our testing program such as those  being considered today in the House will be  counterproductive. These measures,  if en acted, will undermine our negotiators  in  they curtailed or stopped Geneva and encourage the Soviets that they  need not engage in hard, serious negotiatheir ends can be achieved  tween stopping tests and stopping the without addressing our concerns. I strongly  urge you not to tie our hands in ways that  will harm both our ability to maintain a  credible and effective deterrent and our  arms control efforts.  Sincerely,  I think we all ought to vote against  the amendment.  ",1986
1066,595,14,Mrs.  LLOYD.," Mr. Chairman, Dr. Richard  Perle, Assistant Secretary  of Defense  for  PU  tions because  JOHN C. WHITEHEAD,  Acting Secretary.  International Security Policy,  is generally not  known as a master of  the understatement.  However, Dr. Perle  recently commented on  the role of the private United States monitor ing group for Soviet Nuclear tests in which he  dismissed  the group explanations as  ""not  useful"" and expressed a view that we ought  to have a government  to govern arrange ments that provides for adequate verification. I  believe that is a classic understatement.  As  I understand  it,  the scientists from the  National Resources Defense Council, an envi ronmental group which  I believe has quite  suspect nuclear credentials, comprise the test  monitoring team.  It is worth nothing that Dr.  Thomas Cochran, the NRDC team leader, has  spent the past 15 years of his life in an effort  to kill civilian nuclear power  in  the United  States.  It hardly seems  to me good public  policy to have an avowed zealot against the  atom for peaceful purposes be involved in a  critical monitoring function where the govern ment has such tremendous concern.  Dr. Perle went on to point out that the pri vate arrangement with NRDC does not consti tute adequate verification and I must confess  that I am alarmed that this body would seri ously consider having critical monitoring activi ty performed by the National Resources De fense Council. This is why I am supporting Mr.  DICKINSON's amendment. This is why I believe  the Aspin-Gephardt-Schroeder substitute must  be defeated.  We are being asked to have amateurs with  a documented conflict of interest regarding ci vilian nuclear power and a weapons phobia do  the  job of highly skilled professionals who  would have U.S. national security at the fore front of their concerns. I also understand that  Dr. Cochran insists that we send vax comput er systems to the U.S.S.R. and presumably let  Dr. Perle worry about the technology transfer  consequences.  I urge my colleagues to vote  for the Dickinson version and reject the other  amendment which to me represents a terribly  naive approach to nuclear test monitoring and  United States Soviet technology transfer rela tions.

1067,595,14,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in  strong support of the amendment now pend ing. August 6  is  the  first anniversary of the  Soviet Union's unilateral ban on the testing of  underground nuclear weapons.  General Secretary Gorbachev announced  last August that the Soviet Union would refrain  from underground  tests until  the end of the  year. His proposal  for a ban on  testing, of fered in the hope that the United States would  soon comply, was extended  to March 31,  1986. When the Soviet ban ended on March  31  without a  favorable United States  re sponse, Gorbachev extended  it again, until  the next United States test explosion, which  occurred on April 9. The Soviet leader then  extended the ban by his nation until August 6,  despite the fact that more than a dozen nucle ar tests were conducted by the United States  during the year long ban.  The Soviets have not yet announced wheth er  they will now renew  testing. The United  States has not only continued a schedule of  nuclear testing, but we have actually acceler ated our program.

1068,608,14,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, one of the  mistakes being made by many of our  colleagues  critical  of  the Bradley  fighting vehicle is that they think it  was designed to be another tank. In a  recent article, Gen. Donald R. Keith,  former Army Deputy Chief of Staff  for Research, Development, and Ac quisition,  points out  that  this was  never the case. The requirement from  the beginning was for a true fighting  vehicle because the Army found that  the combination of mechanized infan try in vehicles designed to maneuver  and fight with tanks had a synergism  on  the battlefield  that greatly  en hanced the effectiveness of the force.  General Keith  then outlined  the  tough  tradeoff analyses which drive  the designs of combat vehicles for the  modern battlefield.  He also  responds  to allegations of  ""unrealistic testing."" ""The only test ing that the Army was reluctant  to  overdo was to demonstrate what we al ready knew."" That seems to be plain  common sense to me.  Finally, General Keith writes that,  ...     the Bradley  is not a perfect  weapon system, but it is the best fight ing vehicle in the free world.""  Mr. Speaker, I am including General  Keith's article as a part of the RECORD.  [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 16, 19861  A GENERAL DEFENDS THE BRADLEY  <By Gen. Donald R. Keith)  Over the last few years, I have become a  calloused reader of the well-orchestrated as sault by some elements of the media on  many of the weapons systems  that are a  part of the badly needed, long overdue mod ernization of our defense forces. Most of the  articles are flawed at best by selective use of  facts wrapped  in editorial opinion, or at  worst by downright misinformation.  I am not just a casual observer of the  most recent program under attack. I was in volved with the Bradley Fighting Vehicle  from the early 1970s until I retired in June,  1984.  The infantry fighting vehicle never was  intended to be an armored personnel carrier  like the M113. The requirement from the  beginning was for a  true fighting vehicle,  because  in a  cooperative effort with our  German allies we found that the combina tion of mechanized infantry in vehicles de signed to maneuver and fight with  tanks  synergism on  the battlefield  that  greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the  force.  When the situation called for the infantry  squad to dismount and occupy a piece of ter rain, that option was also available. From  the very beginning, the armament for our  fighting vehicle was a 26mm. gun. During  the development of the Bradley, a number  of studies conducted by both the Army and  the office of the secretary of defense sug gested that if we did not thicken our anti tank guided missile defense in Europe, we  had a  risked losing to Warsaw Pact blitzkreig tac tics early in any conflict.  The Army and the secretary of defense  agreed that the least costly solution-both  in people and dollars-was to add a TOW  missile  launcher  to each Bradley so that  every  infantry squad could participate  in  the defensive phase of any battle by engag ing enemy tanks at over 3,000 meters.  The bottom line is that the Bradley was  designed to fill an urgent need, and its field ing along with the M-1 has revolutionized  our ability to cope with an adversary who  has fielded very similar vehicles in far great er numbers.  Now, bear with me while I run through a  brief tutorial on how combat vehicles are  designed and the tradeoffs that are inher ent in the process. There is no such thing as  a totally invulnerable armored vehicle. You  can always come up with some sort of gun  or missile warhead  that will defeat any  armor known to man-even though it might  be difficult and the weapon unwieldy.  Tough tradeoff analyses drive the designs  of the combat vehicles for the modern bat tlefield. The designer begins with the main  threat the vehicle must survive while per forming a specific set of missions-remem bering  that  survivability  involves much  more than having armor that is impenetra ble to threat munitions.  Things like agility, being able to fire accu rately on the move and having ammunition  and fuel compartmented can be as impor tant as toughness of armor.  In the case of the Bradley <and with every  infantry fighting vehicle in the free world  and the Warsaw Pact), the judgment has  been to armor them to a level that protects  the occupants  from artillery, mortar and  bomb  fragments,  small  arms  and  the  medium-caliber cannons found on other in fantry fighting vehicles.  These threats change over time, of course,  so product improvements will be called for.  In fact,  the Army has had R&D requests  before  the Congress  for  the  last several  years  to deal with  the needed upgrades.  These requests did not ask for money to  turn the Bradley into a main battle tank as  some might suggest.  In fact, all the smoke about ""unrealistic  testing"" involves what happens when a tank  main gun round or an antitank guided mis sile hits it. The Army has made no bones  about the fact that, if hit by those weapons,  it will be penetrated. The only testing that  the Army was reluctant to overdo was  to  demonstrate what we already knew.  Rather, the tests were designed to verify  that  the Army was getting what  it was  paying for from  the contractor,  to check  new armors what would help keep pace with  threat evolution and to enhance survivabil  ity, given a penetration, by new compart mentation techniques.  The results of these tests were quite fa vorable. The flammability assertions by crit ics were proved  to be grossly overstated.  The aluminum armor does not burn, as has  been repeatedly stated.  No, the Bradley is not a perfect weapon  system, but it is the best fighting vehicle in  the free world. It has met every perform ance and reliability specification that it was  designed for and has become  the well-re spected backbone of the mechanized infan try and armored calvary units that have re ceived it.

1071,699,14,Mr.  CONTRA AID  CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  many people are no doubt baffled by  what  has  been  occurring  in  the  Senate. The long delays, the failure to  come to grips with some fundamental  issues, the scheduling of cloture votes,  and then the cancellation of those clo ture votes, and  the  rising  testiness  that has been displayed from time to  time between Senators as frustrations  have mounted and  the strains and  stresses of dealing with the monumen tal issues that confront us have taken  their toll.  The fact is that a quiet filiblister has  been going on for many days in this  body against military aid to the Con tras seeking to overthrow the Govern ment of Nicaragua.  There are Senators of both parties an overwhelming majority of Senate  Democrats and a small minority of Re publicans-who are strongly opposed  to military aid to the Contras.  I am one of those deeply involved in  this effort because I am strongly op posed to U.S. involvement in the con flict in Central America.  I feel very deeply about this issue.  The real issue before the Senate pre sents one of the fundamental war and  peace issues of our time. Simply put,  we must ask whether Nicaragua pre sents such a central threat to the secu rity of the United States as to warrant  our prosecution of war against  the  Nicaraguan people.  Here,  in  this  small Chamber, we  must decide this vital issue.  I, for one, was first elected to the  Senate in 1968 on a pledge to do all in  my power to end America's tragic mili tary  involvement  in  Indochina.  I  worked toward this end and I worked  to help heal the wounds this divisive  conflict inflicted in our own land as  my first priority in the Senate. Today,  yesterday, for a number of days and  on into the immediate tomorrows, the  Senate is being asked to give final ap proval for yet another war, the war in  Central America.  Not one Senator has changed his or  her mind since that time. The score re mains 53 who are prepared to vote for  the aid, 47 who are prepared to vote  against aid.  Those of us who feel so very strong ly on this issue have been prepared,  and are now prepared, to resort to all  of our rights in the Senate to prevent  a vote on this issue because we feel so  deeply that it threatens our country in  many, many ways-threatens the prin ciples for which we should stand, and  threatens to involve us in a war that  many of us feel we should not be in volved in, and threatens not only to in volve our money but our men. And we  do not want to see young Americans  fighting and bleeding and dying in a  civil war in Nicaragua.  It is for that reason that we have re fused to agree to a time agreement on  the matter of the money for the Con tras. A  time agreement would  limit  debate and deprive us of the opportu nity to prevent that money from being  approved  simply  by  preventing no  action at all upon that matter.  That is what has led to a long im passe in the Senate. It is a quiet fili buster. We have not had to talk about  it. We have not had to debate on the  floor up  to  this point as a way of  coping with  this very, very  serious  problem. The majority leader has re sorted to all the powers that he has in  order  to  seek  delay  bringing  this  matter to a vote until and only when  he feels that he will be able to win a  cloture and end the debate and win  the vote for military aid to the Con tras.  And what has occurred has led to a  second invisible filibuster, one over the  issue of apartheid  in South Africa.  The majority leader has linked apart heid sanctions to the matter of Contra  aid, and has stated that we will not  deal with apartheid until we have first  dealt with aid to the Contras.  And, also on the other side of the  aisle-the Republican side-there ap parently are  those who have stated  quietly  to  the majority  leader  that  they intend to filibuster the issue of  applying sanctions  to South Africa.  So, in effect, we have two filibusters  going on at the present time.  There have been many, many meet ings on these matters. I trust that it  will be resolved by an agreement that  will enable us to cope with both issues.  But I  assure all who are  interested  that it will not be an agreement that  limits the right of those of us who feel  so strongly against aid to the Contras  from exercising our rights. We will  insist that there will be no vote on  that matter until 60 Members vote to  end debate on this matter and bring it  to a vote.  We are not being asked formally to  declare a war, a prerogative reserved  to Congress by the Constitution. But  for all  intents and purposes, that is  the question that is before us.  The last time the Senate voted on  this issue of aid or no aid to the Con tras, 53  favored  the aid, 47 opposed  the aid.  There are those who charge that a  vote for or against Contra aid is a vote  for or against communism. Mr. Presi dent, there is no sympathy for commu nism in this Chamber. You know that.  I know that. All of us know that.  On the last vote on this issue, as I  earlier indicated, 47 of 100 U.S. Sena tors-none of whom have any sympa thy for communism-had the guts to  stand up to the pressures of a popular  President and vote against aid to the  Contras. They cast those votes know ing they would  thereby open  them selves up to the unpleasant and false  charge  of  voting  for  communism.  ",1986

1073,712,14,Mr. ROTH.,"  I  do  not  intend  to  extend  the debate much  longer.  I  would just like to make a very brief  comment on the observations by the  distinguished Senator from Georgia,  for whom I have the greatest respect.  I think he is absolutely right when he  says that the degree of independence  is going to depend on the actual rela tionship and not upon what we write  into the law. There is no question that  you can have  the most complicated,  extensive requirements in the law and  if the individuals who hold the rele vant jobs ignore them, it will not make  much difference unless Congress inter venes. But I would not agree that how  we create it makes no difference, be cause I  think it is important that if  there is to be any degree of independ ence on the part of the director of op erations he does have to have access. I  think he has to have access to the Sec retary.  Now, I agree with the distinguished  Senator from Georgia again that un doubtedly  there  are many, many  people reporting to the Secretary of  Defense, and it is difficult to get in to  see him. But at least he has that right  under our amendment. He can go to  the Secretary. But unfortunately  I  think it will be much more difficult  for the director of operational testing  to carry his battle, if he is a strong willed man, and he has to be effective,  if he has no right to go directly to the  Secretary.  I think it is not only what the facts  are but also what perceptions are, and  to me it is important that the people  within  the Pentagon  establishment,  the contractors on the outside, under stand the right of access of the head  of the OT&E to go directly to the Sec retary of Defense. I think that is what  creates some independence.  Now, let me just make one comment  that at least one Secretary of Defense,  Harold Brown, under the Carter ad ministration, who of course  likewise  just the same as this Secretary, had  many individuals report to him, sup ported the concept of an independent  OT&E with the director reporting to  the Secretary of Defense. So there is  at least one Secretary who  thought  this was a valuable reform.  Let me also point out that under the  current  legislation,  the  policy,  the  career of the individual who is the di rector of the OT&E, the budget, all go  to the czar. It makes it pretty clear  that he is subordinate to that individ ual and reduces very, very substantial ly his independence. As I said, it seems  ",1986
1074,725,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Indiana.  ,1986
1075,725,14,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, I rise  in opposition to this amendment and  also to reiterate what has already been  stated by other Senators, that basical ly this is a unilateral Asat ban con gressionally mandated and imposed by  the Congress.  It has  already been  stated many  times  that  the Soviets  have tested their coorbital Asat well  over 20  times and the United States  less than 5. The Soviets certainly have  an operational Asat capability. The  United States is far, far behind.  We also know full well, Mr. Presi dent, that we simply cannot verify any  ban on antisatellite  testing. We can  verify a conventional Asat's use, when  it is used and there is an explosion,  but verification of testing is simply, at  this juncture, almost 8.n impossibility.  Anything can be an Asat. You can  put another satellite up very close to  another satellite and just bump it and  be able to put it out of existence or  render it inoperable. That is the easy  way to have an Asat. There is no way  to verify what satellite might be an  Asat.  Furthermore, Mr. President, we do  not have any space-based surveillance  capabilities right now. We do not have  that and we would need to implement  even reasonable space control agree ments.  Also, we need the Asat capability for  a number of reasons.  One,  the United States needs  to  have command of space or at least be  able to contend for such command. We  have to be able to contend for space,  just like we contend for control of the  ground and control of the seas. We are  an island nation.  We must protect interests and allies  far from our borders and this means  most of our communication and intel ligence gathering has come to depend  on satellites. We can neither allow the  Soviets to have the free use of their  satellites to target our ships or armies  nor can we allow them to have a mo nopoly in being able to disable our sat ellites.  I also point out that having defen sive capability for our satellites is a  very important prerequisite for arms  control for determining the rules of  the road eventually for space.  If we are going to get into something  like space defense zones,  in which a  side is going to be kept out, obviously  these satellites are going to have to  have a defensive capability to be able  to  defend  themselves  against  an  attack. Yet, an Asat ban, such as we  would have if this amendment passed,  would prohibit testing of defensive sat ellites as well as Asat's.  Therefore, I  think this amendment  if it were to be passed would cause us  to have the worst of all worlds. We  would have no defense for our satel lites. By having no defense others ob viously  have  greater  incentives  for  attack. And we would have no mean ingful verification.  I think by not going forward with an  Asat capability, you really do damage  to any kind of arms control that might  take place to determine what the rules  of the road might be in space.  In essence, Mr. President, by  the  adoption of this amendment we would  create greater instability, greater un certainty. I hope it is soundly rejected.  ",1986
1076,725,14,Mr. WARNER.," I  thank the distin guished Senator from Indiana.  At this time, I ask unanimous con sent that a very significant body of  communications  directed  to  the  Senate from the following individuals  be incorporated in the RECORD:  The Secretary of Defense, the Secre tary of the Air Force, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  the Com mander  in Chief of  the U.S. Space  Command, the U.S. Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency,  the Director's  Communication, and the recently re tired Chief of Staff of the Air Force,  General Gabriel.  All of  these communications urge  the U.S. Senate in unequivocal, strong  terms to reject this amendment.  I will cite one paragraph by the re cently retired Chief of Staff of the Air  Force which I think signifies the seri ousness with which  this matter  is  viewed by our Department of Defense.  The lack of a United States ASAT capabil ity will allow the Soviets permanent and un limited use of their space systems which  permit real-time  targeting of our military  forces and continue to place those forces in  grave risk.  There being no objection, the letters  were ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  DEPARTMENT  OF  THE AIR  FORCE,  OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF,  U.S. AIR FORCE  Washington DC, June 4, 1986.  Hon. JOHN W. WARNER,  Chairman, Subcommittee on Strategic and  Theater Nuclear Forces, Committee on  Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washing ton, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:  I  am deeply con cerned about the future of our current air launched anti-satellite <ASAT> program and  want to assure you of Air Force support for  continued development of this vital capabil ity.  The lack of a US ASAT capability will  allow the Soviets permanent and unlimited  use of their space systems which permit  real-time  targeting of our military forces  and continue to place those forces at grave  risk. Therefore, I believe  it is  imperative  that we field an operational ASAT system  as early as possible. As you are aware, the  Soviets have had an operational antisatel lite system for some time. Their capability  places many of our vital satellites in jeopardy. Without a similar US ASAT capabil ity, this situation is destabilizing as it does  not provide the military option to respond  in kind to a Soviet provocation in space.  The Air Force is firmly cominitted to the  development and deployment of the current  air-launched miniature vehicle ASAT capa bility. We have solved the complex techni cal problems involved in such a project. The  flawless  intercept of an old experimental  satellite  last September more  than ade quately proved our ability  to handle  the  technical  job. I  likewise believe that cost  and schedule are reasonable, realistic and  achievable. However,  in order  to develop  and deploy an operational ASAT system at  the earliest possible date with the least cost,  we need the help of the Congress. The cur rent restrictions on testing have caused the  Air Force to implement a less than optimum  approach which, if continued, will result in  further increased costs and schedule delays.  I reaffirm my hope that the Congress will  recognize  the critical  importance of  the  ASAT  system  in our  integrated military  force structure and will work with us to pro vide the funding and support necessary to  jointly accomplish a successful program in  an effective manner.  Sincerely,  CHARLES A. GABRIEL.  OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN,  JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,  Washington DC, June 5, 1986.  Hon. BARRY GOLDWATER,  Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,  U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR.  CHAIRMAN: During  the past  months  I have become deeply concerned  about the uncertain future our antisatellite  <ASAT> program faces  in Congress. From  my perspective, there are serious warfight ing implications which place our forces at  risk if Cognress continues the current mora torium on US ASAT  testing, and conse quently, prohibits ASAT development and  deployment.  The existing asymmetry in USSR versus  US ASAT capability allows the Soviets to  hold many of our vital space assets in jeop ardy without a comparable US capabilty to  act as a check. Our need to protect our criti cal space assets from ASAT attack, coupled  with our inability to repond-in-kind to such  attacks, leaves us with few options for re sponding to this threat.  A more important implication of the lack  of a US ASTA system is our inability to  deny the Soviets the use of satellite systems  that provide support to their operational  forces worldwide. The most threatening of  these satellite systems can provide targeting  information in real-time to Soviet weapons  platforms,  thus  enhancing  significantly  their ability to strike our forces. In fact, our  very ability to project power to areas vital  to our national security interests is threat ened directly by these satellite systems-a  threat we believe will grow more serious in  the future.  In short, we have a clear military need for  an ASAT capability to deny the enemy free  access and use of space in crisis and war.  Our operational requirements are based on  demonstrated Soviet space capabilities and  an assement of their warfighting potential.  By conceding our ASAT capability to the  Soviets through a moratorium, we also con cede to them an unrestricted space sanctu ary and wartime control of space.  Unilateral concession of space control to  the Soviets makes no contribution to arms  control or our policy of deterrence. In fact,  ",1986

1079,738,14,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President. I com mend the distinguished Senator from  Maryland for his statement. As usual.  he shows a sense of history, a sense of  conscience. and also does. as so often  should be done in this body. point out  to all of us on both sides of the aisle  that we ought to determine just where  we are going by our policies, asking  those questions that unfortunately too  often we ask after the fact when we  wished we could have undone some thing we had done.  0 1410  He has once more shown the wisdom  that we are accustomed to in this body  from  him and  that  the people of  Maryland  are  accustomed  to  from  him.  Mr. President, I am concerned that  we see this proliferation of so-called  covert actions around the world, espe cially when we have covert actions  that are  announced at Presidential  news conferences and are  talked of  openly by people  in  the administra tion. Those of us who have the respon sibility  of  oversight  in  intelligence  matters  find, more often  than not,  that we read more facts about these  intelligence matters on the front pages  of the New York Times or the Wash ington Post or the Wall Street Journal  in the morning than we ever do in in telligence briefings.  That is not the way to run covert op erations. But it is worse than that. It  is  a policy whereby  this country  is  more  and more  substituting  covert  action for a foreign policy. There has  never been a  time in the history of  this Nation when we have successfully  substituted covert action for foreign  policy. It also, I think. puts in people's  minds that all covert actions must be  matters  that we openly discuss and  have on the front pages of the paper. I  think  that  is creating an enormous  problem for our intelligence agencies.  Obviously,  the United States, as a  major power in the world, will have  secret  actions.  intelligence  actions,  covert actions around the world, which  must.  for our own national security  and the national security of our allies,  remain secret. So  it does not make  sense to me to have a White House  that announces what they call a covert  action and bring people to the White  House-like  Jonas Savimbi-talk  to  them. allow them to have $600,000 to  hire Black. Hannaford &  Stone. but  then say, ""This is secret, we cannot  debate it."" We can only talk about it  when  Black, Hannaford &  Stone  comes in, we can only talk about it  when the White House wants to dis cuss it, we can only talk about it on  backgrounders by  the State Depart ment or the White House for report ers. but do not debate it in Congress.

1089,764,14,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to join Senator STEVENS. I sup port his amendment as one who is con cerned about the problems underlying  our personnel. Nevertheless, what  I  am concerned about is that if we go  ahead with the legislation as it now  exists it will result in the establish ment of a separate personnel system  for  individual Federal agencies. We  cannot permit this to happen.  Mr. President,  I  join Senator STE VENS, chairman of the Subcommittee  on Civil Service, Post Office, and Gen eral Services,  in his effort  to strike  from the DOD authorization bill the  provisions authorizing the creation of  an alternative management system for  scientific,  technical,  and  acquisition  personnel  inside  the Department of  Defense.  As an original sponsor of the Presi dent's Blue Ribbon Commission on  Defense Management  and  a  strong  supporter of  its  recommendations,  I  believe the Government must improve  its ability to attract and retain those  employees critical to our national se curity needs. Yet, I am very concerned  about the standard and precedent that  this legislation would set.  While I understand and am sympa thetic  to  problems  underlying  the  Packard  Commission  recommenda tions, I am very concerned about the  establishment of separate personnel  systems for  individual Federal agen cies. This bill would do just that. It  would establish in the Department of  Defense a separate management and  pay system for acquisition, scientific,  and  technical personnel. In addtion,  provisions contained in the legislation  would permit alternative systems to be  created  along  organizational  lines,  thus including a much larger group of  individuals.  placed this number at over 300,000.  Some  estimates  have  This proposal comes at  the same  time the administration has released  ""The Civil Service Simplifaction Act  of 1986"" -a proposal for a comprehen sive reform of the entire civil service  system based on the China Lake and  San Diego Naval Operations demon stration projects. Any effort to reform  the civil  service system should not  focus on specific agencies or occupa tions, but  instead  take  into account  the entire Federal system.  The Office  of Management  and  Budget, in a statement of administra tion policy, urged that this section of  the bill be deleted for the same reason.  ""Fragmented agency authority is un acceptable"" in a view of the adminis tration's desire for comprehensive civil  service reform, the statement said.  With the White House, Senator STE VENS, Congressman FoRD, and myself  all interested in pursuing comprehen sive civil service reform legislation, it  is important that we do not start to  deal with  individual  agencies  in  a  piecemeal fashion. This past year we  worked long and hard at completing  the civil service retirement reform leg islation. It is  inevitable that we will  now tum to the current civil service to  examine  potential  improvements  in  that  system.  The  demonstration  projects will be very helpful in evalu ating alternative systems. Yet, creat ing a separate personnel system for ac quisition, technical, and scientific per sonnel inside the Department of De fense could impede an orderly Govem mentwide expansion of any compre hensive reform legislation.  In addition,  I  am concerned  that  technicians and scientists outside the  Department of Defense would feel, le gitimately, that they are being treated  unfairly by the creation of this alter native system. it is difficult to under stand why  a  scientist  conducting  cancer research at the National Insti tute of Health should be treated dif ferently than a scientist working for  the Department of Defense.  Because of these concerns, I support  Senator STEVENS in his effort to strike  from this legislation the portion creat ing a separate management personnel  system inside the Department of De fense.  For these and other reasons, I urge  the adoption of the Stevens amend ment.  I yield back the remainder of my  time.  ",1986

1131,816,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I am  introducing legislation today on behalf  of the Tulalip Tribes of Washington  that will first, authorize the tribe to  lease its valuable residential, commer cial, and industrial lands for longer pe riods of time; and second, permit the  tribal leadership to exercise a higher  level of self -determination in the area  of leasing.  The Tulalip Reservation  is  located  30 miles north of Seattle and is adja cent  to a major  interstate highway.  This  is  a  high-growth  area where  prime sites for leasing purposes are at  a premium. The tribe's 22,000-acre res ervation includes the largest tract of  undeveloped lands in the area. Over  the years, the tribe has derived sub stantial  income from residential and  industrial leasing programs. Given the  strategic location of the reservation,  the best use of most of its lands lies in  the area of  residential,  commercial,  and industrial leasing.  Under existing law and policy,  the  Secretary of the Interior must approve  a variety of  leases entered  into be tween Indian tribes and private indi viduals or entities. The Tulalip leader ship has discovered that the existing  authority is  inadequate to accommo date major developmental leases that  require a long period of time for debt  retirement  purposes. Although  the  tribe has been granted authority  to  lease its lands for terms not to exceed  99 years, such leases require Secretari al  approval  for  every  transaction.  Moreover,  the  regulations governing  this authority are overly cumbersome  and contrary to Indian self -determina tion and tribal self-governance.  I am pleased to support the progres sive Tulalip tribal leadership by intro ducing  this  legislation.  Specifically,  my bill amends Public Law 91-274 to  permit the tribe to enter into leases  not to exceed 75 years, with no option  to renew. The tribe, however, would be  required to develop a new regulatory  scheme for the extended leasing au thority. This  legislation will permit  the tribe to pursue its goal of econom ic self-sufficiency. This bill will give  the Tulalip  tribes  the  flexibility  to  work out profitable  leasing arrange ments,  flexibility  that  is needed  to  allow development of commercial, in dustrial, and residential properties in  Washington State.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of  my bill be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the bill  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  S.2728  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That sub section (b) of the first section of the Act of  August 9, 1955 <25 U.S.C. 415<b» is amended  to read as follows:  ""(b) Any lease by the Tulalip Tribes under  subsection <a>. except a lease for the exploi tation of any natural resource, shall not re quire the approval of the Secretary of the  Interior if""<1> the term of the lease does not exceed  30 years, with no option to renew, or  ""<2> the term of the lease does not exceed  75 years and the lease is executed pursuant  to tribal regulations approved by the Secre tary of the Interior before the execution of  the lease."".e  By Mr. STEVENS:  S. 2730. A bill entitled the ""Child  Protection  Forfeiture  Amendments  Act of 1986""; to the Committee on the  Judiciary.  CHILD PROTECTION FORFEITURE AMENDMENTS  ACT   ",1986
1132,816,14,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, today  I  am  introducing  legislation  to  strengthen the Child Protection Act of  1984. In addition, the bill's secondary  purpose is to reimburse to some degree  the U.S. Postal Service for the signifi cant expenditures required in their in vestigations of violations of the Child  Protection Act.  The Child Protection Act of 1984 de termines  which  actions  constitute  sexual exploitation of children. Indi viduals who are involved with the pro duction of the exploitative material, as  well as those who are involved in its  distribution, are subject to the penal ties designated by this act. These pen alties  include  property  forfeiture,  criminal fines ranging up to $200,000,  and prison sentences which may not  exceed fifteen years.  The bill would make  it clear that  property subject to seizure and forfeit ure under the Child Protection Act in cludes motor vehicles and other prop erty used to effect a violation of the  statute without  regard  to whether  such property moved in interstate or  foreign commerce.  The bill would also substantially im prove enforcement of the statute by  authorizing the Postal Service to exer cise the authority presently vested ex clusively in the Attorney General to  conduct civil  forfeitures of property  under section 2254(a) of title 18. The  Postal Service presently exercises a  major  investigative  role  in  enforce ment of the statute. The forfeiture au thority granted to the Postal Service  under the bill would cover any proper ty subject to forfeiture but would only  be exercised in cases where the viola tions included use of the mails, which  is prohibited by the Child Protection  Act.  The bill would also make amend ments to title 39 to allow the Postal  Service to retain forfeited amounts, in cluding proceeds from the sale of for feited items. This is in recognition of  the fact that the Postal Service will  incur costs of over $3 million a year in  investigating violations of, and con ducting  forfeitures  under,  the Act  which are funded by postal revenues  rather than funds appropriated from  the General Treasury.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to print at the end of my remarks  the entire text of the legislation.  ",1986
1133,829,14,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, the  Senate is about to debate legislation  that would impose additional econom ic sanctions against South Africa. As  we begin that debate, it is important  to  understand  the ways  in which  South  Africa  has  attempted-fre quently with success-to circumvent  already existing sanctions that prohib it the sale or export of arms and muni tions to South African military forces.  In an extraordinary analysis of the  history of the arms embargo against  South Africa, Thomas Conrad has de scribed the ways in which the South  African authorities have successfully  obtained  technology  and weaponry  from U.S. corporations, thereby avoid ing the embargo. In an article that ap peared in the March issue of the Bul letin of Atomic Scientists, Mr. Conrad  cites a series of examples,  including  South Africa's acquisition of a nucle ar-capable howitzer, a laser rangefind er, a new family of grenade launchers,  a new series of mine-resistant counter insurgency vehicles,  and new sonar  electronics systems. Mr. Conrad con cludes:  Direct sales  to South African weapons  manufacturers have persisted despite  the  U.N. embargo. Direct exports to ARMSCOR  <the South African State-owned arms con glomerate> are now prohibited under U.S.  regulations but the South Africans have ap parently been able to keep the supply lines  open.  One of the loopholes  in the arms  embargo is to be found in the licensing  process. Certain  items on  the State  Department's munitions list have been  decontrolled for sale to South Africa,  and  munitions  list  exports  have  jumped  dramatically. According  to  Conrad:  In virtual secrecy, the State Department  licensed over $27.9 million worth of technol ogy on  the munitions  list  for export  to  South Africa from 1982 to 1984.  Conrad bases this report on informa tion obtained under the Freedom of  Information Act. Conrad states that:  The sales included encryption equipment,  navigation  gear,  image  intensifiers,  and  technical know-how. The users were private  firms and two government-owned research  installations, both of which do military  work.  In addition to imposing new econom ic sanctions against South Africa,  it  will be  important for the Senate to  close  some of  these  loopholes. The  United States should not continue to  allow  the  South African Govern ment-either openly or surreptitious ly-to procure weapons  systems or  weapons  technology which  is  then  used to maintain the brutal apartheid  system.  I  ask  that the article by Thomas  Conrad entitled ""South Africa Circum vents Embargo""  be printed  in  the  RECORD.  The article follows:  SouTH AFRICA CIRCUMVENTS EMBARGO  <By Thomas Conrad)  In October 1984, two Malaysian warships  steamed into Simonstown Naval dockyard South Africa's largest-for a 24-hour refuel ing and  revictualing  stopover. What  for  other countries would be a  routine event  was a  rare moment to be savored for the  South Africans. It marked a  tiny symbolic  breach in Pretoria's international military  isolation:  the  two  frigates were  the first  military ships to call at a South African  port since 1981.  The Malaysian Navy's courtesy call on  South Africa seemed odd and incongruous.  Since  the  imposition of  the mandatory  United Nations ban on sales of ""arms and  related material"" to South Africa in 1977,  most foreign military establishments have  officially held Pretoria at arm's length.  Public contracts are few and far between. In  1982, South Africa was  thrown out of an  international arms show in Athens when it  was discovered that its state-owned weapons  conglomerate, ARMSCOR, was quietly-but  publicly-exhibiting  its wares.  Just  two  years later, the Chilean government allowed  ARMSCOR to exhibit South African-made  missiles, ordnance, and military electronics  at the ""FIDA '84"" arms bazaar in Santiago.

1134,855,14,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, after 6 years of  war and over $2 billion in United States aid,  elements of the Salvadoran Government con tinue to kill, kidnap, and abuse citizens of El  Salvador. Though the absolute number of vio lations has declined since the mass killings of  the early 1980's, some 20 to 25 Salvadoran  citizens per month continue to die in targeted  killings  by Government  security  forces  or  death squads  linked with  the Government.  Salvadoran workers and trade unionists have  been particular targets of this repression. The  situation in El Salvador therefore deeply con cerns many trade union members here in the  United States.  I commend to my colleagues' attention the  attached resolution, which was passed on July  14, 1986, by the New York Area Labor Com mittee in Support of Democracy and Human  Rights in El Salvador.  RESOLUTION ON EL SALVADOR  Whereas, the living standards of Salvador an workers has dropped 54 percent in the  last five years, inflation this year is rising at  the rate of 36 percent, and workers have not  seen real wage increases,  Whereas,  the Duarte government, with  U.S. aid, continues  to conduct saturation  bombing in civilian area in El Salvador,  Whereas, Amnesty International has con tinued  to receive  reports of arbitrary ar rests, death squad killings and disappear ances,  Whereas, unions such as ASTTEL <the  Salvadoran  Telecommunications Workers  Union> have faced firings, military occupa tion of their worksites, takeover of their of fices, and the management of ANTEL has  set up a company union, ASTA, and has af filiated it with the Communication Workers  International <PTTI> in an effort to derail  international support,  Whereas, garment, electronics and other  plants continue to be closed down here as  U.S. companies flee  to Latin America and  other areas where they can exploit cheap  labor,  Whereas, the Salvadoran labor movement  has formed a broad labor federation-UNTS  <Unidad Nacional de Trabajadores Salvador enos> and recently organized a demonstra tion of over 80,000 people to call for a settle ment of the civil war through negotiations,  20187  Whereas, under the government of Salva doran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, re pression of trade union rights continues de spite his promises of democratic changes,  Whereas,  a  free,  democratic  society  cannot exist without trade unions and re spect for human rights: Therefore, be it re solved that trade unionists in the United  States:  Continue to oppose U.S. military and eco nomic aid to the Salvadoran government,  Call and write their Congressional repre sentatives urging them to discontinue such  aid,  Send  letters  immediately  to President  Duarte urging him to respect trade union  rights and to pressure the government-run  telecommunications agency <ANTEL> to ne gotiate with the ASTTEL workers, re-hire  the fired workers and respect trade union  rights, and release the sons of union leader  Centno from prison.

1135,855,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, for the last 2  years the House has supported a moratorium  on the testing of antisatellite [Asat] weapons  against targets in space. Last year, after tough  negotiating with  the Senate,  the House-sup ported ban on this testing finally became law.  Since  that  time, a de  facto United States Soviet moratorium on Asat testing has worked  exactly as planned.  It will continue  through  October 1 , 1986-but it must be extended  through 1987 if we want to ensure reaping the  benefrts of this arrangement in the Mure.  All of  the arguments  that persuaded  the  House to support the Asat ban last year and  the year before are just as compelling today.  We continue  to be more dependent on our  military satellites that the Soviets are on their  satellites. The Soviet Asat weapon is a year  older and a year closer to total obsolescence.  Allowing United States  testing of  the F-15  launched MHV Asat will more than ever mean  all bets are off on any future United States Soviet negotiations to end the Asat arms race.  In addition to these compelling reasons to  preserve the Asat test moratorium, there are  several  important new  factors  to consider.  First, we now have no way of launching re placements  for our most important satellites  into orbit. With  the Challenger disaster and  the grounding of our Delta and Titan heavy lift  rockets,  it  is dubious whether we could  re spond effectively to a crisis requiring the de ployment of new military satellites.  It is un clear when any of these key launch systems  will be on-line again.  ",1986
1136,868,14,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I am introducing  two pieces of legislation today that would pre vent the United States from giving preferential  tariff treatment to human rights-violating coun tries. Under the Generalized System of Prefer ences [GSP], the United States allows eligible  products from certain developing countries to  be imported duty-free into the United States.  Under  the present  law, nations  that aid or  abet international terrorism are excluded from  receiving  this benefit. But at the same  time  there is no such exisiting exclusion for coun tries that implement terrorism within their own  boundaries. One of my bills will make any  country ineligible for GSP benefits which vio lates internationally recognized human rights  or that  is governed by a  totalitarian  regime  that is not implementing measures for a tran sition to a democratic form of government  My second bill, introduced with Representa tive BEREUTER, calls for the United States to  the people of Chile  in  their  direcUy support  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  struggle against the tyranny of the Pinochet  regime. As we speak, close to a thousand po litical prisoners are in Chilean jails being tor tured or awaiting  torture.  In Representative  MORRISON's recent report on the human rights  situation in Chile, he describes how prisoners  are stripped naked, watered down, and then  electrically  shocked. But  such actions are  nothing new. Since 1973, the Chilean people  have continuously suffered  from government  sponsored torture, arbitrary arrests, and politi cal killings. The citizens of that country as well  as the American conscious have had enough.  The only way to ensure the halting of these  internationally recognized human rights viola tions  is  for Chile  to return  to its democratic  tradition.  Despite widespread support within Chile for  this transition to democracy, the Pinochet gov ernment has made it clear that it has no inten tion of abandoning its authoritarian practices.  On July 11, 1986, General Pinochet declared  that he  intended  for his  regime  to continue  until 1997. The Chilean Government also has  not implemented any significant reforms that  are necessary for the development of democ racy. Political parties are still outlawed, elec tion  laws have not been  implemented and  there is no freedom of speech or press. Fur thermore, General Pinochet has  refused  to  open  into any dialogue with  the democratic  opposition.  Our bill attempts  to  support an end  to  human rights violations and a transition to de mocracy in Chile by denying duty-free  treat ment to any product exported from Chile into  the United States as granted by the U.S. Gen eralized System of Preferences  [GSP]. This  action will continue to be in effect until Chile  has improved its human rights situation to a  level as to be considered acceptable by inter national standards and has taken significant  steps to restore democracy.  I urge my colleagues to suport these bills  and make  it  the U.S.  policy  to no  longer  reward oppressive nations with tariff breaks.  NEW INITIATIVES IN  EDUCATION  HON. STEPHEN J. SOLARZ  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 8, 1986  ",1986
1137,868,14,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, It is my honor to  speak today in praise of both the Dropout Pre vention and Reentry Act and the Gifted and  Talented Children and Youth Education Act.  These bills  together  represent a compre hensive approach toward the overall upgrad ing of this country's educational system. As  the Dropout Prevention Act works  to  insure  that everyone achieves a minimum satisfac tory level of education, the Gifted and Talent ed Children Act extends the resources avail able  to  those enrolled  in conventional pro grams, and enables them to realize their po tential.  The combined effect of halting decline and  increasing growth will very  likely lead  to an  overall improvement in national academic per formance as well as greater national produc tivity due to higher education levels.  August 8, 1986  Two million young people  in  this country  have uncommon gifts, yet their talents go un recognized. It is a crime to let such a valuable  and limitless resource go to waste. The Gifted  and Talented Children and Youth Act is a vital  first step  to preserving and developing  the  gifts  these young people have  to offer. We  have  the opportunity  to nurture a  chance  which can only repay us a thousandfold when  the benefits are reaped.  With the impetus this legislation will provide,  we bring to fruition the maximum potential of  exceptional young people.  I can  think of no  nobler goal.  The Dropout Prevention and Reentry Act  strikes at the heart of one of the major prob lems assailing our educational system: How  can we hope to educate our children  if stu dents abandon the classroom?  Lack of education is a problem that extends  beyond its impact on the individual. The effect  generated by  the student who has dropped  out goes much further. His unrealized abilities  are an immeasurable and unrecoverable loss  to society.  The Dropout and Prevention Act not only  recognizes the dropout problem, but it initiates  a program that is designed to pool successful  methods of keeping  young  people  in  the  classroom and extend exemplary projects.  As a member of the Education and Labor  Committee, I am pleased to have been a co sponsor of both  these measures and  I ap plaud my colleagues  in Congress  for unani mously  approving  them  and  taking  initial  strides in this important area of national con cern.  I am sure it will not be long before we  see  tangible evidence of the value of these  two pieces of legislation.  SOVIET JEWRY  HON. JACK F. KEMP  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 8, 1986  ",1986
1138,868,14,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank my friend  from Texas [Mr. FIELDS]  for his leadership in  the issue of human rights in the Soviet Union,  and  for providing  the Members of Congress  with  the opportunity  to talk about  the Fain bergs, a refusenik family facing great hardship  and tragedy. I know that Mr. FIELDS feels very  strongly about  the  issue, and he has ex pressed to me his deep personal concern for  the Fainberg family.  The Fainbergs, Michael and Faena and their  sons, Andrew and Michael, applied  to emi grate  in 1979, when emigration and hopes  were high. These hopes were dashed  long  before  they were officially  turned down 2  years later. Both Faena and Michael, Sr., were  dismissed  from  the  important jobs they had  earned as outstanding graduates of the  top  Soviet institutions. Andrew and Michael Jr. are  following  in their footsteps with brilliant aca demic careers, in spite of the obstacles faced  by all Jews, and particularly refuseniks. They  are harassed, beaten and constantly assault ed.  It is crucial that the Fainbergs be permitted  to emigrate this year. Next year Michael will  be eligible for induction into the Army.

1141,881,14,Mr.  STEVENS.," Mr.  President,  I  hope that the Senator would not per sist with this amendment, but if he  does that the Senate will not support  it and  it will be disposed of  in a  manner that will allow us to consider  the concept in the appropriations bill.  This is really an amendment that be longs on  the appropriations bill be cause it deals with making funds avail able to the Department. This bill does  not make funds available to the De partment. This bill authorizes funds  for the Department, and leaves it up  to the Appropriations Committee  to  determine where the funds originate.  As a matter of fact, there is a great  deal of misunderstanding about  the  prior years' authorizations  that are  still unfunded.  We deal with budget authority and  with budget outlays and this amend ment confuses the two, I would say re spectfully  to my good  friend  from  Montana, because it says that ""20 per cent of any funds appropriated to or  for the use of the Department that  remain unobligated as of September  30 shall be made available  for pro grams authorized under this act.""  Now, let us take a cruiser. We fully  fund a cruiser. That money may not  be spent for 5 years. We know when it  will be spent. We have put it in the  pipeline  to spend and  it  is outlays.  Each year as the time comes up for  spending, we look at the outlay ceil ings and that is the thing that comes  into effect. The Senator's amendment,  as I understand it, would take 20 per cent of the funds that have been ap propriated in the past and remain un obligated at September 30 and say use  them this year, in 1987. They may well  be scheduled for  the completion of  that cruiserin 1988, 1989, and 1990.  ",1986

1154,881,14,Mr. STEVENS.," Let me say to my  friend that we do not have multiyear  contracts on all appropriations but we  do fully fund some items and they rep resent the bulk of the funds that are  unobligated at the end of each year,  and to have a concept in this bill that  does not deal with appropriations, to  say  that the moneys  to be used  to  fund this bill are to come from the un obligated accounts on September 30 is  in effect  to prejudge the appropria tions bill  that has not  even been  marked up.  I understand what  the Senator  is  doing and if at the time we bring the  appropriations bill here he wants us to  reach out and find  the unobligated  balances that represent savings-and I  would call the Senator's attention to  the fact that last year I did that with  $6.7 billion and put them into a special  fund, and that fund was used and it  represented savings from the past and  future years, I might add.  0 1120  We have now used that to absorb  $1.5  billion  for  the  shuttle. This  Senate initiated the full use of that in  the supplemental appropriations.  I say respectfully to my friend that  this is not the place, because this is  not an appropriations bill. This is an  authorization bill.  This authorization, incidentally, rep resents about two-thirds of the money  that will be spent in 1987. One-third  represents  the amount  that will be  spent by prior years' authorization,  and that money is outlays. As we con sider budget authority, we have one  ceiling; and as we consider budget out lays, we have another ceiling. This  amendment deals with budget author ity on budget outlays, and I think it is  improper.  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.  ",1986
1155,881,14,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, will  the Senator from Virginia permit me  to  respond  to  the  Senator  from  Alaska?  ",1986
1156,881,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Montana is recognized  on his time.  ,1986
1157,881,14,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President,  I  should respond to the Senator from  Alaska exactly at this point.  He says that if I want to bring an  amendment on the appropriation bill,  that will be OK. I must inform the  Senator from Alaska that if I offer an  amendment on an appropriation bill,  as I did last year, to accomplish the  point he is talking about, that amend ment will be ruled out of order as leg islation on an appropriation bill. I at tempted to do this very thing last year  and I could not do it because it was  ruled to be legislation on an appropria tion bill.  This is  the only bill on which the  Senator or any other Senator on the  floor can offer this, to either the au thorization bill or the appropriation  bill, to accomplish what I am trying to  accomplish.  The Senator from Alaska says that  one-third of it is necessary to be avail able under the process that we follow  of  budget  authority  versus  budget  outlay. I point out to the very able  Senator from Alaska that more than  one-third of this $6 billion slush fund  will be available. I am only taking 20  percent.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  STEVENS. Mr.  President,  I  hope Members will see what I am talk ing about.  This  says:  ""Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law or of this act.""  I am always suspicious of that-not  suspicious of my friend. That means  disregard  the whole United States  Code.  That  means  that  specific  moneys we have authorized for tanks  or planes or cruisers or aircraft carri ers, whatever it is, that we know will  not be spent in 1987, the moneys that  are still unobligated on September 30,  1986, we  are going  to  reduce  that  amount by 20  percent. We do not  know where it will come from, but we  will take 20 percent of them.  Then, this amendment directs that  the Appropriations Committee  take  into  account  that  that 20  percent  which has already been appropriated  will be used in 1987.  It may seem strange to other Mem bers of the Senate, but we do not fund  bridges the way we fund ships. When  we say we are going to build a ship, we  forward fund it. We take into account  a projection  for  inflation, and  that  money is there for 5 years. I can tell  you that on September 30, 1986, there  will be a lot of that money unexpend ed and unobligated, and it should not  be touched because it has been com mitted by law.  Mr.  ",1986
1158,894,14,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I would  be happy to work with the Senator  from illinois in the coming year. Let  us see what effect  this has. Let us  check with the Army. I will be glad to  make certain that we have hearings on  this next year, when it will be brought  up in the subcommittee that is chaired  by  the distinguished Senator  from  California and on which the ranking  minority member serves. We will look  at the data and see if it is doing the  job. If it is, fine. I will be glad to come  here and offer that.  ",1986
1159,894,14,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I yield 2  minutes  to  the Senator from Mary land.  ",1986
1160,894,14,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President,  I  commend  the distinguished Senator  from illinois for offering this amend ment and, more broadly commend him  for the interest he has taken in the  subject of making sure that those who  serve our country are proficient in for eign language. He sought to do  the  same with respect to American diplo mats who work abroad, and this is con sistent with that initiative which he  exercised there with a great deal of  imagination and responsibility.  I think it is obvious on the face of it  that this is an enormously important  skill for members of the armed serv ices to have.  I want to ask the Senator from Illi nois a couple of questions, in view of  the arguments that have been made.  First of all,  as  I  understand  the  amendment, while it would permit the  Secretary to pay more special pay, a  higher monthly rate than in the bill, it  does not require him to do so. This is a  ceiling. It says ""not in excess of."" The  Secretary could still make the judg ment to pay only 100 or 50 or 150. He  could not  go  above  the Senator's  figure. Is that correct?  ",1986
1161,894,14,Mr. SIMON.," The Senator is correct.  In fact,  the  intent of  the Armed  Forces is to give that maximum only  when we  have  two  additional  lan guages, one of which  is a hard lan guage-Japanese,  Korean,  Russian,  something like that.  ",1986
1162,894,14,Mr. SARBANES.," I  think that is a  very  important point. The Senator's  amendment  does  not  require  the  higher monthly pay. It only gives the  Secretary the authority to pay up to  that figure if he chooses to do so.  So it gives some discretion  to the  Secretary in order to make this pro gram work, just as the Secretary, as I  understand  it, has the discretion  to  judge which languages are necessary.  ",1986
1163,894,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator's time has expired.  ,1986
1164,894,14,Mr. SIMON., I yield the Senator 1  additional minute.  ,1986
1165,894,14,Mr. SARBANES.," As  I understand  the way the legislation is written, the  Secretary of Defense  is going  to be  able to determine which language is  necessary in which to have this profi ciency. In other words, if you have a  language  in which many people are  qualified, you do not need to urge it;  and the Secretary, I take it, would not  put that language on the list.  So the Secretary has two discretions.  One is the language to be sought. Is  that correct?  ",1986
1166,894,14,Mr. SIMON., That is correct.  ,1986
1167,894,14,Mr. SARBANES.," Second, under the  Senator's amendment, this would only  allow him  to pay  the higher figure  that he judged was necessary.  I submit that this is an important  program. This is giving the Secretary  sufficient  latitude  in order  to have  some real chance of making the pro gram work.  As the Senator pointed out, you may  have related languages in which you  want to develop a skill, in which more  likely a skill can be developed, and you  may need a greater incentive in order  to accomplish that.  I  strongly  support  the Senator's  amendment. I commend him for offer ing it. I cannot think of a limited area  at small cost that would pay greater  returns in strengthening our military  bases.  ",1986
1168,894,14,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I thank  my colleague from Maryland, Senator  SARBANES,  for his comments. I  think  he is right on target.  I appreciate the comments of Sena tor GLENN, Senator GOLDWATER, and  Senator WILSON, even though I do not  agree with their conclusion as to what  we should do with this amendment.  Senator GoLDWATER  says  that  the  military  is not ready. The reality  is  that  the Department  of Defense  thinks they are ready-not for the $18  million I am asking for but $36 mil lion. They want 22,000 people to whom  they can give this pay incentive. My  amendment cuts  that  in half. The  amendment of the committee basically  cuts that down to one-quarter.  What you have here is a resource for  the Nation. I cite what happened in  the bombing in Berlin, where we inter cepted  the  Libyan  intelligence  Berber, only we did not have any who  could translate Berber; and we had it  translated 24 hours late, too late, to  stop the tragedy in Berlin.  Let me cite a figure-and I  regret  that  I  do not have  the up-to-date  figure-but as of 3 or 4 years ago, we  had 497,000 U.S. armed service person nel  stationed overseas. The Armed  Forces regarded 512 of over 400,000 as  linguistically  accomplished  in  the  in  to be a military  country where  they were stationed.  You do not need  expert to recognize that that presents  real problems, and this moves in the  right direction.  Eighty percent of these people will  work in the field of intelligence. With  this pay incentive we can retain the  people who really have the skills or  have  a  better  chance  at  retaining  those skills.  Finally, Mr. President,  I  disagree  with  the Senator  from California  when he said that we have no experi ence as to whether it will work. The  CIA does this; the State Department  does this; the NSA does this. I am ad vised  that other groups do  it with  their armed forces. I do not know the  details there.  ",1986
1169,894,14,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, will the  Senator yield?  ",1986
1170,894,14,Mr. SIMON., I yield.  ,1986
1171,894,14,Mr. WILSON., I  thank the Senator  from illinois for his courtesy.  I  think the Senator misunderstood.  We do not doubt the wisdom of the  program or we would not have author ized it. What I said was how it will  work and whether or not 100 or 200  were required. We are looking for time  and experience to determine whether  or not this is a sufficient incentive.  0 1550  ,1986
1172,894,14,Mr. SIMON.," I understand.  I would simply say I think we can,  with some prudence, cut back on the  Defense Department's request. Their  request was for $36 million. OMB cut  it back to $18 million. The committee  has cut it back to $7.3 million. I am  simply putting it back to 50 percent of  the Defense Department's request.  I think it is a modest request. I think  to move to half of what they request  really makes sense for the armed serv ices of our Nation.  ",1986
1173,894,14,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield?  ",1986
1174,894,14,Mr. SIMON., I am pleased to yield.  ,1986
1175,894,14,Mr. SARBANES.,"  I  simply say all  you are doing is giving the Secretary a  higher monthly figure which he can  use at his discretion. You are not re quiring him to pay that figure. This  gives him some latitude to make some  judgments with respect to the difficul ty of the language, with respect to the  number of language skills that a par ticular person may have that you want  to hold in the service so that he has an  ability then to implement the program  in such a way that it can produce a  maximum response.  The lower you cut the figure under  which he can operate the less ability  he has to adjust to the situation with  respect  to  language  capabilities  in  terms of the number of languages or  with respect to the desirability of ob taining skills in certain difficult lan guages in which very few people may  ",1986
1176,907,14,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  have had the good fortune of serving  in this body for some 24 years. I com mend Senator BYRD and Senator DoLE  for this request of the U.S. Senate. I  think they have tried to aceommodate,  in  the best  tradition of  this body.  views which are widely divergent in a  very complex,  involved process. I, as  one who has passed, quite frankly. the  majority  leader  and  the minority  leader on certain issues, want to ex press my very deep appreciation and  gratitude for what I think is the thor oughness of consideration  that has  been given to all views.  All of us know at this hour, after a  very extensive week, we can flyspeck  this agreement until tomorrow morn ing. I hope we will not. I think that  this request has demonstrated a real  sensitivity to trying to accommodate  different interests. Many of us might  have structured it in different ways,  but I  think all of us who share this  tradition of  trying  to accommodate  different  interests owe  the Senator  from West Virginia and the Senator  from Kansas a very deep debt of grati tude and  I,  for one, who  feel very  strongly about both issues, want to ex press that view at this time.  ",1986
1177,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I  thank  the Senator from Massachusetts, not  only for the effective efforts he put  into developing  the  agreement but  also for his strong expression of sup port for the agreement now that it has  been outlined.  I hope,  then,  that we could agree  that one-half hour of the 2 hours of  Mr. LEAHY's request will go over until  Tuesday  if he does not use  it on  Monday.  Also, Mr. DoDD wishes 30 minutes of  the time on titles I and II under his  control before cloture. I would be will ing to take that 30 minutes from the  10 hours if that would be agreeable so  we do not add  time  to  the overall  debate; we simply let Mr. DoDD have  30 minutes of the 10 hours.  ",1986
1178,907,14,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I do not  know of any discussion. The distin guished Senator from Georgia is here.  I understand there is 1 hour equally  divided between Senators MATTINGLY  and SASSER. This would be an extra 30  minutes on title I?  ",1986
1179,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, and I would suggest  that it be equally divided between the  two managers,  to come off  the 10  hours; it would be 15 minutes off one  side, 15 minutes off the other.  ",1986
1180,907,14,Mr. DODD., If the minority leader  would yield,1986
1181,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, Mr. President,  yield.  ",1986
1182,907,14,Mr. DODD.," It seems to me that on  Monday, given the unanimous-consent  agreement that has been reached al ready with those who will be using the  2 hours or a good portion of the 2  hours, there is a practical matter that  I  getting involved on Monday may be  difficult. Nonetheless, I would like an  opportunity  prior  to  the  cloture  motion on Wednesday to have a half hour to discuss  the background and  history of  this particular question,  rather than a specific amendment. So  I hope that on Tuesday, I would be  able  to have  that one-half hour  in  order to lay that framework out. That  is the thing I am hoping for.  ",1986
1183,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," That would not add to  the overall time. I am just suggesting  that from the 10 hours of debate, 15  minutes come from each side and be  allotted to Mr. DoDD for his control.  ",1986
1184,907,14,Mr. DODD., Privided that is not on  title I. Title I would come on Monday.  I would rather not be constrained to  fit that half-hour in on title I. I would  rather leave it until we are considering  title II on Tuesday.  ,1986
1185,907,14,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Mr. President,  would that be an extra half-hour?  ",1986
1186,907,14,Mr. DODD.," No, it would be extract ed from the 10 hours, 15 minutes to a  side.  ",1986
1187,907,14,Mr. MATTINGLY., I think it ought  to be allocated proportionally. I think  we have it right now as 8 hours and 2  hours.  ,1986
1188,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," No, it is 10 hours.  ",1986
1189,907,14,Mr. MATTINGLY.," I think it ought  to be allocated proportionally, 8 hours  and 2 hours of debate, am I not cor rect, Mr. President? There are 8 hours  of debate to their side and 2 hours on  our side.  ",1986
1190,907,14,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  the 8  hours is on South Africa. On Contra  aid",1986
1191,907,14,Mr. DOLE.," I might say if the minori ty leader would yield, there is more in terest on  that side  taking  time on  Contra aid and there is more interest  on this side in taking time on South  Africa. What we have attempted to do  is make certain we understand those  concerns and try to calculate the time  accordingly. So on South Africa, we  have set aside 2 hours for Senator  DENTON, 2 hours for Senator WALLoP.  We think we have a pretty good bal ance. I do not think this is a matter of  any great moment.  ",1986
1192,907,14,Mr. MATTINGLY.," I have no objec tion, Mr. President.  ",1986
1193,907,14,Mr. DODD.," There is no objection on  that particular request, did I under stand that correctly?  ",1986
1194,907,14,Mr. HARKIN., Reserving the right to  object.  ,1986
1195,907,14,Mr. BYRD., I hope we have resolved  Mr. DoDD's request.  ,1986
1196,907,14,Mr. HARKIN.,  I am reserving  the  right to object because I did not catch  it. Was this a half-hour on title I or II?  ,1986
1197,907,14,Mr. DODD.,  I sought the time on  title I and title II so as not to be con strained. I would prefer to have the  half-hour for debate on titles II and  III.  ,1986
1198,907,14,Mr. HARKIN., Dealing with the sub ject matter in titles II and III?  ,1986
1199,907,14,Mr. DODD., That is correct.  ,1986
1200,907,14,Mr. HARKIN., But not on title I.  ,1986
1201,907,14,Mr. DODD., That is correct.  ,1986
1202,907,14,Mr. HARKIN., So what the Senator  from Connecticut is asking is that he  be given a half-hour to discuss some thing on title II and title ill?  ,1986
1203,907,14,Mr. DODD., That is correct.  ,1986
1204,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," May I call to the atten tion of the Senators also that there is  1 hour of debate on title I, the mili tary construction bill, under the con trol of the managers. They can yield  that. There are 10 hours on titles II  and III of the military construction  bill. The managers can yield that to  Senators so Senators do not have to  feel they have to carve out their 15  minutes here today or 20 minutes.  I think we have settled the problem  of the Senator from Connecticut.  ",1986
1205,907,14,Mr. DODD.," I thank the Senator.  Mr. President, it is my understand ing that that unanimous-consent re quest has been accepted, is that cor rect?  ",1986
1206,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," That is part of the over all agreement, yes.  ",1986
1207,907,14,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, per haps both leaders can straighten this  out. First of all, is it clear that during  the 10 hours of debate, some of which  might be used on Monday on titles II  and III, and I would like to have the  distinguished majority leader's atten tion on this.  ",1986
1208,907,14,Mr. DOLE.," Excuse me, Mr. Presi dent.  ",1986
1209,907,14,Mr. MELCHER.," Is it clear that on  titles II and Ill, under the 10 hours of  debate equally divided, if it is oppor tune, amendments could be offered on  Monday?  ",1986
1210,907,14,Mr. BYRD., Yes.  ,1986
1211,907,14,Mr. DOLE., Yes.  ,1986
1212,907,14,Mr. MELCHER.," And  there could  either be time yielded out of the 10  hours or, if there is a lull on the recog nition of those on the list",1986
1213,907,14,Mr. DOLE., That is correct.  ,1986
1214,907,14,Mr. MELCHER.," All right. Then, do I  understand correctly on South Africa  that at the conclusion of the time this is on page 4 of the unanimous consent request, the top request, that  on the conclusion of all time on South  Africa,  amendments  that were not  brought up could be brought up at  that time. What would be the time  limit on those amendments?  ",1986
1215,907,14,Mr. BYRD., Two minutes.  ,1986
1216,907,14,Mr. MELCHER., Two minutes. So it  applies equally to titles II and III of  the first bill on Contras and on South  Africa.  ,1986
1217,907,14,Mr. DOLE., Yes.  ,1986
1218,907,14,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, Mr. President.  ",1986

1252,946,14,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, I cer tainly recognize the deep desire that  the Senator from Florida has in seeing  enactment of child nutrition legisla tion. She has been a tireless advocate  on  this  subject. Even  during  her  recent hospitalization, she was diligent  in lobbying from her hospital bed for  action and conclusion of child nutri tion legislation.  The problem is, Mr. President, as it  is so often these days, money. There  simply  is not enough  room  in  the  budget to accommodate the Senator's  desire  for  this  amendment which  would add, according to the Congres sional Budget Office,  $46 million  during fiscal year 1987, a total of $168  million during the next 3 fiscal years.  The Senator from North Carolina is  more than willing to see a reauthoriza tion of child nutrition programs-even  a reauthorization that would include  cost-of-living  increases  in  reimburse ments for meals served. What the Sen ator cannot agree to is additional in creases  which  would  have major  budget ramifications.  All of us love children, and none of  us opposes child nutrition programs  that  assist  in  providing  valuable  lunches and breakfasts  for  the Na tion's school children. But what are  the ramifications for the Nation if this  amendment is adopted?  If we are ever to reduce the Federal  deficit, we simply cannot shrink from  our duty to refuse to increase Federal  spending. It is a matter of principle  with me, Mr. President.  Spending will be increased by nearly  $50 million annually. That is spending  for entitlement programs. There will  be no second chance for the Appro priations Committee to restrain spend ing. If this amendment is adopted, en titlement spending will increase.  I know  that  the Senator believes  that there was ""room in the budget  resolution"" for the extra money. But  it has  become  apparent  since  the  budget resolution was adopted that it  was a budget based more on wishful  thinking than reality. Unofficial esti mates emerging from OMB and CBO  now indicate that the projected deficit  for fiscal year 1987 will be something  on the order of $164 to $169 billion.  That  is $20  to $25  billion more more-than the budget resolution an",1986

1255,1050,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I am  offering an amendment to the commit tee  amendment  to  the  bill.  This  amendment does two things. First, it  incorporates a suggestion by the dis tinguished Senator  from Maryland,  the chairman of the Judiciary Com mittee's Subcommittee  on Patents,  Copyrights  and Trademarks, which  clarifies  that  the Government will  retain a right to use an invention re sulting from cooperative research for  its own purposes, royalty free, and in  perpetuity.  Second, the amendment corrects an  error in drafting in section 7, the em ployee activities section of  the bill.  This section was intended to codify an  Executive order which requires that  agencies  turn over  to  the  inventor  rights to patents in which the Govern ment has no interest. The committee  amendment  inadvertently  provides  that the agency may turn over these  rights. The Executive order, which  dates  from  the Truman administra tion, says the agency shall turn over  these rights. Because the objective of  the bill is  to codify  this policy and  therefore strengthen it, it is important  that the bill track the Executive order  correctly. This is what the amendment  accomplishes.  Let me also note one error in the  committee report which may be mis leading. Section 5 of the bill defines  cooperative research and development  arrangments as not including a pro curement  contract  or  cooperative  agreement as those terms are used in  sections 6303, 6304, and 6305 of title  31, United States Code.

1261,1050,14,Mr.  DOLE.," Mr.  President,  this  amendment which  I  am submitting  today would clarify the authority of  Federal  Laboratory Directors with  regard to granting foreign access to re search  information. It is my under standing that this language has been  cleared by the necessary parties, and  that it will be accepted. I believe this  amendment also has the support of  the administration.  U.S. industries are suffering from a  serious trade imbalance, and it is im portant that we protect our interests  where there is a  lack of reciprosity.  Foreign  countries  like  Japan  have  become our very strong competitors in  the world market, and perhaps we  should not be quite so free with shar ing our own research, especially in the  high tech field.  Our universities and Federal labora tories have  traditionally been very  open, and there has always been easy  access to the results of our basic re search. The language which the Sena tor from Kansas is adding to this bill  would give Federal Laboratory Direc to  tors  the discretionary  authority  deny foreign  industrial organizations  and persons subject to the control of a  foreign  company  or  Government  access to U.S. research, when the for eign  country  in question does not  grant similar privileges  to American  persons and industrial organizations.  It is only fair that Federal laborato ry directors have control over  the  fruits of their endeavors, without the  concern that foreign entities will take  advantage of the foundation our lab oratories have established. This type  of information has been all too freely  available,  and  foreign  competitors  have saved themselves a  lot of time,  energy, and expense by taking the re sults of our research and capitalizing  on the free information they have ob tained-to our disadvantage. It is time  that we ask for reciprocal treatment.  I  ask unanimous  consent  that a  Washington Post article dealing with  this problem be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  WHY SUBSIDIZE IMPORTERS? FOREIGNERS UsE  OUR UNIVERSITIES TO BURY OUR INDUSTRY  <By Michael Schrage)  Even as the trade deficit soars to a record  $150 billion, the U.S. is funding a multibi lion-dollar program that effectively sells the  best of America's computer and engineering  research to its Japanese and European com petiiton for less than 50 cents on the dollar.  Not  a  bad deal-if  you're a Hitachi,  Daewoo or a Siemens AG looking for a tech nical edge in today's competitive global mar  ketplace.  What kind of policy is it that subsidizes  America's corporate rivals with millions of  dollars worth of our vital research?  It's the foreign policy practiced by Ameri ca's leading research universities.  According to National Science Foundation  statistics, nearly half the engineering and  computer science graduate students in this  country are from overseas; nearly half of  them will return to the countries and com panies that sponsored them. There they will  apply  their newly acquired knowledge  to  kick the stuffing out of U.S. companies.  These best and brightest minds will have  studied in America the latest in semiconduc tor technology; the best ways to create new  design software; the intricacies of develop ing novel composite materials for automo biles and airplanes. Expressly selected by  their governments or companies to learn at  America's finest universities, many of these  students will become the captains of over seas industries.  Now,  it's terrific  that U.S. universities  define the state of the art in so many engi neering disciplines and that this country en courages the international exchange of re search and a free flow of information.  But let's not confuse a free flow of infor mation with an unwitting policy of subsidiz ing the research and development efforts of  Japan, Korea and Europe.  Take,  for  example,  the University  of  Michigan at Ann Arbor, one of the finest  engineering schools in the country.  According to the University's 1985 figures,  there are 1,452 graduate students enrolled  in Michigan's College of Engineering; 751more than half-are foreign students.  ""Out-of-state""  students <which  is what  foreign students are considered> pay tuition  ",1986
1262,1063,14,Mr. BLAZ.,"  Section 19 has two parts. First, it au thorizes whatever appropriations may  be needed to carry out this act. This  part was added at the request of the  House Immigration Subcommittee to  cover any additional costs associated  with  the  three  immigration  related  sections of  the bill. Although  it  is  open-ended, only minimal, if any, addi tional appropriations are expected to  be needed. Second, this section would  require the full amounts required to  be paid to Gua.ln, the Northern Mari ana  Islands, Puerto Rico,  and  the  Virgin Islands under the laws estab lishing  their  relationships with  the  United States, shall be paid. It would  supersede  the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985  <Gramm-Rudman> which is temporari ly withholding a portion of these pay ments. In an appearance before the  Budget Committee, OMB Director  Miller  identified  this problem as a  technical deficiency  in  the Gramm Rudman law. He noted that these pay ments ""appear in the Federal budget  as an  incidental matter for conven ience of administration rather than as  a  means  of  resource  allocation"".  Gramm-Rudman  failed  to  exempt  these payments from sequestration al though the full amount of payments  will eventually be paid to the insular  governments.  In the case of Puerto  Rico, tax collections are required to be  placed in a trust fund, the unobligated  balance of which can only be released  to the Commonwealth. Discrepancies  between advance estimate payments of  tax  collections  for Guam  and  the  Virgin Islands are reconciled and paid  to these governments at the end of  each fiscal year. In the case of the  Northern Mariana  Islands,  the pay ments are guaranteed grants and can  be obtained, ultimately, through court  action. Failure to provide these funds  is serious because they are each re quired  under  mutual  agreements  reached between  the United States  and these respective territories. In any  case,  sequestration  of  these  funds  cannot reduce the deficit because they  will eventually be released. The effect  of the delay is to exacerbate territorial  deficit problems and sour Federal/ter ritorial relations.  Section 20 would amend the law ap proving the Compact of Free Associa tion <Public Law 9S-239) to cla!""ifJ.' how  appropriations are to be made for cer tain programs and services required by  that law. The Office of Management  and Budget has taken the view that all  programs and services provided to the  Federated States of Micronesia [FSMl  and the Marshall Islands [RMil under  the compact must be funded by appro priations to the Department of the In terior despite the fact that such an in terpretation is  illogical and contrary  to congressional intent. This provision  would make  explicit  congressional  intent that only programs for which a  specific authorization  is  included  in  Public Law 99-239 are to be funded  through the Department of the Interi or. Programs and services extended to  the FSM and RMI under the compact  for which the compact only provides  eligibility to participate, shall contin ue to be funded and administered in  the FSM and RMI on a nonreimbursa ble basis as they are in other areas of  the United States through the normal  appropriations process for such agen cies. It is important to note the strong  bipartisan support for this provision in  both Houses of Congress. Without this  provision it is  likely that OMB will  continue to misinterpret congressional  intent regarding the extension of pro and  services  to Micronesia  under the terms of Public Law 99-239.  Section 21 authorizes judges of the  U.S. District Courts of Guam,  the  Northern Mariana  Islands,  and  the  Virgin  Islands  to  receive  the  full  salary of office if and when they elect  to take senior status. In the 1984 om nibus  territories bill  the  territorial  judges-article 3 judges-were author ized to ""elect"" senior status. However,  their retirement benefits were not adgrams  justed equal to that of other lifetime  senior  judges-article 1  judges. This  provision would authorize the same re tirement pay for territorial judges who  elect senior status as  is provided to  other  senior  status  judges  in  the  United States and Puerto Rico. There  are four judges affected by this provi sion. The language was revised by the  Administrative Offices of the Courts.  Section 22 does not relate to the ter ritories but would provide for the pay ment and compounding of interest to  Alaska Native corporations on the pro ceeds from Native lands committed to  the Alaska National  Interest Lands  Conservation Act. This  section was  added at the request of Congressman  DoN YOUNG.  The  House  amendments  would  delete two of the sections of H.R. 2478,  which would have been added to the  bill by  the Senate amendments of  April 24, 1986.  The House dropped the Senate pro vision, section 11, which would have  exempted aircraft flying between the  Pacific territories and Honolulu from  FAA noise regulations. The provision  was deleted because the ch~irman of  the House Aviation  Subcommittee,  Mr. MINETA, objected to a noise ex emption for aircraft stopping in non territorial  areas,  such  as Honolulu.  Without the ability to stop in Honolu lu, the exemption was considered to be  of no value and it was agreed to drop  it.  The House also dropped the Senate  provisions of section 14 which would  have amended  the Immigration and  Nationality Act to correct an inconsist ency  in  the  immigration  law  that  allows alien crewmen on foreign ves sels to get shore leave while denying  the same alien crewmen shore leave if  they work on U.S. vessels. This section  was dropped because the House Immi gration Subcommittee  insisted  that  the provision be moved as a freestand ing bill under its jurisdiction. The sub committee has since passed such a  measure  and  it  is  expected  to  be  passed by  the Senate  Immigration  Subcommittee shortly.  In addition  to  these changes  the  House  amendments made modifica tions to section 10, approving the new  7-year financial assistance agreement  between  the United States and  the  Northern Mariana Islands. This agree ment is sound and has the full support  of the United States and the Northern  Mariana Islands, the two governments  that negotiated the agreement. There  are certain provisions of  the agree ment, and of the House amendment  modifying the agreement, on which it  would be appropriate to comment.  The language of the House amend ment states that these financial assist ance funds shall be provided according  to the schedule of payments contained  in the agreement. It is, of course, in",1986
1263,1076,14,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I have  read with great interest an August 5  article  in  the New York Times by  Todd Purdum and an article printed  this morning in the Washington Post  by William Raspberry on a program in  New York City that has sent a  loud  and clear message to drug traffickers  and users throughout New York City.  This program utilizes the civil and  administrative forfeiture provisions of  a law which I introduced as part of the  Comprehensive Crime Control Act of  1984. In April1980, as chairman of the  Senate  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on  Criminal Justice. I chaired hearings on  the subject of the Government's efforts to seize and forfeit the assets of  those involved in the drug trade. Since  that time, I have been actively pro moting  the use of  forfeiture  as  a  means of attacking the drug trade, and  I am still convinced that the use of  forefeiture laws remains the most ef fective and the most underutllized law  enforcement tool in the Federal nar cotics control arsenal.  I am encour aged to see that the Department of  Justice is beginning to recognize the  versatility and usefulness of the for feiture provisions enacted in the 1984  crime bill.  Under  the New York  program,  which I might add is less than 2 weeks  old, 43 persons arrested for buying il licit drugs have also had their cars  confiscated. This is permissible under  the provisions of the 1984 crime bill, in  which we sought to make the use of  forfeiture of assets a more viable tool  for law enforcement.  The effectiveness of New York City's  forfeiture policy cannot be overstated.  New York, like so many other cities  who have taken a strong stand against  the drug  trade.  faces a voluminous  court calendar and scarce prison space.  In  these  times of public skepticism  about our criminal justice process, the  value of this program lies in the imme diate message  it  sends  throughout  New York City. As Sterling Johnson.  New York City's special narcotics pros ecutor, has commented: ""Under this  program a $10 vial of crack can cost  upward of $10,000  to $15,ooo:   This  program also sends another message:  The drug trade, both buying and sell ing, will not be tolerated. As William  Raspberry noted:  Drug abusers aren't victims; they are co conspirators  in crime, and its about  time  they were treated as such.  I applaud the efforts of the mayor  and police commissioner of New York  City, the city's district attorney and  special narcotics prosecutor and the  U.S. attorney for Manhattan in this  program, and I hope other cities will  look to this program as an example of  the effectiveness of laws aimed at the  assets of the drug trade.  Mr. President. I ask unanimous con sent that the two articles I mentioned  previously be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the arti cles were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Aug. 5, 19861  NEW YoRK PoLICE Now SEIZING CARS IN  ARREsTS FOR POSSESSION OF CRACK  <By Todd S.

1264,1102,14,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, an edi torial  appeared  in  the New York  Times this morning which I think puts  the case very well.  It said  this bill  would work important change.  Had it been in effect in 1984, calculates  Common Cause,  the public affairs  lobby,  PAC  contributions  to Senate  candidates  would have been cut in half.  Then they conclude:  A half-empty swamp is healthier than one  that's overflowing. The public will soon find  out which Senators want higher ground and  which ones like the muck, slosh, and smell.  I ask unanimous consent that this  editorial from the New York Times,  which  I  have placed on all desks,  appear in the RECORD  in full at this  point.  There being no objection, the edito rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Aug. 11, 1986]  THE MONEY CURVE FOR CONGRESS  Exponential growth is Washington, D.C.'s  middle name. In two generations, the Feder al Government has gone  from worrying  about millions to billions to trillions. In five  years,  the  national  debt  has  doubled.  There's similarly steep growth evident  in  the money curve for Congress. Campaign  contributions are flooding out of the PAC's,  the political action committees that have  sprung up on behalf of every  imaginable  special interest.  Does Congress  care? A bipartisan bill  sponsored by Senator David Boren, Oklaho ma Democrat, and others offers an opportu nity to control that soaring curve, with a  Senate vote possible as soon as tomorrow.  Its provisions are so reasonable and clear  that senators of both parties should be em barrassed to duck and eager to vote yes.  Even in a sluggish economy, political in fluence is a growth industry.  Consider  the  curve  line  for  the  total  number of PAC's. In 1975, there were 600.  Now there are 4,100, an amazing array of in terests. A supermarket chain is represented  by the Piggly Wiggly Southern Good Gov ernment Committee. A beer distributors'  group employs what is informally called the  Six-PAC. The Michigan blueberry growers  have a PAC. So does the American Horse  Council.  Consider the curve line for the amounts  the P AC's shovel into campaigns. At this  point in the 1978 campaign, they had given  $11 million. As of June 30, the 1985-86 total  was $66 million.  Consider the weight of all those PAC dol lars. In 1978, they comprised 12 percent of  total campaign contributions. So far in this  campaign, they account for 24 percent.  At  present,  each PAC  can  give  each  member $5,000 for each primary and gener al election. Frequently there are overlaps.  Several P AC's interested in the same out come can each give $5,000 to a candidate.  There's no limit to the total amount of PAC  money any one candidate can collect.  Senator Boren's bill would  reduce  the  amount of the individual PAC contribution  from $5,000 to $3,000. And it would limit the  total amount a member could receive from  the PAC's. House candidates could get only  $100,000. The limit for Senate candidates  would depend on state population. In view  of the PAC's muscle, these proposals seem  modest. The only sure reform  is  to wean  politicians  from private campaign money  completely-with public money. One day,  Congress will recognize that need,  just as  the country has already accepted public  funding for Presidential campaigns.  Meanwhile, the Boren bill would work im portant change. Had it been in effect in  1984, calculates Common Cause, the public  affairs lobby, PAC contributions to Senate  candidates would have been cut in half. A  half-empty swamp  is healthier  than one  that's overflowing. The public will soon find  out which senators want higher ground and  which ones like the muck, slosh, and smell.  ",1986
1265,1102,14,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I also  ask unanimous consent to have print ed in the RECORD at this point an ex cellent  editorial  from  the Boston  Sunday Globe, which makes the very  same point, that we should make the  change, that we should help Congress  pay more attention, as the Globe says,  to  the larger message of the public  good. It says the Senate should pass  this amendment without delay and  without crippling amendments. I ask  unanimous consent that the editorial  be printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the edito rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Boston <MA> Globe, Aug. 10,  1986]  CUTTING PACs  When lobbyists of ideologies and interests  converge to battle a bill in Congress,  the  measure  is probably one of outstanding  merit. A measure that would change the fi nancing of political campaigns, however,  can also be killed by odd bedfellows.  The US Senate is scheduled to vote on the  Boren-Goldwater amendment to campaign finance  legislation, a  first step in freeing  congressional politics from the hammerlock  of political action committees.  Neither cosponsor is a zealot. Sen. David  L. Boren <D-Okla.)  found out that PACs  screened him  from his constituents and  made him too attentive to lobbyists repre senting anonymous contributors.  Sen. Barry Goldwater <R-Ariz.), ending a  long and distinguished career, is the ideolog ical opposite of another congressional retir ee, Speaker O'Neill. Yet, they agree on one  profound fact. As O'Neill says, ""The PACs  are destroying this government. Too many  guys have big money and no opponent.''  The amendment would limit to $100,000  the amount each House candidate can re ceive  from all PACs. Similar  restrictions  would be placed on Senate candidates, and  the limit of each PAC contribution would be  lowered from $5,000 to $3,000.  To the average citizen, these sums seem  reasonable. They are. To the average lobby ist,  the limits are an outrage. ""If it ain't  broke, don't fix it,"" says Charles Walker, a  former Treasury official and now a leading  lobbyist. ""The presence of so many PACs,''  he says, ""helps assure wide dispersal of fi nancial power in the electoral process.""  Walker's business clients are not the only  ones enjoying the PAC status quo. In 1984,  labor unions like the National Education As sociation and the United Auto Workers con tributed almost as heavily as the National  Association of Realtors and the American  Medical Association.  ",1986
1266,1115,14,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.,"  In that article  Dick Scammon, one of the leading po litical analysts. in the country, points  out  that PAC's are  fulfilling  some  roles  that parties used  to because  PAC's indeed have grown more rapidly  than parties and the party contribu tions are limited. He finds the shift to  the PAC's not to be as threatening as  my friend from Oklahoma believes. He  said. ""The idea that PAC's go out and  buy somebody is pretty far-fetched.""  He said, ""If I ran a PAC, I don't want  to go out and buy a fellow. If I can buy  him, somebody else can.""  It is silly to think that that happens  in the political process.  One additional proposal is to estab lish a bipartisan commission to review  campaign financing and make recom mendations. This is really perhaps the  most important proposal and hopeful ly  this will  survive  in  this whole  debate.  A commission would be formed, not  for the purpose of delaying, stalling or  doing anything else, but just as a rec ognition of  the  fact  that Senators  have a very hard time not only voting  on their own pay, but Senators have a  very difficult time voting constructive ly on campaign financing. As I said  early there are many aspects of cam paign financing  that need attention  ",1986

",1986
1268,1128,14,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Madam  Presi dent, one of my objections  to  the  Boren amendment is that it is a very  limited attempt at campaign finance  reform that is being achieved if the  Boren amendment passes.  As I noted earlier in response to the  remarks made by  the Senator from  Kansas  [Mrs. KAssEBAUM],  because  you  restrict PAC's contributions  to  candidates, and because PAC's have  learned how to raise money, we fear  independent  expenditures  will  be  made by PAC's because those are in no  way  restricted. And, as a matter of  fact, that probably is the result.  I pointed out in my remarks that it  is the unintended result of campaign  reform that we remember that PAC's  arose because of the campaign reform  of 1974 and 1978 when people gave  hundreds of thousands and in some in stances millions of dollars  to  cam paigns.  0 1250  It was  an  effort  to  restrict  the  impact on wealthy individuals that the  campaign reform bills of 1974 and 1976  were passed. Now some of that is being  undone by the Boren amendment be cause, as my friend from Washington  just pointed out, the individual restric tions are raised to $1,500, and the PAC  contributions are lowered.  I  also pointed out  that  twice  as  many people gave through PAC's in  Senate campaigns. So PAC's had the  impact of broadening the participation  in politics.  I  ask unanimous consent, Madam  President, that an article by Michael  Malbin, which appeared in the Wash ington Post, entitled ""Fixing Up the  Boren Bill,"" be inserted in the REcoRD  at this point.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Washington Post, Dec. 2, 1985]  <By Michael J. Malbin)  FIXING UP THE BOREN BILL  Sen. David Boren's campaign finance bill  is expected to come up for debate and a vote  during the first week of December. Taken  by  itself,  the Boren bill would cause as  many problems as it would solve. But if the  Oklahoma Democrat's ideas are joined with  some other good ones on tax credits and po litical parties, Congress just might end up  with  a  politically  feasible  package  that  would improve elections in this country.  Boren and his cosponsors believe candi dates depend too much on political action  committees <PACs> for their campaign con tributions. Their solution  is  to limit how  much candidates can accept from an PACs  combined. Assuming both a primary and  general election, the bill would limit House  candidates to $125,000 in PAC receipts and  Senate candidates to between $200,000 and  $750,000, depending on  the size of  their  state. The figures are close to the present  average for the House, but would prevent  further growth. <The bill does not have a  cost-of-living escalator.> Senate races would  be put on an immediate financial diet.  The bill has an obvious appeal. Almost  nobody  likes how much some candidates  depend on PACs for campaign money. I am  skeptical that the bill will reduce depend ence as much as the sponsors say, but let us  assume that it does. To achieve this result,  the Boren bill would leave equally serious  problems in its wake. These must be identi fied before Congress can think about correc tions.  Why do  I  think  that the bill will not  achieve  its stated objective? Because any  limit on PACS will stimulate well organized  groups to form ad hoc independent expendi ture committees in competitive districts or  states. The bill tries to address independent  spending with a  constitutionally dubious  provision requiring broadcasters to give free  time  to attacked candidates. Even  if the  limit on broadcasters slips by the Supreme  Court, however,  there is no way Congress  can stop groups from spending unlimited  amounts on telephoning, mailing or other  activities. If this happens, and P ACs end up  going around the campaigns, the bill para doxically may end up making elections more  dependent on the strategies of large and  well-organized PACs instead of less.  Let us go along with the sponsors, though,  and assume the bill would cut the role of  PCAs. How would  the  lost money be re placed? The Boren bill would work most  heavily against PAC money that comes to a  campaign late. But late money-crucial in a  close  race-cannot possibly  be  raised  in  small contributions.  Without  late money, underdogs cannot  buy advertising for the final push against a  front-runner. The underdog cannot hoard  money, because the underdog has to work  hard to reach the point where late spending  might even make a difference. But this bill  would dry up the one source of money the  law still allows for large, last-minute gifts.  About the only people who could raise large  amounts late, therefore, would be rich can didates who are willing to open their per sonal checkbooks.  To top it off, the candidates catching up  during a campaign's final days are much  more likely to be challengers than incum",1986

",1986
1277,1141,14,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President,  last  week-in fact, late Saturday evening the Senate passed one of the largest  defense authorization bills in the his tory of the United States.  Despite the need for budgetary re straint and  the cuts and reductions  the Congress will have to make in the  President's  defense  request,  the  United States will  still spend more  than 6 percent of our gross national  product on defense activities during  the coming fiscal year.  Roughly half of our military budget  is devoted to the defense of Europe.  We  have  on  station  in  Europe  340,000 American  troops,  almost 70  percent  of  our  forward  deployed  forces.  It has  been  calculated  that  the  American  taxpayer spends $400 mil lion per day to pay for the defense of  Europe, a  total on a yearly basis of  $140 billion.  Let  us  think  about  that  for  a  momerit, Mr. President. At that rate of  spending, the defense of Europe has  cost us over $1 million just since this  amendment was called up a moment  ago.  Mr. President, that is not the end of  it. We spend another $25 billion for  the defense of northwest Asia, primar ily Japan and Korea.  We  spend another $50 billion on  rapid deployment capabilities for the  defense of the Persian Gulf.  Quite simply, we are protecting Eu rope's and Japan's oil supplies. It ap pears to this Senator that our allies  have been getting almost a free ride in  that regard.  In  the military  construction  bill  alone, over the past 5 years, we have  provided over $1 billion for facilities in  the Persian Gulf-Middle East region.  Our allies have provided not one thin  dime, not one thin dime, in that long  multithousand mile oil  lifeline  from  the Persian Gulf to the Japanese is lands. The Japanese get over 90 per cent of their oil out of the Persian  Gulf. Not  a  single  Japanese naval  vessel is defending that oil pipeline or  oil lifeline until within less than 100  miles of the Japanese home islands. It  is defended all the way, Mr. President,  by the U.S. Navy, nuclear aircraft car riers, battle groups, all to the tune of  billions of dollars, paid for by the tax payers of the United States.  0 1330  Mr. President,  it costs every man.,  woman and child in the United States  almost $1,000 a year for national de fense. Yet our allies are spending less  than  one-fourth  that  amount  per  capita.  So it is clear that Uncle Sam, at least  in  the  judgment of  this Senator,  is  being played for a sucker.  Our European allies and our Japa nese allies are letting us pay for their  defense while they crowd us out on  the international trade markets.  So, Mr. President, I say the time has  come to make it clear to our allies that  the free ride is over. It is time that  they  pay  a  larger  share  for  the  common defense of the free world.  For several years we  included lan guage in the military construction ap propriations bill expressing the sense  of  the Senate  that  the  executive  branch should seek a more fair alloca tion of defense burdens.  I  am sorry  to  say  that  language  never accomplished its intent.  For the past several years we have  required an annual report from  the  Secretary of Defense  assessing  the  free world's defense burden. Every  year that report says the same thing.  It says  that  the allies are doing  better but somehow inexplicably the  gap continues to widen between what  they spend and what we spend.  So, I am forced  to the conclusion,  Mr.  President,  that  the  executive  branch of our Government does not  share the same commitment that we  share here in the U.S. Senate and in  the House of Representatives on this  particular issue.  Oh, sure, the Secretary of Defense  and the Secretary of State will give lip  service to the proposition that defense  ",1986

1279,1154,14,Mr. HARKIN.," I thank the Chair.  In February 1982,  the Agency  re ported to the intelligence committees  that ""economic targets"" such as agri cultural cooperatives were off limits to  the Contras. The following week the  U.S.  press  reported Contra  strikes  against cooperatives.  The administration was  even  less  clear about  its policy.  In its official  line,  the  administration  proclaimed  that its goal was a political settlement  in which Nicaragua  could keep  its  Marxist government only if it would  quit aiding the lefist guerrillas in El  Salvador.  To the Contras, CIA officials left no  doubt about their real goal. ""In pri vate,"" according to Edgar Chamorro,  ""they always told us the objective was  to overthrow the government in Mana gua.""  To the President, the Contras have  been, and will continue to be freedom  fighters. But to  the Defense Intelli gence Agency,  in a 1982 report,  the  main military force of the FDN, the  15th of September Legion, was a ""ter rorist group"" responsible for assassi nating  government  officials  and  a  Cuban adviser.  Worried by the guerrillas' unsavory  image, by late 1982 the CIA created a  new seven-member National Director ate of prominent Nicaraguans with no  ties with the National Guard or with  Somoza. Edgar Chamorro was among  the seven. Joining him in early 1983  was Adolfo Calero, a former Coca-Cola  bottler  and  opponent  of General  Somoza.  The National Directorate was orga nized,  selected, and directed by  the  CIA, and created as a civilian front for  what was then, and is still today, an  army  controlled  by  ex-National  Guardsmen.  Those military  commanders, with  the combination of Argentine training  and  National  Guard  mentality,  remain, according to Edgar Chamorro,  who served on the FDN directorate for  2 years, ""one of the major obstacles  for putting the Contra movement on a  truly democratic path.""  Soon, Bermudez,  the chief Contra  commander, cemented his authority  by allying with Adolfo Calero and the  former Coca-Cola bottler's top aid, a  civilian Somocista  named Aristedes  Sanchez. Together, according to Cha morro, the three were referred to as  the ""Bermudez triangle"" for countless  sums of money would go into it, never  to be seen again.  THE ARGENTINES AND HONDURAN DEATH SQUADS  That the Contras, and their military  commanders, cannot be reformed-de spite all  the cosmetic efforts made  first by the CIA and later by the State  Department, aided by its cabal of neo conservative Democrats-is most clear ly demonstrated by reports that the  FDN was involved in death squad ac tivities in Honduras.  There are those who say, well, yes,  they are former national guardsmen;  yes, in a previous life, they were bad,  bad people. But they have reformed  themselves. They are no more  like  they used to be. But let us look at  what has happened in Honduras since  they have been there.  According to a confidential Hondu ran military  report  completed  last  year, between 1980 and 1984, foreign  agents in Honduras were responsible  for more  than 200 murders, kidnap pings, and disappearances.  According to the study, many of the  victims of the death squads were Sal vadorans suspected of running arms  between the Sandinistas and rebels in  El Salvador. Others, including Nicara guans and Hondurans, were marked as  ""spies"" for Managua.  According to one Honduran military  officer,  ""The  [Contrasl would pick  them up, question  them and some times torture and kill them.""  This charge is echoed by the head of  the Honduran Human Rights Commis sion, Ramon Custodio, who has said:  We have  found direct and  indirect evi dence that the Contras were responsible for  some of the human rights violations that we  have denounced.  Death squad activities, which have  been commonplace in neighboring El  Salvador and Guatemala, had been  virtually unknown in Honduras until  1981. That year Gen. Alvaro Martinez  became chief of staff of the Honduran  military, and the United States, with  the aid of the Argentines, escalated its  support of the Honduran-based Con tras.  At the same time, a special Hondu ran Armed Forces crack  intelligence  squad, the division of special investiga tions, was created to crush clandestine  support networks for Honduran and  Salvadoran leftist movements.  The Argentine military, who had  waged their ""dirty war"" a decade earli er,  trained  the Hondurans  in  their  techniques-safehouses, electric shock  torture, disappearances.  ",1986

1283,1167,14,Mr. SIMON.," Thank you, Mr. Presi dent, I thank my colleague from Ten nessee whose work  I  had observed  from a distance  in the House but I  never had a chance to work with him  closely. I am one of many who appreci ate his  leadership, and a  leadership  that is above average also in that he is  not a member of  the Foreign Rela tions Committee but he has been in  here leading the way on this.  Let me touch on a  few areas very  briefly. I will not be speaking about  this, but I have had a chance to glance  through this document. It must be 300  or 400 pages long. That is the decision  in the World Court in our involvement  over there. I  frankly was not aware  that the World Court really went into  things as thoroughly as they did. For  anyone who seriously wants to take a  look at the international legal implica tions this is a document you ought to  take a look at.  There are a number of questions  that we are faced with in Nicaragua,  one that I have been faced with be cause I support granting weapons to  those who are fighting for freedom in  Afghanistan, and people say how can  you be consistent in opposing aid to  the Contras. We are fighting Marxism  in Nicaragua and at the same time you  help and you believe in aid in Afghani stan. There is one major, major differ ence. In Afghanistan there was an in vasion.  In Afghanistan  people  are  fighting for freedom from an outside  force that has moved in. In Nicaragua,  it is a revolution. We are aiding people  who are trying to overthrow a govern ment, and a very fundamental ques tion that I am sure my friend from  Rhode Island has struggled with who  formerly chaired the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, is should we be  involved in trying to overthrow gov ernments in other countries? My con clusion is that we should not, that if  we want to overthrow governments we  do not like that is basically about two thirds of the governments on the face  of the Earth.  I spoke, I guess it was a year ago or  so now, to a group of educators from  around  the world gathered here  in  Washington, and I  spoke at the re quest of the State Department about  our  views  and  educational  system.  Before I began speaking, I asked the  group, ""Is there anyone in your group  from Nicaragua?"" Two men  raised  their hands. I said ""I would like to talk  to you afterwards."" They came down  in  front.  I  asked  them what  they  thought the United States ought to be  doing in Nicaragua. Both of them said,  ""We do not like the Sandinistas, but  do not send down your weapons that  are killings us. Let us solve our own  problems."" And I think their advice is  sound. I think we ought to be listening  to them.  My fear  is as we push Nicaragua,  and the Government there we are not  going to overthrow that Government.  In fact, the Contras after having re ceived more than $100 million in aid  from us as of right now do not control  one single village, nor one single town.  They are across the border in Hondu ras, and a few of them are across the  border down  in Costa Rica. But  I  think we are making the same mis take, frankly, that we have made with  Cuba.  I am not in love with the Sandinis tas; I am not in love with Fidel Castro.  But  I  think we have  through our  policy helped  the Soviet Union by  making Castro more of a puppet of  the Soviet Union regime than is Ru mania, than is Hungary, I have to be lieve. And I picked up this morning's  New York Times, and I  see we are  going even further in that direction. I  cannot  believe  it  is  sound  public  policy. It is easy when you are talking  about Nicaragua, Cuba, or someplace  like that to respond to the national  passion rather than the national inter est. What I hope we will do is respond  ",1986

1293,1193,14,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  though  the hour is getting late, I feel I would  be remiss as we pursue  this debate  today on the Central American ques tion if I did not take a few minutes to  try to outline myself what I feel are  the central questions before us.  We just heard a very empassioned  and strongly felt set of views by the  distinguished Senator from Vermont.  We  have  listened  earlier  today  to  other Members of the Senate on both  sides of this issue express their views.  Over the next several days this body  will try to address and deal with, in  the time we have remaining under this  unanimous-consent  request, some 31  different amendments on  this  issue  alone,  and  I  think  at  least  that  number if not more on the question of  sanctions on South Africa.  I see my good friend and colleague  and chairman of  the Foreign Rela tions Committee  sitting  across  the  way. He has a  long week in front of  him. So I am going  to  try to keep  these remarks brief.  As he knows, this issue, particularly  for  this Member of the Senate, has  been one that I have lived with during  my first 5 years in the Senate; in fact,  I first offered an amendment on this  issue in December 1982 in opposition  to Contra aid  in Nicaragua. But  I  happen to feel  that the amendment  just offered by our colleague  from  Tennessee is the central amendment.  To me, this will be the vote, by and  large. All  these other amendments  that will be offered will try to improve  one way or the other the particular  question struck by this amendment.  With all due respect, in fact, I have a  couple of amendments  that  I may  raise on all of this. Yet those amend ments do not address the central ques tion, while that of the Senator from  Tennessee's does. If I understand the  unanimous-consent agreement proper ly, sometime around 10 or 11 o'clock  tomorrow morning, August 12, we will  fundamentally decide whether or not  this country is going to go forward, fi nance, and fund this Contra operation.  So to me this is the central vote. The  question of whether or not some of  the Contras are doing things that we  do not find particularly attractive, or  that the Sandinistas do things that we  find deplorable, are significant ques tions but they do not address the fun damental, central question of whether  or not  this  policy,  this  particular  choice of solutions, is in the best inter ests of the United States.  We have heard over the last 4 years,  4 or 5 years, a debate that has tried to  frame this question in a way I think  which does not really address what we  have  to decide as Members of  this  body.  Each and every one of us stood in  this well not very far from where I am  standing here this evening, and to one  Vice President or another acting as  the President of this Chamber raised  our right hands and we took an oath.  We swore to defend and uphold the  Constitution of the United States, and  to protect the interests of this coun try. That is our job here, whether we  be Republicans, Democrats, conserv atives or liberals. We have sworn to do  whatever we can to see to it that our  country, our Nation, would be safe,  would be secure with its ideals and its  values, and would be perpetuated in  such a way that another generation  yet unborn could serve in this Cham ber and carry on the debates of their  day.  0 2100  My  problem with  this particular  question of Contra aid  is not over  whether or not one likes the Contras,  not over whether or not one can  accept  the Sandinistas, or to try to  make  choices  between  those  two  groups of people. The question should  be fundamentally whether or not this  particular approach advances the in terests of the United States and its  allies.  If it does, it ought to be pursued. If  it does not, we ought to seek another  course.  I have felt from the very beginning  that this particular approach is not in  our interest. For that reason, we ought  to seek another course.  I do not reject the notion that mili tary  force  is  a  legitimate way  to  extend your legitimate foreign policy  interests. Time and time again, regret tably, we have had  to use  force  in  order to extend those interests. So we  ought never  to  say  that we would  never use military force.  I do not subscribe or join those who  would embrace that particular point of  view.  But I do embrace the view that says  that military force for a great power, a  power that does embrace the values of  democracy,  liberty,  that we  so  fre quently talk about on the most mean ingful holidays of this country, implies  a responsibility that that great power  ought to be very judicious-very, very  judicious-in the exercise of the use of  that military power; that if you use  that power inappropriately, in an un timely fashion, or prematurely or too  late, then great powers such as ours  can be hurt-hurt seriously and deeply  for years to come.  So the question is not whether or  not we ought to use military power. I  reject that at this particular juncture.  I  think there is a better way to pro ceed in Central America.  The question ought to be before us,  how do we deal with  this problem?  How do we confront this problem that  we perceive? What is that problem? Is  the problem merely the emergence of  a Marxist state  in Nicaragua? Does  that state and  the  leaders  in  that  country pose such a serious threat to  this country that they ought  to be  dealt with quickly and at great risk? Is  that the only question?  If it is, I would suggest we are choos ing the wrong means to deal with that.  If, in fact, that is the problem, it is un clear to this Senator having listened to  the various rationales that have been  offered over the last 4 years as to in  fact what is  the central question to  this  administration;  if during  the  summer of 1986 the question is: How  do we  get  rid of  the Sandinistas,  Daniel Ortega,  and all who  have  joined them, then it seems to me that  in that little country we are choosing  ",1986

1296,1219,14,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, the re lationship  between  the  State  of  Hawaii and our Pacific territories and  commonwealth continues  to become  significantly important to these gov ernments and people. Because of Ha waii's close proximity to the islands,  the  unique  similarities  of  Pacific  Island cultures, and Hawaii's experi ences as a  former  territory, coupled  with existing cooperation in such orga nizations as the Pacific Basin Develop ment Council-these Pacific  Islands  governments tend to look to Hawaii as  a ""big brother"" for economic and polit ical cooperation and assistance.  The territories, while having nonvot ing representation in the other body  of Congress, have no representation in  this body and, the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands, Ameri ca's newest  territory, at the present  time  is not represented in the Con gress of the United States. I am there fore, privileged and very pleased  to  today  propose  legislation  for  the  Northern Mariana Islands.  The covenant  to establish a  com monwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands  in political union with  the  United States of America, U.S. Public  Law 94-241, established a Northern  Mariana Islands Commission on Fed eral Laws which  is  instructed  ""to  survey the laws of the United States  and to make recommendations to the  U.S. Congress as to which laws of the  United States not applicable  to  the  Northern Mariana Islands should be  made applicable and to what extent  and in what manner, and which appli cable laws should be made inapplica ble and to what extent and in what  manner.  The  Commission,  in  its  second  interim  report  to Congress,  issued  recommendations  for  changes to U.S Law.  Mr. President, I am pleased  to be  joined by Senators McCLURE,  JoHN STON, and WEICKER to introduce legis lation  to  enact  these  recommenda tions. I hope my colleagues will join us  in supporting this much-needed legis lation, and I ask unanimous consent  that the legislation be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  REcORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  44  s. 2735  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS  SECTION 1. <a> This Act may be cited as  the ""Commonwealth of the Northern Mari ana Islands Federal Relations Act"".  <b> The table of contents of this Act is as  follows:  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Sec. 1.

1302,1284,14,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4811 would desig nate a San Pedro Riparian National  Conservation Area on Bureau of Land  Management lands in Arizona. Its pur pose  is  to  protect  an outstanding  desert riparian area which the BLM  recently acquired in southern Arizona.  The reason BLM acquired  the area  was to protect it, and this bill is  in tended to help them accomplish that.  The San Pedro River area is a rare  remnant of the desert streamside for ests that have mostly been lost to de velopment over the years. It is an un usually rich wildlife area, with an in credible total of 260 different species  of birds, as well as an abundance of  other wildlife. The river flows north  out of Mexico, and serves as a corridor  into the United States for many spe cies only rarely seen here.  In addition, the area has important  archeological, historic, and paleonto logical resources.  This would be the fourth national  conservation area designated by Con gress. Each one  is managed by  the  BLM, but each has  its own, unique  mandate. H.R. 4811 would require the  BLM to manage the San Pedro area to  protect  the  resources  I  have men tioned,  it would withdraw  the area  from mining, and it would prevent the  Secretary of the Interior from issuing  new grazing permits in the area for a  period of 15 years.  Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank our  colleague JIM KOLBE, whose district in cludes the area affected by this bill,  and  the distinguished Arizonians on  the Interior Committee, Chairman Mo  .  ",1986
1303,1297,14,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  5 minutes to the gentleman from Mon tana [Mr. WILLIAMS].  ",1986
1304,1297,14,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, I was  delighted to join Chairman HAWKINS,  Mr.  JEFFORDS,  Chairman MARTINEZ,  and Mr. GUNDERSON  in  introducing  amendments to the Job Training Part nership Act <H.R. 5185). This biparti san bill represents a consensus of opin ion on the Education and Labor Com mittee and should be adopted by the  House in expeditious fashion.  There are several issues that I would  like to call to the attention of my col leagues as we move from action today  to conference with the Senate: First,  with regard to a compromise on the  hold harmless provision, I would rec ommend that we look at a 2-year base  and at total availability or only pro vide the hold harmless to SDA's with  very limited carry in; and second, with  regard to a compromise on the educa tion component, I would recommend  that we encourage the effort with in centives that do not create a situation  where SDA's spend  less money on  youth.  One issue that this bill did not ad dress is the growth in the number of  service delivery areas  [SDA'sl under  the Job Training Partnership Act re sulting  in  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number of SDA's receiving relatively  small allocations under title IIA. With  limited resources, economies of scale  must somehow achieve a balance with  the wish of the Congress for locally  determined and managed delivery sys tems.  According to a study by Job Train ing Partnership, Inc., in program year  1986, there are now 62 SDA's receiving  allocations of less than $500,000, and  175 SDA's with allocations less than  $1,000,000. This is a marked increase  over the prior year, since in program  year 1985, 35 SDA's received alloca tions below $500,000, and 138 SDA's  received allocations below $1,000,000.  These facts are driven by the follow ing statistics. In fiscal year 1982, there  were 476 prime sponsors under  the  Comprehensive  Employment  and  Training Act  [ CETAl. Through pro gram year 1985 of JTP A,  there were  597 SDA's, while in program year 1986,  there are now 627 SDA's, an increase  of 151 over CETA or a dramatic 32percent increase. To be fair,  this in crease  is  somewhat overstated since  balance-of -state areas counted as one  prime  sponsor  under CET A, while  under JTPA, they were broken up into  SDA's.  The bill includes a provision encour aging the development of a remedial  education component in the Summer  Youth Employment Program [SYEPl.  This bill is a culmination of my efforts  to achieve recognition of this need. In  1985, I  introduced H.R. 1090 to man date  the  inclusion of a competency based remedial education component  in SYEP. Eighty-four Members of the  House  cosponsored  this  effort  and  hearings were held on the bill on May  22, 1985. This year I revised the bill in  light of these hearings and comments  we  received from all partners in the  JTPA system. On January 23, 1986, I  introduced H.R. 4050  to encourage a  remedial education component rather  than mandate it. Ninety-five Members  of the House joined me in cosponsor ing this bill.  The bill being debated today incor porates three components from H.R.  4050: First,  encouraging  a  remedial  education  component  within  the  Summer Youth Employment Program;  second, allowing programs to be con ducted during  the  interval between  the participant's regular school year;  and, third, providing a 90-percent hold  harmless for the SYEP allocations to  service delivery areas.  H.R.  5185  also  incorporates  a  number of the amendments that I in troduced in H.R. 4115 on February 4,  1986. These include: First, designating  of service delivery areas based on one  or more  labor market areas; second,  providing a 90-percent hold harmless  for the title II-A allocations to service  delivery areas; and, third, prohibiting  a matching  requirement on  grants  from  the  Secretary's  discretionary  funds under title III.  0 1415  ",1986

I just want to add, though, as some one who participated in the manpower  program at the local level in Jefferson  County, AL, last year we were able to  train barely 4,500 adults and had some  2,600 jobs available for summer youth,  with more than 12,000 summer youths  seeking employment.

1308,1349,14,Mr. STRATTON.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, the pending amend ment kills the MX Program. It com pletely  reverses  the careful compro mise  that was crafted  last year be tween the Congress and the adminis tration.  Agreement was reached to deploy 50  MX missiles and provide adequate test  missiles to support that deployment.  Today,  the House  is being asked  to  undo that agreement and the fragile  consensus that emerged.  For years, we searched for a way to  modernize  our  land-based  strategic  forces. Last year we were successful.  Now, with the pending amendment we  face going back to the drawing board.  I would be the first to support addi tional  funds  for  our  conventional  forces. Raising the nuclear threshold  is in everyone's interest. But that ob jective can only be achieved by a com bination of means: arms control, ade quate strategic deterrence and mobile,  ready and well-sustained conventional  forces.  Within  the severe budgetary con straints  imposed on us by Gramm Rudman,  the committee bill  repre sents a careful balance between strate gic and conventional forces. The pend ing amendment destroys that balance.  At a time we are seeking to negotiate  with the Soviet Union we can ill afford  to unilaterally  terminate a  strategic  weapon system. We tried that with the  B-1B  aircraft.  Our  effort  went  unrewarded.  I urge the House to reject the siren  and  illusory appeal of  the so-called  conventional  defense  initiative  and  stay with the committee bill.  0 1510  ",1986

1312,1349,14,Mrs. BYRON.," Mr. Chairman, let me  say that I  rise in opposition to this  amendment. We have spent an enor mous amount of time in this body de liberating the  issue of the MX. We  had also thought that we had finally  put this issue to bed several years ago  when we came down to the realization  that 50 Peacekeeper missiles would be  the number we would deploy.  Yet when we have a force of 50 mis siles, we have to keep in mind the fact  that we must have some test missiles. I  think  this amendment  to eliminate  those test missiles is the wrong signal  to send. The program is on its way,  and it has been doing extremely well.  The testing has to continue whenever  we have a program of this magnitude.  Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I  rise in  opposition to this amendment and I  urge others to support the position of  the committee, which was to provide  the funding for the test missiles.  ",1986

1314,1349,14,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman from Florida [Mr. BEN NETT].  If I understand my friend, the gen tleman from New York  [Mr. STRAT TON] correctly, he invoked the name of  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Massachusetts [Mr. MAVROULES], who  serves on the Armed Services Commit tee and who told me earlier that he in tended to vote for the amendment of fered by the gentleman from Florida  [Mr. BENNETT] and myself.  He also mentioned CBO. As I under stand it from CBO, they have evaluat ed three potential test options, one on  the high side at 123, and down to a low  side that is much lower. All three op tions, it is true, do talk about 12 this  year. But  the point  the gentleman  from Florida and I are making here is  that we are not contesting that ulti mately  this number of  test missiles  will be required, and more. What we  are saying is that the Pentagon does  not even intend to accept 50 as the  outer limit for deployment. They al ready have 54 voted, and the commit tee bill, which no one here intends to  try to change, as I understand it, will  restrict them to deploying 10 by the  end of this calendar year and would  only allow  them to deploy anything  even up  to  the 50  if they do some  things on Midgetman, on which they  are dragging their feet.

1315,1362,14,Mr. MRAZEK.," I yield to the gentle man from New York.  Mr. McGRATH. Mr. Chairman,  I rise  in  strong opposition  to  the amendment by  the  gentleman from South Carolina. This proposal  is akin to restarting bottom of the 9th inning  when you don't like the outcome of the game.  The Air Force has been studying the need for  a trainer since the late 1970's. Here we are  nearly 1 0 years later after numerous studies  and  full-blown competition proposing  further  delay.  Developing an alternative to the T -46 would  take at least a year or two. By that time any  existing claims  that money would be saved  through an alternative will not be accurate. In  addition  to  inflation,  enormous  unforeseen  problems could exist  in  fitting new engines  onto an aircraft designed in the 1950's.  In 1984,  the Secretary of  the Air Force  stated that the T -46 is a ""trainer we very des perately need."" Today  and over  the  next  week, we will authorize research and produc tion  of  several  advanced  aircraft-(B-1,  Stealth bomber, advanced tactical fighter, F15C, and F-15E. I think our program to train  pilots ought to utilize a jet trainer with instru mentation and capabilities closer to those we  are spending billions to develop and build.  I fully understand Air Force budget con cerns, however, an investment of  little more  than $1 00 million would enable the T -46 pro gram  to continue efficiently. We would have  no costly production line stoppage, and no ex pense and delay for a new competition. We  would have a sound modern aircraft to train  our pilots through the end of this century.  ",1986
1316,1362,14,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York [Mr. DOWNEY].  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. Mr.  Chairman, we are here today not be cause the T -46 has some trouble. It  did, and we all admit  that. We are  here today because the senior Senator  from the State of Kansas found an op portunity to force the Air Force to say  that they did not want the plane that  the year before they were crying des perately for.  There are  a  number of different  ways to evaluate what is necessary for  the defense of our country. A trainer  should very simply be categorized in  very quick terms. It is needed.  The T-37, everyone knows, is 30-plus  years old. Its useful life is running out.  That is clear. The Strategic Air Com mand commander says so, former Sec retary of  the Air Force, Verne Orr  says so.  Will it cost more money if we cancel  this or will it cost less money? It will  cost more money, my colleagues, if we  go to the bait and switch scheme that  the gentleman from South Carolina  [Mr. SPRATT] has offered us. We will  also be killing the airplane.  0 1725  For the last year, the Fairchild Co.  has managed to swallow a year of not  having pro~ess payments, and  it  is  quite clear that if you want to kill the  plane, you can kill  it  the way Mr.  DICKINSON wants  to kill  it, by not  giving it the money, or you can kill it  the way Mr. SPRATT will do, by study ing it again. You can kill it with kind ness, but I would urge you, urge you to  recognize the fact that there is a re quirement for this plane and it is met  by the T -46, and it will cost over the  lifetime of the project, $1 billion less if  we build it now as opposed to later.  We are faced with an unhappy polit ical dilemma. The Air Force,  in at tempting to prove that it is against  something, has chosen this plane even  though  it has, up  to now, provided  $486 million  in developmental  cost,  and sung a siren song to the House  Armed Services Committee for the last  4 years that the plane was necessary.  It did not sing that song this year,  but the House Armed Services Com mittee  decided  that  young  pilots  needed new planes to train on. This  plane will save money in fuel, mainte nance;  it is more reliable. We know  that for a fact two prototypes have al ready flown.  So, my colleagues, this is not a ques tion of studying; this is a question of  whether you cancel it by cutting the  money out or canceling it by studying  it. Do not do either. Accept the House  Armed Services Committee recommen dation to build the plane.  ",1986

1318,1362,14,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, July 8, the Air Force asked  me if I would like to come out and fly  the T -46; and I was unable to do so be cause of some district promises that I  had made,  so  I  talked  to Senator  GOLDWATER and to Mrs. BYRON, and I  talked to the test pilots, and I talked  to some generals in the Air Force that  have four stars on their shoulders.  I said, ""Now level with me. With all  this  talk about serious problems,  is  there any problem with the engines,  these  excellent  Garrett  engines?""  ""No."" They said, ""These engines are  flying in business jets all around the  world; excellent engines.''  I  said,  ""Is  there anything wrong  with the air frame that is any differ ent than any airplane I've ever flown  or any airplane any other Member of  this Chamber has  flown,  like Mr.  Sl'cUTH and the F-4, anything different  in this stage of its development than  other jet aircraft?"" They said ""No. Ac tually, there isn't anything that can't  be fixed with just a  little effort, and  it's way beyond the average at  this  stage in development of all the other  jets we've flown since the midforties.""  ""Now, taking that fairly into consid eration is the need there for a pressur ized cockpit and a new primary trainer  for our young pilots in the Air Force?""  The answer is yes.  One of these Air Force four-star gen erals, a fighter pilot type, said, ""Con gressman, in the best of all worlds, of  course we would like to have this air plane and make the few fixes that are  necessary. But you guys in the Con gress are rolling us back on so many  fronts and cutting so much that we  want that this is one of those prior ities that we don't want to have to put  up against F-15's or F-16's.''  So I think it is only fair to tell the  New York delegation that those of us  who are not cutting back to the lower  figure in our defense think that our  young pilots  in the Air Force going  after those wings of silver deserve this  T -46; and I accept the testimony from  the other body,  and  the  testimony  from the only person in this Chamber  who has flown it, Mrs. BYRON, and I  say, ""Let's vote for these limited funds  and get this T -46 program going.""

Let me say that I have to rise today,  like many of my other colleagues who  have talked about parochial interest. I,  too, have some parochial interest; not  the fact that I happen to have had an  opportunity to fly this aircraft, but I  happen to be the mother of an Air  Force pilot.  I do not think there is anyone that is  a parent of a child that does not want  only the very best for that child.  Back in July 1982, the award source  selection was made to replace the T37. Fairchild won  that source selec tion. Two of these aircraft have been  delivered. The person who made that  source selection has said to me that  nothing has changed since they made  that original decision.  The Air Force has  acknowledged  that the T-46 has performed in the  flight test program satisfactorily. Mr.  SPRATT, in his discussion, talked about  the aircraft being transported to Ed wards;  not  flying  to Edwards. Of  course, any new aircraft is not going to  be flown to its first test flight station;  it has to be transported.  We have so far had 88 tests of this  aircraft. In March of this year, I had  an opportunity not only to fly the T46, but to fly  the T-37 first for an  hour and a half. I had an opportunity  to compare the two aircraft.

Again, I was impressed by the  survivability of  the Bradley and  its  contents. These  tests were  realistic  and valid.  The Army has  taken delivery of  nearly 3,000 Bradleys out of a total ex pected purchase of 6,882.  It is  true  that most of these Bradleys were pur chased before the Army had conduct ed realistic live fire testing. However, .  the Army has now been conducting  live fire tests for about a year. This  testing may not be the most desirable  way  to procure a weapon, but  the  point is: The Army conducting success ful live fire tests.  I support the completion of phase 2  of the testing. But I do not feel we  should hold up the continuation of the  program by fencing these funds. I urge  my colleagues to defeat both the sub stitute and the original amendment.  ",1986

1323,1375,14,Mr. MINETA.,"  I  thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.  We must all be concerned about the  reliability  and  effectiveness  of  the  weapons we will ask our soldiers to use  in case of war. A13 a Korean war veter an, I have a direct appreciation of this  basic need.  In my judgment, the Bradley is just  such a reliable and effective weapon.  I realize that there has been much  debate  about  the  Bradley. Many  charges have been made against the  Bradley, yet very few of them have  even been proven.  For example,  some have said  the  Bradley's aluminum armor is too vul nerable to enemy fire, and that it is a  potential ""death  trap""  for  its crew.  Yet the Bradley has both aluminum  and steel armor. On the other hand,  the M-113 armored personnel carrier  has only aluminum armor, and this is  the vehicle some have said  is better  than the Bradley.  The Bradley is far superior to the  M-113  in keeping out bullets,  shell  fragments and shaped charges. The  Bradley will stop a 14.5 mm round,  while  the M-113  can only  stop  a  7 .62mm round.  The Bradley's unique ""shoot on the  move"" capability makes it particularly  able to deliver its passengers  to the  actual front, while keeping pace with  the M-1 tank. The M-113 just does not  have this capability.  Yes, the Bradley does not have the  strength of a  tank-but it was never  intended to have that ability.  Some have said the Bradley is too  complex, and that it is loaded with ex pensive and unneeded  technological  features. These features include laser  rangefinders,  gyrostabilized  turrets,  NETT].

1324,1375,14,Mr. BENNETT.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, the Bradley or some thing like it is a good vehicle. It is cer tainly needed. There are places where  it cannot be used effectively, and one  of the problems that I had about it  when I started looking at it was the  policy of where it was going to be used  and some of the places it should not  be used.  We have 3,000 of  them already.  I  come down on the idea that it would  be a good idea to slow up this produc tion  in  the sense of having further  testing because I am not sure the test ing has been adequate for the things  that need to be done.  I  think something like the Bradley  has to be here. We now have 3,000 of  them. We  could  logically get  some  more but I would really like to test  them more adequately and thoroughly  than has been recently done. I favor  therefore the testing amendments.  ",1986
1325,1375,14,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts [Mr. CONTE], one of the  outstanding orators in the House of  Representatives.  ",1986
1326,1375,14,Mr. CONTE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman,  I am quite puzzled  about this amendment. I am puzzled  by this effort to terminate or signifi cantly slow down the Bradley. It does  not make sense. My puzzlement stems  from the attack on what is one of our  best procurement programs-not one  of our lousy ones.  I have been on the Appropriations  Committee throughout my 28 years in  Congress  and  believe me,  cutting  shaky programs and making savings is  what my committee is all about. In the  Defense Subcommittee we have always  tried to use a set of guidelines when  we cut a program:  First, is there a need for the thing whatever it is?  Second, does the thing meet the re quirement?  Third, is the thing staying within its  expected costs.  Fourth, does the customer-in this  case, the Army-like the thing.  Well, the Bradley is the thing. It was  built to meet a need to travel cross country faster than the old APC-ar mored personnel carrier-and to carry  the infantry and supporting firepower  so that they can assist the tanks when  the tanks need help.  The Israelis found out in the 1973  war, that, even in tank country such  as  the Sinai,  sending  unsupported  tanks out to do battle is deadly. The  brigade that they sent out without in fantry support to meet the Egyptians  was defeated in detail. Not until the  infantry came up did the Israelis have  any success.  Well, that was 13 years ago. They  used older  tanks and M-113 APC's.  Today, our M-1  tank  is much more  mobile, so the old M-113 APC cannot  stay close enough behind in protected  positions  to  the M-1  tanks  to help  when they encounter enemy infantry.  Clearly, we had  to have a new and  radically  improved  infantry  carrier.  The Bradley is it.  Guess what. The Bradley fills all of  the Army's requirements. It is on cost  and  the costs are going down. The  commanders in the field love it. I say  love it. The troops love it. I say again,  love it.  The Bradley  does  everything we  want it to do and then some. My gosh,  this is a model program, following ex actly what we  in Congress would  demand and hope for. We would be so  lucky if all our programs performed as  well. It is unbelievable to me that once  we get such a good program, a group  of our Members would go after it. How  can this be?  No one on this Hill has had more  heartburn about  the funding of de fense items than I have. I want an ef fective national security effort that is  funded based on common sense. But,  when we decide to do in a program we  should take our lead from experts, not  from outside organizations whose only  aim is to cancel programs.  Just  look who  supports  this pro gram: The Secretary of Defense-who  personally canceled  the Divads. The  Secretary of the Army. All the com manders in the field. The soldiers. The  Armed Services Committees on both  sides of the Hill as well as both Appro priations Committees.  What  is  the opposition based on.  Tests. That's all-tests. Not tests to ex amine whether  the vehicle can do  what it was designed to do. Those tests  are done. The Bradley passed them  with flying colors and the vehicle has  been in production for years.

1335,1401,14,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from California [Mr. LUNGREN]  is recognized for 60 minutes.  LUNGREN.  Mr.  Speaker,  thanks in large part to a Philadelphia  woman who  sued  a  hospital  after  losing her ""psychic powers,"" America  has awakened  the  issue of ""tort  reform."" Unfortunately, a barrage of  claims and counterclaims has obstruct ed the ability of the public and the  Congress to acquire a realistic view of  to  71-059 ()-.87-46 (Pt. 14)  the  the liability system, either from  litigation or insurance standpoint.  In recent weeks, empirical research  has allowed  interested Americans  to  raise serious questions about the fun damental characteristics of tort litiga tion  in  this country. Does  the  tort  system exact too high a cost from our  economy? Is it an efficient method of  responding to the concerns of consum ers? Does it dampen productivity and  innovation? Does  it  even  threaten  public health standards? The raising  of  these questions, as well as  their  scope, demand a thorough and objec tive  investigation of  the  interaction  between  our  society  and  the  tort  system.  On July 29,  I chaired a hearing of  the Joint Economic Committee's Sub committee on Productivity and Eco nomic Growth. The hearing concerned  the costs of the tort system. Experts  from  the Rand Corp.,  the  research  firm of Tillinghast, Nelson & Warren,  and New York University testified. Ac cording to their studies, the costs and  inefficiency of the tort system have  reached mountainous proportions.  Robert W. Sturgis, managing princi pal of Tillinghast's Risk Management  and  Casualty  Insurance  Division,  reached precisely  those conclusions.  He found  that the  tort system cost  $68.2 billion in 1984. Yet present costs,  huge though they may be, are not as  disturbing as the rate of increase in  costs over the past 30 years. Mr. Stur found  that  the  increase  in  tort  costs roughly paralleled those of the  gross national product from 1933  to  1950. From 1950  to 1984,  tort costs  rose by an astonishing 4,000 percent,  or 37  times, while the gross national  product increased by a small 13 times.  Clearly, the eruption of litigation in  this country cannot be considered in  the same context as other sectors of  the economy.  As Mr. Sturgis noted, it may be more  appropriate  to  think  of  the  tort  system in the context of public assist ance and the redistribution of wealth.  Due to the ""social justice"" concerns of  New Deal jurists and the ""enterprise  liability"" concepts of liberal judges in  the 1960's, liability and fault have fre quently parted ways  in  the past 30  years. Within the framework of ""en terprise  liability,""  plaintiffs merely  need  prove  that  a  product  caused  injury. The need not worry about re butting evidence that the manufactur er did all he or she could to make the  product safe, or disproving any conten tions that the product was misused. If  anything goes wrong with a product,  the manfacturer may have to compen sate those who suffered as a result.  The advent of ""joint and several li ability"" has worsened this scenario. In  the simplest terms, ""joint and several  liability"" means that defendants with  even the most minimal responsibilities,  1 percent, may be assessed the greatgis  est burden of the settlement, 100 per cent-providing that those defendants  have the greatest resources. One dis turbing example of the ""Deep pock ets"" phenomenon appeared in the May  16 edition of the Wall Street Journal.  In this case, 9-year old Todd Alper stein,  of  Chicago,  suffered  brain  damage when he almost drowned in a  pool at a private party. He will receive  a settlement worth between $7 million  and $28 million, but that money will  not come from the host of the party.  The money will not come from those  who own the pool. Rather, the plain tiffs will collect most of their funds  from Chicago Osteopathic Medical  Center.  The  plaintiffs'  attorney  argued that the hospital should pay  because ""the host of the party was a  department head,  the party was for  his staff and  the hospital benefited  through higher employee moral."" Al though such an example may be ex treme, it is consistent with the princi pal of joint and several liability.  As Yale law professor George Priest  has observed, principles such as ""en terprise liability"" and ""joint and sever al liability"" have created a form of na tional  insurance,  an  entitlement  system  that provides everyone with  compensation whenever they suffer an  injury or feel that their concerns have  been mishandled by  a  professional.  Statistics compiled by Mr. Sturgis sup port such analogies, while the costs of  the tort system vastly outstripped the  GNP, they kept pace with other enti tlements, inflation adjusted costs for  the tort system have risen some 8.7  times since 1950. Public welfare costs  have increased by some 9.3 times, and  government health care by 12.5 times.  Although the tort system has main tained a growth proportionate to that  of entitlements, its efficiency has not  been proportionate. As Mr. Sturgis ob served in his testimony, ""It is my ob servation  that with  respect  to cost  [the  tort system] has behaved  in a  manner similar to entitlement systems  in this country, but with a far lower  rate of efficiency     . While 63 per cent of the insured tort costs go direct ly to third party claimants, much of  that goes for plaintiffs' expenses and  legal cost    . Only 25 cents of every  dollar goes  to compensate economic  losses."" In contrast, 85 cents of every  dollar spent on health insurance goes  to compensate economic loss, while 70  cent of every dollar spent of workers'  compensation does the same. Plainly,  the present  tort system has serious  flaws not only as a system of justice where one is sometimes penalized re gardless of fault-But as an entitle ment mechanism. In that context, one  is  entitled  to much  less  than one  would be in other compensation mech anisms.  Research by Dr. James Kakalik of  the Rand Corp.  and Prof. Andrew  ",1986
1336,1414,14,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, following  the visit to the United Nations by Sandinista  Leader Daniel Ortega, U.S. Ambassador  to  the United Nations Vernon Walters responded  to  the Nicaraguan United Nations Ambassa dor's charge that an earlier statement Walters  made was  filled with  lies. Ambassador Wal ters' reply provides a useful summary of the  abuses and indignities perpetrated by the San dinista  regime  in Nicaragua.  I urge my col leagues  to  read what Ambassador Walters  has to say.  [From the Washington Times, Aug. 7, 19861  HYPOCRISY FILLETED AT U.N.  (By Vernon Walters>  Of the many countries who have criticized  the United States for its alleged failure to  accept the  judgment of the International  Court of Justice,  it is  interesting to note  that only one of them accepts the compulso ry jurisdiction of the court, and that coun try has carefully excluded from its accept ance any possibility of being brought before  the court on claims such as those at issue  here today.  It is a fascinating and odd experience to  be lectured on justice and respect for law by  the representative of Cuba, a country which  has been for more than 25 years a vast con centration camp where  liberty  is crushed  and unknown thousands are tortured and in  prison. One has only to read Armando Val ladares's book on his 22 years in Castro's  jails to know what happens there. I will not  dignify the vituperous personal insults that  he addressed to me. He speaks of recent in justice. It is well that he does not speak of  truth. Two million people have  fled his  country to escape scientific terrorism. The  same can be said for the representative of  Vietnam who  followed him. Four million  people have fled from these two paradises.  The American people find it instructive to  see who  the Sandinistas have chosen  to  speak on  their behalf: Cuba, Vietnam countries not known for  their respect for  human  rights  and  dignity. The United  States is not isolating itself from the rest of  the world. Millions are trying to get into the  United States. Who is trying to immigrate  to Nicaragua, Cuba, or Vietnam? Anyone  who wants to leave my country is free to do  so without fear of being shot by the border  guards or put in prison.  I might add, not many want  to,  even  though we have heard how evil it is here  today. When  the  Polish  representative  talked about a big power motivated by ideo logical prejudices intervening in the affairs  of a neighboring state, I wondered to which  country he was referring.  Recently, the representative of Nicaragua  stated that a presentation I had made earli er had been filled with lies. I would be interested in knowing just what lies she was talk ing about.  I described the Sandinstas' betrayal of the  1979 revolution. Is it a lie that former junta  member Alfonso Robelo was harassed by  the Sandinistas and forced into exile? Per haps the Nicaraguan representative should  look at a photograph of Robelo's home and  car after they had been vandalized by the  turbas divinas. These  turbas are  ""divine  mobs"" <it  is an interesting terminology) controlled by Department F-8 of the Sandi nistas' secret police-that are sent to intimi date opponents of the regime.  Is it a lie that Violeta Chamorro has also  been maligned and harassed? Is it a lie that  La Prensa has been shut down? I suggest  that  the Nicaraguan  representative  read  Mrs.  Chamorro's poignant  letter  in  [a  recent issue ofl The New York Times.  Is  it a  lie  that  former  junta member  Arturo Cruz tried to run for president in  1984 but was denied the conditions of a fair  election? Perhaps the Nicaraguan represent ative would like to see a photograph of Mr.  Cruz after he had been attacked by  the  turbas during the campaign. I should point  out that Mr. Cruz is in exile now because  last year the Sandinistas refused to allow  him to reenter Nicaragua because he was  carrying a peace plan from the democratic  resistance.  Is it a lie that the Sandinistas have sought  to destroy the democratic labor movement?  If the representative of Nicaragua does not  choose to believe the International League  of Human Rights, I suggest she read ""San dinista Deception Reaffirmed: Nicaragua  Coverup of Trade Union Repression,"" an  August 1985 study by the American Insti tute for Free Labor Development which pro vides detailed  information on 39 cases of  Sandinista repression of labor organizations.  AIFLD is  the Latin American arm of the  AFL-CIO,  an  organization which  I  can  assure the Nicaraguan representative is not  controlled by the current U.S. administra tion.  Is it a lie that the Sandinistas have sought  to crush Nicaragua's private sector? Did not  the secret police gun down prominent busi nessman Jorge Salazar in November 1980?  Were not several leaders of the umbrella or ganization COSEP jailed in October 1981,  including an initial period of solitary con finement in which they were locked up nude  in cold, dark dungeons? What heinous crime  had  these respected businessmen commit ted? They had the temerity to write Com mandante Ortega protesting the Sandinis tas' Marxist economic policies which were  leading to economic ruin.  I could go on, describing for example how  they have confiscated the property of cur rent COSEP head Enrique Bolanos, or how  they seized Ramiro Gurdian's property be cause of his comments on the reduction of  Nicaragua's  sugar  quota,  or  how  they  tricked prominent industrialist-and former  Red Cross president-Ismael Reyes to leave  the country and then took over his property  and arrested his son.  Is it a  lie that the Sandinistas have re placed the Somocistas as the elite who ex ploit the Nicaraguan people? I suggest that  the Nicaraguan representative look around  the next time she returns to Managua and  see for herself who lives in the nice homes,  who drives the fancy cars, who shops at the  exclusive dollar store. Perhaps then she will  realize what the Sand.inistas have done to  Nicaragua.  Is it a  lie that the Sandinistas have re pressed the church? The representative of  Nicaragua should read the letter delivered  earlier this year from Cardinal Obando y  Bravo to Secretary-General Perez de CUel lar of his May letter in The Washington  Post. She should also read what Pope John  Paul  II said  about  the banishment of  Bishop Vega and Monsignor Carballo. I also  recommend she review the moving testimo ny by Jimmy Hassan of the Campus Cru sade for Christ about his treatment at the  hands of  the Sandinista secret police.  I  would welcome the Nicaraguan representa tive's explanation of why  that country's  only synagogue was confiscated and turned  over to the Sandinistas' children's organiza tion.  For that matter, I would like to learn the  grounds on which the Nicaraguan Govern ment  confiscated  so many  things-the  Somoza newspaper, both television stations,  several  radio stations, countless buildings  and other properties-and turned them over  to the Sandinista party and its puppet orga nizations.  Is it a lie that the Sandinistas have perse cuted the Miskito Indians? Perhaps the Nic araguan representative should travel to the  refugee camps in Honduras or Costa Rica  and hear for herself the shocking details of  Sandinista abuses.  it a  lie  that the Sandinistas have a  secret police 10 times the size of Somoza's,  and that they subject thousands of prison ers  to multiple forms of abuse? Does the  Nicaraguan representative mean to tell us  that now Nicaragua will  allow  respected  international organizations to visit the pris ons of the secret police?  Is it a lie that the Sandinistas have, with  massive Soviet and Cuban assistance, built  the largest military machine in the history  of Central America? Is it a lie that the draft  is highly unpopular, that thousands of Nica raguan youths have  fled  the country or  gone  into hiding to escape service  in the  army of the Sandinista party, and that anti draft riots have been ruthlessly repressed?  Is it a  lie that the Sandinistas have at tempted to export their Communist revolu tion? Would the Nicaraguan representative  like to look at a photograph taken in 1980  of aircraft at Papalonal which were involved  in the arms trafficking? What is her expla nation  for  the Lada vehicle captured  in  Honduras last year which had been loaded  in Nicaragua by the secret police with muni tions, communications gear, and other mate rial for the Salvadoran guerrillas?  Is it a  lie that the Sandinistas have at tacked  their neighbors with  their regular  military forces? We all recall  last March  when the Nicaraguan representative told us  that this was a lie, only to have Comandan te Ortega later admit the incursion.  What is a lie is the Sandinistas' claim that  they want a negotiated settlement.

1337,1427,14,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, Dr. Herbert Stein,  former Chairman of the Council of Economic  Advisers, recently made some very pragmatic  and  thoughtful comments about fiscal policy  and Gramm-Rudman. They are well worth  reading by every Member.  [From the Washington Post, July 31, 19861  THE WRONG TIME To CuT GoVERNMENT  SPENDING  <By Herbert Stein>  Grown men with  responsible  positions  stand up  before  television  cameras  and  make this statement: Since the economy is  rising less than expected earlier in the year,  and inflation  is also  lower than expected,  federal revenues will be less than expected  and it is therefore necessary to cut federal  expenditures below the level planned previ ously.  I do not understand it. Why are we pun ishing ourselves in this way? Does the slow down in the U.S. economy mean that the  Russians are weaker or more amiable and  the buildup of our military  strength  is  therefore less urgent? Is the need to look  after the poor and homeless diminished? <Is  the ebbing tide lifting all the boats?> What ever was  the  previous  justification  for  spending $30 billion on aid to agriculture-is  that  justification now weaker? Obviously  not.  With both less output and less inflation  than we previously forecast are we now less  able  to afford  those  things we previously  thought we needed? Surely the answer to  that is no. On the contrary, there will now  be more unutilized productive capacity with  which  to meet the government's  require ments, and less risk of inflation. The answer  would be different if the economy were lag ging  behind  previous  forecasts  because  output was bumping up against a ceiling of  capacity, but that does not seem to be the  case.  Is our revulsion against the economics of  Keynes so great that we not only deny what  he said but assert with confidence that the  opposite is true? That is, do we now think  that cutting government expenditures is a  reliable way to stimulate a sluggish econo my or prevent a threatened recession?  The question may be put more concretely:  In the past year output increased by 2.7 per cent, which is probably somewhat below our  potential growth rate, and unemployment  was fairly steady at around 7 percent. Now  there is an expectation that output will rise  in the next year at about the same rate, or  possibly less. In these circumstances,  is it  prudent to cut expenditures below the presi dent's budget level in order to reduce the  deficit from $210 billion in fiscal year 1986  to $144 billion  in fiscal year 1987? <That  figure, $144 billion, is the Gramm-Rudman  target for the 1987 deficit. Because of the  peculiarities of Gramm-Rudman account ing,  it appears  that about $25 billion of  taxes collected in 1987 will not be counted  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and about $15 billion of exp~nditures will  not be  counted. Thus,  if  the  ""Gramm Rudman deficit"" is $144 billion the ""real""  deficit may be $134 billion.>  My  pre-Keynesian  and  anti-Keynesian  professors knew better than that. Even Her bert Hoover knew better than that. A thor ough-going classicist or monetarist might  deny that increasing government expendi tures would have even a short-run stimulat ing effect on the economy. He would not say  that cutting expenditures would have  a  short-run stimulating effect on the econo my, so that it was necessary to cut other wise worthwhile expenditures  in order  to  fend off a recession.  What  leads  to  the present foolish  talk  about the budget is Gramm-Rudman. But  even Gramm-Rudman does not imply that  cutting expenditures is a good prescription  for dealing with economic sluggishness. The  Gramm-Rudman  law provides  that if the  real GNP rises at less than an annual rate  of 1 percent for  two consecutive quarters  the deficit limits are suspended for the cur rent and following fiscal year.  This is recognition that cutting spending  does not cure  recessions. Once  the GNP  growth rate falls below 1 percent for two  consecutive quarters the ceiling on the defi cit is off. But as long as the growth rate re mains at 1.1 percent-as it was in the second  quarter of 1986-or higher, the targets must  be met. They must be met even if, with the  economy  sluggish  and  revenues  rising  slowly, that requires holding expenditures  below levels that are worthwhile, that are  well within  the economy's capacity, and  that are not harmful but possibly helpful to  the health of the economy.  Sophisticated people to whom I express  my concerns about the idea of cutting ex penditures to meet a shortfall of revenue  tell me not to worry. The government will  not really meet the Gramm-Rudman  tar gets. All Gramm-Rudman requires is that at  the beginning of fiscal 1987 there should be  an official estimate that the deficit will not  exceed $144 billion for the year. The law  does not require that the deficit actually be  less than $144 billion.  This solution is unsatisfactory for two rea sons:  First, the government should not pretend  to do what it does not intend to do. This is  more than a moral injunction. It has prag matic significance. The credibility of  the  government is an asset-more valuable as it  becomes  scarcer-and  it  should  not  be  wasted.  Second, while a  sharp  reduction of ex penditures in response to the slowdown of  the economy would be unwise, to destroy  completely the expectation that the size of  the deficit will be brought under sufficient  restraint to prevent continued increase in  the size of the federal debt relative to the  GNP would  also be unwise. That could  cause an increase in long-term interest rates  that would be harmful to economic growth.  The  de  facto  abandonment  of Gramm Rudman, without the establishment of any  substitute rule of fiscal policy, will destroy  all hope of deficit restraint. We find our selves in a position where we can't live with  Gramm-Rudman and can hardly live with out it.  We need a fiscal policy that will limit the  long-run growth of the deficit and the debt  while not enforcing inefficient and probably  destabalizing change of government expend itures  in response  to fluctuations of  the  economy. Fifty years  ago  people  talked  about balancing the budget over the busi20759  ness cycle as a solution to  this problem.  Forty years ago the Committee for Econom ic Development proposed the policy of bal ancing the budget at high employment for  the same purpose. Even a  few years ago  people were talking about the difference be tween  the  ""structural""  deficit  and  the  actual deficit, which was a way of distin guishing between our long-run position and  our cyclical position.  The  attractive  nuisance  of  Gramm Rudman diverted attention from all that,  but our present situation shows the urgency  of returning to the problem of reconciling  our long-run and short-run fiscal  require ments.  REMEMBERING THEODORE  BIDDLE  HON. JOHN P. MURTHA  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, August 11, 1986  ",1986
1338,1427,14,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I want to take a  moment to honor Dr. Theodore Biddle, former  president of  the University of Pittsburgh at  Johnstown, and note his death at the age of  80 on August 2.  Dr. Biddle was the former dean of men at  Pitt, and the first president of the Johnstown  campus.  Following  retirement,  he  became  president emeritus.  Dr. Biddle helped so very many students  during his illustrious career that it is correct to  say that his efforts live on in the lives of thou sands of productive graduates.  Moreover,  in our area,  the University of  Pittsburgh at Johnstown has become a key  academic center, an attraction to industry con sidering locating in the area, and a major eco nomic force  in  the community. Johnstown  is  one of the university's most able and benefi cial branch campuses, and that is not surpris ing given the start that it received under Dr.  Biddle's leadership.  Dr. Biddle's was a constructive  life, well  lived.  I enjoyed the chance to work with him  and know him, and I hope we can join in con tinuing the strong tradition he has laid down at  Pitt.  CIVIL SERVICE SIMPLIFICATION  ACT OF 1986  HON. GENE TAYLOR  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, August 11, 1986  ",1986
1339,1427,14,Mr. TAYLOR.," Mr. Speaker, at the request of  the administration,  I am pleased to introduce  the Civil Service Simplification Act of 1986.  This proposal establishes a simplified man agement system for Federal employees in an  effort to enhance management flexibility and  employee  incentives  to better motivate  the  Federal work force while improving employee  morale.  The current personnel system, which had its  origins more than 60 years ago, stresses ad ministrative procedure at the expense of man agement flexibility and opportunities to reward  employee productivity. In 1978, Congress un",1986
1340,9,18,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, my  myth of the day is that better health,  better jobs, and a longer life expectan cy have resulted  in a declining per centage of workers taking early retire ment.  The  actual  situation  is  that  the  labor  force  participation  rates  for  older men has been declining sharply  over the past 25 years.  In 1970, more than four out of five  males age 60 or 61 were in the labor  force. By 1985, only two out of three  American males either held a  job or  were seeking one. The decline is even  more striking for males between the  ages of 62 and 64. While more than  two-thirds of the males  in that age  bracket were  in  the  labor  force  in  1970, only 46 percent were attached to  labor markets in 1985.  While the decline has been less pro nounced,  the  same general pattern  holds for men in their fifties.  In the case of the labor participation  rate of older women, any increase in  early retirement from long-held jobs is  basically offset by the flood of women  entering the labor market.  On average, a man who turns 65 in  1983 could expect to live another 15  years. That is about 2V2 years longer  than his 1940 counterpart. A woman  turning 65 in 1983 could expect to live  to age 84 or about 5 V2  years  longer  than her 1940 counterpart. Clearly,  the increase in life expectancy and the  decline  in  labor  force  participation  means the amount of time spent in re tirement is increasing dramatically in  our society.  Why are people choosing to retire  early?  First of all, health problems are cer tainly not one of the reasons. The pro portion of men age 55 and over who  cited health or disability as the reason  for not working has dropped sharply  since 1973.  I believe one of the major factors in ducing people to retire earlier and ear lier is the increased coverage of work ers under pension plans which permit  retirement younger than 65 with little  or no reduction in benefits.  A  growing number of  firms have  found it advantageous  to offer early  retirement to their employees. In addi tion, withdrawal of funds from tax-de ferred  accounts  such  as  IRA's,  Keoughs, and 401(k)'s can begin at age  59%.  The current Federal law which per mits the cessation of the accrual of  pension benefits for an employee after  the age of 65 obviously acts to discour age older workers from continuing in  employment.  With workers  retiring earlier and  the general aging of our population,  our society will have to monitor care fully both public and private pension  plans to guarantee their fairness and  solvency.

1343,9,18,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President, ap proximately 54 percent of our children  in the 12to 17-age group go to the  movies at least once a month-84 per cent go at least twice a year. Themes sages portrayed in these movies exert  enormous influence on our youth who  are just beginning to formulate values  and ideals which directly affect their  thinking for many years.  One of the messages we see more  and more frequently in today's movies  is the casual and often glamorous por trayal of illegal drug use. This sends a  very mixed signal to the youth of our  country. For some time, children have  been taught of the dangers of illegal  drug use-in classrooms, churches, and  at home. However, during their leisure  time at the movies they may see drug  use depicted in a different light.  For this reason, today I am introduc ing  a  sense-of-the-Senate  resolution  calling on the Motion Picture Associa tion of America  [MP AAJ  to adopt,  within its current rating system, a sub category ""D,"" for movies which clearly  depict drug use in a benign or favor able light. I am also introducing this  resolution  in amendment  form  and  will offer it as an amendment to the  omnibus  antidrug  legislation  the  Senate soon will be considering. This  legislation is endorsed by the National  Association of Secondary School Prin cipals and the National Parent Teach er Association [PTAJ.  In November 1968, the Motion Pic ture Association of America, together  with the National Association of Thea ter Owners [NATO] and the Interna tional Film Importers and Distributors  of America  [IFIDAJ, voluntarily  im plemented  their  own movie  rating  system. This provided concerned par ents with advance warning that some  of  the subject matter  in particular  films may not be suitable for children.  This bold step recognized the need to  preserve  the  creative  freedom  of  movie-makers while providing parents  with a forewarning of the content. Ac cording to the Motion Picture Associa tion, nationwide scientific polls have  consistently reported that parents find  the  ratings useful  in helping  them  make decisions about the movies their  children wish to see.  Ratings are determined by a seven member ratings board located in Cali fornia. The board's criteria  include:  theme, language, nudity, sex, and vio lence. Parents have no way of knowing  how  a movie  depicts drug use,  or  whether this subject matter is includ ed at all. It would be extremely help ful to parents who are already fighting  the influence of peer pressure on their  children to know if a movie portrays  drug use in a glamorous manner.  This resolution does not punish film makers  for  the subject matter they  choose  for  their films. On  the con trary, the movie industry, and in par ticular the Motion Picture Association,  should be commended for  its volun tary  creation of  the  rating  system  nearly 18 years ago. The movie indus try accepted voluntary ratings primar ily to provide parents with the oppor tunity to make an informed decision.  In so doing, they protected the rights  of movie makers to create any type of  movie they see fit, and made it clear  that the ultimate responsibility rests  on the parents, not the industry. This  resolution simply asks for a slight ex pansion of the current rating system.  By taking this small step, the motion  picture industry could become one of  the private sector leaders in the war  on drugs.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to join me in sponsoring this  resolution. Mr. President, the Motion  Picture Association of America has al ready  demonstrated  its  ability  and  willingness to respond to the needs of  parents  by  implementing  its  over whelmingly  popular  rating  system  over 38 years ago. We need the coop eration and support of this influential  industry to successfully fight the war  on drugs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of my resolution be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the resolu tion was ordered to be printed in the  REcoRD, as follows:  ",1986

1345,22,18,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President,  I  would like to express my appreciation  for  the very clear comments of the  Senator from Kentucky, for his initia tive in preparing amendments to the  bill which we want to place before us,  and, above all, for his tireless efforts  in the field of product liability. There  are very few Senators, maybe two or  three, who have spent as much time  on this subject as has Senator McCoN NELL, and there is no one who spent  more time.  Clearly, as the Senator from Ken tucky has pointed out, this is an issue  that cries out for a solution.  yield  the  to  the  0 1450  When the small business people hold  their White House  conference  and  they are asked what is the most impor tant question before the country and  they say product liability, clearly, it is  our role  to respond. When our con stituents buttonhole us at every turn  and tell us about one horror story or  another, of not being able to buy in surance or having their premiums go  up 200 or 300 percent in a year, they  are asking us to respond.  Our constituents are not coming to  us because they enjoy our company.  They are coming to us because they  have a real economic problem, and it is  the unavailability and the cost of in surance.  The Commerce Committee has ad dressed the problem of product liabil ity because it is clearly within our ju risdiction. The Senator  from Ken tucky is on the Judiciary Committee,  and his interests have been somewhat  broader, substantively broader,  than  those of us on the Commerce Commit tee. Yet, it really is the same problem.  I hear it from manufacturers, but I  also hear if from charities, from mu nicipal governments, from county gov ernments, from all kinds of business  people, from doctors.  One obstetrician came up to me in  an airport and said that his liability  insurance, malpractice insurance, was  over $100,000 a year.  People are  leaving  the practice of  medicine. People are getting out of  business because  they cannot afford  the cost of insurance.  It cries out for a solution. The solu tion is in our bill. The Commerce Com mittee's bill  is  somewhat  different  from that of the Senator from Ken tucky. Wo do not insist, in our bill, on  a fault basis system. We tried that a  couple of years ago and did not get  very far with it. Our idea in the Com merce Committee is that there has to  be an economic incentive to settle out  of court and that the only way to pro vided such an incentive is with some  system of caps. You get a cap if you  are prepared  to settle-that  is our  theory. Maybe  there  is  a  better  theory.  I absolutely share the comment of  the Senator from Kentucky that noth ing  is written  in  concrete, but we  should move on this, and right now we  are not moving. We have a filibuster in  the works. We cannot even proceed to  a product liability bill. It is absolutely  stalemated.  So, when our constituents come to  us and say, ""We want help; we want  relief; we want action; we want Con gress to address this problem of insur ance,"" our response now,  in the U.S.  Senate,  is very clear: ""Get lost. Go  away. No. We're not going  to do  it.  We're going to protect the status quo.  We're going to protect the system, in  which court costs and lawyers' costs  President,  are more than the plaintiffs are get ting.""  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr.  will the Senator yield?  ",1986
1346,22,18,Mr. DANFORTH.," I yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I  commend the chairman of the Com merce Committee. Had it not been for  his efforts, we would not have a bill  here. We would not have a bill on the  floor of the U.S. Senate to even con sider.  Even though I would like to go in a  more comprehensive way at the prob lem, I want to commend the distin guished chairman, because without his  efforts, we would not have any bill to  consider on  the  floor  of  the U.S.  Senate. Had we tried to get one out of  Judiciary, I say to my friend from Mis souri, we would still be waiting.  A lot of my colleagues on the Judici ary Committee say that we cannot go  down this road, that this offends no tions of federalism.  I ask the distin guished chairman of  the Commerce  Committee if he has had a single busi nessman over the years come up  to  him and say, ""Senator DANFORTH, I am  concerned  that acting  in  this area  might somehow offend notions of fed eralism."" I have not received any let ters  like  that, and  I wonder  if the  chairman of the Commerce Commit tee has.  ",1986
1347,22,18,Mr. DANFORTH.," No. The Trial  Lawyers Association is opposed to this.  They are happy with the status quo.  I can think of a couple of times in  recent months when I have been back  in my State and there have been meet ings scheduled  in the morning, 7:30  breakfast meetings. It is very hard for  me  to get the adrenaline flowing at  7:30. But what is interesting is that at  these meetings,  they are absolutely  sellouts. The  room  is  packed with  people,  because  they want  to  talk  about product liability. They want to  hear about product liability.  If you were to go back to Kentucky  and announce that you were going to  have a breakfast meeting at 7:30 in the  morning, 7 in the morning, 6:30 in the  morning, on the question of product li ability,  I guarantee  that you would  pack that meeting with people who  have horror stories.  I think it is going to be difficult for  Members of  the Senate  to go back  home after we adjourn and to meet  with their constituents and answer the  question,  ""Why didn't you do any thing?""  The Commerce Committee did  it.  We reported out a bill that was not  easy. We want to bring it to the floor;  and if people have amendments, fine.  But the short answer is that we have  not acted.

1349,35,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS-A CLOSER  LOOK  <By Nathan Perlmutter and David Evanier)  Discussion of the political scene in South  Africa properly begins with the self-evident  stipulation that apartheid is racist and de humanizing.  If you are a black citizen of South Africa,  you cannot vote in national elections; you  must generally use separate public facilities;  you are not allowed to own real estate in 87  percent of your own country; you are told  with whom you may socialize, and where  you can look for a  job. If the government  wants to resettle you, it can do so at any  time for any reason.  The ""homelands"" resettlement drive has  forced half of South Africa's blacks  into  overcrowded, unproductive segregated Ban tustans, areas with no industrial base that  are so overpopulated hardly any viable agri cultural  land  remains. Drinking water  is  unsafe and sanitation deplorable. Since the  Bantustans are little more than detention  camps, many Africans migrate to urban cen ters as ""illegals"" subject  to arrest. Forty  percent of black children are estimated to  be malnourished and  ten percent suffer  from kwasiokor <extreme protein deficien cy> ..  In 1984, Pretoria's Constitution granted  Parliament chambers  to Asian and  ""col ored"" communities but not to blacks.  On  the positive side, black, colored and  Asian trade union membership has grown  from 150,000 after legalization in 1979  t.o  750,000  today and blacks' real income has  risen  substantially  in  the  last  25  years,  higher than in any other African country.  The U.S. State Department says that more  positive changes have taken place in South  Africa in the last five years than in the pre vious 300.  Hotels, parks and theaters are being inte grated, and the pass laws controlling where  blacks can live and work were recently re voked. Other reform commitments that are  going  to be  translated  into  legislation  in clude guaranteeing blacks freehold property  rights.  Paul  Johnson,  British  historian  and  former editor of the New Statesman, recent ly wrote  in Commentary: ""There  is  .  .  .  overwhelming evidence  that South Africa  has been moving away from apartheid .. .  It is quite clear that P.W. Botha . . .  is con vinced  that apartheid has  to go and has  been dismantling  it almost by stealth  to  avoid panicking the regime's followers.""  Nevertheless, apartheid remains in force  today. We,  Jews, with  a  collective  memory of centuries in European ghettos  and who have experienced the singular evil  of racism, feel a special personal responsibil ity to insist on its dismantling.  But this is not to sugge~t. closing our eyes  to what may emerge once apartheid is gone.  Political morality demands that the values  that see us abhor apartheid also measure  the society that will follow. We must distin guish between  those who will work for a  humane,  democr::-.. tic,  pro-Western South  Africa and those who are totalitarian, anti humane,  anti-democratic,  anti-Israeli  and  anti-American.  It is in this context that the African Na tional Congress <ANC),  so frequently dis cussed as an alternative to the Botha Gov ernment, merits a close, unsentimental look.

""  -An article in the September, 1971, issue  of Sechaba,  the monthly ANC magazine  headlined,  ""Zionism,  South Africa  and  Apartheid-a Paradoxical Triangle,"" was  adapted  from a pamphlet with  the same  title published by  the Palestine Research  Center, an affiliate of the P.L.O.  -In September,  1980, ANC  president  Oliver Tambo spoke in Paris at an interna tional Conference on Solidarity with  the  Struggle of the Namibian People, sponsored  by the World Peace Council, a Soviet front.  He said:  ""  . . . I would like to assure our comrades  in  the  liberation  struggles .... and  the  P.L.O .... that  their  struggle  is  ours ... our  fight  is  carried on  in  the  knowledge of the degree of intimacy and po litical, military and economic alliance that  has been developed between racism and Zi onism.""  -At the 60th anniversary meeting of the  South African Communist Party <SACP> in  1981, Tambo stated: ""Today, in the anti-im perialist struggle, we have won new allies  like the struggling people of Palestine. We  have thrown up new enemies of peoples, like  those who murder civilians in Beirut.""  -In July, 1982, during the Israeli military  action against Lebanon-based P.L.O. terror ism, ANC  chief United Naitons observer  Johnstone M.

He re ferred to Prime Minister Begin's policy as  ""Zionist Nazism.''  -Witnesses who had been associated with  the ANC testified before the U.S. Senate Ju diciary Committee Subcommittee on Securi ty and Terrorism in March, 1982, that the  ANC cooperated with the P.L.O. and that  some members trained in the U.S.S.R. with  P.L.O. cadres.  -In 1983, a controversy erupted at the  State University of New York at Stony  Brook  involving Professor Ernest <Fred)  Dube, who taught a course on ""The Politics  of Race."" Dube, an ANC representative at  the United Nations servip.g on  the ANC's  National Educational Council,  taught that  Zionism is a form of racism and suggested as  a  term paper theme ""Zionism  is as much  racism as Nazism is racism.;, Dube spoke at  a ""Teach-in on Palestine"" in New York in  December, 1983, sponsored by the Novem ber 29 Coalition, a pro-P.L.O. organization  of radical leftist and Arab-American groups.  In  an  interview published  in  the  July- .  August 1985 issue of Palestine Focus, a pub lication of the now renamed November 29  Committee  for Palestine, Dube said  that  ""what the Zionists did to the Arabs in Pales tine was exactly the same that the whites  did to us"" in South Africa.  -At the ANC National Consultative Con ference in June, 1985, Oliver Tambo stated:  ''In 1973, the Arab armies succeeded to in flict a major defeat on Zionist Israel for the  first time in a quarter of a century, forcing  U.S.  imperialism  to seek new measures to  protect its client state iii the Middle East.''  -The ANC,  the P.L.O. and  the South  West  Africa  People's  Organization  <SWAPO> were  observers at  the  second  ",1986

1351,74,18,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 5229  the Land Remote-Sensing  Commercialization Act Amendments  of 1986. This bill will ensure that the  intent of the original Landsat Act is  fully carried out. I believe this is legis lation we can all support.  In 1984, Congress took a bold step in  the commercialization of space by set ting  forth a  policy  for  transferring  land  remote-sensing  satellite  oper ations to the private sector. This was  an excellent piece of legislation and it  achieved widespread bipartisan  sup port. Now, 2 years later, we are in a  position to amend that act with any  changes that might clarify its intent  and improve its implementation.  Last  October,  the  subcommittee  which I chair and the subcommittee  chaired by the gentleman from New  York  [Mr. ScHEUER],  solicited  com ments from a great many parties on  what clarifying and technical changes  may be needed to the Landsat Act. We  held joint hearings on some proposed  amendments in early July. Witnesses  from both the administration and the  private sector supported our draft leg islation at that time. On this basis, I  introduced H.R. 5229 on July 23 and  the bill now has 19 cosponsors.  In addition to some minor clarifying  language changes,  this bill addresses  two types of comments we consistently  have heard from both the administra tion and the private sector. Both class es of comments pertain to the role of  research and development in this era  of commercialization.  First, H.R. 5229  enables both  the  Government and the private sector to  participate  in research and develop ment activities unencumbered by the  constraints  that are placed on com mercial activities. Essentially, the act  as amended would not allow licensees  to make data grants to researchers in  universities,  industry, and elsewhere  without charging commercial prices.  Second, H.R. 5229 would establish a  National  Remote-Sensing  Advisory  Committee whereby various parties in volved in remote-sensing can provide  input into  the Government's overall  research and development planning. If  we are to maintain our worldwide lead ership in this area, it is essential that  the Government maintain an active  research effort and be responsive  to  the needs of the private sector opera tors. We cannot afford  to let other  spacefaring nations, such as France  and Japan, dominate the remote-sens ing market by being the first to devel op and  take advantage of advanced  technologies.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5229 is a very val uable piece of  legislation  that will  create an environment whereby  the  Government and private sector can de velop  the working relationships that  will be necessary if commercialization  is to succeed. I ask my colleagues to  join me in strong support for this leg islation.  ",1986
1352,74,18,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker,  port of H.R. 5229.  As my colleagues from Florida, Mr. FuauA  and Mr. NELSON, have indicated, this bill con tains valuable provisions which will  fine-tune  the plan to establish an entire new industry in  space-the remote-sensing industry. We con tinue to face tough competition in this arena  from both France and Japan. However, favor I rise in sup able action on H.R. 5229 will send a strong  signal  that the Congress remains committed  to a commercial  remote-sensing program  in  the United States.  I would  remind my  colleagues, however,  that this new high-technology industry faces a  more immediate crisis than that proposed by  its international competitors. The crisis I refer  to is budgetary. The Challenger accident and  subsequent shutdown of  the Western Test  Range at Vandenberg Air Force Base have re duced launch options for the next generation  of  remote-sensing  satellites. However,  the  Earth  Observation  Satellite  Corporation  [EOSA T]-the entity charged with  commer cializing  land remote sensing-has proposed  an  innovative and practical plan for working  around the current problems associated with  scheduling of shuttle launches. EOSA T's plan  is contingent upon  the Congress providing a  level of funding  in fiscal year 1987 which ap proximates  the  funding  contained  in  the  House-passed Commerce appropriations bill.  I urge my colleagues  to keep  the United  States at the forefront of space commercial ization, both by supporting H.R. 5229  today  and  by  supporting  the House  position on  Landsat commercialization contained  in H.R.  5161.

1358,87,18,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 551,  unanimously passed by  the Foreign  Affairs Committee last Tuesday, com mends the Arms Control and Disarma ment Agency [ACDAl for its service to  the Nation and to world peace on the  occasion of the 25th anniversary of its  founding.  In establishing ACDA on September  26, 1961, President Kennedy and the  Congress sought to create a separate  authority to coordinate U.S. arms con trol policy as well as to integrate arms  control  into U.S.  national  security  policy.  The Agency grew out of a strong bi partisan consensus  in Congress  that  negotiated arms controls were an es sential element of our national securi ty policy. The Agency was entrusted  with the mandate of institutionalizing  the arms control process and ensuring  its presence in the formulation of U.S.  national security policy.  As a sponsor, along with the ranking  member of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee, Mr. BROOMFIELD, of this resolu tion,  I want  to commend  Control and Disarmament Agency for  the  important and vital  role  it has  played during its short existence for  promoting international arms control  and disarmament.  Every day that has gone by in the  past 25  years has pointed out  the  need,  the  desperate  need,  for  an  agency of this kind to coordinate U.S.  arms control policy.  While a strong bipartisan consensus  resulted  in  the creation of such an  arms control and disarmament agency,  such a consensus would not have been  reached, had it not been for the Presi dent of the United States, John Ken nedy, who saw fit to give and lend his  support to that measure. Ever since  then we have been struggling, but nev ertheless,  the Arms Control Agency  for 25 years has been  trying  to do  the Arms  Arms  what Congress has sought for it to do.  We have disagreed from time to time,  obviously, but nevertheless ACDA  is  the focal point and has the responsi bility for fostering an atmosphere of  peace and for integrating arms control  into our national security policy. The  Control  and  Disarmament  Agency deserves the commendation of  the Congress for the arms control ef forts of its current Director Ken Adel man and for the work of its past Direc tors,  including Paul Warnke, Gerard  Smith, Ralph Earle, Eugene Rostow,  George Seignious, Fred Ikle, and Wil liam Foster. Over the years these Di rectors and their staff have wrestled  with perhaps  the most  insurmount able problem confronting the world.  I therefore encourage my colleagues  to support this bipartisan resolution  and to express the hope that ACDA's  next 25 years of existence will be even  more productive than its first quarter  century of existence.  ",1986
1359,87,18,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this op portunity to join my good friend, the  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee,  the gentleman  from Florida  [Mr. FASCELL]  in supporting this reso lution commemorating the 25th anni versary of the Arms Control and Dis armament Agency, and I also take this  opportunity to compliment Ken Adel man,  the present Director, and his  staff for the fine job he is doing today.  Since the establishment of ACDA in  1961, the Agency has been responsible  for making arms control a  relevant  part of U.S. national security policy.  In this regard, ACDA has made special  contributions to bilateral arms limita tion talks with the Soviet Union while  participating in a number of multilat eral arms control negotiations.  I especially want  to commend  the  Agency for its research in verification,  including  seismic  developments,  as  well as nuclear nonproliferation. Over  the years, the Agency has also played  an important role in reviewing United  States arms  transfers as well as at tempting to resolve Soviet noncompli ance with arms control agreements.  With  these  accomplishments  in  mind, I take this occasion to wish the  agency all the best and expect that  ACDA will continue to contribute to  our Nation's search for a more peace ful world.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  California [Mr. LAGOMARSINO].  ",1986
1360,87,18,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I also rise in support of this resolution  commending  the  organization  of  ACDA, Arms Control and Disarma ment Agency, on its 25th anniversary  and to commend the present Director,  Ken Adelman.  I think the organization is realistic,  tough and innovative.  I might also say, Mr. Speaker, that if  the proposals that were put forth by  President Reagan today at the United  Nations can be put into effect and the  Soviets will reciprocate, I think we can  go a long, long way in true verifiable  and realistic arms control.

1367,256,18,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, as an original co sponsor of this measure as well as the author  of the first bill ever authored in the House to  deal with the problem of ""hate crimes"" I rise  in strong support of H.R. 4980. This is a long  overdue measure which takes the critically im portant step of providing for strong and specif ic Federal criminal penalties against  those  who commit crimes or violence and or vandal ism against religious persons and or property.  The date was February 25, 1981, when I in troduced H.R. 2085, ""a bill to amend title 18  of the United States Code to prohibit certain  damage to, and theft of property used for reli gious purposes, and for other purposes."" I re introduced similar measures in the succeeding  Congresses and finally when the Subcommit tee on Criminal Justice reported out this bill, I  was pleased to join as a cosponsor.  The issue we are dealing with in this legisla tion is a national scandal pure and simple. We  are talking about some of the most intimidat ing end  heinous crimes  committed against  one of our Nation's most  fundamental  free doms-the freedom of religion. We are all too  acutely  aware  of  the  existence  of  these  crimes. They happen  in our neighborhoods,  they claim our neighbors as their victims. They  are carried out by persons who operate with  virtual  impunity knowing  that prosecution  is  remote. The prejudice and hatred pract;ced by  these people with closed minds has  left <m  open wound on our communities and  the  Nation as a whole.  To me there are two critical features of this  legislation. The first is the fact that it imposes  first  time  and  specific  Federal  penalties  against  these crimes. The second key ele ment is this bill, as I had hope with all of my  bills, does set up a graduated series of penal ties based on the severity of the crime. This  includes life imprisonment should dealth result  from an act of antireligious violence or vandal ism.  This legislation properly directs its penalties  against persons who not only ""defaces, dam ages, or destroys"" religious real property but  also against those convicted of 'obstructing  by force or threat of force, any person in the  enjoyment of that person's free excercise of  religious beliefs.""  The incidences of these crimes on a nation al basis  is not known  in  the pure statistical  sense. One compilation that is provided each  year is done by B'nai B'rith and it does reveal  some  shocking  data  regarding  anti-Semitic  acts of violence and vandalism. When t testitied before the Subcommittee on Criminal Jus tice in April of 1985 the B'nai B'rith report had  indicated  a  6. 7 -percent  increase  in  the  number of incidents, totaling 715 for that year  alone. While the number decreased slightly in  1985, the rate these crimes occurred exceed ed one per day for the entire year.  These crimes  included bombings, arsons,  and cemetery desecrations. These crimes in cluded assaults, threats, and harassment.  The B'nai B'rith pointed up the second need  for this legislation. In addition to the report es tablishing that this problem does in fact exist it  also pointed  to  the  fact  that  in  1984  the  number of persons arrested for the crimes de creased even though the number of crimes in creased.  The problem  this  legislation addresses af fects all religions  in our great Nation. These  can be acts directed at religious and or racial ly motivated grounds. As the committee report  accompanying this bill states:  The majority  of  religiously motivated  crimes of destruction are believed to be com mitted against synagogues and involve such  things as swastikas painted on walls or de struction of Torah scrolls. Black churches  are believed to be the next most frequent  target of religiously motivated violence.  Tragically no religion is exempt.  Let me quote from two New York Post arti cles:  A gentle Long Island minister who devot ed his life to helping young criminals is in a  coma today after he was bludgeoned by a  thief who invaded his church.  A Catholic priest was viciously attacked in  Brooklyn yesterday by four punks who beat  him and kicked him even after he offered  them his money.  A further need for this legislation is based  on the fact that barely one-third of the States  in this Nation have laws on the books to pro vide criminal penalties for these crimes. The  present Federal law, section 1074 of title 18 is  entirely  too vague and does not in any real  fashion direct its attention or penalties to the  various types of antireligious crime that is the  reality of today's America.  We must combine stricter laws, with greater  public education about  this problem  if we  hope to reduce its growth. This Congress last  year passed an  important measure, requiring  the Justice Department to maintain statistics  for ""hate crimes"" in the annual uniform crime  report. This was important as a means of en suring we know the extent of the problem as  well as how to allocate resources.  I have argued for the past 5 years that for  us  to embark on anything  less  than a  full fledged effort will give license to the continu ation of these horrible crimes. To sit back and  do nothing of this threat is to invite its continu ation. As Dr. Martin Luther King once said ""In justice anywhere  is a threat to justice every where.""  Let me pay a brief tribute to an organization  which did so much to advance my bill and this  final product.  I refer to the International N~t­ work of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survi vors who in a letter in support of my bill said  ""We know all too well from our parents what  effects the damage, destruction, and desecra tion of religious objects and buildings have on  people and what it can lead to.""

Today there are almost 45,000 Amer ican nurses in the Army Nurse Corps.  Almost 9,000  in the Navy and thou sands in the Air Force. They have a  glorious tradition to uphold and they  do it very well. There are eight names  of American women on that beautiful  memorial  to our Vietnam veterans  that died in the service of their coun try and in trying to bring freedom to  that God-awful part of the world.  This tradition goes all the way back  to World War I, but in World War II,  dozens of American nurses from Cor regidor, Bataan, also one nurse who  was captured by the Germans from a  plane crash, their great tradition will  be honored tomorrow in this Congress,  at the White House, at Arlington, at  Kennedy Center that night with the  CBS movie called ""Women of Valor""  that will be shown later this year in  prime time.  I urge all of my colleagues to come  to the well of the House tomorrow to  learn the facts and to address with  honor these women that are so deserv ing. The last one only retired from  active duty in 1969.

1393,295,18,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution  67,  sponsored by Congressman BILL  WHITEHURST, calls on the President, in  concert with the International Whal ing Commission,  to seek a  treaty or  other international agreement to es tablish a wildlife preserve for hump back whales in the West Indies.  The  humpback whale  population  has declined seriously in recent years.  In fact, stocks have diminished from  an estimated 100,000 to a low of 6,000.  killing  Of this, approximately 3,000 are of the  northwest Atlantic stock which mi grates to the West Indies every year.  The West  Indies, particularly  the  coast of the Dominican Republic,  is  known to be the main breeding and  calving  ground  for  the  humpback.  Recent  research  indicates  that  this  may be  the only  area  that  these  humpbacks find suitable for their re productive activities.  The International Whaling Commis sion declared a ban on the commercial  of  humpback whales  some  years  ago. Nevertheless,  humpback  stocks continue to be in jeopardy of  extinction, not only from nations defy ing  the  IWC moratorium, but also  from toxic chemical pollution, dredg ing,  landfill, drilling, mining, ocean  dumping, boating, development, and  offshore petroleum activities.  The  Subcommittee  on  Human  Rights  and  International Organiza tions, which  I  chair, has conducted  hearings  on  international whaling  issues, and the plight of the humpback  is well-documented. Two years ago, a  similar bill, House Joint Resolution  136, was passed by the House by voice  vote under suspension and last week  the Foreign Affairs Committee  ap proved the bill unanimously.  I believe that House Joint Resolu tion 67 constitutes a meaningful effort  to arrest the declining stocks of hump back whales. It authorizes no funds,  complements  the work of  the IWC,  and is consistent with U.S. policy and  leadership with respect to internation al whale preservation.  I ask my colleagues to support this  important measure.  I want  to commend Congressman  WHITEHURST for his continued interest  and leadership on this matter, and I  believe passage would be most gratify ing, as he plans to leave Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I  include letters from  the Foreign Affairs Committee  to  Chairman JoNES of the Committee on  Merchant Marine and Fisheries  re garding the jurisdiction of House Joint  Resolution 67:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Washington, DC, September 23, 1986.

1401,347,18,Mr. MARTINEZ.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes, to close the debate, to  the  gentleman  from  Florida  [Mr.  PEPPER], chairman of the Committee  on Rules.  Mr.PEPPER.Mr.Chairman,Iwish  in the warmest way to commend the  distinguished chairman of the Educa tion and Labor Committee, the gentle man from California [Mr. HAWKINS],  and the distinguished chairman of the  subcommittee handling this measure,  the gentleman from California  MARTINEZ] for the magnificent way in  which  they  have  considered  and  brought to the floor of the House this  important measure. They have han dled it with excellence and deep dedi cation to the cause of the elderly of  this country.  Mr. Chairman, if I may just make a  personal reference,  I was elected  to  the House when I was 62 years of age.  If I had stopped serving in the public  service, which is  the chosen advoca tion of my life, I do not think I would  have been living for the last several  years.  It is good to have something to get  up for in the morning, something to  do,  some challenge,  that gives you  somehow or other  the  impetus  to  carry on in spite of one's increasing  years.  Do you realize there are over 13,000  people  in  the United States over a  hundred years of age? To show you  the spirit of the elderly, I met a man  down in Texas the other day and in  conversation with him he said, ""You  know, Mr. PEPPER, if you think you are  to the end of your rope, do you know  what you should do?""  I said, ""No, what?""  He said, ""Tie a rope on it and hang  on.""  That  is  the spirit of  the elderly.  They want to remain a vital part of  this great country  that  they have  helped build.  I had a hearing when I had  the  honor to chair the Aging Committee  and I had seven witnesses, each one  over 100. A lady was 100, a black man  who had been a  railroad locomotive  fireman was 112. They all testified in telligently and keenly.  I had  them  over to the House Dining Room for  lunch. Some of them shared a  little  white wine. with me. We had an ani mated conversation. They told some  jokes, we told some, and they were a  wonderful  audience  of Americans,  every one of them over 100 years of  age. One of them was a doctor 103  years old. They said he went to his  office everyday in New Jersey.  So the elderly people are going to be  heartened tonight when they hear the  good news of this great House that  they have confidence in the elderly.  They are going to give them a chance  to keep on building America.  ",1986
1402,347,18,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, it is obviously diffi cult  to  follow  the gentleman  from  Florida, the esteemed expert on this  question, and probably the prime ex ample in the country why we should  not have age discrimination. I certain ly commend the gentleman for all the  work that he has done and understand  why  he wants  to  bring  this  bill  through as soon as possible with no  exceptions, and I agree on that aspect  also.  I  just want to make a couple final  comments as to why this bill is needed.  There is concern expressed by some  that as we do  this we are creating  problems. There is no question that  there may be some  transition prob lems as we move forward; we look for ward and see into the future, we may  see that the number of workers in this  country will probably be inadequate to  meet our needs unless we make it pos sible and urge our senior citizens to  work longer. As has been pointed out  by the gentleman from Florida,  the  most rapidly increasing segment of our  population includes senior citizens.  D 1750  We need to make sure that every  senior citizen has the opportunity to  have  the fullest  life for the longest  time. There should be no exceptions to  the Age Discrimination Act. There  may be some  transition rules neces sary with respect to tenured faculty,  but there should also be no permanent  exceptions.  I had intended and urged the Com mittee on Rules to allow me an amend ment to override  the exceptions for  Federal workers. We had discussions  earlier and we have a  commitment  now with respect to congressional em ployees. I also received a commitment  from the chairman of the committee  dealing with our Federal employees  that he will  entertain a  bill  from  myself next session which will try to  remove the exceptions that we have  for the Federal work force.  We have tens of thousands of Feder al employees who are excepted from  the age discrimination rules, and that  is wrong.  We do not need the Murphy excep tion. The law already recognizes an ex ception for BFOQ's-""bona fide occu pational qualifications"", when it is im possible or impractical to test individ ual employees. But we can test police men and firefighters.  The same is true for the exempted  Federal employees-the CIA, the For eign Service, the Federal firefighters,  or whatever. There is no reason that  we should exempt them from this law,  and I will pursue my efforts in this  regard. I will continue to go forward to  see that we remove all exceptions in  the Federal law as we go into the next  session.  But, following the lead of the chair man of the Committee on Rules, our  distinguished  friend  from Florida,  I  understand  the desire  to move  this  through now so that we can get on  with other matters. I know that we are  reaching the end of this session, so  considering that, I will certainly sup port the bill in its present form, even  though I wish we would have other  amendments.  Mr. Chairman, I have no further re quests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",1986
1403,347,18,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 4154, the Age Discrimina tion in Employment Amendments of 1986.  As  the sponsor of  legislation  to eliminate  mandatory retirement  for Americans over 70  and to prohibit the discrimination against any  worker because of age, I would urge the pas sage of this long overdue legislation. Accord ing to census information, I represent the dis trict with the highest concentration of Ameri cans over 65.  It  is no surprise,  then,  that  I  know firsthand of the valuable contribution of  older workers to our community and our local  economy.  Pinellas County businessmen  tell me  they  are anxious to hire older workers because of  the unique experiences and skills they offer.  For these employers, age  is not a factor in  hiring decisions. In fact,  I can cite case after  case of employees who make valauble contri butions to their companies while working into  their seventies, eighties, and beyond.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act,  enacted by Congress in 1967, prohibited age  discrimination in employment for workers be tween 40 and 65 years of age. Congress  wisely amended this legislation in 1978 to in crease the upper-age limit to 70. We should  take the final step today to end all age dis crimination in the workplace by eliminating en tirely the upper-age limit in this act.  Testimony presented to the Education and  Labor Committee  indicated  that  there  are  more than 800,000 Americans over 70 in the  current work  force. Undoubtedly,  this  figure  would be higher  if some workers were not  forced into mandatory retirement at age 70 or  left the work  force voluntarily because  they  were denied certain promotions or benefits.  Employment decisions should be based en tirely on a worker's skills, abilities, experience,  and qualification, not on age,  race, or sex.  Federal  law  prohbitis  the  discrimination  ",1986
1404,360,18,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, on July  31, the Superfund conferees completed  their work on the policy portions of  the Superfund conference report. I be lieve the conferees achieved a remark able compromise. The bill will result  in a strong Superfund Program which  will protect Americans from the hor rors of toxic chemicals, but it will be a  program which can be administered  and enforced.  Once the tax portions of the Super fund Program have been completed,  the conference report can be brought  back  to  this Chamber  for consider ation.  It has been understood  that  once program changes were set so that  costs could be judged, the tax confer ees would complete their work.  The tax committees have been under  extreme pressure to complete the com prehensive  tax  reform bill. Now,  I  would urge my conference colleagues  on Ways and Means Committee and  their counterparts on the Senate Fi nance Committee  to do  everything  they possibly can to complete the tax  portion of the Superfund bill in the  very near future.  My  concern, quite  frankly,  arises  from the fact that the administration  has already threatened a veto of the  Superfund bill. If that were to occur, I  am confident that the House would  override such a veto. Superfund is too  important to the American people.  But if the Congress does not pass  the conference report on Superfund in  the very near future, there is a very  real  possibility  that  the President  could pocket-veto the bill and deprive  the Congress of an opportunity  to  override.  A strengthened Superfund Program  is  too  important to fall victim  to a  strategy of delay that could culminate  in a pocket veto.  I urge my colleagues on the tax com mittees to complete their work on a  Superfund tax so that the conference  report can be approved and we can  assure that Congress has the last word  on whether a strong Superfund bill be comes law.

1405,386,18,Mr.  SIMON.," Mr.  President,  no  matter what happens on the immedi ate motion, I think all of us recognize  that nothing is going to happen this  year. We have a very real problem,  and it is a problem we do not have the  ability  to deal with right now. You  have two giant forces in collision, trial  lawyers, and  insurance companies.  I  would point out, as I did in the Judici ary Committee, that in the State of Il linois we used to have two giant forces  in collision-the employer groups and  the unions and unemployment com pansation and workmen's compensa tion. We finally worked out an agreed  bill process whereby  the employers  and the unions get together and they  agree  upon  changes-they  are  not  sweeping  changes,  but  necessary  changes, desirable changes-and  the  public in Illinois has been well served  by that process.  In the committee meeting I asked  the trial lawyers and the representa tives  of  the  insurance  companies  whether they would be willing to meet  and consider this kind of a process,  and  they at least monetarily agreed  that they might. I  think those of us  who are here, Members on both sides  of the aisle, ought to ask representa tives of those two groups to meet. You  are not going  to have the sweeping  changes you have here. I do not think  you are going to end up with a cap on  pain and suffering, for example, but I  think there are some changes on both  sides that would serve the public inter est.  Now, what kind of changes? Well,  some kind of limitation on joint and  several, some  limitation on frivolous  suits, some kind of a statute of limita tion. The Senator from Kentucky [Mr.  McCoNNELL] has made some  innova tive and good suggestions in the area  of resolving disputes without going to  court. On the trial lawyers' side, those  are some of the things that can be  considered. On the side of the insur ance companies, among other things,  there are two bases at which we have  to look. One is the major modification,  if not outright repeal, of McCarran Ferguson. If two shoe stores in the  hometown of the Senator from South  Carolina [Mr. HoLLINGS] get together  and set the price of shoes, they can be  sent to prison for 3 years. If two insur ance companies get together and set  the price of insurance, it is all perfect ly legal. Clearly that does not serve  the public interest.  The second thing that is wrong  is  that we simply do not have an ade quate data base. Trying to find out  what is going on in this country in the  insurance field  is  like grabbing at a  balloon. It is  just very, very hard to  catch. We have 50 State regulators.  Clearly, we need to be gathering data  at the Federal level. We are the only  Nation on the face of the Earth that  does not have Federal Government  control, National Government control  of  insurance.  I  do not advocate  it.  What I do advocate is that this indus try is so important and its function is  so important that the Federal Govern ment ought to be able to gather infor mation. I think that clearly ought to  happen.  Again,  I  think we all recognize we  are not going to pass a bill and have  anything  enacted  this  year.  That  should not mean this discussion is not  serving a useful function. We ought to  see if we cannot get together the two  major parties in dispute, although the  public ultimately needs to be served the insurance companies and the trial  lawyers-not  to  have  the  kind  of  sweeping changes we have here but  some modest changes that I think will  serve the public well.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. McCONNELL  and Mr. HOL LINGS addressed the Chair.  ",1986
1406,386,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL.  I  Chair.  Mr.  President,  today  the Senate  votes to determine whether or not it  will proceed to consider the merits of  S. 2760, the Product Liability Reform  Act. The real question is whether this  body can afford to ignore the erosion  of  this Nation's tort  law? Can we  ignore the inability of so many of our  constituents  to obtain affordable  in surance-or  insurance at any price?  Can we continue to ignore the reality  of a judicial doctrine that casually dis misses fault and negligence as being  virtually  irrelevant  in  determining  whether a defendant is liable? Can we  simply shrug our collective shoulders  when  the  scales of  justice  in  this  Nation no longer weigh the conduct of  individuals, but  instead weigh  their  pocketbooks? I for one say no.  Mr. President, S. 2760 is not a per fect bill. Should we have an opportuni ty to consider this bill on the Senate  floor, I am sure there will be a number  of amendments offered to improve it.  Indeed, as I announced, I intend to be  among  those offering  such  amend ments. The real issue  is whether we  have a  responsibility, a duty,  to ad dress this matter, and then proceed to  a vote on its merits. I for one say we  owe this to the American public.  At the appropriate time, I will offer  an amendment-which I  filed yester day-which would significantly broad en the scope of S. 2760. Rather than  thank  the  limiting reform to product liability liti gation, my amendment, as most of you  are aware, would comprehensivley ad dress tort reform in general. It would  apply to municipalities. It would apply  to day care centers. It would apply to  nurse midwifes. It would apply to the  officers  and directors of chairtable  foundations. In short, it would apply  across the board.  At this point, Mr. President, I am  not going to delve into the merits of  my comprehensive approach or go into  the substantive provisions contained  in my amendment. I will reserve that  for a more appropiate time. What I do  want to address, now,are a number of  myths that opponents of tort reform  constantly parade before us.  The first is the myth that holds the  unfettered  development  of  the  common law as holy writ, and vilifies  those who would, legislatively, impede  this  process  as  sacreligious. Well,  pardon my irreverance, Mr. President,  but that notion is simply nonsense.  For generation upon generation  it  has been the plaintiff's bar and civil  libertarians who have sought legisla tive relief to ""humanize"" the exacting  and  formalistic demands of a  rigid  common law system. It was they who  were responsible for urging the pas sage of State worker compensation  laws to preempt the harsh regime of  the so-called three evil sisters of the  common law that virtually precluded  any recoveries by a worker against his  employer. Wrongful death and survi vor statutes, modifications of sover eign  immunity, the downfall of con tributory negligence, warranty  laws,  dram shop acts, the adoption of strict  liability in some jurisdictions, occupa tional disease legislation and so forth.  When it pleases the bar, suddenly the  sacred cow of the common law loses its  sanctity.  Today,  the common law pendulum  has swung too far. It is not that cer tain  classes  of  plaintiffs  have  too  many rights; but rather that many de fendants  are  being  denied  theirs.  Americans have been  led to believe,  led to expect, that they will receive  unlimited  redress  for any harm,  re gardless of  fault. That system has  become bankrupt-both economically  and morally. The well has run dry.  IDtimately, Mr. President, it is the  obligation of the elected representa tives of the people to determine what  is and what is not sound and equitable  public policy. So let us proceed to do  so.  Second, Mr. President, we are at tacked for unconstitutionally denying  the individual States the right to de termine their own tort law separately.  It is clear, I would think, that a basic  sense  of  fairness,  of  equity would  demand  that we  establish  uniform  standards-treating  all  our  citizens  equally before the law.  ",1986

1414,425,18,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  on April 18,  the Federal Emergency  Management Agency  issued  regula tions that would in effect deny Feder al disaster relief assistance to States  and localities in 61 of the last 111 de clared disasters. They would not have  been eligible. Under these regulations,  when a disaster is severe enough to  warrant Federal assistance,  localities  would be called upon to pay 50 percent  of the costs of replacing and repairing  public facilities, instead of the 25 per cent they pay under current practice.  I  oppose  the  implementation  of  these regulations. Denying Federal as sistance in time of need and increasing  costs to local governments when they  can least afford increased costs under mines the basic purpose of Federal dis aster relief.  As ranking member of the Subcom mittee on Regional and Community  Development with  jurisdiction over  this program,  I strongly oppose  the  imposition of  these drastic changes  through  the  regulatory  process.  sweeping changes are to be made in  the Disaster Relief Program,  those  changes should be made by the Con gress, not by the bureaucracy.  Prior to the August recess, I had in tended to offer an amendment to the  debt  ceiling  bill  to  prevent  these  FEMA regulations from taking effect  until Congress specifically authorized  changes to existing law. The commit tee leadership urged me to withhold  that amendment until this bill came to  the floor, so that an amendment could  be worked out which stopped the regu lations  and,  further,  authorized  changes  in  the Disaster Relief Pro gram. An important reason for choos ing this vehicle  is  that this amend ment will then go to conference with  the proper House committee.  Mr. President. it is time for the Con gress to exert control over the Disas ter Relief Program. Passage of author izing legislation is  the way to do  it.  With the exception of one provision,  this amendment has been adopted by  the Senate on two previous occasions  If  ",1986

1417,438,18,Mr.  NICKLES.,"  The  legislation  which we have before, us, the amend ment of the Senator from Nevada of  which I am a cosponsor, allows  the  States to increase to 65 on some high ways. But if those States felt safety  was really in jeopardy and it was not  in the public's interest, they could still  leave it at 55. It would be the States  making that decision instead of Wash ington, DC. Is that not correct?  ",1986
1418,438,18,Mr. HUMPHREY.," That is correct.  Certainly, the Senator from Nevada is  better able to answer.  ",1986
1419,438,18,Mr. HECHT., Will the Senator yield  on that?  ,1986

1421,438,18,Mr. HUMPHREY., I yield to the Sen ator from Nevada.  ,1986
1422,438,18,Mr. HECHT.," The Senator is correct.  It is strictly a States rights issue. The  States can increase it or keep it at 55  iii urban areas, but  it  is  strictly a  States rights issue.  ",1986
1423,438,18,Mr. SYMMS.," I  thank the Senator  and I  thank the other Senators who  have spoken in favor of the proposi tion. What this will do is simply give  the States the authority to relax their  speed limit up to 60 on certain roads.  That would mean  that  they would  probably have to go to their State leg islature and get a  law passed in the  State to raise the speed limit. For ex ample, the Governor of Pennsylvania  has already spoken to this.  0 1730  For example, the Governor of Penn sylvania has already said that as long  as he is Governor of Pennsylvania, he  will use his abilities as Governor to see  that they do not raise the speed limit  above 55. I have no quarrel with that.  We are not trying to force  it down  their throats. We are not trying to say  that the people on the banks of the  Potomac know best what  the speed  limit should be; we will let the people  on the banks of the Snake River or  the Clearwater River or somewhere  else decide whether it should be raised  to 65 or not. If New Jersey and Penn sylvania and  the other States  that  have highly traveled roads do not wish  to raise the speed limit, they will not  be forced to do it. Just give them per mission. It is an example of federal ism.  ",1986
1424,438,18,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  end as I began. There is nothing more  boring than belaboring the obvious. It  is obvious that it is time to get rid of  this  13-year-old,  arbitrary  provision  and restore flexibility and sovereignty  to the States to set reasonable speed  limits so  that, among other  they can concentrate on apprehending  drunken drivers. I thank the Chair.  things,  Mr. PROXMffiE. Mr. President,  rise in opposition to both the Hecht  second-degree  amendment  and  the  I  SYMMS.  If the Senate raises the speed limit  to 65 miles per hour on rural inter state highways, we will be in effect  signing death warrants for the lives of  500 or more men, women, and children  each year. We will be accessories in  the maiming and  injuring of  thou sands of others  in highway  injuries  every year.  A Transportation Research Board  study estimated that these deaths and  injuries will be some of the tragic re sults of increasing to 65 miles per hour  the speed limit on our Nation's 31,500  miles of rural interstate highways.  The economic losses to the Federal  Government of such increased carnage  on our Nation's roads will run into mil lions of dollars. The taxpayers will be  forced to bear the costs of increased  Medicare, Medicaid,  disability  and  other aid programs.  But this Federal cost would pale in  comparsion to the overall cost to socie ty associated with the increased high way deaths and injuries.  I hope my  colleagues will  think for a moment  about the increased burden on health  insurance plans,  lost  family  income,  rehabilitation services,  funeral costs,  pain and suffering, and ultimately, the  heavy emotional costs to other family  members as a  result of bereavement  and the necessity of caring for the in jured and disabled.  While experts may disagree as to the  exact relationship between  increased  speed and fatal accidents, there is no  question that the probability of a fa tality occurring in a crash increases  with speed. It has been estimated that  the likelihood of a fatality doubles as  speed increases from 45 to 60 miles per  hour. It again doubles as the speed in creases from 60 to 70 miles per hour.  Higher speeds are likely to result in  less safe driving simply because of the  physics  of  automobile  in motion.  When  traveling at a  high  rate of  speed, a car moves a greater distance  during the time it takes for the driver  to react  to a perceived problem.  general,  a  driver's ability  to  steer  safely around curves diminishes with  speed. After  recognizing a problem,  the distance required to stop a vehicle  by braking increases with speed.  Finally, crash severity increases dis proportionately with speed at impact.  The  55-mile-per-hour  speed  limit  tends to reduce the speed differentials  among  vehicles. Differential  speed  among cars  traveling on  the  same  highway is extremely hazardous and  higher speed limits tend to aggravate  the problems associated with speed  variations.  Mr. President, right now OPEC  is  struggling  to  regain  leverage  over  world energy markets. By increasing  the speed limit we will be in a small  but significant way playing into their  In  ",1986

1427,451,18,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. President,  this  amendment to S. 2405 authorizes the  widening of U.S. Route 58 in the Vir ginia section of the Cumberland Gap  National Park from 2 to 4lanes.  The Federal Highay Act of 1973 au thorizes  the  reconstruction of U.S.  Routes 25 and 58 inside the Cumber land Gap National Park in the States  of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.  That project  includes  the abandon ment of U.S. Route 25 inside Virginia  and the construction of the Cumber land Gap Tunnel  linking Tennessee  and Kentucky. Only a 2-lane road is  now envisioned from this new roadway  through the National Park in Virginia.  This 2-lane road will not be adequate  to handle  the expected  traffic once  the tunnel is completed. The expan sion of Route 58 from 2 to 4 lanes is  essential to meet the demands of trav elers and commerce.  This amendment extends the exist ing  authorization  for  the  tunnel  project to include a 4-lane route 58 for  a distance of approximately 2.2 miles  from  the  relocated  tunnel  road  through the Cumberland Gap Park in  Virginia. This project has already been  approved in the House of Representa tives with the support of the Repre sentatives  from Virginia, Tennessee,  and Kentucky.  The  language of  the amendment  provides  that  this project will not  begin until after the tunnel and ap proach roads have been constructed. It  will not adversely affect  the  timely  completion of the tunnel.  Mr. President, this amendment has  been reviewed by the chairman of the  Committee  on  Environment  and  Public Works, the chairman and rank ing member of the Subcommittee on  Transportation and that they are will ing to accept this amendment.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President,  will the Senator from Virginia yield?  Mr. TRmLE. I am pleased to yield  to  the  distinguished Senator  from  Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Can the Senator  assure me that this amendment will  not delay the timely completion of the  tunnel project or compete with  the  tunnel for funds?  ",1986
1428,451,18,Mr. TRIBLE.," Ye:;;,  I can. The lan guage of this amendment allows the  widening of U.S. Route 58 only after  the  tunnel project  is  finished. The  tunnel and the approach roads will be  constructed  first and  then parkway  funds can be made available for the  road widening.  Mr. McCONNELL. If an additional  environmental impact statement is re quired for the project in the Senator's  amendment, it will not be interpreted  to require any additional environmen tal impact statements for the tunnel  project now under construction?  ",1986

1437,464,18,Mr. STAFFORD.," Mr. President, this  amendment is really from  the Com mittee on Governmental Affairs and  has three times been reported, and the  Senate has three  times unanimously  passed essentially  identical  language  to that which is being proposed to the  Senate at this moment.  The Senate last passed this amend ment as separate legislation on August  1, 1985. The amendment would com prehensively reform the Uniform Re location Assistance and Real Property  Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. If en acted  into  law,  this amendment will  make the administration of this 1970  act more equitable and efficient at all  levels of government.  The 1970 law creates certain rights  and entitlements for property owners  and tenants. The act establishes basic  acquisition procedures as well as mini mum levels of compensation, such as  for moving expenses,  reimbursement  for the additional cost of relocating to  comparable replacement housing, and  advisory services during the relocation  process.  The Uniform Relocation Act Amend ments were developed jointly by the  Subcommittee on  Intergovernmental  Relations and OMB's Intergovernmen tal Affairs staff in full and open con sultation with key Federal agencies,  State and local governments, profes sional organizations whose members  implement the Uniform Act, and orga nizations representing the interests of  displaced tenants. The result is a bill  which  comprehensively  addresses  a  core of issues around which there is  broad consensus.  The amendments promote flexibility  and local discretion, broaden the act's  coverage,  raise benefit  levels  across  the board, and provide for a variety of  management  reforms  designed  to  achieve modest programmatic and ad ministrative savings.

The Senator from  nized.  ",1986
1443,477,18,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I yield  myself such time as I may use.  Mr. President, the amendment is a  simple,  straightforward  amendment  that increases the Davis-Bacon thresh old  for  federally  assisted  highway  projects from $2,000 to $250,000.  My colleagues might be surprised at  this attempt because it defies conven tional wisdom  that  ""Congress does  nothing controversial before an elec tion."" I assure my colleagues that I  would prefer a million dollar thresh old, but a favorable vote will send all  parties a strong signal that the Senate  is  indeed serious about  looking  into  Davis-Bacon reforms in the future.  It is unconscionable that the current  $2,000  threshold has never been ad justed upward in the 55 years since  the inception of the Davis-Bacon Act.  The CBO estimates that this modest  change will result in a  taxpayer sav ings of $38 million in outlays over the  next 5 fiscal years-$38 million only to  raise  the  threshold  to $250,000. Be sides this actual savings, approximate ly 32 percent of the total number of  contracts will be  exempt  from  the  Davis-Bacon Act. This is a tremendous  benefit, Mr. President, to small busi ness, and  it  is . in keeping with  the  recent requests of the White House  Conference on Small Business to rid  small business of the Davis-Bacon Act.  Now, Mr. President, who benefits  from this amendment? First off, it is  the taxpayer and the small local con tractors that would gladly bid for the  small highway contracts should  the  threshold be increased.  The Senate has spoken three times  in recent years on Davis-Bacon. With  each proposal, an increasing number  of Senators have seen fit to support  Davis-Bacon changes. Recently,  this  body accepted a $250,000 threshold for  military  construction  projects. We  should do the same here.  This  amendment  partially  imple ments one of the recommendations of  the Grace Commission, and as such it  is strongly supported by the Council  for  Citizens  Against  Government  Waste,  the  lobbying  organization  founded to support implementation of  that Commission's cost-saving recom mendations. It is also supported by the  construction contracting industry, the  NFIB, and other industry-related and  public-interest organizations.  D 2110  Mr. President, it will provide signifi cant budgetary  savings without  in creasing taxes or cutting services. It is  estimated that it will reduce DOT out lays $45 million in 1987 and $1 billion  over  the  fiscal  years 1987  through  1990. CBO estimates that this amend ment will reduce DOT authority $357  million and $38 million in outlays.  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues  that this is an important amendment.  It is a very modest step. When you  think about the fact that it has been  over 50 years since the $2,000 thresold  was set, to move it up to $250,000 is a  very modest step, and it would set us  on a  trend of doing something that  would be good for the taxpayers, good  for competition, good for small busi ness, and therefore it will be good for  jobs  and  opportunities  for  people  working in construction.    I urge the adoption of the amend ment, and I reserve the remainder of  my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  TRIBLE). Who yields time?  ",1986
1444,477,18,Mr. KENNEDY.," I yield myself such  time as I may require.  Mr. President, I rise in strong oppo sition  to  the amendment offered by  Senator SYMMS of Idaho. Time and  again we have been forced to deal with  the issue of Davis-Bacon in the con text of  limited floor debate,  tossing  about  fanciful  figures on projected  cost savings and inflammatory rheto ric about what the Davis-Bacon Law  does and does not do.  Only last month, on the DOD au thorization bill, we  faced  this  issue  here on the floor. The Armed Services  Committee had included amendments  gutting two of our most important pre vailing wage laws. This body decisively  rejected  the assault on  the Service  Contract Act, yet  retained  the  lan guage which removed prevailing wage  protections for thousands of construc tion workers.  The Committee on Environment and  Public Works wisely rejected the Sena tor from Idaho's amendment in com mittee,  as  should  this  body. This  absurd attempt to gut our prevailing  wage  laws  in a piecemeal fashion-!  remind my colleagues there are some  70  statutes  containing Davis-Bacon  protection, of which this is but onewill do nothing to improve the law and  much to confuse the issue, wasted our  time,  and  cause  an  administrative  nightmare.  I want to remind my colleagues just  what it is we are discussing here today.  We are discussing a principle which is  as important and fundamental today  as in any time since the original pas sage of the act.  The principle  is  this: The money  raised by taxing the working men and  women of this country should not be  used to drive down their wages. The  power  of  the Federal Government  should not be used to help impoverish  its citizens. As Representative Bacon a Republican-put it 60 years ago:  The  Federal Government  should  not  engage in construction work in any State  and undermine the labor wages paid in that  State. The least  the Federal Government  can do is comply with the local standards of  wages and labor prevailing in the locality  where the building construction is to take  place.  I will briefly raise and answer three  questions about this amendment:  First, will it save significant sums of  money? No.  Second, does the administration sup port this amendment? No.  Third, is this Davis-Bacon reform or  repeal? It is not reasonable reform-it  repeals  these  basic  protections  for  thousands of workers.  First, this amendment will not save  the exotic sums its proponents claim.  Over  the  last several years,  there  have been several studies which pur port to demonstrate how much would  be saved by increasing the threshold  of  the Davis-Bacon Act. These esti mates fluctuate wildly, and the only  consistent factor  in  these studies  is  that none of these studies took pro ductivity differences  into account, a  factor all experts agree is significant.  The recent CBO studies assume a  3.3-percent savings if Davis-Bacon pro visions were not to apply to construc tion projects. This figure flies in the  face  of  the  contracting  experience  when Davis-Bacon was actually sus pended  in 1971.  In that year, over  1,000  contracts were  rebid without  Davis-Bacon. The costs savings were  nowhere near  the 3.3-percent figure  we see from the CBO estimates. The  actual savings, while operating under  total repeal of Davis-Bacon by Execu tive order, was only six-tenths of 1 per cent.  If the ostensible goal of this amend ment is to save money, the proponents  will be sorely disappointed. If the goal  is to gut the law under the guise of  cost savings, the proponents will have  achieved their goal.  Second, does the administration sup port this amendment?  The answer is no. Even this adminis tration has not recommended raising  the threshold for highway construc tion to that which senator SYM:Ms  is  ",1986
1445,516,18,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise to  voice my strong support for legislation  to reauthorize the General Revenue  Sharing Program.  When  the House Appropriations  Committee marked up the continuing  resolution for fiscal year 1987, a provi sion was  adopted  to  fund  revenue  sharing for an additional year at a  level of $3.4 billion.  A bill is also pending on the legisla tive calendar to reauthorize this im portant program at its current author ization level of $4.6 billion per year for  another 3 years, but the Senate ver sion of the legislation is still pending  in  the  Financial Committee.  The  Senate measure extends revenue shar ing  for  local  governments  through  fiscal year 1991.  I am a  joint sponsor of the Senate  legislation  and  I  call  upon  each  Member of the Senate to join me right  now in taking an affirmative stand to  pass this revenue sharing bill.  If we do not extend the Revenue  Sharing Program before  the end of  this fiscal year, the immediate result  will  be huge  increases  in property  taxes and sharp cuts in basic public  services back home. Without revenue  sharing, many  counties,  cities  and  townships  across  this great Nation  would have little hope of improving  their educational systems or maintain ing the infrastructure that is neces sary for economic growth.  Since the Revenue Sharing Program  began in 1972, it has been an integral  part of a  long-range plan  to return  government  control  to  the  people  through their local, city and county  governments. In fact, it has served as  the Government's most effective vehi cle for returning Federal tax dollars to  our local communities to be used by  these  local units of governments  to  meet the needs of the people of the  cities, towns, and counties.  At present levels, counties and mu nicipalities in my home State of Ala bama receive $70 million in revenue  sharing funds, money which is used to  provide valuable services  to the citi zens. Without  the Revenue Sharing  ",1986
1446,620,18,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  would like to bring to the attention of my col leagues the continuing plight of Cuban politi cal prisoners. The recent release of approxi mately 65 political prisoners and  their family  members, totaling 111 people, is an action to  celebrate. We must not forget, however,  the  tragedies of  the many, many other Cubans  who want nothing in  life but to be free. The  publication of Armando Valladares' powerful  book, ""Against All Hope,"" clearly and graphi cally illustrates the horrors of Castro's prisons.  The plight of people imprisoned there, as well  as those former Cuban political prisoners who  have fled Cuba for other countries cannot and  should not be  ignored. To many of  these  people, the United States stands as a beacon  of freedom in the darkness of their imprison ment. It is therefore with great sadness that I  point out to my colleagues the administration's  untenable position regarding many Cuban po litical prisoners. For example, the administra tion will not grant visas to Cubans who have  escaped from Cuba to other countries such as  Mexico or Panama. This policy slams the door  on  these people, and  in effect,  turns  them  back over to Castro.  I believe that this policy is unfair and cruel. I  hope to offer an amendment to the Immigra tion bill which would address this problem. My  amendment would prevent  the  Immigration  and Naturalization Service from denying visas  to the United States to Cuban political prison ers who have left Cuba for other countries.  I  urge my colleagues  to support  this amend ment. The Cubans have suffered enough-we  should open our doors to these political pris oners who have experienced such adversity,  and who yearn  for  the  freedom which  this  country offers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I respectfully request to have two relevant  articles on Cuba submitted  for  the RECORD.  These articles, one by Wayne S. Smith and  one by Frank Calzon, recently appear~d in the  New York Times. They are thought-provoking,  and I urge my colleagues to read them care fully. Thank you.  WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CUBANS  LET MORE COME HERE  <By Wayne S. Smith)  WASHINGTON.-lt is 1965. An East German  family has bribed a guard to let them over  the wall. They approach it apprehensively,  but, sure enough, the guard turns his back.  Homefree, they think. They scramble to the  top of the wall. To freedom? Not on your  life. American M.P.'s waiting on the other  side  tum  them back. The next day,  the  United States proudly announces that it has  stopped the  traffic in human lives. From  now on, all refugees will be turned back.  Sound incredible? Not at all. The Reagan  Administration has just announced a policy  that has precisely that effect on Cuban ref ugees:  it turns them back. Henceforth, no  visas will be  issued  to Cubans who reach  third countries such as Mexico and Panama:  Why? Because  the Administration claims  that some of  those Cubans have had  to  bribe ""Cuban and other foreign officials"" to  get to third countries. So, to save some of  them from paying bribes, the Administra tion will refuse entry to all, thus effectively  keeping them inside the wall, for in most  cases they can only get to third countries if  there is a chance of getting a visa on to the  United States.  Who does  this new policy punish most?  Obviously,  the  innocent Cuban  citizens  trying to join their families in the United  States. Does such a policy-which hardly  even  inconveniences  the Castro  regime make any sense? Of course not, but it is per fectly consistent with previous Reagan Ad ministration  actions  toward Cubans who  wish to leave the island.  In 1981, for example, it refused to accept  some 2,000  former political prisoners  the  Carter Administration had agreed to process  as refugees. All were anti-Communists who  had suffered for their convictions. Yet the  Reagan Administration reneged on the com mitment.  For some four years also, the Administra tion flatly refused to issue visas in Havana  to  hundreds  of  divided Cuban  families.  These were often cases in which one spouse  was a  legal resident of the United States  while the other, with the children remained  in Cuba. Immigration petitions were on file  and all papers were in order. The families  could have been reunited immediately. The  Administration said no. Why? At first, it of fered no rationale at all. After two years, it  came up with the story that its refusal to  issue visas in Havana was designed to force  Cuba  to negotiate an  immigration agree ment  and  the  return  of  the  criminals  dumped here during the Mariel exodus.  It was a good story-except that it wasn't  true. We did not have to press the Cubans  to negotiate these issues. They had been of fering to do so since January 1981. We had  ignored  them-and  continued  to  ignore  them until 1984, all the while maintaining  that we were trying to press them to talk.  Finally,  in 1984,  the Administration got  around to taking up the Cuban offer. An  agreement was quickly  reached, but with  the  inauguration  of Radio Marti  only  months later the Castro regime, in a snit,  suspended it. Now, by closing the last loop hole-the possibility of emigrating through  September 23, 1986  a  third country-the Administration has  completed Fidel Castro's work for him yet  somehow wants us to believe it is trying to  pressure him to reinstate the 1984 agree ment.  Beneath the thin surface rationale in all  these cases  lies a  common Pavlovian  re sponse. The Administration seems incapable  of responding  to any problem related  to  Cuba with other than punitive measures.  Never mind that those measures may harm  the  innocent  far more  than  the Castro  regime.  The  human  lives  involved  are  simply not considered.  The Reagan Administration talks all the  time about its sympathy for Cuban dissi dents, but there is a great gap between the  President's rhetoric and his actions. In the  human rights field, his Administration has  not a single accomplishment in Cuba. The  Carter Administration got out thousands of  political prisoners. Senator Edward M. Ken nedy, Jacques Cousteau and the American  Roman Catholic  bishops,  among others,  have brought about the release of dozens of  others. The Reagan Administration, not  even one. Worse, it has added to the burden  disaffected Cubans alredy must bear. It is  not a record to be proud of. With a friend  like Ronald Reagan, Cuban dissidents don't  need any enemies.  Go BEYoND EMBARGo  <By Frank Calzon)  WASHINGTON.-The  real  news  about  United States-Cuban relations these days is  not  the Administration's  announcement  that it will tighten the 26-year-old trade em bargo against Cuba, but how little the Ad ministration is willing to do in the face of  Fidel Castro's provocation.  Mr. Castro's ability to harm United States  interests has been underestimated for many  years. Consider one case being heard before  a Federal court in Hartford, Conn., involv ing 17  terrorists accused of a Wells Fargo  robbery in 1983. According to the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, the leader of the  group, Victor Manuel Gerena, has been  given sanctuary in Cuba, some of his weap ons were provided by Havana and a portion  of the $7 million heist is ""in the custody and  care of the Cuban Government.""  Nor is this an isolated case. In 1982, senior  Cuban officials, including the head of the  Cuban Navy, were  indicted by a Federal  grand jury for facilitating narcotics smug gling into the United States. Such ""narco traffickers"" stop in Cuba for refueling and  repairs, protected from  the United States  Coast Guard by the Cuban Navy, and they  pick up weapons on the way back to South  America.  Recent  reports  also  indicate  that Mr.  Castro is stepping up Cuban military activi ty abroad-in Nicaragua, Angola and Ethio pia.  Most of this disruptive and anti-American  activity took place after the opening of the  United States diplomatic mission in Havana.  This first step toward normalization of rela tions has apparently done nothing  to re strain the Cubans. And the interests section  has had difficulty carrying out even routine  diplomatic duties:  the Cuban-born United  States citizens who  travel  to  the  island  enjoy no American protection because Mr.  Castro refuses to acknowledge their citizen ship, and several American diplomats have  been harassed.  How can the Reagan Administration make  Mr. Castro feel the force of United States  displeasure? There are several options.  ",1986
1447,633,18,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, I want to join our  colleagues in paying tribute to our good friend,  GENE SNYDER, who has so ably represented  the people of his district, the Fourth District of  Kentucky, for two decades and who will retire  at the end of this Congress.  GENE has served with distinction and effec tiveness on the Merchant Marine and Fisher ies  Committee  and  as  ranking  minority  member of the Public Works and Transporta tion Committee.  Those of us who have been  in  the House  for a number of years get to know each other  fairly well. Not just in strictly legislative mat ters, but in matters of personality and  talent  and political skills. And  I can say that GENE  SNYDER  has  always  impressed me,  both  before and since  I have become Republican  leader, with his persuasive power, his ability to  focus on and help achieve realizable  legisla tive goals and his overall effectiveness.  GENE is one of the classic tellers of tales, in  the great House  tradition  that seems,  these  days, to be slowly dying. Such a gift is some thing more  than  the ability  to  tell a good  story-it is a cherished part of this complicat ed,  sometimes maddening,  always  difficult  task we call  legislating. A good story, at the  right time, told in the right way, can go far to  ease a tense atmosphere, to slyly illustrate a  point or to just plain make us laugh when we  need it.  It is an enviable gift and we're going  to miss GENE's ability in this area as well as in  so many others.  Mr. Speaker, let me just say GENE has been  a good colleague and a good Representative  for his constituents. That may seem like slight  praise to those who have not served  in  the  House, but to those of us who have been on  the firing line for many a year can tell you, it is  the highest praise we can pay.

HOW DO WE TAKE ADVANTAGE  OF THE U.S.S.R. NUKE WEAP ONS TEST MORATORIUM?  ",1986
1450,646,18,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  what  are  the  implications  of  the  Soviet extension of  their unilateral  suspensions of nuclear weapons  test ing that began August 6, 1985, and has  now been extended until January 1,  1987? First, have the Soviets actually  stopped nuclear testing for more than  a year? Have they violated this mora torium? After all, the moratorium has  not been subject to any U.S. verifica tion procedures of any kind.  How do we know the Soviet Union  has not been cheating? How do we  know they have not conducted scores  of tests? We are told that seismic mon itoring stations in Scandinavian coun tries can detect underground explo sions that exceed 1 kiloton within the  Soviet Union. We are also told that ex plosions of less than a single kiloton  would have no military significance. Is  this true? Ask yourself: Would the ad ministration make this an issue if the  Soviets had,  in  fact,  tested nuclear  weapons during this 13-month morato rium? The administration could. They  should. They would.  Has there been any charge by any  responsible  administration  official  that the Soviet Union has violated its  unilateral suspension of nuclear weap ons testing since August 6, 1985? No.  This Senator has not heard such a  charge from any source.  Has anyone in the Defense Depart ment charged that the Russians could  have been testing nuclear weapons of  significant kilotonnage  in actual ex plosions without detection? This Sena tor has not heard it. If there is any  evidence of this kind, let us have it.  The fact is, Mr. President, that there  is  every  reason  to believe  that  for  more than a year, the Soviet Union  has not conducted a  single nulcear  weapons  test. There  is  also  every  reason to believe that the Soviets will  continue  this moratorium  at  least  until January 1, 1987.  What are  the  implications of  this  Soviet absention from nuclear weap ons testing? First, it means that the  Soviets, in all likelihood, do not feel  that this long moratorium will have an  important adverse effect on their na tional security or on the credibility of  their deterrent. Second, it means that  by next January, our country will  have nearly l¥2 years advantage over  the Soviet Union in the testing of nu clear weapons which  is essential  to  proving new research on these weap ons.  Keep in mind that at the time the  Soviet Union  stopped  testing,  the  United States was already well ahead  in nuclear weapons  technology-ac cording to our own Under Secretary of  Defense  for Research and Develop ment. The Undersecretary  informed  the Congress in 1985-shortly before  the  Soviet moratorium  on  testing  began-that  the United States was  either ahead of or tied with the Soviet  Union in every one of the most impor tant  nuclear weapons  technologies.  The Soviet Union was ahead in none.  Since then, our researchers have had  more  than a year  to advance  their  technology even further. It is also a  fact that the United States had initiat ed far more nuclear weapons test ex plosions than the Soviet Union even  before the Soviets ceased their testing.  What does all  this mean  for  the  wisdom of U.S. negotiations with the  Soviet Union to stop further nuclear  weapons testing? It means we can stop  testing on both sides with the absolute  assurance that the United States has a  clear and decisive technological lead in  nuclear weapons research and testing.  We freeze. We stop testing when we  are ahead. And what does that do? It  solidifies our advantage  in concrete.  Neither side can test. Neither side can  move the lethal, devastating effect of  nuclear weapons ahead further by the  testing that is quintessential to effec tive nuclear weapon  technology ad vance. If we stop nuclear weapons test ing now, we end this crucial element of  the nuclear arms race. We end the nu clear weapon technology arms race.  If there can be a winner in this race,  it is us. That is reason enough to nego tiate a test ban treaty. But there is an  element here that should satisfy the  most cynical hawk. We stop the test ing when we are clearly ahead. We  stop  the  testing when we have had  nearly 1% years  to further advance  our advantage. Mr. President, there is  no way we can gain by refusing to take  advantage of this golden opportunity.  Just think of it. We serve the cause of  peace in this terribly dangerous nucle ar age by endtllg the technological nu clear arms race. And best of all, we do  it at a  time when our country  is  ahead-so we perpetuate our advan tage. We freeze it.  Does this mean the negotiations will  be easy or automatic? Certainly not.  We can and should insist that verifica tion be absolute. We should insist on  the stationing of seismic monitoring  stations through the Soviet Union. We  should  insist on on-the-spot,  unan nounced inspections of any suspicious  indications of explosions in the Soviet  Union. We should promptly turn to  the extension of this ban to other na tions,  including all  the present ac knowledged nuclear powers and poten tial nuclear powers.  We have a golden opportunity here.  Let us take advantage of it.  terrorism  MYTH OF THE DAY  ",1986
1451,646,18,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  there are two prevailing points of view  among many experts  in  the United  States on the subjects of terrorism and  nuclear accidents that, at their core,  are based on mythology. The first gen erally accepted viewpoint is that nu clear  accidents  can't happen  here.  Sure we had Three Mile Island but not  one life was lost. Our technology is su perior  to  the Russians. Chernobyl  can't happen here.  Likewise the United States has es caped serious terrorist attack. This has  given  rise  to  the perception, also a  myth, that we somehow are safe from  terrorfst actions.  Both related and commonly held po sitions are, unfortunately, not based  on fact.  What  form can nuclear  take in this country?  Just look at all of the nuclear power plants in this country and the large  number of nuclear reactors we have at  our universities and research centers.  Many of these facilities have less than  adequate  physical  security  arrange ments, which in many cases would not  deter a nuclear terrorist from sabotag ing them.  According  to  Theodore  Taylor,  former Deputy Director of the U.S.  Defense Atomic Support Agency, one  possible terrorist scenario could be the  detonation of a  very  small nuclear  device on top of a nuclear waste facili ty causing an extraordinary amount of  destruction.  Mr. President,  let me add another  possibility. Not all weapons-grade ura nium and plutonium in this country is  very well protected. The biggest risk  we face today, where these materials  are  concerned,  is  during  transport.  Can you  imagine  someone  actually  stealing weapons-grade nuclear mate rials during  transport on  the open  road? Well, it could happen.  THE NEW GATT ROUND  ",1986
1452,646,18,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, yester day I stated that the GATT [General  Agreement  on Tariffs  and Trade]  agenda recently agreed to in Punta del  Este was a good beginning.  But yesterday I was able to review  an actual copy of the agenda that was  agreed to. It contains a troubling pro vision.  The agenda seems to state that the  less developed countries do not have to  make any concessions in these negotia tions. if those concessions might hurt  their ""development, financial or trade  needs.""

1456,659,18,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, we are  really playing with fire here. We are  not doing anything for the domestic  cement industry, as has been so clearly  pointed out. The total imports from  Canada amount to 4 percent of U.S.  consumption. So what we are doing is,  in an extreme  fashion,  irritating a  neighbor of ours and one of the great  customers we have. Listen to these sta tistics. Ontario  is  the  largest single  customer for American-made products  in the world. In 1985, U.S. exports to  Ontario were valued at $40 billion-19  percent of all U.S. exports.  Are these exports growing? We know  they are declining all over the rest of  the world. What  is happening with  Ontario? Between 1981 and 1985, U.S.  exports to Ontario advanced by 51 per cent, to the $40 billion. In 1985, Ontar io consumers purchased 20 percent of  all U.S.-manufactured exports. That is  where we are trying to do some good  in our sales abroad, with manufac tured exports. Twenty percent of all of  them went to Ontario; never mind how  many went to the balance of Canada.  But this is the principal province we  are dealing with. We are saying  to  Canada, ""No, we are not even going to  let you sell 4 percent of our  total  cement supply in the United States.""  Mr. President, I plead with my col league to reject this amendment be cause of the dangers it imposes on the  United States. Now, I would say that if  this amendment should be adopted, we  have word from the Office of Manage ment and Budget that they would rec ommend a veto to the President of the  United States. Certainly, with all of  the work we have done in this high way bill, we do not want to have it en dangered by a measure such as this.  ",1986

1460,659,18,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent  that  two  letters  and a telegram that I have be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CONSOLIDATED  READY MIXED CONCRETE,  East Providence, Rl, August 18, 1986.  Hon. JOHN H. CHAFEE,  U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR CHAFEE. As a cement ready mixer from your state, I am writing to ex press my strong opposition to a Buy Amer ica cement proposal in the House highway  reauthorization bill <H.R. 3129). A similar  bill <S. 2405 > will be addressed on the Senate  floor  in  the near future. Your continued  strong  opposition  to  the Buy America  cement provision is vital to the health of my  business.  I know you are aware of the adverse impli cations of such a ban on U.S. trade relations  and on U.S. compliance with standard inter national  trading practices <GATT>. This  proposal would also be very damaging to the  U.S. domestic economy. Every small busi ness person needs as many alternate sources  of supply as possible. For a variety of rea sons, many U.S.  cement producers have  abandoned markets  in the Northeast and  along the U.S./Canadian border. Thus, be cause of prohibitive  transportation costs,  many ready-mix companies have no real al ternative  to Canadian or other  foreign  cement.  If foreign cement were banned from use in  federal highway projects, many of us would  either face shortages or severe price disad",1986
1461,672,18,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I would  just like to say that it is the wish of  the managers of the bill that we could  keep the debate very brief on this sub ject. It is most important, I think, that  we  get  this  highway  legislation  through.  The majority leader has been most  patient, but his patience  is  running  thin. We need to get this bill done  very soon, and I mean within the next  30 minutes.  So I hope we could keep our remarks  as brief as possible, say what we have  to say, vote on this amendment, and  then vote on final passage of the bill.  I yield the floor.  ",1986
1462,711,18,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, as my colleague has indicated we  have put some effort in the last week  or so against the concerns of the Sena tor from North Carolina.  Let me begin my brief comments in  reaction to his amendment by indicat ing that I appreciate his comments on  the  intelligence bill  itself. Like him  the members of the Select Committee  on Intelligence are dedicated  to  im proving  the  quality  of  intelligence  available to the U.S. Government.  I have consulted with the members  of the Intelligence Committee and can  say that the committee has no objec tion to inclusion in its classified report  on the bill the material of interest to  the Senator from North Carolina.  The amendment which the Senator  has offered to the bill reflects certain  changes  in  the nature of a  supple ment, which would be  incorporated  into the committee's classified report  on intelligence programs. Material in  the supplement relates to the subjects  listed  in  the amendment and  it  is  available to be read by any Member of  the Senate who so wishes.  Mr. President, in view of the agree ment of the committee for the inclu sion of supplementary material in its  classified report, members of the com mittee will not object to a motion by  the Senator from North Carolina that  his amendment be adopted. However,  prior to proceeding with that motion, I  would like to engage in two colloquys  with the Senator on the subjects of  CIA analysts and on  the subject of  counter intelligence.  After hearing of the Senator's con cerns in these areas it appeared for a  variety of reasons more desirable  to  discuss  them here  than  to  include  them in the classified report on the  bill.  With respect to the issue of how CIA  analysts use  their  time on basic  re search as proposed by the Senator or  on current reporting and policy sup port tasks such as briefing, I felt that  a discussion on the floor would be suf ficient to alert the Director of Central  Intelligence to the Senate's interest on  this issue.  I  think we have agreed on a collo quy. If the Senator wants to proceed  he certainly may do so.  ",1986
1463,711,18,Mr. HELMS.," Very well.  Mr. President,  I  thank  the distin guished  chairman.  I  do have  some  questions which I wish to direct to the  distinguished  chairman  concerning  the kind of responsibilities that the  CIA analyst must assume today.  0 1510  As the distinguished occupant of the  chair knows, a lot of us have been con cerned for a great while about wheth er the CIA analysts have the opportu nity  to carry out  the mission  they  were hired to do, and that is to con duct basic analysis. According to some  reports I have received, CIA analysts  are  increasingly  required  to  attend  interagency meetings and coordination  sessions, all of which cuts  into  the  basic intelligence research and analy sis the Agency is able to accumulate.  My concern is that, without a base of  research, the people we expect to be  our experts on the Soviet Union and  the rest of the world will lack the op portunity to develop the knowledge we  expect of them.  So, with that preface, I would ask  my good friend from Minnesota, Sena tor DURENBERGER,  are  these  reports  true, and what is the burden of irrele vant  administrative  duties  that  is  being imposed on CIA analysts?  ",1986
1464,711,18,Mr. DURENBERGER., I fully appre ciate my colleague's concerns. This is  one reason why the select committee  has initiated an indepth study of per sonnel policies within the Intelligence  Community. One of the subjects that  the committee study is currently ad dressing is how our most valuable re source-people-is being used within  the Directorate of  Intelligence and  other analytic units in the Intelligence  Community.  ,1986
1465,711,18,Mr. HELMS.," Then, am I correct in  understanding that the select commit tee's study will  investigate whether  CIA analysts are being drawn away  from doing basic research?  ",1986
1466,711,18,Mr. DURENBERGER., That is cor rect.  ,1986
1467,711,18,Mr. HELMS.,"  I  thank the Senator.  And when will this committee study be  completed, if I may ask the chairman?  ",1986
1468,711,18,Mr. DURENBERGER., Our current  expectation is that the study will be  completed and available for implemen tation in January 1987.  ,1986
1469,711,18,Mr. HELMS.," That is fine. I appreci ate  the distinguished chairman's re sponse and I appreciate his diligence  in this connection, and that of Senator  LEAHY, as well. I will be looking for ward to the results because, Mr. Presi dent, this issue is so critical to our in telligence capability and, of course, to  the security of this country.  CO~INTKUUGENCECOLLOQUY  ",1986
1470,711,18,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, counter intelligence is at the heart of the deep  concern  that many Americans have  about the intelligence community and  its potential weaknesses. The espio nage cases of the past 2 years do not  tell the whole story, but they make  clear that our Government has some  very serious problems.  Counterintelligence issues cannot be  confined to closed hearings and secret  deliberations. Foreign agents and spies  are  prosecuted  in  public.  Strategic  monitoring capabilities are acknowl edged by the Government, and Soviet  concealment practices are described in  the administration's unclassified state ments on Soviet noncompliance with  arms control agreements. The compro mise of our intelligence collection ca pabilities by a Howard, a Pelton, or a  Chin cannot be kept quiet, because es pionage is  too serious to be immune  from the criminal law or congressional  and public concern.  The implications of these and other,  earlier hostile  intelligence  successes  can be enormous. The Navy says the  Walker-Whitworth ring was a military  disaster. Fortunately, we were not en gaged in battle with the Soviet Navy,  for we might well have lost any battle  due to the Soviets reading our coded  messages; that's what we did to Japan  in World War II. There are immediate  dangers when the compromise of intel ligence secrets gives our adversaries  the ability  to neutralize or deceive  some of our sensitive intelligence sys tems or operations.  Concerned Americans  have  to be  deeply troubled by the propsect that  the Government may not be facing up  to the full implications of Soviet intel ligence operations. Is anybody doing  an overall assessment of the damage  from all the recent espionage cases?  How can we learn and apply the les sons,  if nobody  looks at what went  wrong, why it happened, and what the  consequences have been?  Another question  is  raised by  the  latest case involving a Soviet employee  at the United Nations Secretariat. Has  there been a comprehensive effort to  examine the ways the Soviet KGB ex ploits its access through the U.N. Sec retariat and the Soviet U.N. missions  for  intelligence purposes? We have  stood idly by for too long while the So",1986
1471,724,18,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I wish to use this occasion to ex press my personal appreciation and  that of the committee to members of  the  intelligence  community  in  this  country-to  the Director of Central  Intelligence, Mr. Casey, with whom we  have had our periodic differences, as  many have over the course of  time,  but there has never been a question of  our mutual, bipartisan agreement on  the need for strong, effective intelli gence in this country. The leadership  of the intelligence community in this  country,  in DIA, NSA,  State/INR,  FBI, and a variety of other areas, has  probably never been stronger than it is  today. That is a compliment to the in dividuals  involved,  a  compliment  to  Mr. Casey, a compliment to the Presi dent of the United States, and it is a  compliment  to  the mutual  efforts  toward  congressional  and  executive  branch commitment  to good  intelli gence in this country.  I express my appreciation to what  we commonly call the rank and file,  the tens of thousands of intelligence  officers, men and women throughout  this  country  and  throughout  the  world, many of whom have participat ed in deliberations of the Senate select  committee  on  its  authorizing  bill  during the course of this year.  I express my particular appreciation  to the staff of the committee, to the  leadership of the staff, Bernie MacMa hon and Eric Newsom, to all who made  a particular contribution this year in  the area of adapting our budget re quirements  to the new  international  intelligence strategy in a way which  was so persuasive that the golden ob jectives of  the community and  the  committee were almost  totally satis fied throughout this process.  Mr. President, I had almost complet ed my compliments and mentioned in dividuals and I turned to my right and  discovered one of the most valuable  members of the staff, who happens to  be on my immediate right. Dan Finn  has been on the committee staff sever al years, having earlier been on the  minority staff and having been pro moted, if you can call it that, to the  minority counsel; then when the committee counsel job was vacated recent ly, he was willing to take on that job.  I  think that this indicates the spe cial spirit that exists in what we would  rather  call  the  nonpartisan,  sometimes,  than  the bipartisan spirit of  this committee, particularly the spirit  of professionalism on the staff, which  does not really recognize the political  differences. Dan Finn, as much as any body else, reflects that.  ",1986
1472,724,18,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I also  add my compliments to Dan Finn for  the years he served 3.8 minority coun sel and for the years he served before  that in various capacities on the Intel ligence Committee.  ",1986
1473,724,18,Mr. DURENBERGER.,"  I  conclude  with  compliments  to my  colleague  from Vermont [Mr. LEAHY] and to our  colleagues on the House side. We have  had some spectacular, if you will, suc cess in our relationship with our coun terparts in the House select commit tee, particularly its leadership and the  chairman, LEE HAMILTON,  from  Indi ana, which has made the staff work  and the work of the intelligence com munity, participating in the oversight  process as well as the authorizing work  that we have completed today, much  more successful than in the past.  This  is clearly a  reflection of  the  fact that there is growth in this new  process of oversight,  that there is a  maturity we are finally realizing, but  that it is the individuals who are in volved to whom we all in this country  owe a debt of gratitude for their com mitment to the role that intelligence  plays in the national security.  ",1986
1474,724,18,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I  join  with my good friend from Minnesota  in complimenting not only the intelli gence community and those who work  on intelligence matters in the Senate,  but the Senators who are members of  the committee. They have put in an  inordinate amount of time, invariably  behind closed doors, usually having to  take time from their other and always  pressing duties.  The staff, led by Bernie MacMahon  and Eric Newsome, have  served all  Senators on both sides of  the aisle  very well.  I could mention others here-Keith  Hall and others on the staff of the  committee. Of all  the committees  I  have served on, I cannot think of any  staff  that works with such a high  degree of professionalism as tirelessly  or so anonymously as the Senate In telligence Committee staff. I wish we  could bring them all out and explain  the responsibilities of each one. But  even that would violate security, for  much of their work is classified and  held in compartmented fashion.  I have always had, in my 12 years in  the Senate, first as a member of the  Armed Services Committee and then  as a member of  the Appropriations  Committee, an opportunity to watch  the development of our  intelligence  community.  I  have seen  this strong  leadership provided in the Senate to  strengthening our intelligence-Sena tor GOLDWATER, Senator INOUYE, Sena tor BA YH, and Senator DURENBERGER  have all provided leadership. I would  like to think that in some ways, I too,  have helped. In all of this, there has  only been really one overriding con cern, not only of the select committee  but also of those individuals we have  worked with as directors of the CIA,  directors of the FBI, and others from  both Republican and Democratic ad ministrations: To have the best intelli gence agencies in the world, the best  ability  to gather  intelligence  in  the  world. I firmly believe that the United  States today has the best intelligence  services in the world.  I also firmly believe that this admin istration, as previous administrations,  is committed  to making it the best,  and to continue in proving our intelli gence capabilities. I am also convinced  that those who  lead the community  strive  for constant  improvement.  that regard, they have received strong  bipartisan  support  from  the House  and from the Senate and strong lead ership, Chairman LEE HAMILTON and  the members of the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence.  Mr. President, I hope that the intel ligence services of this country realize  that the Senate's unanimous vote of  support for the intelligence authoriza tion bill, after only 2 or 3 hours of  debate, is a reflection of the commit ment of the Senate to our intelligence  services and those who lead them.

I  understand that can probably be com pleted in not more than 2 hours. Hope fully following that, we could take up  FIFRA, though I am not certain we  can get that cleared. There is fairly  heavy wrapup; in other words, a lot of  things we  can do after we do  the  CFTC bill. It is our hope that tomor row we will start on drug enforcement  legislation.  I must commend the staff members  on each side who have been working  for  the  past  several  days  almost  around the clock. What they are at tempting to do before they bring the  package to Senators on each side is to  try to reach some consensus on areas  ",1986
1480,737,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Iowa.  ,1986
1481,737,18,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I have  not had a chance to take a close look  at this amendment offered by the dis71~59 0-87-24 {Pt. 18)  from  South  Senator  tinguished  Dakota.  I want to say at the outset that I  would agree with  the Senator from  South Dakota  that  there are some  problems in this context, the cattle fu tures contract. It is apparent, at least  to this Senator, that there are many  unexplained disruptions in the cattle  futures market which are resulting in  lost cash to cattle producers. I do not  believe  that  the Congress, nor  the  CFTC, has given sufficient attention  to the inequities that cattlemen face  in the futures market.  I know  that  many of my cattlemen believe that the  position of  the  futures market has  been dictating the price. That is what  they believe.  They  believe  that  the  futures  market is driving down the cash price  of  cattle which,  of  course,  is  the  amount of money that a rancher or  farmer gets for his cattle at the sale  barn or the packing plants.  The recent situation in the futures  prices on the Chicago Merchantile Ex change have convinced many cattle men  that  something  is  definitely  wrong there.  The  recent volatility of,  and  the  downward pressure on,  futures  and  cash prices had many cattlemen ques tioning the integrity of the beef cattle  markets.  On the other hand, Mr. President,  the ability to forward contract is es sential. It is essential to the cattle in dustry, if we are to have stability in  the livestock industry.  The futures markets can provide sev eral benefits  to  the  industries  that  have them. For instance, cattle futures  and options in particular, first, allow  for cattlemen to increase the time in  which they can choose the price for  their cattle  from  the  traditional 2  weeks to 5 months or more. That is a  definite benefit  to  the cattlemen  in  Iowa, South Dakota, or anywhere else.  Second,  cattle  futures  allow  the  cattlemen to significantly reduce the  financial risk involved in cattle feed ing.  I would  just point out that those  who were appropriately hedged at the  time of the whole herd dairy buyout  announcement would have been fully  protected against the 9-percent cash  price drop which followed immediately  thereafter. So  that also could have  been a benefit.  Third, I would point out that an op erating cattle futures market allows  cattlemen to obtain continous  infor mation on how the market is valuing  cattle to be delivered up to 14 months  into the future. This is a definite asset  to anyone who is in the cattle busi ness.  Mr. President, abolishing the cattle  futures trading contract right now is  much  too precipitious an action  to  take at this time. The disruptions that  it would cause throughout the countryside would be enormous.  If you  think cattlemen have  lost a  lot of  money now, if you adopt this amend ment, I grant you the cash price of  cattle  is  going  to  go  completely  through the floor. If we have disrup tions now, you ain't seen nothing yet  if we adopt this amendment, because  this amendment says, ""Bang, no more  contracts after the date of enactment  of this.""  No new contracts.  That is going to cause the price of  cattle,  I  think,  to  go  completely  through the floor.  Ideally, Mr. President, we  should  have,  I  think, a strong  look at the  cattle contract because I do not believe  that it is working properly. I would  agree with many of the cattlemen who  feel that way. I believe very strongly  that if we do not clean up this con tract, sooner or later it is going to hurt  all the other CFTC contracts. But this  is not the way to do it. This does not  just get at  those who are perhaps  trying  to manipulate  this  contract,  those who are violating the limits as  one speculator violated the limits 15  times in the last 5 months.  No;  this really hurts the cattlemen  out there in the countryside.  So I think that the real victims from  this kind of amendment would be the  cattlemen, and I would also point out  the real victim would be the cow-calf  producer out there in the countryside.  I just think, Mr. President, that we  have a contract here that should pro vide, as I mentioned, those these bene fits to our cattle producers, to the live stock industry. I  think, for the most  part,  this contract has operated  to  benefit the cattle producers of Amer ica. There are anomalies. There are  some things going on in this contract  which I think ought to be looked at. I  would hope that this amendment by  the Senator from South Dakota would  be rejected, and I would hope that we  perhaps could move on to a study to  find out why these things are occur ring and to have this reported back.  As I understand it, if I am not mis taken,  the Senate Agriculture Com mittee and the distinguished chairman  and  ranking member  have written  such a letter and have requested that  study to be done.  So I think this action here is much  too precipitous.  I  just  think  if  this  amendment is adopted on the floor of  the Senate tonight, watch what hap pens to the cash price of cattle tomor row. Just watch it. It will go down and  you are going to leave a lot of farmers  out  there, who  are  already  hurt  enough, holding the bag.  As much as I agree that we ought to  have a strong look at this contract,  and I do believe there are some things  going on that I do not like, this is far  too precipitous an action to take. The  real victims of this amendment, should  ",1986

My cosponsor on  the House side,  Congressman GEPHARDT, and I are in troducing today a new bill-the Save  the Family Farm Act-because  it's  become clear, 1 year after its misguid ed inception, that the 1985 farm bill is  not working.  The present farm bill is busting the  taxpayers to the tune of $35 billion  this year, it's busting our farmers with  more surpluses and lower prices, and  it's destroying our small  towns and  small businesses across America.  Yet, this administration brags about  how much money  it  is spending on  farm programs. That  is  like Henry  Ford bragging about all the produc tion costs he put into the Edsel. Well,  the 1985 farm bill is an Edsel, and no  amount of fine-tuning or new paint  jobs will make it any better.  We were told by this administration  and  its supporters  in Congress  that  embodies  two basic con the 1985 farm bill would lower com modity prices and increase exports.  Well, they got it half right. They got  commodity prices down-way down.  But for the past 3 months in a row,  U.S. agricultural imports have exceed ed exports-the  first  time  this has  happened since 1959.  This fall, farmers across the Nation  face the prospect of bumper harvests  with no place to store their grain.  If we continue down this same road,  we are headed for higher unpaid set asides and a repeat of this disastrous  1983 PIK Program.  The road we are on now is leading to  the destruction of  the  family  farm  system of agriculture in America.  The time has come for a new direc tion in farm policy.  If our goal is a cost-effective farm  bill  that  increases net farm  income  and reduces the deficit, the Save the  Family Farm Act is the only ballgame  in town.  The bill  cepts:  First, a nationwide producer referen dum in all major food and feedgrains  and dairy. If a majority of producers  in any given commodity approve, then  a supply-management program would  go into effect.  In  brief,  the  supply-management  program would be based on bushel al lotments and market certificates. The  acreage  reduction would be progres sive, so bigger farmers would set aside  a  greater percentage of  their  land  than smaller farmers. However, in no  case would the set-aside on any one  farm exceed 35 percent.  The bill also contains a credit provi sion which provides for  interest-free  loans to be given to States for States  to administer to farmers. Any farmer  who had over a 40 debt-to-equity ratio  or any farmer who was already under going bankruptcy or foreclosure would  be eligible for such loans.  To  conclude,  I  believe  there  are  three compelling reasons that we have  to have a change in our farm policy di rection:  First, it is the only bill yet offered in  Congress  that would actually  lower  the  deficit. Government  payments  would be drastically  reduced. There  would be no more $20 million pay ments  to huge corporate farmers  in  California, or any other State.  Last year the Congressional Budget  Office conducted a study of this bill  that showed it would save $42 billion  over 5 years. But that was based upon  the anticipated costs of the farm bill  that we now have before us. But with  farm costs now far higher, we fully  expect that this bill will save in the  neighborhood of $15 billion to $20 bil lion per year-or approximately $60  billion over 4 years.  Second, it is the only bill yet offered  in Congress that would  increase net  farm income. And it will do this, not  by busting the taxpayers of this coun try, but by providing the farmers with  a  fair price  in  the marketplace. A  study by  the Food and Agriculture  Policy Research Institute at the Uni versity of Missouri and  Iowa State  University showed this approach could  increase farm income to $74 billion an nually-almost three times the current  level.  And third, this is the only bill that  has widespread,  grassroots  support  from farmers across this country. At  the St. Louis Farm Congress held last  week, 2,000 farmers from 38 States en dorsed this approach. Forty percent of  the farmers in attendance at that con ference were Farm Bureau members.  It has been endorsed by the National  Farmers Union, the American Agricul ture Movement, the National Farmers  Organization,  the Save  the Family  Farm Coalition, and a host of other  farm organizations.  This farm bill works, it saves money,  and it has the support of America's  family farmers. The current program  is broke and it's no use even trying to  fine-tune  it. We want  to  save our  family farms and we need a new direc tion. That's why we're introducing this  bill today.e  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that an editorial appearing in the  Baltimore Sun  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept. 23, 19861  NEW DIRECTION FOR FARM POLICY  If  Mter less than a year,  the farm bill  is  bearing bitter fruit.

Tom Harkin and Rep.  Richard Gephardt present an intriguing al ternative.  Dubbed the ""Save the Family Farm Act,""  the legislation would allow farmers to vote  every four years on whether  to continue  present policies or give the agriculture sec retary the power to set production limits on  each major  commodity.  a majority  agreed, the USDA would set a production  quota based on export demand, domestic  consumption and  average  acreage yields.  The bill would require larger producers to  lay idle a greater percentage of their land  than smaller farmers-to a maximum of 35  percent of total acreage.

1484,789,18,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Speaker, how  many of my colleagues would have  supported the breakup of the telecom munications  industry?  I  believe  the  answer would be none.  Yet right now we have a number of  Congressmen who will have to accept  the responsibility for the breakup of a  tax system, a system that generated  investments,  that generated  job cre ation, that generated the incentive for  providing for people's own retirement.  There is no action, no action that  trust be elicits more anger  than a  trayed. Make no mistake about it, by  passing so-called  tax reform, we are  betraying agriculture, we are betray ing small business, we are betraying  those who would provide for their own  retirement, we are betraying the prop erty owner.  Like the breakup of the telephone  industry, once it is done there will be  no fixing it. I  just hope that we are  not breaking up the American dream.  I urge my colleagues to vote against  the so-called tax reform.  ENSURING  QUICK  ESTABLISH MENT OF A NATIONAL ORGAN  REGISTRY  <Mr. FLORIO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1986
1485,789,18,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am  introducing  legislation  which  would  require hospitals  to establish  protocols for organ procurement and  to establish national standards for the  110 organ procurement  agencies  in  this country. On September 10, Sena tor GoRE introduced similar legislation  in that body, cosponsored by Senators  MITCHELL, HEINZ, and KENNEDY.  Two years ago many of us envisioned  a fully functioning national organ reg istry in place by this time as a result  of  the  enactment  of  the National  Organ Transplant Act of 1984.  In stead, we have seen our hopes for the  quick establishment of  the national  network included with a vast study of  the ethical and moral implications of  large scale organ transplantation.  Although the conferees working on  the National Organ Transplant Act in structed that implementation of the  National Registry not be tied to this  study, the Department of Health and  Human Services  tied  its creation  to  the results of this study. Only within  the past  few weeks has  that study  been completed. And only now will the  National Organ Registry move toward  reality.  There is a tiny child today, a little  girl, virtually living at Children's Hos pital in Philadelphia. Her name is Ju lianne McLaughlin. She is a very sick  little girl. She is 17 months old and is  in need of a liver transplant.  My bill would force the Department  of Health  and Human Services  to  move  quickly  toward  the  establish ment of a National Registry.  Mr. Speaker, if we are to give chil dren  like Julianne McLaughlin and  hundreds of thousands of other Amer icans a real chance of saving their lives  through organ transplants we have to  do one thing. We have to make sure  that each person in need has access to  all of the potential donor lists in the  country and that they are provided  with those organs by strict order of  need and not by other considerations.  CROSSING THE WIRES AT THE  TRAFFIC LIGHTS  <Mr. DANNEMEYER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
1486,789,18,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  our trade deficit has reached a record  of $18 billion on a monthly basis. As  this Member has been  urging  the  House, the policy of dollar deprecia tion is counterproductive and danger ous. Not only will it fail to redress our  trade balance, but it may make  the  deficit worse.  A depreciating currency crosses the  wires at the traffic lights. It gives the  green signal to importers, telling them  to accelerate before it is too late, while  sending the red signal  to exporters  telling them to decelerate. Indeed, im~  porters can increase their profits by  accelerating  imports because  if  they  wait longer, the same amount of im ports will cost them more dollars. Ex porters can increase their profits by  slowing down the repatriation of their  receipts because if they wait longer,  their foreign earnings will convert into  more dollars.  Now that our dollar has lost 50 per cent of its value in terms of the yen,  thanks to the efforts of our Treasury  Department, we have to ship twice as  much  to Japan  in payment for  the  same amount of imports as a year ear lier. Our terms of trade vis-a-vis much  of the world has worsened in the same  proportion.  Are the dollar debasers contrite, and  do they admit that they have erred?  Far from it: They are getting ready to  step up their efforts to beat down the  foreign exchange value of the dollar  even more.  Mr. Speaker,  the policy of dollar  degradation  is  insane, and  it  invites  disaster. The  alleged benefits of  a  weak and depreciating dollar are a  myth. There  is no substitute  for a  strong and stable dollar, one based on  a fixed metallic standard.

Mr. Speaker,  I  want to just say to the leadership of  the Committee  on Education  and  Labor and the staff what a privilege it  has been for me to serve on that com mittee during this term that we are re authorizing such an important piece of  legislation.  Particularly  I want  to  thank  the  chairman, the gentleman from Michi gan [Mr. FoRD] and his staff, as well  as the ranking member, the gentleman  from Missouri [Mr. CoLEMAN] and his  staff, and the ranking member of the  full committee,  the gentleman from  Vermont [Mr. JEFFORDS], because they  have been of incredible assistance to  me and my staff as we have tried to  address problems that are specific to  Maine children who need the opportu nity for higher education.  Whether they are problems that are  unique to our own secondary market  where we are trying to give more op portunity to Maine children for higher  education; whether it is the problem  of rent subsidies being considered a  part of income for the nontraditional  students who need that help in order  to go back to school; whether it is ex panding the work-study programs  to  make sure that we can put more funds  into  job placement, so  that we can  make sure that we have the opportuni ties that are going to be essential for a  work-study  program  to  work;  or  whether it is just changing the oppor tunities the students have under the  Guaranteed Student Loan Program.  Maine has the lowest percentage of  students in this country who go on to  higher education, but the largest per centage who use guaranteed student  loans.  I believe the kind of changes that we  have made are going  to allow more  Maine  students  and more  students  throughout this country to have the  opportunity to use government assist ance to make sure that they have the  opportunity  to  get  the  education  which is going to be so important for  their futures.  Mr. Speaker, I think we have satis fied the goal that we started out with,  thanks to the leadership on our com mittee putting education ahead of par tisan politics. That is the way legisla tion ought to be crafted, and I am con vinced that will mean we are going to  have more opportunity for students in  this country within the limited dollars  that we have.

1499,945,18,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, quite  often when  the Congress  considers  major legislation of this type, it has  difficulty drafting the legislation in a  way  that affects  the future. We so  often know what has happened in the  past that sometimes we in effect fight  the last war.  I am pleased that the chairman and  those of us who worked on this legisla tion were able to draft it in a way that  we took a close look and affected the  lives of the new college student.  There is a myth, Mr. Speaker, that  the American college  student  is 18  years old, male, unmarried, not work ing,  and  enrolled  in  the  business  school. I do not know if that was ever  true, but it certainly is not true today;  and this bill really takes a major step  at working with what we might call  the nontraditional college student, the  student that is more and more making  up the majority of the student popula tion on the campus.  With this legislation we try to pro vide appropriate assistance to returning students, to single parent students,  to workers who have been thrown out  of work in these last two recessions in  the past few years, and want to return  to a  campus  to pick up additional  kinds of skills.  0 1720  Time does not allow me to enumer ate all of the many, many pages of  changes that are in this bill which will  affect the new students coming onto  the campuses today and tomorrow. I  want  to commend  the chairman for  his  leadership  in ensuring that  this  bill affects those types of students and  I would like to also commend my col leagues on both sides of the aisle, par ticularly,  if I might take the risk of  singling out one colleague, particulary  Mr. GUNDERSON on the minority side  of the aisle for the excellent work that  he did in coordinating and cooperating  with me and others in writing this bill  in a way that it takes care of the non traditional new college student who is  going to be on America's campuses.

1501,945,18,Mr. HENRY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the conference report on S.  1965,  the higher  education  amend ments of 1986. This  legislation  re sponds to the two overriding concerns  today when it comes to Federal stu dent  financial  assistance-making  more dollars available, both in grants  and in subsidized loans, for those stu dents unable  to pay  the  increasing  costs of higher education, while also  tightening eligibility criteria and col lection procedures, to insure that only  those students who need Federal aid  receive it, and that those who do re ceive loans repay them. The bill main tains the critical combinations of Fed eral grants and loans which have been  so  important in insuring educational  opportunity to our young people, and  increasingly, older workers who need  retraining and  further education as  well.  In addition,  the conference report  follows the House bill and includes a  new program  to address one of the  most pressing needs of higher educa tion today-the critical need for new  and upgraded research and education al facilities. By involving private cap ital in this new program of loan insur ance and reinsurance for educational  facilities, this program will allow us to  leverage a large number of. dollars for  college  construction with  relatively  few Federal dollars involved.  I want  to also commend  the out standing efforts of Chairman FoRD,  and of my ranking member of the sub committee, Mr. CoLEMAN, and to the  chairman and ranking member of the  full committee, Chairman HAWKINS  and Mr. JEFFoRDs for all of their work  on this legislation.

1503,958,18,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Chair man, I  rise in support of H.R. 5495,  the fiscal year 1987 NASA authoriza tion bill. The Subcommittee on Trans portation,  Aviation,  and Materials  unanimously supported  the adminis tration's request for their aeronautics  program this year.  I know none of us are happy with  the huge deficits  that continue  to  plague us. However, we must resist the  temptation to balance the budget at  the expense of research and develop ment. I am sure every one of us would  be willing to borrow money to take ad vantage of an investment opportunity  with a guaranteed return greater than  the cost of borrowing. Those kinds of  investment opportunities  are  rarely  available to us as individuals, and yet I  believe that funding NASA's aeronau tics R&T program is as close to a risk free investment as any of us are likely  to see.  The U.S. aerospace industry contin ues to provide a positive trade balance.  This is directly related to the invest ments we have made in the past in  aeronautics research. There is tremen dous synergism in NASA's aeronautics  program; much of  it  is generic  re search that benefits all aspects of avia tion, and the resulting cost of requir ing each company to conduct its own  basic research program would surely  mean the end of our fragile competi tive advantage in aviation products.  I would also like to call attention to  a new line item in NASA's budget this  year-transatmospherics R&T. This is  the aerospace plane program which  bridges  the gap that now exists be tween  aeronautics  and  space. The  aerospace plane is the most exciting  program we've seen in decades-a hy personic  research aircraft  that will  demonstrate the technologies needed  for hypersonic transports, military air craft, and also a single-stage-to-orbit  space transportation system.  This is a  joint program with DOD,  and it is critically important to sup port a strong NASA role in this pro gram to ensure that it remains a re search program to support both civil  and military applications in both aero nautics and space.  And, now I would like to turn our at tention  to  the space program. The  NASA authorization bill directs NASA  to begin procurement of a replacement  orbiter; moreover, it provides for the  ",1986

MEL  LEVINE and Ken Edwards were not  only close politically, they were close  friends, personally, and this is, indeed,  a very special way MEL has chosen to  honor his friend.  Ken Edwards was my cousin, and I  was proud of him. When I speak to my  own children about a  life  in public  service,  about  the  rare opportunity  public life offers to help our people, I  talk to them about their cousin, Ken.  We don't salute Ken today because  of family, or friendship, or even be cause of our similarities. Ken's father  and mine were brothers, in our child hood we lived together, but politically  we set about on very different paths. I  am  a  conservative Republican;  the  man whose life I am celebrating today  was a liberal Democrat who was once  honored by the Democratic Party in  Los Angeles as its Man of the Year.  So what was it about Ken Edwards  that sets him apart,  that makes us  want to stand here and put his life  before our colleagues  as  something  very special and very important.  For one thing, Ken Edwards devoted  his life not to himself, but to others.  He had  the  intelligence,  the dedica tion, the capacity to make a substan tial amount of money and live com fortably,  without  controversy.  He  chose instead to spend his life in social  work and public service.  As Ken's wife, Sue, describes him:  Ken was  a  social worker-a  social  worker who entered politics to contin ue his social work. And he did it well.

1551,997,18,Mr. DOLE.,"  I  thank  the  distin guished Presiding Officer, the Presi dent pro tempore, Senator THuRMoND  of South Carolina.  Under the standing order, the lead ers will have 10 minutes each followed  by special orders for Senators HAwKINS,  PROXMIRE, MURKOWSKI, BRAD LEY. and McCoNNELL for not to exceed  5 minutes each.  Routine morning business will not  extend beyond the hour of 10:30 a.m.,  with Senators permitted to speak for  no more than 5 minutes each.  Between 9:30 and 10:30, hopefully,  we can make some decision on cloture  on product liability.  It is still my hope that we can com plete action on  the Commodity Fu tures Trading Commission authoriza tion  legislation.  I  know  they were  working last evening, the staff repre senting Members on both sides of the  aisle,  to  see  if  they could combine  some  of  the  amendments  because  there are Members on each side who  want to offer pretty much the same  amendment on grain quality, for ex ample.  Senator MELCHER has an amendment  which can be accepted and Senator  McCoNNELL has an amendment which  can be accepted.  We would still like to dispose of that  piece of legislation and then perhaps  move to FIFRA, which is another im portant  piece  of  legislation which  should be disposed of.  On that there could be an amend ment by Senator BoREN, if he decides  not to offer it on the CFTC legislation.  In any event,  I would say before  midafternoon  it would be my hope  that we could turn to drug legislation.  We hope  to have an opportunity to  meet sometime this morning with the  principals who  have  been  involved  with their staffs for the last couple of  weeks. That would include myself, the  distinguished minority  leader,  and  others who might  be  designated.  There  is a  lot of work going on by  members of our staffs on each side of  the aisle.  We hope we can agree on 90 percent  of the package. There is no disagree ment from the standpoint of Republi cans or Democrats. We do not believe  ours will be a perfect solution, but we  do believe that it is time for us to act.  We would  like  to start that process  today.  In my view,  the drug problem can  only be solved by a full-scale biparti san attack. That  is why we  looked  carefully at all proposals and then di vided negotiators into five bipartisan  working groups. They have been work ing within these groups.  One group is education, prevention,  and treatment. The second group is ju diciary and justice related issues. The  third group is  interdiction of supply.  The  fourth  group  is  international  issues. The final group  is  leadership  issues and floor amendments.  The  initial meeting was held  last  Friday  afternoon  and  they  have  reached, we believe, a fair consensus.  We believe that most, if not all, Sena tors can agree to cosponsor and whole heartedly support the package at the  outset. However, as with any compre hensive package,  some major  issues  must be decided on the Senate floor.  At  least at  this  time, we have not  reached a compromise on such issues  as  the death penalty,  the so-called  drug czar, the exclusionary rule, drug  testing and a  few others. So in the  course of this deliberation-today, to morrow,  and  possibly  Saturday-!  hope we can resolve these outstanding  issues.  Again, Mr. President,  I suggest  to  my colleagues that we do not have a  great deal of time left. I hope we are  in the final 7 or 8 days of legislative  business this year. I do believe there is  some hope that we can conclude our  business by October 3.  The one matter we would  like  to  take up early  today  is  the so-called  Daniloff resolution sponsored by Sena tors HUMPHREY and MOYNIHAN. It is  my understanding now that they have  agreed to certain modifications in the  resolution which will make it accepta ble to nearly everyone on both sides  and at least let us bring it up as a free standing resolution. Otherwise, I am  advised by Senator HUMPHREY that he  will offer it as an amendment to what ever might be pending on the Senate  floor.  Mr. President, I reserve the remain der of my time.  RECOGNITION OF THE  MINORITY LEADER  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  ANDREWS). Under the previous order,  the Democratic leader is recognized.  ",1986
1552,997,18,Mr. BYRD., I thank the Chair.  SUPPORT FOR THE PHILIPPINES  ,1986
1553,997,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, President  Corazon Aquino has now returned to  the Philippines, after an inspiring visit  to the United States. Her remarkable  presentation to Congress was an elo quent testimony to the powerful well springs of democracy which exist in  her island nation, and which survived  and finally prevailed under extremely  trying and difficult circumstances.  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.  ",1986
1554,1049,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., It is so  that a Senator would have to be recog nized to ask for the yeas and nays.  ,1986
1555,1049,18,Mr. BYRD.," I thank the Chair.  The Constitution gives any Senator  the right to ask for the yeas and nays  on any question and he is entitled to  have the yeas and nays if one-fifth of  those Senators present signify  that  they support that call for the yeas and  nays. But  if he  does  that,  under  today's ruling, that is one speech. If  he asks for the yeas and nays twice, he  has made his two speeches.  that  logical? Does  that make  sense, that a Senator who asks for the  yeas and nays on a given matter, to  which he is entitled if supported by  one-fifth of Senators present, under  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States-which  is on a much higher  plane than the rules of the Senate or  the precedents of the Senate-then, is  he going  to  render himself further  speechless on a matter that may be vi tally important to his State? No State  shall be deprived of equal representa tion in the Senate without its own con sent. Is he, by virtue of the fact that  he asked for the yeas and nays twice  unable to speak on a matter vital to  his State, thus denying representation  for his State?  The majority  leader may  say,  ""I  move that the Sergeant at Arms be in structed to request the attendance of  absent Senators."" The majority leader  may then say, ""I ask for the yeas and  nays."" He has made two speeches? Is  that what we are being told?  ",1986
1556,1049,18,Mr. HART., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,1986
1557,1049,18,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, I am happy to yield.  ",1986
1558,1049,18,Mr. HART., Is it the contention of  the Senator from West Virginia that  the precedent cited by the Chair is in correct  or  that  the  interpretation  placed upon  that precedent by  the  Chair is incorrect?  ,1986
1559,1049,18,Mr. BYRD.," I am saying that, No. 1,  it is not a precedent.  The Chair is referring not to prece dents. The Chair is referring, rather,  to an opinion expressed by a previous  Chair in response to a parliamentary  inquiry. That is not a precedent. I am  saying, furthermore, that the interpre tation based upon the nonprecedent is  incorrect, and illogical.  I shall read this paragraph on page  626 which the Chair has cited:  If Senator HoLLINGS had had  the  floor and had spoken, let us say, for 2  U  a Senator in possession of the floor  yields to another Senator to make a motion  to recess or makes such a motion himself he  would  lose  the floor, and would have no  prior right to recognition, and if recognized  again, it would be his second speech.  minutes, 3 minutes, 10 minutes or 15  minutes-whatever  it was-and  he  yields to another Senator to make a  motion to recess, or makes the motion  himself, he would  indeed  lose  the  floor, and he would have indeed made  a  speech, but the motion  to recess,  standing alone, would not, in and only  of itself, constitute a speech. If he has  the floor and speaks for an hour and a  half and then puts in a quorum, of  course, he has made a speech.  Or he speaks for 20 minutes and  yields to me on another matter and I  put in a quorum call, of course he has  made a speech. No one would argue  that he has not done so.  But for the Senator simply to stand  and say, ""Mr. President, I ask for the  yeas and nays on this question,"" who  in the name of common sense would  maintain  that  that  request  for  the  yeas and nays-which he has a right  to make under the Constitution of the  United States, the organic law which  created  this  Senate-constitutes  a  speech?  I hope the Senators will think about  this carefully, because",1986
1560,1049,18,Mr. METZENBAUM., Will  the mi nority leader yield for a question?  ,1986
1561,1049,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I do not  have  to  ask unanimous consent  to  yield to the distinguished Senator if  he is going to ask a question. I have  not taken my hour.  ",1986
1562,1049,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., There  will be no objection.  ,1986
1563,1049,18,Mr. METZENBAUM.," If we  follow  this procedure, that any kind of recog nition is tantamount to a speech, is it  not the fact that the majority leader,  as well as the minority leader, in their  responsibilities are called upon day in  and day out to seek recognition not  only 2 times but 22  times in connec tion with a matter? And that any Sen ator seeing fit to do so could totally tie  the Senate up in knots and tie up the  leadership, preclude  them  from  ac cepting their responsibilities? Does not  the minority leader believe that would  be the case?  ",1986
1564,1049,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, there is  no question  in my mind  that  this  ruling would be  a  ball  and chain  around both hands and both feet of  any leader, in addition to having a gag  thrust in his throat. No leader could  lead the Senate if this ruling is going  to stand. If what is being maintained  by the Chair, and I say this with all  respect to the Chair-and the distin guished Senator in the Chair at the  moment is there by reason of having  answered the call to preside. I answer  by simply saying, yes, that would be a  serious impairment to the leaders and  to managers of bills, and to any Sena tor who wishes to offer an amendment  and is required repeatedly to explain  or defend his amendment.  0 1350  ",1986
1565,1049,18,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Another ques tion I would then pose to the minority  leader is, so far as the Chair's ruling as  based  upon  the  Parliamentarian's  advice would put the Senate in a very  tight bind and one  that  I  believe  would totally frustrate the ability to  run this body in an orderly fashion,  does the minority leader have an opin ion as to how the Senate might act in  order to make it clear that recognition  for the yeas and nays, or for a quorum  call, or for any one of number of other  issues, might be resolved and make it  clear that that is not the position of  this body? I am wondering if the mi nority leader, who  is unquestionably  the most renowned authority on the  Senate  rules we have  in  this body,  could suggest how we might clarify  the situation?  ",1986
1566,1049,18,Mr. BYRD.," Yes, by appealing the  Chair's ruling. In a few minutes I am  going  to  suggest  the absense of a  quorum so that I can read the tran script. I want to see what the facts are.  I was not on the floor when the situa tion developed. I want to see if the dis tinguished Senator from South Caroli na was  indeed making a speech. He  has indicated he was not. I will take  his word for it. But the transcript I  want to read. Was he indeed making a  speech,  after which  he  put  in  a  quorum. That is one  thing. But he  says he was not making a speech. He  got recognition and suggested the ab sence of a quorum and then at a later  time he was speaking and someone in  the middle of the speech called for the  regular order. It is appropriate for an other Senator to ask for the regular  order even in the middle of a Senators'  speech. If then he  is charged with  having made  a  second  speech  and  therefore he cannot proceed because  the Chair rules that he has already  made two speeches, why then, I want  to see by the transcript just what it  was all about.  But it will have to be challenged if it  is  the ruling by the Chair that the  Senators' call for a quorum, in and of  itself and standing alone constituted a  speech. That cannot be allowed  to  remain unchallenged.  ",1986
1567,1049,18,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  I  thank  the  minority leader. As a matter of fact,  when the Senator from South Caroli na was involved in this issue, the Sena tor from Ohio suggested the absence  of a quorum and then learned, to my  total surprise after inquiry of the Par liamentarian,  that  that  constituted  one speech. And I am frank  to say  that I have been on this floor for a  number of years and  involved  in a  number of parliamentary debates and  issues and, to the best of my recollec tion, I have never heard of a ruling  that  suggesting  the  absence  of  a  quorum, or asking for the yeas and  nays, or any one of a number of other  ",1986
1568,1062,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  decision of the Chair does not stand as  the judgment of the Senate.  ,1986
1569,1062,18,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I move  to reconsider the vote.  ",1986
1570,1062,18,Mr. BIDEN.,  I move  motion on the table.  The motion to lay on the table was  agreed to.  HOLLINGS  addressed  Chair.  ,1986
1571,1062,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from South Carolina.  ,1986
1572,1062,18,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  apologize for talking too long today.  It is the intent of the distinguished  Senator from Wisconsin and myself to  move to a motion to proceed  ",1986
1573,1062,18,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President,  I make  the point of order that the Senate is  not in order. We cannot hear the dis tinguished Senator from South Caroli na.  ",1986
1574,1062,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator  is  correct. Those Senators  who are conversing in the aisles will  please retire to the cloakroom.  ,1986
1575,1062,18,Mr. HOLLINGS.," I thank the Chair.  Mr. President,  it  is our  intent  to  move to a motion to proceed and get a  rollcall vote very promptly.  In that spirit, I ask unanimous con sent that the following documents be  printed in the REcoRD: a  letter from  the American Bar associatbn, which I  was  in  the process of  reading  this  morning, dated August 11,  1986;  a  letter from the American Bar Associa tion dated September 24; a letter from  Public Citizen, Consumer Federation  of America, Consumer's Union, and  the U.S.  Public  Interest Research  Group, dated September 24; a  letter  from  the American  Federation  of  Labor and Congress of Industrial Or ganizations, dated September 23, 1986,  and the testimony of Ernest Dubester;  a paper entitled ""Fifteen Fallacies of  Product Liability Reform.''  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  REcoRD, as follows:  AMERICAN BAR AsSOCIATION,  Washington, DC, August 11, 1986.  Hon. STRoM THuRMoND,  Chairman,  Committee on the Judiciary,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: It is our understand ing that your Committee has expressed in terest in considering the proposed ""Product  Liability Reform Act"" that was ordered re ported June 26, 1986, from the Senate Com mittee on Commerce, Science and Transpor tation. We take this opportunity to tell you  of our strong opposition to this bill or any  other broad federal legislation pre-empting  state product liability laws.  The American Bar Association opposes  such legislation because it believes that the  area of tort and insurance law is one which  traditionally and appropriately has been  handled at the state, not the national, level.  Product liability laws have evolved histori cally from  the common law developed by  state courts and supplemented by state leg islation. This gradual, state-by-state evolu tion of product liability law attests to one of  the basic values inherent in our system of  federalism, namely, that local communities  in most situations are best able to regulate  the day-to-day conduct of their citizens and  are in the best position to address their spe cific social and economic needs.  Broad pre-emptive legislation such as the  Commerce Committee proposal would intro duce uncertainty and instability in the area  of state product liability laws-results exact ly contrary to the stated purpose of the pro posed legislation. The current laws in each  state have been carefully crafted and re fined over the decades. In contrast, a new,  untested system of  laws would  inevitably  result in a rash of litigation in an effort to  interpret it.  We have given serious consideration  to  ""reform"" proposals in the product liability  area and have not taken a position of blan ket opposition to all federal legislation in  this area. We would support, for example,  federal legislation dealing with occupational  diseases with long latency periods, when the  number of such claims and the liability for  such damages in fact threaten the solvency  of a significant number of manufacturt;rs  engaged  in  interstate commerce, and  the  number of such claims has become clearly  an excessive burden on the judiciary. Simi larly, we would support federal legislation  allocating product  liability  risks between  the federal government and its contractors  and providing, in certain instances, indemni ty against those risks. We are continuing to  study this whole area to see if other por tions of the product liability laws should be  appropriately addressed at the federal level.  However, we cannot support  legislation  which would sweep aside  the decades of  careful legal drafting which has taken place  in the fifty states in the product liability  area and replace it with a sweeping new na tional  standard. Such  federal  legislation  may seriously  impair the rights of  those  who have been injured and the consuming  public generally by introducing great uncer tainty and confusion into a judicial system  that, with rare exception, has been working  on the state level in a sound and rational  way.  We urge you  to vote against  the Com merce Committee proposal when and if your  Committee considers this bill.  Sincerely,  WILLIAM W. FALSGRAF.  AMERICAN BAR AsSOCIATION,  GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS OFFICE,  Washington, DC, September 24, 1986.  Re S. 2760, board Federal product liability  legislation.  DEAR SENATOR: Yesterday on the Senate  floor during debate on S.  2760, Senator  Kasten stated that ""most lawyers support  some kind of bill"" on product liability. We  believe this is misleading.  The ABA, with a membership of approxi mately 320,000 lawyers, supports federal leg islation in two discrete areas of the product  liability  law. However, we  have opposed  broad  federal product  liability  legislation  such as S. 2760 since February 1981 when  th~ ABA went on record against such pro posals.  In February 1983,  the ABA's House of  Delegates  reconsidered  the matter  and  voted by a substantial majority to reaffirm  its earlier position of opposition  to broad  federal preemptive product liability legisla tion. At that time, it also voted to approve  two recommendations supporting federal at tention in two limited areas: litigation in volving certain latent occupational diseases,  and the question of how to allocate liability  risks between the federal government and  its contractors.  The  approximately  380-member  ABA  House of Delegates, which is carefully struc tured to represent all aspects of the Bar,  thoroughly studied all facets of this matter  before making its decisions on this issue in  1981 and 1983.  Operating in a manner similar to the U.S.  Congress, our House of Delegates is the leg islative body for the ABA. The House of  Delegates  represents  not  only  various  groups within the Association but also the  legal profession as a whole. Its membership  is made up of delegates elected by Associa tion members in each state, delegates from  every state bar association, the larger local  bar associations, other national organiza tions of the legal profession and delegates  elected by the ABA Assembly and the ABA  Sections.  Enclosed is a letter from our Immediate Past President setting forth our reasons for  opposing broad Federal product liability leg islation.  Sincerely,  ROBERT D. EvANS.  SEPTEMBER 24, 1986.  DEAR SENAToR: We are writing to clarify  the consumer organizations' position on the  product liability legislation currently pend ing before  the Senate. Contrary  to  the  claims of some proponents of S. 2760, we  continue to find that numerous provisions  of the bill and of the Kasten substitute even without caps on recoveries-would evis cerate vital consumer protections of current  product liability law.  Like S. 2760, the Kasten substitute would  tip the balance of current law firmly against  consumers  by  denying  victims  adequate  compensation and weakening incentives to  produce  safe products. Specifically, both  proposals would;  partially repeal the doctrine of joint and  several liability and thus deny some victims  who happened to be injured by more than  one wrongdoer  the  full compensation  to  which they were legally entitled:  offer some manufacturers, particularly  general aviation and pharmaceutical manu facturers, unjustifiable protection from pu nitive damages;  limit the liability of sellers of dangerous ly defective products notwithstanding  the  crucial  role  that product sellers play  in  bringing products, both safe and unsafe, to  the market;  preclude  absolutely people  injured by  faulty equipment more  than 25 years old  from recovering anything at all for their in juries.  Our goal has long been to provide consum ers injured by dangerously defective prod ucts fair compensation in a speedy and effi cient way. Unfortunately, the Kasten sub stitute would not create an effective mecha nism for meeting these goals.  Thank you for your consideration in this  matter.

1576,1088,18,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, the  city of Cerritos, CA has forwarded to  my office a copy of a moving and elo quent indictment of the Federal A via tion Administration's prolonged avoid ance of deciding to issue a rule to re quire  altitude  encoded  transponder  equipment on all light aircraft, par ticularly  aircraft  entering  terminal  control areas.  Cerritos suffered a  terrible tragedy  when an Aeromexico jet and a  light  aircraft collided over the city on Sep tember 2.  The Cerritos  tragedy  is  the  third  midair  collision  over California  in  recent years. This time we must accept  the lesson that heavy commercial jet  traffic  and  light  private  aircraft  simply do not mix safely without alti tude encoded  transponders or some  onboard  or  air-to-ground  collision  avoidance system. If such equipment is  found by experts not to be an answer  then another answer must be found at once. Among the answers we must  consider promptly are:  Equipping the FAA with sufficient  computer capacity to handle the traf fic encountered at congested airports.  Adding  increased numbers  of  air  traffic controllers.  Rehiring controllers fired in 1981 on  a selective basis if that is necessary to  bring the FAA's strength up  to the  level  required  to keep our airways  safe.  Imposing temporary restrictions on  air traffic at crowded airports until  the FAA can install equipment and  personnel necessary to do its job.  The innocent traveling public, flight  personnel aboard commercial planes,  pilots on private planes and those who  accompany  them, and  the  residents  living  in areas of heavy air  traffic  must no long carry the risks resulting  from the failures of the Federal Avia tion Agency and Congress to act deci sively  to stop avoidable midair colli sions between  commercial  jets and  light privately operated aircraft.  I am encouraged.  therefore, by re ports that FAA Administrator Donald  Engen may reconsider the position of  the FAA against requiring altitude en coded transponders on all aircraft en tering terminal control areas.  I encourage all segments of the avia tion industry and the general public to  participate in solving the critical need  for collision avoidance systems. The  starting point must be to avoid midair  collisions. All parties share a common  interest in achieving this objective.  The resolution adopted by the Cerri tos City Council asks for support for  H.R.  3805,  introduced  in December  1985 in the House of Representatives  by Congressman BoB DoRNAN. The bill  requires the FAA to promulgate stand ards for an airborne collision avoid ance system within 1 year of enact ment. I send to the desk a copy of the  bill and ask for its appropriate refer ral.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of the bill and the motion adopt ed by the city council of the city of  Cerritos on September 18, be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 2877  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  ""(1)""  SEc. 2. Section 312(c) of the Federal Avia tion Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1353(c)), which  relates  to  research  and development,  is  amended by  inserting  immediately  after ""(c)"" and by adding at the end thereof  the following new paragraph:  ""<2> In carrying out his functions, powers,  and duties under this section pertaining to  aviation safety, the Secretary of Transpor tation shall coordinate and take whatever  steps necessary <including research and de velopment> to promulgate standards for an  airborne collision avoidance system for all  United States aircraft, civil and military, to  improve aviation safety. The Secretary of  Transportation  shall  promulgate  such  standards within one year after the date of  enactment of this Act. Such standards shall  require that such collision avoidance system  be designed""(A) to give aircraft pilots clear and unam biguous instructions concerning maneuvers  to be undertaken or avoided to prevent a  mid-flight collision with other aircraft;  ""<B>  totally  independent of any  ground-based equipment and ground sta tions and able to function in any remote or  other area without the need for communica tion with ground-based equipment;  ""(C)  to permit modification of the per formance of such system by the pilot  in  command of  the aircraft  in which such  to be  is  installed at the option of such  system  pilot;  ""<D>  to prevent  the  functions of such  system being modified in any way by signals  sent  from  any  ground-based  system or  equipment:  ""<E> so that such system can be manufac tured and sold at a cost which the Secretary  of Transportation determines is sufficiently  reasonable so that its use on all such air craft would not  impose an unreasonable  burden on air carriers and other owners and  operators of aircraft;  ""<F> so that it shall not be incompatible  with the air traffic control system; and  ""(G) so that it shall be adequate to pro tect  a  small  aircraft  from  a  similarly  equipped small private or military aircraft.""  MOTION ADoPTED BY CITY OF CERRITOS CITY  COUNCIL, SEPTEMBER 18, 1986  History does repeat itself. It is also true  that we are doomed to repeat our mistakes  if we do not learn from them.  Time and the cruelties of chance selected  Cerritos to drive home those two truths. Be cause  the  aviation  industry-and  the  public-failed to learn from the mid-air col lision above the City of Whittier in 1975 and  again in 1978 in San Diego, history has once  again repeated itself. In each case, altimeter  encoded  transponders  that would  have  made the light planes and their altitudes  visible to radar were not in use. As a result,  we in Cerritos are left with immeasurable  loss and grief.  In 1975, and again in 1978 following the  mid-air collision of a PSA airliner and a  light plane, many levels of aviation interests  unleashed an avalanche of responses; much  of it designed to disarm the public below:  Our aviation system is too complicated to  be understood by laymen, they said.  It isn't necessary for radar to detect all  aircraft because TCA's <terminal control  areas> established by  the FAA will keep  commercial and private aircraft separated  from each other, the experts said.  The public was told 3-D type radar used  by the military to track uncooperative air craft would be in airport service in a few  years.  We were also told that altitude encoding  transponders on all aircraft would  flood  radar screens and prevent traffic controllers  from doing their job.  Those things were said 10 years ago. They  are being said again today. It is  time for  sleight-of-mouth  assurances  to  stop  and  meaningful action to BEGIN. it is time for  those altitude enconding transponders to be  required on ALL planes flying in metropoli tan areas. The Federal Aviation Trust Fund  has amassed over $8 billion which could be  used to help implement such action. The  fund was created to assist aviation safety by  levying an $8 charge on each airline ticket  purchased.  While this City Council does not have the  authority to act directly, it does have the  authority of the people to demand action.  We have the authority-and the responsibil ity-to demand and keep demanding until  Congress and the Federal Aviation Adminis tration take action.  I, therefore. move that the Cerritos City  Council:  (1) Go on record in support of requiring  that all general aviation aircraft flying in  metropolitan areas be equipped with opera ble  altimeter  encoded  transponders  and,  that all local control towers be empowered  to deny permission for takeoffs or landings  ",1986
1577,1101,18,Mr. CARR.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is my  honor  to host  the Reverend Chuck  Patterson as the guest chaplain. Rev erend Patterson hails from, originally,  Charlotte, NC. He and his lovely wife  Irene have lived in Pontiac, MI, for  the  last 13  years where he  is  the  pastor at the Apostolic Church in Pon tiac and is well known as a leader in  our community. He helped develop the  Child Development Center in Pontiac  in  connection with  the  Apostolic  Church. Through this center he has  helped shape the future of many chil dren in our area. He has served many  elected officials, and he has  in fact  served in the city government of Pon tiac giving of his time to further repre sentative government.  Mr. Speaker, he is my friend and he  is an inspiration to those of us in the  Pontiac area. I look forward to intro ducing him to my many colleagues.  H.R.  4142, THE GENERAL AVIA TION TORT REFORM ACT OF  1986  <Mr. WHITTAKER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
1578,1101,18,Mr. WHITTAKER.," Mr. Speaker, for  roughly a decade the issue of product  liability reform has been debated  in  the Congress. While we debate  this  issue, American  industries are being  overwhelmed  by  product  liability  awards that are beyond reason. The  general  aviation  industry has been  particularly hard hit.  The U.S. general aviation industry is  experiencing its most severe recession  in history. The industry delivered only  2,033 airplanes  in 1985 compared  to  17,811 units in 1978. In 1985, the in dustry recorded a trade deficit of $481  million. These are not simply abstract  numbers; what they mean is a loss of  jobs for American workers.  The major general aviation manu facturers are currently experiencing  66 percent unemployment. Two-thirds  of the jobs in this industry have been  lost. Since 1980, 15,000 jobs have been  lost in Wichita, KS, alone.  According  to  the Department  of  Commerce, one of the primary causal  factors behind  the  industry's down turn is the cost of the product liability  system. In 1985, industry cost for prod uct liability exposure was $70,000 for  each airplane built and delivered. Pro jections for 1986  indicate this figure  will go over $100,000 per airplane. It  should be noted that for the general  aviation industry, this is not an insur ance problem. These manufacturers  are almost totally self-insured for the  primary layers of insurance coverage.  If action is not taken to reform the  product liability laws, the general avia tion industry could be totally devastat ed. Therefore, I am supporting H.R.  4142 which provides for sector specific  reform of product liability laws.  H.R. 4142 addresses, in an equitable  manner, the three areas  to  tort law  that have given the general aviation  manufacturers particular difficulties.  First, the bill provides a Federal uni form law on aviation product liability.  Second, it eliminates joint and several  liability, except for liability for defects  in airplanes or their parts. Finally, it  prohibits actions for injuries caused by  products that are beyond their useful  lives.  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is essential  that Congress act on this legislation  during this session. The general avia tion industry and its employees cannot  afford  to  listen  to Congress discuss  this issue for another 10 years.  MR. NAKASONE, AN APOLOGY IS  IN ORDER  <Mr. MITCHELL  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1986
1579,1101,18,Mr. MITCHELL.," Madam Speaker, I  would hope that my colleagues may be  able to hear me.  Madam Speaker, I am a black man  and Nakasone of Japan holds that I  am intellectually inferior because I am  black.  Madam Speaker, I hold that I am his  intellectual superior. I have a myriad  of facts and data stored in my mind. I  have a catholicity of interests.  I understand the Guaranteed Agree ment on Trade and Tariffs.  I know  what the law of diminishing returns  means in terms of economic productiv ity.  I have a knowledge that the medical  world no longer looks with favor on a  lobotomy, a lobectomy or leukotomy. I  know  that Brahms wrote  four sym phonies, Gustav Mahler wrote nine. I  know the difference between the Lie bestod and the Liebeslied, and I do not  think Mr. Nakasone knows that. I hold  that I am his intellectual superior. I  want  to use my superior  talents,  I  hope,  to persuade all blacks and mi norities to stop buying Japanese-made  the gentle cars. If he holds that we are inferior,  then we should not use his products.  I would also hope that this House  will not take that insult gratuitously  imposed on black and Hispanic people,  imposed by Mr. Nakasone of Japan.  Madam Speaker, I would hope that  this House would show its outrage, its  absolute outrage and do that which is  appropriate to protect the dignity of  those of us in this House.  Nakasone has got to remember that  it was the Black Caucus that support ed reparations for the Japanese-Amer icans in this country who were treated  so badly during World War II.  Mr. Nakasone, does that show intel lectual inferiority?  ",1986
1580,1101,18,Mr. MATSUI.," Madam Speaker, will  the gentleman from Maryland yield?  ",1986
1581,1101,18,Mr. MITCHELL., I yield to the gen tleman from California.  ,1986
1582,1101,18,Mr. MATSUI.,"  I  thank  man for yielding.  Madam Speaker,  I would  like  to  adopt each and every one of the sen tences,  the remarks that the gentle man from Maryland has just made.  You know, it was very interesting; 2  years ago when the Democrats had a  caucus in West Virginia and Mr. Lee  Iacocca spoke before our Democratic  caucus and made some comments that  I viewed as somewhat racist,  it was  people like P ARREN MITCHELL, MICKEY  LELAND, ESTEBAN TORRES WhO came to  me and said, ""We think what Lee Ia cocca said was outrageous.""  Now,  I  think what Mr. Nakasone  said was outrageous, too.  They are, in Japan, a very closed so ciety;  they discriminate against  the  Koreans,  the Filipinos, and a  lot of  other groups, and for them to make  racist remarks against the people of  our great country who have made this  country the great Nation that it is, to  me is outrageous.  I would  just like  to commend the  gentleman and wholeheartedly agree  with his condemnation of the Prime  Minister of Japan.  ",1986
1583,1101,18,Mr. DAUB.," Madam Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1986
1584,1101,18,Mr. MITCHELL., I yield to the gen tleman from Nebraska.  ,1986
1585,1101,18,Mr. DAUB.," I  thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Madam Speaker, may I say to my  good  friend and colleague  that this  House should stand and applaud what  the gentleman from Maryland says. I  think we owe our country and we owe  Mr. MITCHELL  a  round of applause  from this Chamber, and we all ought  to agree with every word that he has  said.  ",1986
1586,1101,18,Mr. MITCHELL., I thank the gentle man for his comments.  ,1986
1587,1127,18,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Madam Speaker,  I yield 3 minutes  to  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. RANGEL].  ",1986
1588,1127,18,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise in support of the tax reform bill  and I vigorously oppose the consideration of a motion to recommit. The  motion to recommit means that the  bill goes back to committee and then  we  have  to  get  together  and  see  whether or not we can redraft a new  tax bill.  When this bill first was being con ceived,  I  thought, what a wonderful  opportunity for Democrats to be able  to go into their districts and to cam paign for a reform bill, to take advan tage of that fact that when the Presi dent first introduced his Economic Re covery Tax Act, everyone got a tax cut  except the working poor, and for the  rich and for the corporations the abili ty to shelter their income was right  out here and I thought, my God, what  a big Republican giveaway.  But is  it not  ironic now that this  same President has come  to us, not  only  to close  the  loopholes, but  to  make certain that the working poor  who have been sucked into this tax  system, that have been held hostage  for 6 years, are relieved of the burden  of having  to pay Federal  taxes and  that the rich,  the wealthy, and the  profitable  corporations would  once  again pay some contribution  to  the  debt of this Nation.  I am suggesting to you that I believe  that the President, by joining hands  with the leaders of both the House  and the Senate, by having the gentle man from  lllinois, Mr. DAN RosTEN KOWSKI, and our own gentleman from  Tennessee, Mr. JACK DUNcAN, working  together on the House side with Sena tor PACKWOOD and Senator LoNG have  produced a good bill. There are a lot of  things  in  this bill  that anyone who  wants an excuse to vote against it can  find.  But the option that we have is not  just voting for this bill, but by voting  for a motion to recommit; by voting  against this bill, what we are doing is  saying that we want this same corrupt  obscene tax system.  One of the worst things about this  current system is that we enjoy in this  great Nation of ours a voluntary tax  payment system, and yet everybody  knows somebody who  takes a great  amount of joy in explaining that not withstanding their income, that they  are able through creative accounting  to find the type of shelter that is not  based on any econoniic  incentive, so  that they will pay little or no taxes.  In this bill we have protected the  fringe pension benefits of the working  people. We have made it possible for  the overwhelming majority of Ameri can taxpayers not to have to file, not  to have to itemize on the long form,  but to just file a short form.  There are many Members that say  this bill should not be revenue neutral,  that we should have taken advantage  of this opportunity to raise the funds  and reduce the deficit. The last time I  heard something like this, there was a  guy named Fritz Mondale, and nobody  in this House thought that that idea  was good then and we have another  election year and I have not found any  Member who is willing to do it now.  I say vote against the motion to re commit and vote for this reform bill.  It is an historic occasion that we have  to take advantage of.  ",1986
1589,1127,18,Mr. DUNCAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New  Hampshire  [Mr.  GREGG],  a  member of the Ways and Means Com mittee.  ",1986
1590,1127,18,Mr. GREGG.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Tennessee  for recognizing me.  I think I should start by saying that  this bill clearly does not bottle light ning. It has some significant problems.  In my opinion, there are sections of  this bill which are going to create ex traordinary complexity in our tax law.  There are also, unfortunately, sections  of this bill which I would characterize  as staff-driven academic drivel; but on  balance, this bill accomplishes some of  our fundamental goals for tax reform.  First, it is fair. It creates a situation  where people of essentially the same  taxable income will pay approximately  the same amount of taxes.  Second, it dramatically cuts rates so  that people have a greater incentive to  be productive, so that people will go  out and earn that extra dollar because  they know they will be able to keep a  higher percentage of that extra dollar.  Third, it significantly  takes out of  the business of investment the policy  of  trying  to obtain  tax deductions.  One of the biggest problems we have  in  this  economy  today  is  that  too  many people invest for purposes of tax  deductions versus  investing  for pur poses of getting a real return on their  investments. This bill will go a  long  way toward correcting that. It is there fore in my opinion not an answer to  our dream, but rather a better bill  than what we presently have as reality  today. For that reason,  I endorse it  and I hope that it will pass.  ",1986
1591,1127,18,Mr. ARCHER.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield such time as he may consume to  the distinguished gentleman from Wy oming [Mr. CHENEY].  ",1986
1592,1127,18,Mr. CHENEY.," Madam Speaker, the decision  of whether to support or oppose H.R. 3838,  the so-called  tax  reform bill,  is one of  the  most difficult questions  I've faced during my  time  in Congress. Very  few people would  defend  the existing Tax Code or make  the  claim that it cannot be improved. The goal of  reform  is one that nearly everyone supports.  However,  the actual enactment of legislation  into  law requires us  to be  far more specific  about what we mean by reform, and I have re luctantly concluded  that H.R. 3838  fails  the  test.  Without question,  there are some positive  features  in  the bill.  I  like  the  idea of  lower  rates and fewer brackets. The move to close  some badly abused loopholes is a good one,  as is the imposition of an effective minimum  ",1986
1593,1140,18,Mr.  ROSTENKOWSKI.,"  Madam  Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen tleman from Louisiana [Mr. RoEMER].  ",1986
1594,1140,18,Mr. ROEMER.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank my colleague for yielding to me.  There are many weaknesses of the tax  bill. There always are. Tax bills are  like catching fish: 5 days later, they  both stink.  We are going to find things in the  bill in a week or a month or so that we  do not like. Even now, I resent the ret roactive provisions, the investment tax  credit, and capital gains provisions in  I  the bill, but I like the heart of the bill;  the heart of  the bill  is  solid and  strong: Lower marginal rates for all  Americans. You make the last dollar,  you get to keep it. That is what Amer ica is all about.  like the heart of the bill: Every body pays their fair share. The only  thing wrong with this bill is that we  did not have it 20 years ago. I like the  heart of the bill. It is progressive.  The gentleman just got up and said,  well, the rich are going to get off free.  Wrong. The top 10 percent of the tax payers in America pay 51 percent of  the taxes now. After this bill, they will  pay a higher percentage. This bill is  progressive, fair, and with lower mar ginal rates. It is what America is all  about.  Bad  parts,  yes. Wish we  could  change  them. But  if  I have got  to  measure an animal, I will take the one  with a good heart. Vote ""yes.""  ",1986
1595,1140,18,Mr. DUNCAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont [Mr. JEFFORDS].  ",1986
1596,1140,18,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Madam Speaker, I  certainly would like to echo the com ments of  the previous  speaker.  In  1981, I refused to back the tax reform  package as it had excessive and inequi table tax breaks, which I  felt would  lead to large deficits.  Like  everyone else,  I would have  written this bill differently. Yet I rise  in support of the bill. I represent Ver mont. This bill is good for Vermont.  Our average  income  is one of  the  lowest in the Nation. Overall, we will  receive $60 to $75 million in tax relief;  this increased disposable  income will  benefit all Vermont.  Vermont  is a small, small business  State, and will generally have  lower  business taxes. The loss of farm tax  shelters will have little direct effect on  Vermont. However, it will bring down  national milk production, especially in  the West and Southwest.  In addition, we have won the battle  to keep the tax deductibility of State  and local property and income taxes.  Also, we have protected  the marble  and granite and second home indus tries.  The Vermont  vote  is  definitely  ""yes,"" and the national vote is ""yes,""  also.  Madam Speaker,  first,  I want to commend  the previous speaker, who  really did do a  memorable job of getting to the heart of this  issue.  Madam Speaker, I was the only Republican  Member-and one of only a few Members al together-who voted against the 1981 tax bill.  I feared that, with its excessive and inequita ble  tax breaks,  the changes would  lead  to  large deficits and public condemnation. It did.  Like just about everyone else here today,  I  also have problems with this bill. Unfortunate ly, we don't have, nor do we ever have, the  option of voting for a perfect bill. We have to  compare the conference report before us with  law. We are given no other option  current  today.  In the absence of a perfect bill, I reluctantly  support this tax bill because  I represent the  State of Vermont and, compared  to present  law, this tax reform is good for my State. Ver mont's average per capita  income is one of  the  lowest  in  the Nation. On a per capita  basis, we are the most small business State in  the country. Vermont's tax commissioner esti mates  that Vermonters' Federal  taxes, as a  whole, will decrease by $60 to $75 million per  year. That  increased disposable  income will  benefit all Vermont.  Vermont businesses, like the rest of the Na tion's, will benefit from the substantial rate re ductions. With  its  repeal of  industry-specific  deductions and credits, the bill tends to tax all  industries more similarly, spreading  the  tax  burden more evenly among corporate taxpay ers. In an effort to guarantee that all profitable  corporations pay their fair share of taxes, the  drafters have designed a tough, minimum tax.  This stiff new  tax will  raise  revenues  from  wealthy individuals and corporations that cur rently escape paying any  taxes  through ma nipulation of the Tax Code. For the first time,  they will pay their fair share.  I am also pleased  that  this measure  re tained some provisions of current law that are  vital  to specific Vermont businesses. For in stance, the bill retains the depletion allowance  for Vermont's marble and granite  industries,  which  is  essential  to  their  survival.  The  second home  industry, so  important  to Ver mont, was spared a major loss when the tax  writers decided to retain the current deduction  of interest on mortgages on two personal resi dences. However,  individuals may no  longer  be able to deduct unlimited interest on many  residences,  thereby preventing abuse of this  provision.  It is unclear how the construction of vaca tion condominium residences will be affected  by the bill's passive loss limitations. The spe cial  rule  for rental activities, allowing  individ uals  to offset up  to $25,000 of nonpassive  income with losses from rental real estate ac tivities, should help  to assure an adequate  supply of  individual  investors. Many experts  feared that the passive loss provisions would  lead to an increase in rents and a shortage of  quality  low-income housing. The conference  agreement attempts  to prevent  this by cre ation of a special credit to encourage invest ment in this sector. I am concerned about the  retroactive  impact of the passive  loss provi sions on investments-particularly real estate  investments-made in good faith, and based  on the principles of existing law.  Because  of  the  reduction  in  rates,  the  repeal of the deduction  for long-term capital  gains was probably necessary  to avoid a  windfall to the wealthy taxpayers who realize  such gains. In my view, however, repeal of the  deduction should have been accompanied by  indexing of  the basis of capital assets  to  assure that taxpayers do not pay taxes on in creases in value due solely to inflation.  Among the provisions that I found troubling,  however, are  the arbitrage provisions. The  State of Vermont, as well as many  local  school districts, make use of arbitrage when  funding construction projects. This bill would  ",1986

1598,1153,18,Mr. MACK.," Madam Speaker, I think  I  am  probably,  like many  others,  really just making up our minds in the  last few hours.  The issues are very complicated, and  I think everyone has had the opportu nity to address those issues over the  past several hours of debate. But for  me, the decision had to be based on  the answer to this question, Will this  bill produce higher levels of economic  growth, and if so, why will that occur?  We have heard the concern about  the transfer of $120 billion to the cor porate side and what impact that will  have on our economy. The real ques tion is, Will lower marginal tax rates  on the individual side offset the drag  that has been created by the shifting  of the burden?  I believe the answer to that question  is, yes, they will, that the lower mar ginal rates will,  in fact, stimulate in vestment,  savings,  job creation, and  business formation.  The  reason  that I believe  that  is  that if you go back to the 1960's when  the country debated the Kennedy tax  cuts,  the argument was made  that  lower marginal tax rates will encour age savings, investment, job creation,  and business formation.  In the 1960's, only 2 percent of the  American  taxpayers of  this country  paid a marginal tax rate of 30 percent  or more. Today, over one-third of the  taxpayers in this country are in mar ginal tax rates of 30 percent or above.  So if you believe in the 1960's that we  stimulated economic activity because  of lower marginal rates, I would ask  you to think, what can we do today as  a result of lower marginal tax rates?  The answer is, we are going to stimu late the economy and we are going to  keep it moving. I urge you to vote for  tax reform.  ",1986

1600,1153,18,Mr. COATS.," Madam Speaker, let me  just say that while it is difficult in 1  minute to say all the things I want to  about this tax bill, I would like to ad dress one particular aspect of it.  This is a profamily tax bill. I intro duced, more than a year ago  in the  House of Representatives, H.R. 1551,  the Tax Fairness  for Families Act,  which doubled  the personal exemp tion. I am most pleased that the bill  before us today accomplishes the pur71...{)59 0-87-37 (Pt. 18)  poses of that bill. It raised the exemp tion  to $1,900 next year and up  to  $2,000 by 1988 and indexes it by the  year 1990.  This is the most significant, historic  piece of fairness for families  in this  country that we have ever achieved  through our tax law. I am proud of  the people who have worked so hard  to  support  this  particular  item.  I  thank them for including it in this his toric tax reform measure. The families  of America thank you and I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation  from  this very standpoint alone.  brings fairness to families.  ",1986
1601,1153,18,Mr. KEMP.," Madam Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1986
1602,1153,18,Mr. COATS., I yield to the gentle man from New York.  ,1986
1603,1153,18,Mr. KEMP.," Madam Speaker, I want  to join the gentleman in underscoring  the comments about  this bill being  profamily. Doubling  that exemption  for the family and every dependent of  every family is one of the most impor tant aspects of the tax bill and de serves the support of all Members.  I congratulate the gentleman from  Indiana [Mr. CoATS] for his leadership  in pushing this $2,000 dependent ex emption  forward  to success  for  the  American family.  COATS. Madam  thank the gentleman.  Speaker,  It  Mr.  I  In  the past,  families have been  the one  group,  the one special  interest,  if you will,  which does not have high-priced lobbyists and  interest groups  fighting  for  their welfare. At  long  last,  the impact of the American  family  has been weighed and considered in terms of  the Tax Code.  Over the past 35 years, real family income  has  increased by more  than 50 percent  in  constant dollars for one-income families, and  has nearly doubled  for  two-income  families.  But the increases in Federal income taxes for  all families has far outstripped the increases in  income. In 1948, the personal exemption was  set by Congress at $600 for each  taxpayer,  spouse, and dependent. By 1979, this exemp tion had been  raised  to $1 ,000; a $400  in crease over a  three-decade period. Finally,  this personal exemption has been indexed for  inflation since 1985.  However,  if  the personal exemption had  been indexed back to 1948, today it would be  worth about $2,600. This devaluation of the  personal exemption has caused  the Federal  tax burden to shift disproportionately onto the  backs of families with children.  We have  reliable estimates  that  it costs  more than $4,000 per child per year to raise  children at home. We have official U.S. Gov ernment statistics which say that for each ad ditional child  in a family, $2,027 is added to  the poverty threshhold  level that is used for  official statistical purposes and welfare benefit  purposes.  Madam Speaker, in the past 2 years, I have  received letters from every State in the coun try,  indicating considerable frustration, resent ment and discouragement among our families  ",1986
1604,1166,18,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Madam Speaker,  I will  vote no because after reading the Stockman  book, his bottom  line  is a government is  in  trouble if it raises 70 cents for every dollar it  spends. This bill continues the trouble. I wish  it  had  plugged  the  corporate  loopholes  opened  in 1981, period. Let me  talk a little  more  about what  revenue  neutral  really  means.  The 1986 tax reform is designed to be reve nue neutral, a startling  fact  in  the  face of  record Federal deficits. We, Democrats and  Republicans,  liberals and conservatives, are  afraid to raise revenue to pay for the level of  Government we claim is necessary.  But the revenue neutrality is deceptive. Only  the net result is revenue neutral.  Within the bill revenue is raised with some  changes in order to offset other changes.  The most disturbing change is the elimina tion of certain deductions in order to raise rev enue to offset the revenue  lost by curtailing  the progressive tax rates.  In other words,  in order to lower the rates  for upper income taxpayers, the bill eliminates  deductions-and thus increases the rates-for  many middle-income taxpayers.  Within the middle-income category,  the bill  is oddly skewed. The one-wage-earner family  benefits at  the expense of  the  two-earner  family and the single person.  In short, the bill shifts the tax burden from  upper  income  to middle  income, and within  middle income to certain taxpayers whose life style the administration does not approve off.  As a result, I intend to vote against the bill.  Worst of all,  the bill  returns  the marriage  penalty tax we spent so many years trying to  get rid of.  The Reagan administration claims that the  bill supports the traditional family-the family  with  one wage  earner. Unfortunately,  that  family is neither traditional nor numerous. The  Census Bureau report that only 7 percent of  all families fit that mold.  ",1986
1605,1166,18,Mr. BROWN of California.," Madam Speaker,  we have before us the most comprehensive  piece of tax legislation in decades. If enacted,  as it appears that it surely will be, this legisla tion will affect nearly every segment of our so ciety. The sheer volume of the changes will  overwhelm Americans, many of whom have  already expressed their concern and dismay.  Unlike past ""reform"" movements,  this one  was unique for its very  lack of popular sup port.  It was as if we,  isolated in Washington,  forged  this  reform, but  forgot  to  inform  the  public. And what the public does know has  not been encouraging. Those of us who have  spent much of our time back  in our districts  since the conference report was agreed to in  mid-August have heard nothing but complaints  from our constituents.  Small businessmen don't understand  they  are  to afford  to understand  the extensive  changes in the Tax Code without the advice  and counsel of expensive accountants and  lawyers. Those people saving  for retirement  are bewildered by a government who, on the  one hand,  tells  them  that  they should  find  ways  to  supplement  their Social Security  checks, and at the same  time withdraws  in centives  to save. Parents wonder how  they  can afford  to send  their children  to college  without being able to deduct interest. Students  on scholarships are stunned to realize that the  same scholarship  this year as  last  is worth  considerably less because now it will be taxed  in part. And my constituents worry about a  provision which will give  favorable  treatment  to a proposed  tire-burning plant  in my dis trict-a district with some of the worst air pol lution in the Nation.  While these are troublesome areas, this bill  is not without its merits. In fact, such a com prehensive and extensive measure as this is  bound to have both positive and negative ele ments. On the positive side, it will take 6 mil lion  taxpayers off  the  tax  rolls. For  these  Americans  it may mean  the difference be tween  just barely getting by and getting by.  For millions more working poor Americans,  mostly women and their children, this tax bill  will substantially reduce their tax liability. For  the  first  time since 1980,  the  tax  threshold  (when one brings paying taxes) will be above  the poverty level.  For nonitemizers, nearly  two-thirds of all  taxpayers,  the changes in  the tax bill will be  significant. The personal exemption will be in creased from $1,130 to $2,000 by 1989. The  standard deduction, also known as  the zero  bracket amount and calculated  into  the  tax  tables, will be significantly increased. More im portantly, heads of households will be treated  more  like married couples with dependents  than as singles, as they are now. Finally, the  earned  income  tax  credit,  used  to  offset  Social Security taxes for the poorest taxpay ers, will be increased as well as have its eligi bility expanded. More  low-income  taxpayers  will benefit from the credit.  These benefits to the working poor will have  a significant impact on the majority of my constituents. The average  income  in  the 36th  Congressional District  is substantially below  the national average. Since the vast majority  of low-income individuals do not itemize, they  will surely benefit from these changes.  But though  they benefit in  the short term,  will they in the long run? This question is not  easily, nor unequivocally, answered. Given the  magnitude of the rate cuts at the top, main taining the present degree of progressivity in  terms of actual taxes paid is largely depend ent on several key reforms, most notably the  repeal of the capital gains preference and the  anti-tax-shelter rules. While the lobbyists con cerned with these issues seem to have more  or less accepted defeat in the current round, a  sustained effort  to  reverse some of the  re forms seems almost  inevitable next year.  If  these reforms are eroded, the main legacy of  the 1986 tax reform legislation will be a mas sive reduction in upper income tax rates.  Even if these reforms are not eroded, pro gressivity-an essential philosophical compo nent of our tax structure-may very well be.  Lost somewhere in the debate on tax reform  has been our concern for continued massive  budget deficits. One of  the primary goals  during this tax reform process has been reve nue neutrality. Meanwhile, our deficits contin ue to rise despite our efforts to reduce spend ing. The fact remains, however, that we simply  cannot reduce spending by $200 billion with out seriously damaging services to the Ameri can public and grinding our economy to a halt.  Eventually, in some manner, revenues will be  raised. But how?  This conference agreement has done an  excellent,  if not perfect,  job of closing  loop holes and eliminating many abusive tax shel ters. Yet its mistake is refusing to use the rev enue yield  from  this  to  reduce  the deficit  rather than reduce the tax rates. It will be ex tremely hard to raise revenues in future years  through  the  income  tax.  Instead, our only  other available options will be  increases  in  excise taxes or the imposition of new levies  such as energy taxes or a value-added  tax.  These options will be highly controversial and  highly unpopular, particularly since they tend  to place the heaviest burdens on those least  able to pay.  I am not opposed to wealth.  I could use a  little myself, as I'm sure we all could. But I do  believe that those well-off have an obligation  to pay  slightly more  for  the opportunities  which have been provided in our great Nation.  I would not want to see the concept of pro gressivity-those who earn more, pay more be abolished in the search for rate reduction.  I am also concerned about the possibility  that this tax bill could dampen the economic  climate. Not only does the bill shift $120 bil lion of the tax burden to business, it adversely  impacts educational  institutions-the  incuba tors of our economic future. Bond restrictions,  charitable contribution  limits,  taxation of the  nontuition portion of scholarships,  repeal of  the  interest deduction  for educational  loans,  pension reforms, and other items will all place  a financial stress on our higher education in stitutions. This administration has nickle and  dimed our education system  throughout  its  tenure. It has yet to understand its integral im portance to our Nation's well-being. I regret to  ",1986
1606,1179,18,Mr. BOLAND.," Madam Speaker,  the  time  has come to make a decision on tax reform.  For more  than a year,  this Congress has  wrestled with  the concept of tax reform. We  have found  that everybody is for tax reform,  as  long as  they are only supporting an ab stract concept. But when  it comes  time  to  consider  the specifics of a tax reform bill when  it becomes clear that some of the tax  loopholes we claim  to oppose are  treasured  by certain special interests-we discover that  some of the early supporters find reasons to  turn away.  No, this conference report is not perfect. No  tax bill has ever been perfect. No tax bill will  ever be perfect. But this legislation represents  real tax reform, more than has been achieved  by any prior act of Congress. Passage of this  measure will ensure that future investment de cisions of both individuals and businesses are  driven by sound economics  rather  than  advoidance. The minimum  tax provision will  require some taxpayers, who have in the past  shirked their responsibility to assume a share  of the financial burden associated with main taining this country, to join in that effort. By retax  moving 6 million low-income Americans from  the tax rolls, this measure will encourage their  continued participation in the work force and  promote the kind of independence from Gov ernment assistance we all profess to favor. Fi nally, by providing some tax relief to middle income  taxpayers,  the bill addresses one of  the central complaints about the existing Tax  Code;  that  it is a haven  for the rich, or for  those skillful enough to exploit its shortcom ings.  Mr. Speaker, the question each of us must  ask before casting our vote on the legislation  is whether the Tax Code it will create will be  more fair than the one under which we now  operate.  I believe  that  the answer  to  that  question  is yes. We have an opportunity  to  vote for fairness by voting for this conference  report, to vote for the kind of sweeping reform  we all said we wanted. It is an opportunity that  may not come again soon, and if we allow it  to pass us by, I do not believe that the Ameri can people will accept our explanation that we  were  for  tax  reform-but. All  the ""buts,"" all  the ""except tors,"" all of the ""instead of's"" that  are raised  in objection  to  this  legislation do  not, in my judgment, outweight the benefits it  will provide for the people of this Nation. The  time has come  to decide on  tax reform. Do  we want it or don't we? I believe that we do,  and  I urge  that  the  conference  report be  adopted.  ",1986
1607,1179,18,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Madam Speaker,  though  I  have concerns about several of the provisions  in this bill, I rise in support of the historic tax  reform measure  being  considered  by  the  House today. On balance, I believe this bill is  good for business, good for the economy, and  perhaps most importantly, good for the Ameri can family.  This bill is a giant step forward toward a fair  and equitable  tax system. For me,  fairness  always has been a preeminent concern when  it came to tax reform. I believe that tax reform  without fairness would be a disservice to all  Americans. With this bill we get fairness, and  that is why I am voting for it.  By passing this tax reform bill:  We make sure  that multinational corpora tions finally pay more in taxes than the police  officers on the street who risk their lives ev eryday protecting us.  We help out millions of single-parent fami lies, by making sure they're not stuck with a  big tax bill each year in addition to being stuck  with big bills for shoes, clothes, and rent.  We send a strong message to our Nation's  families-a message  that encourages home ownership,  charitable  giving,  and  makes  standard deductions and personal exemptions  more generous.  Finally, we say  ""thank you""  to American  workers  by  improving  pension  protection,  guaranteeing better benefits, and wider, more  equitable pension coverage for workers.  But this tax bill is not just a pro-family bill,  it's a pro-business bill as well.  It encourages  investment in productivity by closing down tax  shelters  that only promote  investments  that  have no economic merit. It encourages invest ment  in  research and development. And  it  allows  for business stability by discouraging  hostile corporate takeovers.  ",1986

1609,1192,18,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  this afternoon I plan to vote for this tax reform  legislation, but with some trepidation.  While I support the goal of tax reform, there  are some items in this legislation which give  me cause for concern. With legislation of this  magnitude, my fear is that as it is implement ed over the next few years we will be sur prised and concerned by some of its unintend ed effects and ramifications on certain individ uals and businesses. There is no doubt in my  mind that as further studies and analyses of  this legislation are completed over the coming  months, we will see  the need  for  legislation  making major technical corrections to this act.  Among my concerns about this legislation is  a belief that the conferees may have gone too  far in granting an inordinate number of transi tion  rules and special privileges. More  than  340 were granted while  thousands of others  were denied, with no apparent uniform criteria  to determine which were accepted.  Another concern is the retroactivity of many  portions of this legislation. In general, I object  to provisions of any  legislation  that become  effective prior to that legislation being signed  into law. Retroactive sections of this bill will  have a serious negative effect on Federal,  State, and local government employees plan ning to retire this year.  Other retroactive provisions will have a sig nificant impact on some businesses, industry,  and the real estate market.  Despite  these  concerns,  the  number of  positive provisions associated with this legisla tion outweigh the negative. When fully imple mented, this act will meet the originally stated  goals of the tax reform effort, namely to pro vide fairness, simplicity, and economic growth.  Individuals and corporations will no  longer  be able  to avoid paying  their  fair share of  taxes. The elimination of many  tax shelters  and a stiff, unescapable minimum tax, will pre vent total tax avoidance.  Older Americans, especially those living on  small,  fixed  incomes, will do better under a  system of lower tax rates. Many of those with  low incomes will be taken off the tax rolls en tirely.  Families will fare well under this legislation  which  increases the personal exemptions for  family members and lowers overall tax rates.  Six million more low income families will be re lieved of their tax burden entirely.  Although this legislation does not go as far  as  I might have  liked  in simplifying  the  tax  code and streamlining  the  income  tax  filing  process,  it does eliminate a large number of  exemptions and deductions that are beneficial  only to a small proportion of the American tax payers. This enables  the majority of Ameri cans to pay less in taxes and keep more of  their hard earned wages and income.  Finally,  lower tax rates and a deemphasis  on  tax avoidance will encourage economic  growth  in our Nation. Consumers will have  more money  in  their pockets  to purchases  goods and services or save for future needs.  Businesses will  be  encouraged  to  pursue  money-making rather than money-losing ven tures. Economists predict that, after the initial  transition period when  tax  reform  is  imple mented, there will be an increase in American  jobs, lower interest rates, and a period of sus tained economic growth.  If tax reform is to achieve its desired goals,  however, Congress must  resist  future  at tempts to reinstate many of the special breaks  and shelters which are to be eliminated. We  must also  remain committed  to maintaining  the new, lower tax rates as provided for in this  legislation. We cannot allow these lower rates  to be raised over time as an easy, new source  or revenue for the Federal Government.  And we must be sensitive to any unforseen  and  unintended  effects of  this  legislation.  Errors and problems associated with this leg islation should be studied and corrected early  in the next Congress to prevent apprehension  and hardship from having an adverse impact  on our economy. Technical corrections must  be made but should not be  the source  for  special favors or special interests.  Madam Speaker, this legislation is an over all good faith effort at tax reform and simplifi cation. While  there are some areas where  I  believe the bill could be improved, the legisla tion in general will benefit the great majority of  American  taxpayers who will realize a fairer,  simpler tax system and a smaller overall tax  bill.

We have  sent all these things over there.  In  the supplemental 2 years ago,  they had 340 amendments. Two years  ago,  they had 224 amendments. The  last continuing resolution, we had 135  amendments.  The  reason we have a  continuing  resolution here  is  that we sent  the  bills over there and they have not sent  them back.  So with the gentleman standing over  there, I wish he would talk to them a  little bit. If so, perhaps we would not  have this.  ",1986

Except to this point, this  extent:  First, defending our own institution.  I realize it is hard for the Appropria tions Committee to do its job, because  you have to wait on the Budget Com mittee, you have to wait on the au thorization  committees,  and  that  makes it almost impossible for you to  do your job.

1625,1231,18,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield further? I do not  want to worry the gentleman; I know  his is as sincere as we all are; but if we  were to follow what you say and, it is  so easy to speak in generalities; in this  bill you would strike out such pro grams as the National Health Service  Corps,  the Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Research Program-",1986
1626,1231,18,Mr.  LOTT.,"  Absolutely,  because  those are not relevant to an appropria tions bill. Those are unauthorized pro grams that should not be attached to a  continuing resolution to keep the Gov ernment operating. You are right.  Now, some of them I like, but not in  this bill. There is a process to do these  things.  ",1986
1627,1231,18,Mr. WHITTEN.," Well, I do not mind  the gentleman, because I make such  speeches,  too; but let us look at the  cause and the only way you can cor rect any bad situation is correct the  cause: The cause is on the other side  of the Capitol.  ",1986
1628,1231,18,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  address  that,  too.  I hear  that year  after year. Where  the House  says,  ""Why, we passed those bills and sent  them over there. Why don't they act?""  When the House does not pass ap propriations bills until July or August  or September, how can we immediate ly,  then, on September 1 say, ""Well,  they haven't done their job""?  They honor  the  tradition of not  acting until we act. Plus, they are also  bound by more stringent rules than we  are, under  the Gramm-Rudman-Hol lings law. I do not defend the fact that  they have not moved some of them.  ",1986

I would urge us, in a bipartisan way,  to encourage our authorizations com mittees to move earlier next year. Get  the process going. There is no reason  why authorizations committees should  not act in March or April, and also, I  think it is high time we look at the  possibility of working 5 days a week  and have 4 weeks or so that we are in  session and a week that we are not, for  our district work periods.  Let us look at something revolution ary when we  have new  leadership  elected on the other side of the aisle,  let us work together and try to find a  way to get started earlier, make sure  we keep the Members here for a full  work week, and that we also have time  to look after our districts.

Res. 738) making  continuing  appropriations  for  the  fiscal year 1987, and for other pur poses, with Mr. DoNNELLY in the chair.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Mississippi [Mr. WHITTEN].  ",1986
1633,1244,18,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may re quire.  Mr. Chairman, notwithstanding the  outcome which was just announced, I  still express the hope that our Com mittee on Rules will report out the bill  which I  introduced on behalf of the  committee that provided for revenue  sharing.  There has been much  information  kicked around here. I have the highest  regard  for  everybody,  including my  friends on the Rules Committee. So I  want  to call your attention  to why  they should go ahead, notwithstand ing this matter. To turn down a rule is  not easy, it is not easy to vote that  way. But before us now is a bill that  totals $561.9 billion and to say to the  American people that we cannot find a  way to save the one program that af fects 40,000 little villages, towns, and  counties-revenue sharing-is just ridiculous.  Now, the facts are that the people  were led to believe that revenue shar ing would be continued.  On May 21, the committee of juris diction,  the Government Operations  Committee, reported by a vote of 28 to  10, H.R. 1400 which extended the au thorization of  the program  through  September 30, 1989, at an annual level  of $4.6 billion-the present authorized  level and an increase of $500 million  over  the amount provided  in  fiscal  year 1986. On August 5,  the Rules  Committee  reported  a  rule making  consideration of H.R. 1400 in order on  the House floor. It was reported in the  press  and  every  town  and  village  throughout the country had reason to  believe  that  this program would be  carried forward.  On September 12,  I  introduced a  House joint resolution and circulated  copies of that resolution to the Com mittee on Appropriations. That resolu tion provided full year funding for the  programs,  projects,  and  activities  funded  in the regular appropriations  bill as passed the House or reported by  the committee. These bills continued  many  important programs  that had  been  proposed  for  elimination  or  major reduction by the President. Pro grams such as soil conservation, water shed protection and flood prevention,  small  business,  Appalachia,  low income weatherization, health  serv ices, 4-H club work, rural development  and farm loans. In addition, we have  retained at least the 1986 funding level  for important programs such as low income  housing,  veterans, medical  care, medical research, vocational edu cation,  student  financial  assistance,  and child nutrition. In addition,  the  resolution provided  for  the continu ation of 20 ongoing programs which  had not been included in the 13 regu lar appropriations bills because the au thorization process had not yet been  completed. That  included such pro grams as: General Revenue Sharing,  National Health Service Corps, Alco hol and Drug Abuse Research Pro gram, Refugee and Entrant Assistance  Program,  Head  Start,  Community  Services Block Grant, Higher Educa tion  Act,  and  Low-Income  Home  Energy Assistance.  These are all  important programs.  Because action  is pending, benefici aries of these programs are anticipat ing their continuation. The continuing  resolution  is  the  traditional vehicle  used to continue them. In full commit tee, a motion was made to strike one  of those unauthorized programs-gen eral revenue sharing. The vote on that  motion was yeas 15; nays 29, and the  motion was not agreed to. House Joint  Resolution 730  as  reported by  the  committee  is privileged;  it does not  need a rule but a ru1e is desirable to  limit the number of amendments be cause of the scope of the resolution.  Eleven of the thirteen regular appropriations bills that are included in the  resolution have already been consid ered and amended by the House.  Yesterday, a majority of the Rules  Committee did not grant a  rule for  consideration of House Joint Resolu tion 730 because it included revenue  sharing; the only item which affects  every community, every  town, every  city  in  the United States  in  these  times where nearly all except those  benefiting from military spending are  hard put to provide local services.  Mr. Chairman,  this bill for $561.9  billion covers the entire Government.  It includes:  Billions  Military spending .................................. $279.9  Foreign aid..............................................  13.0  State Department..................................  2.8  USIA........................................................  .9  Housing programs .................................  13.3  NASA.......................................................  Science Foundation...............................  Interior Department.............................  Department of Labor............................  Department of Health and Human  Services ................................................  Department of Education....................  7.6  1.6  4.0  5.5  84.0  13.3  It is unfortunate that the only item,  the only provision that was objected  to, is that for the people of our own  country.  That being the situation, the only  way we would protect our Nation on  those things, those other existing pro grams, was to introduce the pending  bill which is necessary if we are to pro tect what is left.  In doing this, Mr. Chairman, I wish  to say it is only about 3 days before  the end of the fiscal year.  NEED TO CONTINUE REVENUE SHARING  I urge all Members to ask the Rules  Committee at this late date to report  out favorably House Joint Resolution  730 which  is  the same bill as  that  before us today except it does contin ue revenue sharing at a three-fourths  rate. Let us look after our people first,  not last. Do not cut it out when our  people  in our  towns, villages, cities,  and counties had a right to expect rev enue sharing to continue.  I hope, that with the help of our  people at home,  this will be only a  holding action we  take here  today,  until the Rules Committee can correct  what I know to be a serious mistake.  I call your attention, Mr. Chairman,  that yesterday the administration de livered to our office a statement of po sition stating, ""In particular, the ad ministration  opposes most  strongly  the inclusion of funds for general reve nue sharing.""  Mter the action of our friends on  the Rules Committee-instead of shar ing the credit for eliminating revenue  sharing, today the administration sent  out  another  statement  eliminating  such language. In other words,  they  want no blame for your actions.  Now, may I say that misinformation  has been distributed here. The budget  ",1986
1634,1270,18,Mr. HYDE.," I  for yielding.  I  thank the gentleman for holding  this special order  in order  to com memorate someone we knew and re spected enormously.  Mr. Speaker, they say the good die  young, and the accuracy of that truth  is once in a while brought home and  never more forcefully  than with the  untimely death of Don Fortier.  They say that service is the rent we  pay for our room on Earth. If that is  true, Don Fortier was well ahead of  himself. He paid rent for a lot of life times in the short 39 years that he was  here  because  he  achieved  so  very  much.  His  life was abundantly productive  in so many ways in a city that is peo pled with too many overbearing and  self -serving  power  brokers; he pos sessed all of the qualities of the ideal  public servant.  His modesty, his dedication, his loy alty,  his  patriotism,  his  analytical  prowess  combined  to  make  him  uniquely effective at building bridges  over troubled turbulent waters.  He supplied logic and sweet reason ing many times when emotion and pol itics intruded. He played an indispen sable role  in many important issues,  particularly in forging the bipartisan  coalition in support of the President's  Central American policy. This was a  prodigious  task. A  lesser man would  have quit a lot earlier. But Don with  characteristic tenacity refused to con ceQ.e  defeat,  and  consequently  this  Nation, this evening, is on the verge of  turning the corner on a national secu rity question with far-reaching region al and global implications. If we can  sustain what Don worked so hard to  begin, history can demonstrate why  we and the rest of the free world benefited  immeasurably from his devoted  effective service.  Don is survived by his lovely wife  Aison, herself an outstanding public  servant; a son Graham, as well as an other child soon to be born. I do not  know which is more difficult, to have  known Don and loved him and enjoyed  his company or never to have known  him and still to be his child.  In any event, their loss is a keen one,  and we  in some small way share it  along with his parents, his mother and  father, brother Tom, and grandmoth er, Mrs. Robert Fortier of Dayton, OH.  But to all of them we offer our deep est sympathy and our fervent prayer  that somehow these words and those  of all of us participating in this memo rial will in some way assuage the pain  while inscribing on the public record  the unique legacy of this rare and cou rageous man.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to com mend the President for allowing Don  Fortier to be buried in Arlington Cem etery. Such a final resting place is fit ting and appropriate for someone who  literally gave his  life  for  a  nation  whose destiny he strove so mightily to  help shape. He was a patriot whose  contributions  to  his  country were  many and enduring. He used his short  time among us to accomplish so very  much.  Somehow the real pain of his loss is  mitigated by the pleasure and, yes, the  honor of having known him. I  thank  the gentleman.  ",1986

1636,1270,18,Mr. LANTOS.,"  I  thank  the gentle man for yielding, and I want to com mend my friend from Missouri  [Mr.  CoLEMAN] for bringing us together to  pay tribute to Don Fortier.  Mr. Speaker, Don Fortier was  a  friend of mine, as  indeed he was a  friend of all of us, Republicans and  Democrats, who have come  to  learn  his  passionate  patriotism,  his  deep  commitment to public service, his im peccable scholarship, and his unique  qualities as a husband and as a father.  I have rarely met a person who was  more serious about his work.  In my previous incarnation as a uni versity professor, I had come to appre ciate scholarship. I do not think in all  the years I have spent here in Wash ington both as a Member of the House  and as a staff member on the Senate  side before I ever had the pleasure of  getting to know someone who was as  demanding of himself as a scholar.  President Reagan  could not have  chosen better than to have made this  brilliant, dedicated, outstanding patri ot his deputy national security adviser.  He loved his work. I have never seen  a person whose mind was as constantly  engaged as Don's and all of that engagement had the purpose of answer ing the one question: How best to pro mote  the  interests  of  the United  States.  He sat next to me at the Kremlin  one day when we met with the top  Soviet negotiator on arms control, Am bassador Karpov.  Now while we had a distinguished  and a strong bipartisan delegation, I  believe I am accurate in saying that all  of us combined did not have the depth  of understanding, the appreciation of  the nuances of arms control that Don  did.  He incessantly worked for the bene fit of our Nation and even when he  was on vacation he was churning forth  endless memorandums, papers, cables,  telegrams, to tell his home office what  is happening, with a degree of percep tivity and insight and appreciation of  other cultures that was extraordinary.  Don and Alison were a  team. They  were one of the finest teams in this  Capital. They shared the love and ap preciation of what this Nation is and  the skills of foreign policy experts. It  was such an infinite joy to see them  greet their little son when he arrived  some 3 years ago.  The last time Annette and I saw Don  was at Andrews Air Force Base when  he had a little boy in his arms greeting  Alison as he was returning from a dif ficult and arduous journey abroad.  The sparkle, the joy, the intelligence  in that little boy's eyes give all of us  hope that someday he will carry on his  father's, Don's, work.  To Don's grandmother, his parents,  brother, but particularly to Alison and  Graham and the little baby yet to be  born, my wife Annette and I are send ing our love and our affection.  ",1986

His gifts were  recognized early  in  life. He distinguished himself in the  academic world and  in  the private  sector.

The consecration and Chrismation of  the  Assumption Greek Orthodox Church  is  a  joyous occasion  for  its parishioners, and  it  sends a powerful message of  faith  to  the  entire Flint area.  The church was founded in the late 1920's  by a group of 20  immigrant  families, whose  commitment and courage  laid  the foundation  for a holy place of worship  that now serves  240 families in the Flint area. The Assumption  Greek Orthodox Church, which  received  its  charter in 1928, has been a constant and un wavering source of spiritual strength  for  its  congregation.  In  its early days and after the  church building's construction in 1961, the vi brant spiritual  life of  this church has been  manifest through its sacred traditions of wor ship and its active service to the community.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In Flint, we are fortunate to have a strong  Greek  community,  whose members  have  made, and continue  to make, a tremendous  contribution  to  the quality of life  in  the Flint  area. The Assumption Greek Orthodox Church  has not only been a sacred place of worship  and spiritual guidance  for  its parishioners,  it  has provided them with a community of fellow ship that is rich in a shared faith and heritage.  The  formal dedication and baptism of  the  church on September 28  is an occasion  for  renewed  faith and appreciation of a church  that has met the spiritual needs of its congre gation for nearly 60 years.  Mr. Speaker, under the spiritual  leadership  of  its  pastor, Rev.  Athanas George,  the  church continues its tradition of religious com mitment and community service today. I would  like  to ask all of my colleagues  in  the U.S.  House of Representatives to join with me now  in paying tribute to the Assumption Greek Or thodox Church, upon the occasion of its con secration and Chrismation.  THE  lOOTH RONALD McDONALD  HOUSE OPENING  IN QUEENS  COUNTY, NY  HON.GARYL.ACKERMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 24, 1986  ",1986
1640,1283,18,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to mark  the opening of  the 1 OOth Ronald  McDonald House, which will be dedicated on  Monday, September 29, 1986.  The new house,  the  first  to be opened  in  Queens, Nassau, or Suffolk Counties in New  York,  is located on the grounds of Schneider  Children's Hospital, at the Long Island Jewish  Medical Center.  Mr. Speaker, 12 years ago, one family and  a doctor had a small idea. When Kim Hill was  stricken with  leukemia, her parents and Dr.  Audrey Evans realized how difficult it can be  for a mother and  father  to stay close  to a  child who has been hospitalized. They con ceived of a simple solution: special homes  away from home where parents and  families  could  remain near  the hospital without en countering often-prohibitive hotel costs. The  seed that they planted was sown generously  by McDonald's, a corporation that cares about  the communities  in which  it does business.  And today, that seed has become a network  of 1 00 Ronald McDonald Houses, providing a  warm atmosphere for families to stay together  when they need each other the most.  Fred, Fran, and Kim, as well as Dr. Evans,  will all be present at the dedication ceremony  on Monday. Their story, and the entire history  of the Ronald McDonald House movement, is  an  impressive  testiment  to  the  American  people. From the lone individuals who had a  dream,  to  the corporate caring  that brought  the dream to  life,  to the private sharing  that  keeps each house  in operation  to  this day,  this is a slice of America of which we can all  be proud.  The Schneider Children's Hospital is an ap propriate place for the 1 OOth Rondald McDon ald House. Specializing  in  treating cancers  that strike out at our young people, this institu26375  tion of healing helps children from the entire  New York metropolitan  area,  as well  as  youngsters from across the Nation and around  the world. Thanks to .the new facility, count less children will be able to receive the com fort and support that only a parent can bring. I  would  like to acknowledge Lyn Jurick, presi dent, and Irving Klein, chairman of the board  of this new Ronald McDonald House; and Dr.  Robert K. Match, the president of Long Island  Jewish Medical Center, for their hard work in  bringing  this 1 OOth house  to  the New York  area.  Mr. Speaker,  I call now on all of my col leagues to join me in congratulating the Long  Island Jewish Medical Center, Schneider Chil dren's Hospital, and all of the people behind  every Ronald McDonald House, as  they pre pare  to dedicate  this  landmark site, and  in  wishing  the  families who  take advantage of  the facility our very best.  HONORING 35TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  KIWANIS  CLUB  OF  PICO RIVERA  HON. ESTEBAN EDWARD TORRES  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 24, 1986  ",1986
1641,1283,18,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask my col leagues to join with me today in saluting the  35th anniversary of the Kiwanis Club of Pico  Rivera, CA.  On Sunday, September 28, 1986, the club  will conduct its annual  installation of officers  and will celebrate  its charter date of August  29, 1951.  It is important to note that the Pico Rivera  Kiwanis have been conducting charitable and  civic projects for the residents of Pico Rivera  since its charter as a Kiwanis club. Recently,  this club has embarked on a special effort to  help our young people by assisting them with  the Key Club at El Rancho High School.  These efforts, along with many other year round  projects,  contribute  to making Pico  Rivera a special place to live and work.  Mr. Speaker,  I also ask my colleagues  to  join me in congratulating Mr. Albert Cortez, in coming president of the Pico Rivera Kiwanis  Club. Albert is an outstanding young man who  has served our community witth distinction  and dedication.  THE STATELESS OF CYPRUS  HON. ROD CHANDLER  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 24, 1986  ",1986
1642,1283,18,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Speaker,  the United  States should recognize the Denktash govern ment. Here is one of the more positive pieces  I've seen written on that issue. Enclosed is an  article in Monday's Wall Street Journal.

1644,1309,18,Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.," Mr.  Speaker,  the Committee on Rules did a railroad  job on this rule. The effect of doing a  railroad job on this rule is to make a  bill loaded down with contentious and  divisive  issues even more contentious  and more divisive which will ensure  that a conference will not succeed.  The gentleman from Nebraska [Mr.  DAUB]  ticked  off  a whole host of  things that the Committee on Rules  did, including putting Moakley-DeCon cini in and sheltering it from a motion  to strike.  But in another instance, on the issue  of warrantless searches of fields,  the  Committees on Agriculture and  the  Judiciary have had a  difference of  agreement. The Committee on Agri culture supported the search warrant;  the Committee on the Judiciary, for  good reason, did not. Yet the commit tee on Agriculture's version is put in  this bill and sheltered from a motion  to strike.  So even when  there are disagree ments between 2 committees, this rule  prevents a vote of the House to deter mine which committee's viewpoint is  justified.  These kinds of issues are going to  make a conference almost impossible  to reach agreement in the few days  left of this session. This kind of rule, I  believe in effect, will kill immigration  reform vitally needed for 2 more years.  ",1986
1645,1309,18,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker, for  purpose of debate  only,  I  yield  1  minute to the gentleman from Califor nia [Mr. TORRES].  ",1986
1646,1309,18,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule on H.R. 3810. Im migration refotm is a complex and dif ficult issue. Addressing the many com peting interests is not easily achieved.  But I strongly believe that the rule we  are voting on here today represents a  fair  and  realistic  effort  to balance  these interests.  Two years ago, I voted against the  House immigration reform bill. I voted  against the bill because I believed that  employer  sanctions would  result  in  widespread  discrimination.  I  voted  against the bill because I believed that  the massive  guest-worker  program  that was adopted would lead to abuse  and exploitation of both foreign and  American workers. I voted against the  bill 2 years ago because I did not be lieve it represented fair or meaningful  immigration reform.  Because of our efforts to ensure that  immigration reform did not result in  discrimination  and  abuse, Hispanics  like myself have been accused of being  obstructionist. We have been criticized  for subverting the will of the majority.  When I opposed the rule on the immi gration bill in the last Congress, I was  told that although the rule was not  perfect-the  time  for  immigration  reform had come.  I  find  it ironic that some of these  same critics are now attempting  to  deny the House an opportunity to vote  for legislation that has been approved  by virtually every committee of juris diction. The rule is not perfect. But it  does attempt to maintain a  realistic  balance of competing interests. And to  borrow  a  line  from my critics-the  time for immigration reform has come.  If the rule we are considering here  today is adopted, I am not certain how  I will vote on final passage. I am still  troubled by  the discrimination  that  could result from employer sanctions.  I am also not convinced that any for eign agricultural workers should be  imported to pick our crops. I am cer-  tain, however, that if the rule is not  adopted, the opportunity for approv ing acceptable legislation will be lost.  If the House does not adopt  this  rule,  the delicate balance  that has  been crafted will be destroyed and im migration reform will once again be  left for another day.  I urge my col leagues to adopt the rule and provide  the House an opportunity to vote for a  fair and meaningful immigration bill.  ",1986

1648,1309,18,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  strong opposition  to  this most un democratic rule.  Again,  we  find  ourselves  going  through the semiannual sadistic proc ess of trying to do something about  meaningful immigration reform in this  country. I am sick and tired of hearing  speaker after speaker come down here  and say that getting this bill out is  more important than the democratic  process.  The Committee on Rules has com pletely stopped the democratic process  from going forward and I will say to  the Members  that  democracy,  the  1  democratic process, is more important  than any statute, any change or any  bill coming through this Congress of  the United States.  It is sadistic and anybody who be lieves for 1 moment that we are going  to take this bill to conference and that  we are going to come back with a good  immigration bill before  the close of  this Congress next week or the follow ing week must have  come  in  this  morning's mail.  It is not going to happen and I urge  all of the Members that the only way  that we can really make our feelings  known and come up with a decent bill  that will give us any chance of mean ingful immigration reform this year is  to defeat this awful rule.

1650,1309,18,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, having  worked on immigration reform, I, too,  regret that we take this up in the clos ing days of the session. But that is the  case.  Yesterday we dealt with tax reform;  today  we  deal  with  immigration  reform. There are some similarities.  Like tax reform, if we are going to do  immigration reform, it has to be com prehensive  and  deal with  a  broad  number of areas to do it properly.  Like tax reform, you cannot provide  an open rule that allows every amend ment to come in and destroy the care ful compromises that have been put  together. That is the reality of dealing  with comprehensive legislation in this  body if you want to enact it.  On the compromise itself, let me say  this: Today there are in the area of  300,000 to 350,000 undocumented who  work in agriculture. The choice of this  institution is either to allow the con tinuation of having illegals work in ag riculture, to bring in another 300,000  to 350,000 guest-workers in this coun try to solve that issue, or to try to le galize and provide green cards to those  who work in agriculture.  Do  the  right  thing. Support  compromise and support the rule.  ",1986

Mr. Speaker,  if  the Members love amnesty, they are  really  going  to  love  the Schumer  amendment because that is what it is.  That is what the provision is, a second  legalization or a second amnesty that  is far worse than the regular legaliza tion that is in this bill.  It is the one thing in the legislation  that is going  to cause  this Member,  who has always supported  immigra tion reform, to vote against the whole  package if we cannot amend at this  time. I hate to say that.  The only way we can get a decent  product out of this body is by voting  this  ",1986

1667,1361,18,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise, as will many colleagues today, in  support of the bipartisan drug abuse  bill before us, S. 2878, and I take the  occasion of the debate to offer just a  few observations on this general sub ject.  First, I express appreciation. On the  first day of  this Congress, almost 2  years ago, I introduced S. 15, the State  and Local Narcotics Control Assistance  Act, which, while receiving very little  attention at that time-and indeed, no  specific consideration since-is largely  included in the bill before us. In par ticular, the measures for law enforce ment  and  drug  abuse  prevention,  treatment,  and  rehabilitation which  we are going  to adopt  in  the near  future, are essentially what was pro posed in S. 15. As  the distinguished  Presiding Officer knows, the majority  leader has the first 10 numbers in our  calendar. Therefore, S. 15 was,  in a  sense, the fifth bill introduced by an other Senator in the 99th Congress.  While thinking about the present in tense concern over narcotic abuse, I go  back in my own mind to the period of  the late 1960's, when we had a very  comparable situation with heroin.  In 1969, I was serving as assistant to  President Nixon for urban affairs.  I  recall that there were more bank rob beries that took place in the city of  Washington than the entire previous  century, and we were in the midst of a  heroin epidemic, not all that different  from earlier episodes in the long histo ry of drug abuse in our country.  The question was how to respond to  this crisis-not with any expectation  of putting an end to a large and con tinuing aspect of modern society-but,  rather,  in order to interrupt and to  break the epidemic in a manner that  had at least some hope of success in at  least the near term.  It fell to me to devise a strategy for  the Nation  in  this  regard. My  first  view-which the President, Mr. Nixon,  completely  endorsed-was  that we  should  interrupt the flow of heroin  supplies into the country.  At  that  time,  on  overwhelming  amount of heroin was produced first  as poppy,  in a provinces of Turkey,  then  the heroin was  transported by  ship across the Mediterranean to Mar seille, where it was processed into mor phine and then into heroin, and from  Marseille,  the heroin was  smuggled  into the United States.  0  1310  It seemed to me that we had to put  the issue of heroin on the agenda of  American foreign policy. We also had  to encourage our allies-France and  Turkey, countries with which we have  close relations and military relations to help us in this matter of great con cern to us, and, obviously, of marginal  concern to them, if at all.  In August 1969,  I  flew west from  California  to  Istanbul where  I met  with the Turkish foreign minister.  I  represented myself as speaking for the  President of the United States and de scribed  the situation  in our country  with respect  to heroin use, and the  ",1986

1671,1374,18,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased to join the distinguished  Senator  from  Pennsylvania  HEINZ]  in introducing Senate Concur rent Resolution 166,  expressing  the  sense of Congress in opposition to dis crimination  against  individuals who  have or have had cancer.  Mr.  President,  biomedical  science  has made remarkable progress in the  fight against cancer. Many cancers,  particularly  those  afflicting  young  people,  are  treatable-even  curable.  We applaud our scientists for helping  transform more and more cancer vic tiins into cancer survivors.  Recovered cancer patients are able  and desire  to enter or  reenter  the  workforce to become productive Amer icans.  That's what makes  it  especially  tragic that, after winning the fight for  their lives, many cancer patients are  then faced with another uphill battle  against discriinination.  Mr.  President,  according  to  the  American Cancer Society,  1 out of  every 5 persons with a cancer history more than 1 million persons-has en countered employment discrimination.  1\tlr. President, section 504 of theRe habilitation Act of 1973, of which I  was a principal coauthor, prohibits dis crimination against handicapped indi viduals under any program or activity  receiving Federal financial assistance  or conducted by  a  Taken together with sections 501 and  503  of  this  act-requiring  Federal  agencies and Federal contractors, re spectively.  to take affirmative action  to employ and advance disabled per sons-this  legislation has been and  continues to be instrumental in open ing doors previously used to shut cut  disabled Americans. For the purposes  of these provisions, section 7(7)(B) of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, defines  the term ""handicapped individual"" ex plicitly  to  include any person ""who  first, has a physical or mental impair ment which substantially limits one or  more  of  such  person's  activities,  second, has a record of such an impair ment, or third, is regarded as having  Fed~ral agency.  such an impairment."" Without ques tion, persons with cancer or a history  of cancer are covered by this defini tion and are  thus entitled  to every  effort  of  the Federal Government  available under  this  law  to protect  them from discrimination.  Although great strides have been  made under sections 501, 503, and 504  in helping ensure that persons with  disabilities are not denied full partici pation in our society,  it is  tragically  evident from the figures I have earlier  cited regarding the number of individ uals with a history of cancer who have  been the victims of employment dis crimination that we still have much to  accomplish if disabled persons are to  be provided the rights and opportuni ties that are each American's due.  Mr. President,  if  is my hope  that  this  resolution will help promote a  greater awareness and understanding  of individuals who have or have had  cancer. I urge all of my colleagues to  review and support this resolution.  ",1986
1672,1374,18,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I would  like  to commend Senator HEINZ  for  the work he has done on Senate Con current Resolution 166, expressing the  sense of Congress in opposition to em ployment discrimination against indi viduals who have, or have had, cancer  based on such individual's cancer his tory. I would also like to express my  general support  for  the concept of  educating  the  public  about  the  progress we have made  in  treating  cancer.  Today, 1 of every 2 persons diag nosed as having cancer is cured. That  means that there are more than 5 mil lion people alive today who have had  cancer. And  there  is no doubt  that  many  of  them  are  discriminated  against when it comes to employment  or insurance.  The  solution  to  this  problem  is  public  awareness. People who have  had cancer historically had a much  shorter  life  expectancy.  Insurance  companies base their rate on historical  data. Today, because more people are  living with cancer,  insurance compa nies will adjust their rates for cancer  patients downward.  Likewic;e, employers have been reluc tant to hire and tra.ir. persons with a  history of cancer. who might have a  shortened life expectancy. In addition,  employers were concerned about fre quent hospitalization and its effect on  employees'  productivity  and  their  health care costs. But  today, many  cancer  patients  can  be  cured  and  return  to many years of productive  employment.  As I and other Senators have point ed out, it is important that the public  learns about  the progress we  have  made. Attitudes  toward  cancer  pa tients should and are changing. Most  of us now personally know someone  who has been cured of cancer.  But let me express a word of cau tion.  I am cautious about  trying  to  change these attitudes through legis lation. Among employee benefits, for  example, is insurance. Insurance rates  are generally determined by one's risk  of injury or illness. People who smoke,  are overweight, have high blood pres sure, or have been exposed to AIDS  an charged higher rates because they  present a greater risk. Those present ing a lower risk should and do pay less.  Thus  I  am not willing  to mandate  equality  in  the marketplace which  would amount to a forced cross-subsi dy, but I am willing to endorse a broad  policy statement opposing unfounded  disparate treatment.  Mr. President, having said  that,  I  would like to again commend Senator  HEINZ for his work and leadership in  this area. I hope that I can work with  him to increase the public awareness  of the progress we have made in this  area.  ",1986

Whereas there are more than five million  Americans in our Nation with a cancer his tory and an estimated one million of them  face  the  terrible  injustice of employment  discrimination;  Whereas one out of every two individuals  now diagnosed as having cancer  is cured,  and as a result, the number of survivors will  continue to dramatically increase;  Whereas  employment  discrimination  against cancer survivors  ranges  from  job  denial  to wage  reduction, exclusion  from  and reduction in benefits, promotion denial,  and in some cases outright dismissal; and  Whereas we must permit, and encourage,  cancer survivors to remain fully integrated  and productive members of society: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep resentatives  concurring), That  it  is  the  sense of the Congress that the Congress( 1)  opposes  employment discrimination  against individuals who have, or have had,  cancer based on such individual's cancer his tory, and  (2) urge that such individuals receive fair  and equal treatment in the workplace.

1676,1439,18,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  in  support  of  the Tax  Reform Act  of  1986. This  historic  piece of legislation is the culmination  of a major effort by Members of Con gress to improve the tax laws of this  Nation. It seeks  to achieve a  funda mentally fair tax system in which tax payers of equal income will pay equal  taxes. I believe that the willingness of  our citizens to pay their taxes is based  on a recognition that this is the price  of good government. However, Ameri cans are perfectly justified in expect ing that those similarly situated will  share equally in the cost of govern ment.  I believe  this bill  is a needed  step in that direction.  It is clear that no tax reform bill can  please all affected. Furthermore, there  are certain areas in this bill which I  cannot totally support. For example, I  am concerned about the impact that  changes in the tax-exempt bond area  will have on State and local financing.  I am concerned that the repeal of the  capital gains deduction will negatively  impact the timber industry. This legis lation will cause the real estate indus try to undergo major restructuring in  the next few years. The banking in dustry will also have to make major  adjustments. Despite  these concerns,  it is necessary to balance all the vari ous positive and negative aspects of  this legislation and view it in its en tirety. As a whole,  in my  judgment,  this bill merits my support.  In the provisions affecting the indi vidual taxpayer, 80 percent of Ameri cans will pay taxes in the 15 percent  bracket. A number of  important de ductions have been retained including  the deduction for mortgage interest on  first  and  second  homes, State and  local property  taxes, State and local  income taxes, charitable contributions  for those who itemize, and medical ex penses exceeding a certain amount.  I  also believe  that  the provisions  which apply  to  the corporate sector  will benefit  the economy. First,  the  maximum  tax  rate will be  reduced  from  46  percent  to  34  percent. A  recent article in the Wall Street Jour nal points out that a reduction in cor porate tax rates will attract new for eign investments, and will also reduce  American direct  investment  abroad.  Studies cited estimated that the 198182  tax changes may have  increased  foreign  direct  investment  in  the  United States by as much as 20 per cent a year, while reducing American  investments abroad by as much as 4  percent a  year.  I  believe American  companies should be encouraged  to  invest in the future of America, and I  am optimistic  that  these provisions  will accomplish such a result.  I have previously expressed concerns  about the repeal of the 20-percent cap ital gains rate. However, it is  impor tant to put the new 28-percent rate  into historical perspective. It is worth  noting that the top rate on long-term  capital gains was 25 percent  in  the  United States until 1968-only slightly  below the new proposed top rate. This  rate did not appear to slow national  economic growth during  the  1950's  and 1960's.  Mr. President, this bill is not perfect.  Nevertheless, when viewed  in its en tirety,  the advantages outweigh  the  disadvantages. Long-term positive ben efits will emerge as a more productive  economy is established, and financial  decisions are made on the basis of eco nomic merit rather  than  tax avoid ance. For these reasons, I will vote in  favor of this bill.  ",1986
1677,1439,18,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I rise to  express my support for the conference  report on H.R. 3838, the Tax Reform  Act  of  1986.  Since  the  conferees  reached  their final decisions on  tax  reform last month, we have all heard  conflicting characterizations of what  this bill will mean to our Nation. Some  have hailed this tax bill as one of the  most historic legislative achievements  in recent memory. Others have con deirmed  the bill  as being  a major  threat  to our economy.  In deciding  whether  to support  this conference  report,  it has been necessary  to cut  through the hyperbole and to ask the  essential question of whether this bill  is a positive step toward meaningful  tax reform. In my opinion, the answer  is an unequivocal ""yes.""  This bill contains major provisions  that will make our tax laws fairer. It  provides relief to 6 million low-income  persons by removing them from  the  Federal income tax rolls. It benefits  many low-and middle-income persons  by expanding the personal exemption  and standard deduction and by retain ing indexing of the tax rates. It tar gets much of its tax relief to persons  who do not itemize on their Federal  income tax returns, which now consti tutes over two-thirds of all taxpayers.  This bill places over 80 percent of all  American taxpayers in the 15-percent  marginal  tax bracket and distributes  the  tax burden more  equitably by  broadening the tax base. It retains the  tax benefits that are widely used by  most taxpayers, such as the mortgage  interest deduction, the charitable con tribution deduction for itemizers, and  the  deduction  for State  and  local  income and property  taxes.

1680,1452,18,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, every  so often a gifted individual will shed  new light on, or give a fresh insight to  a topic we thought we knew intimate ly. Such an event happened Tuesday,  September 16 at Brigham Young Uni versity when The Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints President  Ezra Taft Benson spoke on the U.S.  Constitution.  His address was in commemoration  of the 200th birthday of the Constitu tional Convention. We are indeed for tunate  to have had a group of  the  most uniquely talented men ever to be  assembled at the birth of any nation, a  gathering which produced the greatest  document ever  to govern  a  nation.  Those  Founding  Fathers  possessed  wisdom  and  inspiration  far  beyond  their generation as  they authored a  document which would  endure un known future assaults.  Ezra Taft Benson  is of  the same  timber as the Founding Fathers and  has devoted a  lifetime  to profound  study of  those great men and  their  product.  Mr. President, as we commence our  celebration of the Bicentennial of the  Constitution,  I  strongly urge  every  Member of this body  to  take a  few  minutes and ponder this great address  on the Constitution:  THE CONSTITUTION-A HEAVENLY BANNER  <By Ezra Taft Benson>  My fellow Americans, on the 17th day of  September, 1987, we commemorate the two hundredth birthday of the Constitutional  Convention, which gave birth to the docu ment that Gladstone said is ""the most won derful work ever struck off at a given time  by the brain and purpose of man.""  I  heartily  endorse  this  assessment.  would be erroneous for us, however, to con clude that the document was the sole genius  of the Founding Fathers. Theirs was a com bined wisdom derived from heavenly inspi ration, knowledge of political government  from ages past, and the crucible of their  own experience.  We pay honor-honor  to  the document  itself, honor to the men who framed it, and  honor to the God who inspired it and made  possible its coming forth.  It  SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES  To understand  the  significance of  the  Constitution, we must first understand some  basic, eternal principles. These principles  have their beginning in the premortal coun cils of heaven.  The Principle of Agency  The first basic principle is agency. We un derstand that the purpose of the council in  heaven was  to announce and present the  plan of redemption for the salvation of all  of God's children. The council was called so  that every man and woman could sustain  the provisions of the Father's plan, which  required  that  all  people  obtain mortal  bodies. be tried and proven in all things, and  have opportunity  to choose of  their own  free will to obey the laws and ordinances es sential to their exaltation.  Because a fallen condition was an essen tial part of this plan, an infinite, eternal  sacrifice was also  required  to  redeem us  from this state. We are all familiar with the  facts: how Lucifer-a personage of promi nence-sought to amend the plan, while Je hovah  sustained  the plan. The Prophet  Joseph Smith explained how this difference  led to the war in heaven: ""The contention in  heaven was-Jesus said there would be cer tain souls that would not be saved; and the  devil said he could save them all, and laid  his plans before the grand council, who gave  their vote in favor of Jesus Christ. So the  devil rose up in rebellion against God, and  was cast down.""  The central  issue  in that council,  then,  was: Shall  the children of God have un trammeled agency to choose the course they  should follow, whether good or evil, or shall  they be coerced and forced to be obedient?  Christ and all who followed Him stood for  the former proposition-freedom of choice;  Satan stood  for  the  latter-coercion and  force. Because Satan and those who stood  with him would not accept the vote of the  council, but rose up in rebellion, they were  cast down  to the earth, where they have  continued to foster the same plan. The war  that began in heaven is not yet over. The  conflict continues on the battlefield of mor tality. And one of Lucifer's primary strate gies has been to restrict our agency through  the power of earthly governments. Proof of  this is found in the long history of human ity.  When the first worldly government began  as a theocracy, Adam's descendants soon de parted from this perfect order and degener ated  into  variou.S  political  systems. The  result has been human misery and, for most  of humankind, subjugation to some despotic  government.  Look back  in  retrospect on almost six  thousand years of human history! Free dom's moments have been infrequent and  exceptional. From Nimrod to Napoleon, the  conventional  political  ideology  has been  that the rights of life, liberty, and property  were subject  to a  sovereign's will,  rather  than God-given. We must appreciate that  we live in one of history's most exceptional  moments-in a nation and a time of unprec edented freedom. Freedom as we know  it  has been experienced by perhaps less than  one percent of the human family.  are the principles that, in my opinion, pro claim the proper role of gove1nment in the  domestic affairs of the nation:  [l] believe that governments were institut ed of God for the benefit of man; and that  he holds men accountable for their acts in  relation to them.  Ul believe that no government can exist  in peace, except such laws are framed and  held inviolate as will secure to each individ ual the free exercise of conscience, the right  of control of property, and the protection of  life ....  [l] believe that all men are bound to sus tain and uphold the respective governments  in which  they  reside, while protected  in  their inherent and inalienable rights by the  laws of such governments. <D&C 134:1-2,5.>  In other words, the most important single  function of government  is  to  secure  the  rights and freedoms of individual citizens.  The Source of Human Rights  The third important principle pertains to  the source of basic human rights. Thomas  Paine, back  in  the days of the American  Revolution, explained: ""Rights are not gifts  from one man  to another, nor from one  class of men to another .... It is impossible  to discover any origin of rights otherwise  than in the origin of man; it consequently  follows  that  rights appertain  to man  in  right of his existence, and must therefore be  equal to every man.""  The great Thomas Jefferson asked: ""Can  the liberties of a nation be thought secure  when we have  removed  their only  firm  basis,  a  conviction  in  the minds of  the  people that these liberties are of the gift of  God? That they are not to be violated but  with his wrath?""  The feelings of these great men are  in  keeping  with  the  revelations  of  God  1through His prophet, who said:' ""Men are  free according to the flesh . . . and they are  free to choose liberty and eternal life ... or  to choose captivity and death."" <2 Nephi  2:27.)  Rights are either God-given as part of the  divine plan, or they are granted by govern ment as part of the political plan. Reason,  necessity, tradition, and religious conviction  all lead me to accept the divine origin of  these rights. If we accept the premise that  human rights are granted by government,  then we must be willing to accept the corol lary that they can be denied by government.  I, for one, shall never accept that premise.  As the French political economist Frederic  Bastiat phrased it so succinctly, ""Life, liber ty, and property do not exist because men  have made laws. On the contrary, it was the  fact that life, liberty, and property existed  beforehand that caused men to make laws  in the first place.""  We must ever keep in mind the inspired  words of Thomas Jefferson, as found in the  Declaration  of  Independence:  ""We  hold  these truths to be self-evident, that all men  are created equal, that they are endowed by  their  Creator with  certain  unalienable  Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty  and  the pursuit of Happiness. That  to  secure these rights, Governments are insti tuted  among Men,  deriving  their  just  powers from the consent of the governed.""  The Proper Role of Government  The second basic principle concerns  the  function and proper role of government.  I  should like to outline in clear, concise, and  straightforward  terms  the guidelines that  determine, now and in the future, my atti tudes and actions toward all domestic pro posals and projects of government. These  People Are Superior to Governments  The fourth basic principle we must under stand is that people are superior to the gov ernments  they  form.  Since God  created  people with certain inalienable rights, and  they, in turn, created government to help  secure and safeguard those rights, it follows  that the people are superior to the creature  ",1986
1681,1465,18,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of S. 2884. Earlier this Con gress I introduced a predecessor bill, S.  2148, along with 11 cosponsors. In the  97th Congress, the Labor Subcommit tee held hearings on a slightly differ ent version. These hearings convinced  me that current law was a detriment  to the primary employers of the se verely handicapped;  sheltered wotk shops  and work  activities  centers.  Those operators holding both certifi cates were barred  from  comingling  their clientele. Consequently, both the  business side of the operation and the  therapeutic side were often hindered.  Precious resources were also wasted. I  became a  firm believer  that section  14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act  needed to be amended.  This year, Senator METzENBA UM and  I negotiated out several changes to S.  2148. I am pleased to say that this co operative effort now appears on the  verge of becoming law. The interest  groups  that  represent  the  handi capped support this bill and I am told  that  it  is acceptable  to  the proper  Members of the House as well. Once  again the members of this committee  have cooperated on legislation. I ap preciate the efforts of Senator METz ENBAUM and Senator HATCH as well as  the support of all the cosponsors.

I, too,  am pleased that our efforts appear to  be paying off.  I have discussed  this  issue with our counterparts  in  the  House of Representatives and I believe  that they will accept this negotiated  compromise and clear the bill for the  President.  ",1986

I suspect that many of  these  shops-particularly  the  small  shops in rural areas-will realize a sub stantial cost savings once this bill is  enacted.

I  commend the Senators from Oklaho ma and Ohio for their hard work on  this legislation.  I am also pleased to note that the  bill has the support of major organiza tions concerned with protecting  the  rights of and creating meaningful em ployment  opportunities  for  handi capped workers,  including the Easter  Seal Society and the National Associa tion of Rehabilitation Facilities. They  have encouraged us to push forward  with this legislation even at this late  hour in the session. This is an indica tion, I believe, of the importance with  which this measure is viewed.

BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE  HON. MEL LEVINE  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 25, 1986  ",1986
1687,1478,18,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Mr. Speaker, this  past Sunday's New York Times carried an arti cle by John Cushman which described  in  detail problems with  testing of  the Bradley  fighting vehicle. Specifically, the article exam ined whether the Bradley was-as the Army  and FMC-the Bradley's prime contractor have said-capable of crossing deep water.  This was  to be one of  the Bradley's major  assets, and was a military requirement for the  vehicle.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  That  the Army and FMC's enthusiasm  for  the Bradley might have made them less than  forthcoming on the Bradley's swimming capa bility should come as no surprise;  the Army  still has not conducted realistic, live-fire tests  on  the Bradley, even  though  I, along with  many of my colleagues, have long pressed for  such testing.  I call this article to the attention of my col leagues and urge them  to read  it.  It demon strates yet again that many unanswered ques tions  remain  about  the Bradley,  questions  which  could  ultimately  cause  unnecessary  casualties  to  the  troops who must  ride  the  Bradley in combat.  EXPERTS SEE RISK IN TROOP CARRIER  <By John H. Cushman, Jr.>  WASHINGTON, September 20.-The Army's  Bradley troop carrier would risk sinking if it  tried  to cross deep  rivers and streams  in  combat, according to weapon experts. The  flaw, which is suggested by newly uncovered  documents, could halt infantry attacks at  the banks of rivers in Europe, where the ve hicle is deployed.  Despite the risk to infantrymen riding in  the Bradley, the Army and its prime con tractor have pressed ahead with the $12.2  billion project.  Maj. Gen. Charles D. Bussey, chief of  Army public affairs, said that the Pentagon  is ""naturally concerned"" about any problem  with the vehicle but that ""the Bradley has  proved itself in the field and is vital to the  Army's modernization.""  MANUFACTURER CALLS IT SAFE  While warning soldiers about the hazards,  the Army has continued to accept certifica tions by the FMC Corporation, which man ufactures the vehicle, that the Bradley is ca pable of crossing deep water.  The company has been sued by a recently  dismissed  test engineer  for making  those  certifications. The suit is focusing renewed  attention on doubts by some experts in the  military about the Bradley's capabilities.  Granting  interviews  on condition  that  they not be identified, the weapon experts  agreed to discuss the newly uncovered inter nal documents from the Army and FMC and  other papers filed last week in Federal Dis trict Court in San Jose, Calif., in connection  with the engineer's suit. The experts includ ed current and  retired military officers,  Congressional staff members, Government  consultants and former Pentagon officials.  The documents  indicate  that the Army  and the contractor adopted extraordinary  measures to prevent troops from drowning  during river crossings in the 22-ton vehicle,  which moves about on tracks like a tank. In  training, the troops wear life preservers and  rescue boats are kept close at hand.  Patrick J. Head, general counsel of FMC,  said that ""the basic issue"" in the California  lawsuit ""is whether we misled  the Army,  and our position is no, we have not.""  ""Like any other piece of  litigation,"" he  said, ""we treat it very seriously, and want to  dissect  it completely before we  come up  with an absolute position on it.""  General Bussey said it was  too early to  form an opinion about  the merits of  the  California lawsuit.  VIEW OF THE CRITICS  Critics say the reluctance by  the Army  and FMC  to  try  realistic  river crossings  seem  to contradict assertions before Con gress that the vehicle's abilities meet the  military's requirements and contribute  to  September 26, 1986  the Army's doctrine of aggressive, mobile  combat.  On  occasion,  the Army  acknowledges,  Bradleys have sunk while swimming across  streams, a procedure that entails attaching  a rubberized skirt around the vehicle to pre vent water  from  cascading  through  its  hatches as  it paddles  through water  too  deep to ford.  One former Defense Department official  who is fully familiar with the Bradley pro gram ridiculed the swimming capability of  the vehicle. Asked how important it is that  the Bradley be able to swim, this expert as serted: ""On the defensive, it might not be  important. If attacking, if you want to win,  if you're going forward, you've got to have  it. If you're going to the rear, it may not be  important."" Bridges  to  the rear are more  likely to remain intact, he explained.  The concern about the vehicle's perform ance in water is also justified by the fact  that soldiers have died trying river crossings  in  the Bradley's predecessor,  the M-113,  which is also made by FMC.  To  this day,  the Army asserts that the  Bradley, which carries as many as nine  riders  into combat, can pass  its  tests  in  water, even though it can be risky. That will  be the case, the Army says, even after more  armor is added to the vehicle, a planned im provement that could add three or four tons  to its weight.  But the Bradley's critics say that the vehi cle performed poorly in the original oper ational tests conducted by the Army in 1979,  and  that  the problems have never been  fixed.  The problems center on  the protective  rubberized  skirt, which can be damaged  during operations and cannot be erected  swiftly, the critics say. They add that the  Bradley rides too low in the water for the  skirt, held  in place by poles,  to perform  during  turns,  in choppy waters or strong  currents, or in certain other conditions.  PRAISE AND DOUBTS  Even  those who  praised  the Bradley,  which is armed with a cannon and antitank  missiles, doubted its worth in water deeper  than three and a half feet,  the depth at  which its tracks touch bottom.  ""The vehicle  is a  tremendous  improve ment over  the M-113,"" said one well  in formed retired officer. ""If you asked me to  fight in a Bradley versus a 113, 100 percent  of the time I'll take the Bradley. That gun  and TOW missile are magnificent and the  speed and everything else. But I don't want  to swim in it.""  FMC has  tried  to meet the Army's re quirement that the immense vehicle swim  safely since work on the project began in  the late 1970's. But recent company docu ments say that ""swim risks could be elimi nated and a  very significant cost saving  achieved  if  the Bradley  fighting vehicle  swim requirement were deleted.""  Henry Boisvert,  the engineer who sued  FMC last week, says he thinks the Bradley  will never prove capable of safely swimming.  In the lawsuit, he asserted that the compa ny inadequately tested the Bradley, falsified  the results of some tests, and withheld from  the Army information developed at Govern ment expense.  Mr. Boisvert, according  to his attorney,  was discharged a month ago when he re fused to sign a report that had been rewrit ten to expunge details of flaws. The compa ny said the engineer, who tested the Brad ley in water over the past year, was laid off  ",1986
1688,1491,18,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, let us not overes timate  the agreement  reached  last week  in  Punta del Este. What has happened  is  that  GATT member nations have agreed to negoti ate for the next 5 to 1 0 years to explore solu tions  to  the many problems besetting  the  international trading system.  Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit is soaring  toward the $200 billion level for 1986-exact ing a staggering  toll  in American  jobs and  businesses. Yet,  the Senate refuses  to take  action on the comprehensive trade bill (H.R.  4800) that was passed by an overwhelming bi partisan majority last May.  The following article by Lane Kirkland, presi dent of the AFL-CIO that appeared in today's  New York Times underscores  the need  for  prompt action by the Congress and the Presi dent to reverse the alarming decline in Ameri ca's industrial base and the living standards of  many American families.  [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 19861  THE FREE-TRADE MYTH Is RuiNING Us  <By Lane Kirkland>  WASHINGTON.-America faces an economic  crisis caused by the Administration's infatu ation with the long dead  theory of ""free  trade."" To deal with that crisis, the Senate  must act quickly on trade reform legislation  passed last May by the House.  Scores of industries, thousands of compa nies and millions of workers are drowning  under a flood of imports generated by for eign government  initiatives and Washing ton's neglect. The effects are felt in every  sector of the economy through plant clos ings, farm foreclosures, bankruptcies and re cession-level unemployment.  Yet, President Reagan insists that ""free  trade and open markets . . . generate more  jobs, a more productive use of a nation's re sources, more  rapid  innovation and high  standards of living both for this nation and  its trading partners."" But free trade doesn't  exist except as an empty slogan. Not a prod uct, commodity or service, including money,  moves across any border except ours under  free trade conditions.  Much of  the world disavows a market  economy and practices the most brutal form  of protectionism: the protection of mercan tile power and profit. Most trade is not open  but directed-directed by governments  in  support of national policies and multina tional corporations that move  labor-inten sive production to countries with the most  exploitable workforce.  There are no open markets among our  trade partners in the European Community,  nor in Japan, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea  and Mexico-not unless ""free and open mar kets"" means import quotas, discriminatory  performance and  inspection requirements,  export subsidies and  incentives,  industrial  targeting programs, controlled currency ex change rates, and barter agreements.  There is no sign of the  jobs that ""free  trade"" supposedly generates. The Labor De partment reports that from 1979 through  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  1984, 11.5 million workers lost jobs because  of plant closings or  layoffs due  to slack  work.  Living standards have not risen. Real av erage weekly earnings for production work ers  fell by 9 percent from 1977  through  1985. Nearly half  the workers displaced  from manufacturing who were lucky to find  jobs were forced to accept lower pay and re duced living standards.  Their loss of jobs has not brought gains to  workers overseas. Too many less developed  nations enjoy booms because workers are  paid rock bottom subsistence wages, are for bidden to organize and bargain collectively  and have no health and safety protection,  no pension, no security.  If ""free trade"" benefits anyone, it is ma nipulators who depress wages in order to in flate profits. They are absolved of guilt by  the ""free trade"" evangelists who say that  our ""over-paid"" workers have ""priced them selves out of the market.""  What is going overseas are not only jobs  that sustain millions of families but the in dustrial  capacity  that  sustains America.  Company after company is no longer a pro ducer but a mere relabeler and distributor  of  imports. And  foreign  label goods sold  across the nation cost no less than products  once made here. The only difference is that  none of the money is returned as wages and  payroll  taxes  to communities where  it  is  spent.  It is wrong to label the Senate trade bill as  ""protectionist."" It is a response to virulent  protectionism, and  its goal  is  to expand  trade by making it a two-way street conduct ed on even terms. President Reagan prom ises to veto it. His supporters fear ""retalia tion."" They argue  that America has no  moral right to require trading partners to  adopt humane labor standards. If other na tions treat workers like dirt, they say, we  must accept ""cultural differences."" And if  our corporations make fat profits because of  those cultural differences, well, that's what  ""free trade"" is about.  Accept  that and you must accept  the  proposition  that  it  is  fair  to allow other  countries,  aided by business and govern ment, to slash American standards of living  and human decency  to the level  that ex ploiters growing  rich off  the  free  trade  myth praise as ""competitive."" Such think ing must be resisted. The labor movement's  historic mission  is not to lower American  standards but to raise them-and, as well, to  raise the world's standards to our level.  H.R. 5225: A SOLUTION FOR THE  INSURANCE CRISIS  HON. GEORGE MILLER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 26, 1986  ",1986
1689,1491,18,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  supported passage of H.R. 5225, the Liability  Risk Retention Act of 1986, which amends the  Product Liability Act to allow businesses and  individuals to form groups in order to facilitate  purchase of liability insurance.  This is a necessary and timely bill.  Last year,  the Select Committee on Chil dren, Youth, and Families, which  I am privi leged to chair, held hearings to investigate the  crisis  in availability and affordability of insur ance for child care providers. Since it began  last summer, this crisis has grown, extending  26583  to foster care, schools, Head Start programs,  and well-established young-serving agencies.  The  burdens  placed  on  these  agencies  have been unacceptable.  In June, at a California hearing, chaired by  the State  insurance  commissioner,  it was  learned  that  until  recently,  32 YMCA's  in  Orange County paid, altogether, $2,800 for li ability coverage. Now, with lower claims limits,  they must pay more than $80,000. What could  justify such an outrageous increase?  According  to  the California  Insurance  for  Child Care Project, 37 4,000 California young sters are  in  child  care  facilities,  including  family day care homes. The mayor of Los An geles, Tom Bradley, estimated in June that 70  percent of these were going without insurance  because rates are so high.  We need a better approach.  The voluntary market assistance plan  in  California, Cal Care, clearly isn't working. The  Los Angeles Times reported that of 4 73 appli cants, out of the thousands without insurance,  only 84 policies had actually been written  under  the plan as of June 1986, because  many child care providers still cannot afford  the rates being offered.  As alarming is the loss of liability insurance  for foster care parents, who are often the last  resort  for  children  abused,  neglected,  or  thrown away. The situation became so severe  in California,  that  foster care parents state wide went on strike,  refusing  to accept any  more children until the State provided assist ance with liability insurance.  In my own district of Contra Costa County,  there are currently only 450 foster homes for  850 children. The county is concerned about  the effect that the rising cost of liability insur ance  is having on  the supply of foster care  homes.  According  to  the  director  of  the  county  social  services  department, more  foster parents are being  lost by  the county  each year than are being gained. The county  was able to pay for coverage  for foster par ents before the cost became so prohibitive.  In addition, it has been estimated that half  of  the 2,000  family day care providers  in  Contra Costa County are operating without in surance, and forcing parents to sign waivers  of provider liability.  According  to  the Diablo Valley Day Care  Providers Association, 35 family day care pro viders have shut down strictly because  they  couldn't afford the insurance.  During the past year, the Children's Founda tion and the National Association for the Edu cation of Young Children released  their own  surveys of child care centers and family day  care homes nationwide. Similar to the findings  of the select committee, they concluded that  there  is no actuarial basis  for  the cancella tions or increases in premiums.  H.R. 5225 is a responsible, important action  that Congress can  take to alleviate some of  the crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.  But we will need to continue our efforts on  all fronts. We look to the States, which have  the authority to regulate the insurance indus try, for a responsible solution to this growing  problem. We also await a responsible, volun tary  response  from  the  insurance  industry  itself. But time is running out.  ",1986
1690,12,23,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, the  trade deficit is approaching $200 bil lion, and yet we have no trade bill be cause very simply, the President of the  United States does not want it.  The President continues  to  allow  unfair foreign partners to rape Ameri can industry. Where is it going to end?  It is not just steel anymore; it is your  industries: electronics, textiles, leather  goods and yes, even agriculture.  What is really dangerous about it,  no one even seems to really care or  notice in this House. We keep defend ing, on this side of the aisle, free en terprise. This  is not free enterprise  anymore;  this  is freeloading. This  is  absolute freeloading and American in terests  including the President right  now are giving birth to a new dinosaur  called the American Industrial Infra structure.  The greatest sin of this administra tion will be, in the 99th Congress, the  President did not address  trade and  the President  failed  to  look at  the  future consequences of a Nation ap proaching a $200 billion trade deficit.  You cannot separate  that from  the  economic problems of this country.  STATEMENTS FOR THE RECORD  ON THE RETIREMENT OF DR.  FREEMAN CARY  <Mr. GAYDOS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1986
1691,12,23,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker, having  had 3 hours of special orders, 2 of  which were used to discuss in detail  trade problems and health and safety  problems, last night I had the honor  and  the privilege of holding  a  60minute special order for our former  House physician, Admiral Cary.  We have substantial participation by  the Members; and on coming in today,  many Members asked whether or not  they could put in prepared statements,  and  I want  to notify my colleagues  today that they have 5 legislative days  as of yesterday to insert these into the  RECORD depending on how long we are  going to be in session.  Mr. Speaker,  I  urge Members  submit those remarks.  to  IMMIGRATION  BILL  HAS  STRONG ANTIDISCRIMINATION  FEATURES  <Mr. FRANK asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1986
1692,12,23,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, paren thetically, I hope we do not have 5 leg islative days left to do anything.  I want to talk a little bit about the  language that has come forward about  a  key provision  in  the  immigration  bill. One section of that bill which re mained law was originally drafted by  the Committee  on  Education  and  Labor under  the guidance of Chair man HAWKINS.  It provides a very tough antidiscrim ination mechanism,  in case sanctions  cause discrimination-we hope they do  not, but they might-and it allows pri vate organization to bring suits if the  administration official charged with  protecting people declines to do so in  some cases.  I  think that is very important, Mr.  Speaker, and  I  look  forward  to  its  working well. Some people in the ad ministration had a great fear that this  was going to lead to abuse; so some  statements were made by the chair man of the Committee on the Judici ary here and the chairman of the Sub committee of the Judiciary on Immi gration  in  the other body, stressing  that this was not intended to be used  to harass people.  I have no problem with those state ments being made; except some of the  language, particularly  in  the other  body, suggested that there would be  reason  to  fear  that some of  these  ",1986
1693,90,23,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker, fur ther reserving the right to object,  I  yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio  [Ms. OAKAR].  ",1986
1694,90,23,Ms. OAKAR.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the  Members who are responsible for this  legislation  brought  by  the  distin guished chairman from California and  the minority leader.  I really was going to say about the  same  thing.  I  think  that Senator  PEPPER is living proof concerning why  we should not have mandatory retire ment and I think this bill symbolizes  something even beyond those individ uals who are past the age of 70 or so.  There are many unemployed work er~ who are over 50 years, particular  men in many ways, who cannot find a  job because of age discrimination. So  if we think that age discrimination is  not a difficulty for so many individ uals, male and female,  it really  is.  I  think this bill symbolizes the whole  area of civil rights related to age dis crimination that we  really have not  forthrightly addressed.  Of course, the chairman of the Sub committee on Health and the Commit tee on Rules, the former chairman of  the Aging Committee, has really been  the champion in this area. I remember  going to a birthday party a couple of  years ago for Senator PEPPER and all  of the people at the head table were  over 70 years of age. The MC was Bob  Hope  from my home of Cleveland,  who now I think is about 82 years old  or so. So all the kids were up there  celebrating Senator PEPPER's birthday  and they are all living proof of why we  should abandon that form of discrimi nation.  I want to compliment you, Senator,  in particular.  ",1986
1695,90,23,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker, fur ther reserving the right to object,  I  would say that in my mind this bill is  been made. My  feelings  are  very  strong that through the utilization of  BFOQ's we do not need to have ex emptions, we only need transition periods. We have provided the necessary  nnproved by  the changes  that have  transition periods  for  the  respective  groups that are included in this.  So  I would urge  that the bill be  adopted.  The Senate has made two major changes  to  the bill. First,  the exemption  for  law en forcement officers and firefighters will be limit ed to 7 years. This is an issue of concern to  law enforcement officers in my State as well  as many others. The 7 -year exemption will  give  the Secretary of Labor and  the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission the op portunity to complete the studies mandated by  the bill on the use of fitness tests as appropri ate measures of the competency of police of ficers and  firefighters to perform the require ments of their jobs. While I do not favor per manent exemptions from civil rights laws, I do  recognize the special problems that may arise  for  firefighters and  law enforcement officers  and can support a transition period. The stud ies should help determine whether  individual  testing for these jobs is a feasible alternative  to a blanket exemption.  Second,  the Senate amendment provides  for a 7 -year exemption  for  tenured  faculty  members at colleges and universities. This  temporary exemption  recognizes  the special  demographic problems of institutions of higher  education, who  took  on  additional  faculty  during the years when ""baby boomers"" were  of college age. Most faculty openings occur  only upon death or retirement of faculty mem bers. Therefore, if mandatory retirement were  immediately eliminated for college faculty, the  continued employment of these faculty mem bers hired during a time of expanding enroll ments might result in a shortage of openings  for new college faculty members. Opportuni ties for new professors and researchers with  new  ideas and new ways of  thinking, and  skilled  in  emerging  disciplines, might  be  scarce. Continuation  of present mandatory  policies  for a  temporary period of  time will  help alleviate these pressures. In addition, the  7 -year  exemption will  give  institutions  of  higher  learning  the opportunity  to reexamine  the tenure system and to determine, in light of  the  elimination  of  mandatory  retirement,  whether structural changes might be appropri ate or whether  incentives should be offered  for early retirement.  Mr. Speaker, this bill guarantees for senior  citizens a fundamental right that many of us  take for granted: The right to work and earn a  living. I commend the gentleman from Florida  for his  invaluable  leadership and  tireless ef forts on this measure.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva tion of objection.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  KILDEE). Is there objection to the ini tial  request of  the gentleman  from  California?  There was no objection.  A motion to reconsider was laid on  the table.

1702,259,23,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I shall not vote  for H.R. 5300, the reconciliation bill. The recon  ciliation  process was  intended  to  reduce  spending, but this bill merely raises taxes and  sells assets. The spending baseline continues  inexorably upward.  I take strong objection  to one of the new  taxes, euphemistically  titled a custom's user  fee. User fees are good, but only if applied to  clearly defined services with a reasonable fee  basis.  The user fee in H.R. 5300 has no reasonable  basis, and it is not identified with any service. It  is based on merchandise trade value only.  It will develop,  in  fiscal year 1987, about  $850 million in new revenues. That's more than  we will spend on all salaries and expenses of  the entire Customs Service.  It amounts  to  about a 7 -percent surtax on total customs du ties, and  therefore will be subject to protest,  retaliation and mirror laws by all our trading  partners.  It's a shame we could not have cut some  spending  in  the bill. Actually, H.R. 5300  in creases the spending baseline by over $2 bil lion. It's a shame we are raising taxes in this  bill. The new taxes are nearly $4 billion.  Again we have missed an opportunity, and  missed it by a mile.  I shall vote against the bill.  ",1986

1707,259,23,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of  the conference report  with respect to certain pension provi sions.  Mr. Speaker, for the second time this year  an omnibus budget  reconciliation bill before  this Congress has been expanded into much  more  than a budget bill.  It should be noted  that the bill before us is also a pension bill  which extends valuable pension accrual pro tections to older Americans who work beyond  normal retirement age.  It is  important for this body to understand  what this ""Older Americans Pension Benefits""  provision does and does not do. What it does  is prevent a covered employee pension bene fit plan  from eliminating or reducing an em ployee's pension benefit accruals, because of  the attainment of any age,  for the period of  employment after  the employee attains  the  normal retirement age under his or her plan.  This is accomplished by means of a coordi nated amendment to the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act  [ADEA],  the Employee Re tirement Income Security Act [ERISA], and the  Internal Revenue Code.  In  this coordinated  fashion  the amendments also make  it clear  that pension benefit accruals prior to normal  retirement age meet the age nondiscrimination  provisions if they also conform to the benefit  accrual  rules described  in  section  204 of  ERISA and section 411 (b) of the Internal Rev enue Code. The requirement that the Depart ments of  the Treasury and Labor and  the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  issue identical regulations on the same issues  and  that  they be consistent  in all other re gards (given that the scope of plans covered  is different under each statute) should provide  a measure of comfort to employees in under standing their rights and to plan sponsors in  understanding their obligations.  It should also be understood that these pro visions do not require pension plans to pro vide post-normal retirement age henefit accru als  in every  instance. The  legislation makes  clear  that  factors other  than age-such as  plan cost, years of service or participation,  nondiscrimination requirements for the highly  compensated and other restrictions and limita tions on contributions and benefits under the  Internal Revenue Code, et cetera-are either  allowed or required to be taken into account  in a  fashion which may reduce or eliminate  post-normal retirement age accruals.  In addi tion, plans which provide or are required  to  provide actuarial or similar post-normal retire ment age adjustments are allowed to take into  account the value of such adjustments as an  offset to the value of the benefit accrual oth erwise required during each plan year. Plans  which pay out some or all of the pension ben efits accrued at the time of normal retirement  age are also to be treated in a similar fashion  to plans which delay payment but provide for  an actuarially equivalent increase.  In  summary,  these age nondiscrimination  amendments to ERISA, ADEA, and the Inter nal Revenue Code remove a significant disin centive for older Americans to continue work",1986
1708,272,23,Mr. COELHO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of those provisions contained  in  the budget  reconciliation package  relating  to  the Farm  Credit System. This legislation is critically im portant  to  the  farmers and  ranchers of this  country.  Last May 14, this body adopted overwhelm ingly, by a vote of 407-0, a  resolution au thored by my colleague  from Georgia, Mr.  THOMAS, urging  the Farm Credit Administra tion to permit system institutions greater flexi bility in their day-to-day business affairs. I was  pleased to have had a part in crafting a new  provision, which was  incorporated  into  that  resolution. The additional  language  stated:  ""consistent with the purposes and objectives  of the Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985,  the Farm Credit Administration should limit its  involvement in system business affairs to only  those situations where safety and soundness  are primary concerns. The Farm Credit Admin istration should permit production credit asso ciations, Federal land banks and banks for co operatives to have flexibility in adjusting their  interest  rates  to more  accurately  reflect  changing market conditions so as to more ac curately reflect changing market conditions so  as to remain competitive  in agricultural  lend ing, consistent with  the capital needs of the  system.""  While it has been nearly 5 months since we  adopted  the Thomas resolution, House Con current Resolution 310, we have before us  today legislation which removes FCA from the  interest rate approval process. However, I am  concerned that FCA may still try to effectively  control  interest rates through misuse of their  safety and soundness and capital adequacy  regulations.  The policy statement in the farm credit pro visions of this package states that borrowers  from  system  institutions are  to derive  the  greatest benefit practicable  from  the  legisla tion. It is not the intent of Congress that FCA  resort  to any back door method  to  require  system  institutions  to charge  interest  rates  which are either noncompetitive or exceed  rates generally charged by other commercial  lenders on similar loans. Any attempt by FCA  to exercise this type of control would be se verely detrimental  to  the  farmers,  ranchers  and cooperatives that borrow from  the Farm  Credit System.  Our Farm Credit System  institutions obtain  the funds they lend to farmers by selling secu rities  in  the Nation's money markets. Some  have asked how the financial community will  react to the Farm Credit proposal we are considering today. The answer can be found in a  memorandum prepared by Allerton Smith of  the Wall Street brokerage firm of L.F. Roths child, Unterberg, Towbin,  Inc.  In  this memo,  Mr. Smith discusses what he sees as the two  crucial elements of this legislation: lowering in terest rates to borrowers and method to delay  the anticipated need for Federal financial as sistance.  Mr. Smith rightly points out that this legisla tion simply defers losses in order to achieve  what are  important and productive ends  for  the Farm Credit System. He continues,  ""We  are less concerned with the accounting treat ment of system losses under the new act than  with  the  reality of  the problems  the system  currently faces. Any reduction in the rate of in terest charged its borrowers will not only pre serve system market share, but also conserve  system  capital and  slow  the  rate  of  loan  losses. The time when the system might ulti mately require Federal financial assistance will  be postponed, and  the additional breathing  space the act provides improves the system's  chances of surviving independently. Since the  system can fund the losses with cash raised  in  the capital markets,  this solution  is work able and the ends certainly justify the means.""  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  the farm credit provisions  in H.R. 5300, and  submit the memorandum by Mr. Allerton Smith  to be reprinted in the RECORD at this point:  THE FARM CREDIT SYSTEM PROPOSES To USE  DEFERRED Loss AccouNTING  The Farm Credit System [FCSJ has pro posed a new plan which would allow it to  both lower its cost of loans to farm borrow ers and delay indefinitely its anticipated re quest for Federal financial assistance. The  plan is to defer losses, which while question able from a strict accounting viewpoint, will  achieve several  important and productive  ends for the FCS. Our investment conclu sion is that the plan would be neutral for  FCS bond prices, since the short term costs  are at least matched by the long term bene fits. We are  less concerned with  the ac counting treatment of FCS losses under the  new act than the reality of the problems the  FCS currently faces. Any reduction in the  rate of interest charged its borrowers will  not only preserve FCS market share, but  also conserve FCS capital and slow the rate  of  loan  losses. The  time when  the FCS  might ultimately  require federal  financial  assistance will be postponed, and the addi tional breathing space the act provides im proves the FCS' chances of surviving inde pendently. Since  the FCS can  fund  the  losses with the cash raised  in the capital  markets, this solution is workable, and the  ends certainly justify the means.  The proposal is the Farm Credit System  Borrower Interest Rate Relief Act of 1986.  The FCS has issued a large volume of high  coupon,  long  term non-callable debt over  the last several years. As a consequence, the  FCS average cost of funds is 10.6 percent,  which is far above competing financial insti tutions. In addition, the FCS has high over head expense. All  these costs are passed  through  to FCS  farmer-borrowers which  makes rate on FCS loans non-competitive  with  other  financial  institutions.  The  market share of the FCS has eroded be cause of this differential in rates: FCS loans  outstanding have fallen to $61.5 billion at 6/  30/86 from $66.6 billion at 12/31/85, and  $78.4 billion at 12/31/84.  The FCS had asked the Farm Credit Ad ministration <its  regulator>  to allow  it  to  lower the rate it charged on its loans, but  the FCA refused on the grounds that lend ing at a negative spread would speed the  erosion of FCS capital. The new proposal  would take the rate setting power out of the  hands of the FCA and place it with the 37  district banks of  the FCS. This change,  since it is endorsed by the Congress, would  not stand in the way of any future needed  financial assistance.  The new act would allow  the FCS  to  charge a competitive rate to its borrowers  and capitalize the difference between the  actual cost of its funds and the prevailing  market rate. The capitalized interest would  be amortized as an expense over  twenty  years. Alternatively, the FCS could defense  the high coupon bonds and capitalize the  premium, also using a twenty year amortiza tion.  In addition, the FCS could, upon approval  from the FCA, capitalize their annual provi sion for loan losses, which was in excess of  one-half of one percent of loans outstand ing, and amortize it over 20 years.  The FCS stands  to have  its operating  losses reduced by up to $1 billion annually  under the proposal. While the deferred loss  treatment is not in accordance with general ly accepted accounting principles it is not  uncommon in regulatory reporting for the  thrift industry. This process would reduce  the market erosion the System is experienc ing and  reduce  the debt service  require ments on many farmers. The System's cap ital would be conserved by the retention of  borrowers <since they supply the funds for  the FCS Capital Stock and Participation  Certificates> and market share would be  maintained by competitive rates. In addi tion, a  reduction  in  the  rate of  interest  charged  to  the  FCS  farmer /borrowers  would help prevent many marginal farmers  from defaulting,  thus  reducing FCS  loan  write-offs.  Last week before Congress, H. Brent Bees ley, Chief Executive of  the Farm Credit  Corporation of America discussed the Sys tem's future financial prospects. He report ed that a projected System loss of $1.7 bil lion for 1986 compares to a loss of $2.7 bil lion recorded for the year ending December  31, 1985. In addition, System projections re flect losses of $1.1 billion in 1987 and $600  million in 1988. The System's surplus is pro jected to decline to $1.7 billion by year-end  1986, to $600 million by year-end 1987 and  to a negative $100 million at December 31,  1988. Beesley cautioned that there are many  uncertainties surrounding these projections.  Changes in such factors as general interest rate  levels,  federal  farm programs,  land  values and commodity prices could alter the  projected results significantly. At the same  time the General Accounting Office project ed FCS losses of $2.9 billion in 1986, which  would  reduce  surplus  to $354 million.  seems clear that without a drastic change in  either the farm economy or the accounting  system used by the FCS, federal aid would  be needed soon.  While it is not certain that this measure  would be sufficient for the FCS to avoid re questing Federal financial assistance, it re duces the amount of assistance that might  ultimately be needed. The FCS manage ment is fighting to avoid the need to request  assistance, and to miminize the amount of  assistance  that might be  requested. This  new proposal seems a logical and favorable  step towards reducing and delaying the FCS  needs for assistance from the Treasury.  It  ",1986

1714,285,23,Mr. DIOGUARDI.," I  tleman for yielding.  I would  like  to clarify a point on  this. I have gotten several letters on  these Olmsted properties, the concern  being that they were listing properties  that were not strictly Olmsted proper ties but done by the studios or done by  the firm and not by Olmsted himself.  One of these properties is in my dis trict, the Society of New York Hospi tal property, 230 acres.  Could the gentleman clarify this for  me please?  ",1986
1715,285,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," We have done  two things. We have greatly narrowed  the definition of what works by the  Olmsted brothers firm are covered by  this legislation in terms of listing the  works and, second, in order to elimi nate the original source of the com plaint, we have simply made it clear  that the New York Hospital property,  by name, is simply removed from the  bill. So that that eliminates the source  of that complaint.  Mr. DioGUARDI. So the bill recog nizes that the 230 acres of Westchest er County for New York Hospital  is  specifically excluded from  the provi sions of this bill.  ",1986
1716,285,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Yes. On page 6  of the bill it provides ""notwithstand ing any other provisions of this title,  no provision of this title shall apply to  the approximately 230 acres of proper ty owned by the Society of the New  York Hospital on Bloomingdale Road  in White Plains, New York.""  Mr. DioGUARDI. So this is an ex plicit recognition that that property is  not an Olmsted property.  ",1986
1717,285,23,Mr. SEIBERLING., No;  it  simply  says it is not covered by the bill. We  cannot rewrite history as to who did  the  landscaping. We  are  explicitly  stating as explicitly as you can that it  is not covered by the bill.  ,1986

TITLE II-OLMSTED HERITAGE  LANDSCAPES  SEC. 201. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.  The Congress finds and declares that(1) Frederick Law Olmsted, Senior,  the  premier  American  landscape  architect  during the nineteenth century, is considered  the father of landscape architecture in the  United States;  (2) Olmsted's philosophy and designs in fluenced  the  development  of  landscapes  through  the Nation,  including National,  State, and  local parks,  forests, parkways,  scenic reservations, college campuses, cities  and planned communities, and publicly and  privately owned estates, institutions, ceme teries, and recreation areas.  (3) Through the partnership formed by  Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., Olmsted's sons,  and their associates carried out his philoso phy and designs well into the twentieth cen tury and, coupled with the achievements of  Olmsted himself, have  left a  tremendous  legacy of historic landscapes and a philoso phy that continues to benefit the American  people and people throughout the world.  (4) Olmsted's social responsibility, ecologi cal sensitivity, and landscape design creativ ity have inspired the development of large  urban parks  for public benefit  in urban  areas through the United States, creating a  legacy of parks which today constitute a sin gular feature of the urban experience.  <5) Age, overuse, deteriorating infrastruc ture, inadequate maintenance, and inappro priate developments threaten many of these  historic landscapes.  (6) Although voluntary, private efforts  have been initiated to identify, commemo rate,  restore,  and  preserve  the Olmsted  legacy, the size and complexity of the task  place the Federal Government, by virtue of  its expertise relating to parks and historic  preservation,  in an especially appropriate  position to assist in public and private ef forts  to  identify and  record  the Olmsted  legacy.

1722,376,23,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 min utes  to  the distinguished gentleman  from Minnesota [Mr. 0BERSTAR].  ",1986
1723,376,23,Mr. OBERST AR.," I thank the gentle man for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 6, and to commend the leader ship of the House Public Works and  Transportation Committee, our chair man, the gentleman from New Jersey  [Mr. HoWARD];  the Water Resources  Subcommittee chairman,  the gentle man from New Jersey [Mr. RoE]; our  ranking Member, the gentleman from  Kentucky [Mr. SNYDER]; and subcom mittee  ranking member,  the gentle man  from Minnesota  [Mr.  STANGE LAND]. All have labored heroically over  many months, indeed many years, to  bring us the first water resources con ference report sirtce 1976. I especially  commend them for the consideration  they have given to the very real needs  and concerns of the people of Minne sota.  Mr. Speaker, at this point I would  like  to engage  the gentleman  from  New Jersey, the chairman of the Sub committee on Water Resources  [Mr.  RoE]  in a  colloquy on section 732,  shoreline erosion damage on Lake Su perior.  This section, first, requires the corps  to determine  the extent of United  States shoreline erosion damage caus ally related to the regulation of Lake  Superior water levels by  the United  States/Canada  International  Joint  Commission. The  corps  is  then  to  report  the results of  this survey  to  Congress and, if justified, to include in  that  report  recommendations  of  a  methodology for and a determination  of the costs of indemnifying individual  property owners and a recommended  schedule for indemnification.  Under any reading of this language,  it would seem that once damages have  ""causally related"" to regulation by the  IJC-which frequently stores water in  Lake Superior to alleviate water level  damages in lower lakes-this causal re lationship would  automatically pro vide a basis on which to ""justify"" in demnification; and  thus  require  the  corps to provide the recommendations  of a methodology for and a determina tion of the costs of indemnifying indi vidual property owners, and the rec ommended schedule for  indemnifica tion.  Is this the gentleman's understand ing of the section?  ",1986
1724,376,23,Mr. ROE.," Yes, the gentleman's ob servations of the intent of the commit tee and the conferees is correct.  ",1986

1728,376,23,Mr. EVANS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I understand section 1104 of the bill  agreed  to by  the conference  report  provides $15 million for needed reha bilitation of the Hennepin Canal  in  west-central Illinois under an existing  contractual obligation.  I want to congratulate the chairman  for ensuring that this funding was in cluded in the conference report. The  same amount was contained  in  this  year's House-passed  version  of  the  water projects bill and was also ap proved by the House last Congress.  The funding contained in this bill  will  fulfill  contractual  obligations  made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engi neers when the canal was turned over  to the State. Needed repairs on the  waterworks of the canal, long held up  by lawsuits and bureaucratic redtape,  can now proceed.  The Hennepin is a historically sig nificant and structurally unique canal  which was a  forerunner of the con struction techniques and waterworks  used in Panama. This canal, by defini tion, begins at the Mississippi River  and runs the breadth of the 17th Con gressional District. The  Illinois and  Michigan Canal, which starts in Chica go, meets the Hennepin Canal at the  Illinois River to form a waterway cor ridor across the entire State and can  potentially become  a  leading  recre ational area in our State and a draw  for tourists.  We in west-central Illinois who have  grown up with this canal, who swam  and fished in it as kids, and who recog nize its historical significance will fi nally be able to see this canal devel oped to its fullest for recreational pur poses.  I congratulate the chairman and the  conferees  for  their hard work and  thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1986

1730,376,23,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  conference agreement on H.R. 6,  the  Water Resources Development Act of  1986.  To say that this landmark piece of  legislation is long overdue is a classic  understatement. H.R. 6  is  the  first  major water  resources  development  bill in 16 years. In fact, we have not  had an omnibus bill of any kind en acted since 1976, although that short coming certainly has not been for a  lack of concerted effort on the part of  both Houses of Congress and the ad ministration.  ",1986
1731,389,23,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker,  the conference  report on the Water Resources Conservation,  Development and  Infrastructure  Improvement  and Rehabilitation Act of 1986, H.R. 6, repre sents a reasonable compromise with the other  body on  the  insular areas provisions which  were  included by  the Committee on  Interior  and  Insular Affairs. Three of the  four provi sions which were passed by  the House and  deleted by the Senate are included.  Improvements to the harbor at Saipan in the  Northern Mariana  Islands would be author ized. This $14 million project, reported on by  the Corps of Engineers under the Omnibus In sular Areas Act of 1980, is vital  to the eco nomic development of the Commonwealth.  Improvements  to  the  Commonwealth's  water system would be reauthorized. The re maining amounts to be appropriated-perhaps  as much as $12.3 million of the $15 million ini tially authorized by the Omnibus Insular Areas  Act of 1984-are vital  to  the health of our  fellow Americans  there as well as  the eco nomic development of the newest member of  the American political family.  A waiver of all cost-sharing requirements up  to $200,000 for Corps of Engineers projects in  American Samoa, Guam,  the Northern Mari ana Islands, and the Virgin  Islands would be  authorized. This clarifies  the waiver of any  matching requirements in all Federal programs  authorized by a series of omnibus  insular  areas acts.  I hope that this will be the last time that the  Congress needs to make such a clarification  and  that  all  agencies will  implement  the  waiver as  the Congress has  reiterated  so  often it intends. To disgress for a moment,  I  note,  for example,  that Secretary Bowen  is  currently reviewing the Department of Health  and Human Services'  interpretation  that  the  waiver does not apply  to  the Child Support  Enforcement Program; I hope that he will rec ognize that this policy is contrary to congres sional intent.  The waiver effectively requires the corps and all other agencies-to add  the waived  amount to their contribution to a project's total  cost. Because of this, agencies should allo cate budgetary resources to the insular areas  that  are  sufficient  for  necessary  insular  projects and programs.  The conference agreement does not au thorize  the Corps of Engineers  to construct  projects in  insular areas which have a cost benefit  ratio of  less  than  1.0, a provision  which was included in the House bill. Opposi tion  from  the Reagan administration and  the  other side of the Capitol compelled this com promise.  Corps officers  recognize  that  flexibility  in  evaluating water resources projects in insular  areas is warranted because the standards that  are usually applied give inadequate weight to  unique insular circumstances and needs. The  bipartisan leadership of the Committee on In terior and  Insular Affairs,  therefore,  intends  that this problem be addressed in future legis lation.  Members of the Committee on Interior and  Insular Affairs were not conferees on another  provision of  the bill which originated  in  the  committee but which was amended by  the  Committee on Ways and Means. The confer ence report amends the House-passed provi sion to provide an exemption for all of the in sular areas from the new harbor use tax which  the bill would levy for cargo shipped between  the insular areas and  the United States and  within the insular areas.  Distant from supplies and markets and gen erally underdeveloped,  the  insular areas are  far more dependent upon expensive ocean  shipping and would be far more adversely im pacted by a tax on cargo than other areas of  the Nation. Most  consumer and  business  goods and materials must be  imported and  most products must be exported in the case  of the insular areas. Additionally, if a tax had  been applied to them in most cases it prob ably would have to have been paid over to the  insular governments since they generally re ceive the proceeds of Federal collections.  Finally, I would like to express my apprecia tion for the cooperation of the chairman of the  Committee on Public Works and Transporta tion, JIM HowARD, on the provisions of the bill  affecting the U.S. insular areas. I also want to  thank other leaders of that committee for their  efforts on  these provisions: Boa RoE; GENE  SNYDER; and ARLAN STANGELAND. The chair man of the Committee on Ways and Means,  DAN ROSTENKOWSKI, and our colleague from  Hawaii, DAN AKAKA, have also been very help ful.  I must additionally recognize the work of the  members of the Committee on Interior and In sular Affairs who are responsible for the insu lar areas provisions: conferees RON DE LuGo,  ",1986

1756,467,23,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, let me in dicate we have been trying to come to gether with some language that might  satisfy the concerns of those who have  an interest in the T -46. I am not cer tain we can do that. Maybe we have  reached the point that we ought to be  permitted to vote up or down on the  Goldwater amendment. In exactly 40  minutes, if there will not be any CR  over here by then, we will have,  in  many cases, nonessential Federal em ployees who will be told to go home.  I do not think that is what anybody  would  like  to have happen.  I have  been visiting with the chairman of the  committee. He is willing to make some  modification.  It would seem to me that we have  reached the point where we have to  make a determination if the majority  of this body is going to be able to work  its will, a clear majority, a substantial  majority, 75 to 80 percent who want to  go on and finish the CR. I know the  chairman, Senator HATFIELD, does, and  also  the  distinguished  ranking  Member, Senator STENNIS.  0 1120  I hope we can bring that to a close  shortly after the cloture vote. We have  reconciliation, we have a clean water  bill that is important to a lot of people  in this body. All of that can be done in  a matter of hours-2 or 3 or 4 hours if we can somehow get beyond  the  logjam right here.  There are no other amendments in  order to this CR. We can dispose of  this whole thing in 20 minutes if they  would just let us vote on the Gold water amendment.  Would  the Senator  from Arizona  allow me to yield to the senior Senator  from Arizona?  ",1986
1757,467,23,Mr. DECONCINI., I am happy to do  that.  ,1986

The Senator was in the  room  last night when  the Chief of  Staff of the Air Force and all of their  top Secretaries stated unequivocally  that  they would not  take  that air plane-for the simple reason that we  do not have the money.  I think the Senator will recall that  the Chief of Staff said that we are  going to lose three fighter wings in the  next 4 years; we are going to lose a  search-and-rescue  squadron  and  a  weather squadron. That indicates only  one  thing: They are running out of  money and we are starting  to  lose  troops.  We  cannot make  any  agreement  with the proponents of the T-46 that  involves money. I do not want to be  ",1986
1760,480,23,Mr. DECONCINI.,"  I want to thank  the Senator from Kentucky for giving  me a very  important message about  my quality of life and I am not going  to put that in the RECORD, but the  Senator is correct.  I thank the Senator.  Let me continue because I know the  Senator from Kentucky wants this in formation and I would not want him  to be without it.  Total  investment costs  for  this option  would also be less than for the T-46 by 23  percent. Twenty-year costs, however, would  be 2 percent higher because investment sav ings are offset by higher operating costs  <see Summary Table and Alternative IV A  in the text).  On the other hand, if the Air Force ob tained improvements in utilization similar  to those it expects for the T-46, this option  would be substantially cheaper in terms of  total investment (46 percent> and in terms  of 20-year costs <16 percent). <See Summary  Table and Alternative IV B  in the  text.)  Currently, the Air Force believes that the  T -46 can be operated 60 hours per month,  but that the T-37-even though extensively  improved-could not get above its current  level of 45 hours per month. Since many of  the factors that lead to assumed improve ments  in utilization of the T -46 are also  part of  this major modification,  it would  seem reasonable  to expect some  improve ment in the utilization of the modified T-37,  though it might be difficult to achieve 60  hours of monthly utilization. Absent a good  assessment  of  potential  utilization,  this  analysis shows both cases. In both cases,  there should be less uncertainty about T-37  operating costs than about the T-46 because  the Air Force has had extensive experience  with the plane.  MINOR MODIFICATIONS OF THE T-37  If funds are stringent over the next few  years, Air Force needs could be met at least  partially  through  less extensive modifica tions of the T-37, such as modifications nec essary to extend the life of the aircraft or  those plus new engines. While these alterna tives would be 35 to 69 percent cheaper in  terms of total investment than continuing  with the T-46 or making major modifica tions of the T-37, they would only be 3 per cent to 12 percent cheaper in terms of 20year costs as  lower  investment costs are  offset by higher operating costs <see Sum mary Table and Alternatives I and II in the  text>. Moreover, in the long run, past the 20  years of  this analysis,  the advantages of  lower investment costs would be outweighed  by higher operating costs for these alterna tives. Also, these more limited modifications  would not provide  the  improvements  in  safety and utilization that the Air Force be lieves are important.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that a  summary  table entitled  ""Comparison of Alternatives"" be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the table  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  SUMMARY TABLE.-COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES  Alternative  AlternatM! number  in paper  Investment costs  NY~~ 3 5  Total 2  20-yr  costs 1  Continue ~n~ the T--46 ......

1761,480,23,Mr. DECONCINI.," Now, Mr. Presi dent, I  think that clearly points out  the great advantages that having the  T -46 move ahead would bring to our  national security and, of course, to the  defense of this country.  It is important, Mr. President, to re alize  that the Air Force has money  constraint problems, and we all under stand that, and the Air Force has de cided-only  for  this  fiscal  year,  I  might point out, because they have re quested funds for  this all the other  years-not to request funds for  this  aircraft and yet to continue to advance  and expand the F-15 and the F-16.  Now, that is an interesting decision  they have made because those are the  most sophisticated flying machines in  the world and  they  require a great  deal of training. Of course, where do  we train these pilots? We train them  in the T-37. We have  just indicated  through this report that there are cer tain misgivings about continuation of  that, certainly without major modifi cations which would take some period  of  time, a commitment for a  lot of  money to continue to use the T -37.  So going to the T -46 would satisfy  this and, quite  frankly,  ensure  the  safety of our pilots. What can be more  important than taking a new pilot or a  new  officer  in  the Air Force  and  thrusting them into this very techni cal field, with high proficiency needed  and have them launch into a  trainer  that is 25 years old,  that has  inad equate  avionics,  cannot  go  above  25,000 feet, even in the area of Arizona  where they are trained, in some of the  busiest airways now because of the tre mendous commercial  traffic  in  that  area. We are asking them to continue  to use a very antiquated trainer. So  there is ample need already to proceed  at least as we have talked before in  the area of compromise as to the 1986  funds.  0 1510  Now I want to read section 1 of this  Congressional Budget Office  report,  called the introduction:  SECTION I. INTRODUCTION  In 1982,  the Air Force contracted with  Fairchild Republic Company to begin pro ducing a  new  trainer aircraft,  the T -46.  Fairchild, however, has faced problems de veloping the aircraft. Fairchild's costs for  the first lot of 10 T-46 aircraft will exceed  the amount budgeted by about 80 percent  <an excess that Fairchild absorbed), and last  year Fairchild had many discrepancies on a  contractor review. For this reason, because  of the fiscally constrained budget environ ment, and possibly for other reasons, the  Air Force has not put any money into its  1987 budget for further purchases of the T46. Instead, the service is considering alter natives to continued production of the T-46.  Some  in  the Congress have  expressed  strong preferences  in regard  to  this pro gram. In 1985, for example, the conference  report of the House and Senate Appropria tions Committees on the 1986 appropriation  for the Department of Defense stated, ""The  conferees expect the Air Force to budget for  and procure T -46 Aircraft  in  fiscal year  1987, where firm fixed price contract op",1986

1778,493,23,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I have  spoken many  times on  the Senate  floor over the past several months of  my concern over the safety of our air  traffic system. The incidence of midair  collisions continues to rise. Last year,  526 individuals lost their lives aboard  U.S. carriers. It was one of the worst  years in terms of lives lost, and was  the worst year for air accidents since  Congress deregulated the domestic air line industry in 1978.  As a member of the Senate Appro priations Subcommittee on Transpor tation, I have reviewed the requests of  the Federal Aviation Administration  [FAAl  and have  closely questioned  FAA officials that appeared before our  subcommittee. The  bottom  line  in  FAA testimony before our subcommit tee has been that we have the safest  system in the world.  Yet, over and again, we read in the  newspapers or hear on the news of an other airplane crash that has taken  lives.  Because of growing concern over the  safety of our air traffic system, I intro duced legislation <S. 2417) to establish  a seven-member Aviation Safety Com mission to make a complete study of  the organization and functions of the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  [FAA]. Although  this measure was  passed by the Senate on September 11,  because of the shortness of time re maining  in  the  99th Congress,  it  became clear that the House of Repre sentatives would not be able to act on  the bill prior to adjournment. There fore, I offered an amendment to the  continuing resolution to establish that  Commission, and  I  am pleased  that  those provisions were agreed to by the  joint House-Senate  conference  com mittee.  This Commission will undertake a  comprehensive,  independent study of  the FAA and its responsibilities. Be cause of the tremendous  increase  in  the volume of air traffic, it is impera tive that we have an independent, in  depth study of the organization and  functions of  the FAA  to determine  whether or not the dual functions of  promoting and regulating the aviation  industry are in conflict.  In view of the increasing number of  air tragedies and the growing concern  over FAA's ability to meet the chal lenges brought about by the dramatic  growth of the airline  industry,  it  is  vital that this Commission be estab lished as expeditiously as possible. The  report of the Commission will be com pleted within 9 months of the enact ment of this legislation, and will prove  invaluable to the Congress in its ef forts to restore the margin of aviation  safety.  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  LABOR,  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION AND RELAT  ED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS  ",1986
1779,493,23,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise to  emphasize a provision in the confer ence committee report on the Depart ment of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and education and  related  agencies  appropriations  bill  as  the  measure relates to funding the Lister  Hill Center for health policy.  When the labor, HHS and education  appropriations bill was adopted by the  Senate on September 10, 1986, by a  vote of 83 yeas to 12 nays, it provided  $5,000,000 for a Federal contribution  to endow  the Lister Hill Center for  Health Policy at the University of Ala bama at Birmingham.  The committee report which accom panies the bill contains the following  wording which  fully  explained  the  statutory  language embodied  in  the  labor, HHS and education and related  agencies appropriations bill:  The  establishment  of  the Lister Hill  Center for Health Policy honors in his own  State the memory of a great Senator whose  legislative achievements  in public health,  biomedical  research,  and  hospital  care  eamed him the title of the Nation's ""states man for health"". The Center would be dedi cated, as was Senator Hill, to improving the  quality of our health care system. It would  function as a national center for the ad vancement of disease prevention and health  promotion, and would work specifically to  refocus national health policy upon such  goals as  the development of a  proactive  health care system, the integration of treat ment and prevention strategies and the re duction of  societally  imposed  threats  to  health. The Hill Center would support re search and scholarship on prevention topics,  and its activities would include the estab lishment of a program of Lister Hill Health  Fellows, who would receive support to serve  as congressional staff knowledgeable in the  area of prevention.  Mr. President, similar provisions re lating  to  the Lister Hill Center for  Health Policy, unfortunately, were not  included  in  the Labor, Health and  Human Services  appropriations  bill  passed by  the House of Representa tives. When  the House and Senate  conferees convened  to work out the  differences  in  the  two  respective  Chamber's versions of the Labor, HHS  and education appropriations bill, the  House conferees agreed that the Lister  Hill Center should be  fully  funded.  Adequate funds were included in the  bill to enable the Secretary of Health  and Human Services  to make  this  grant for the Lister Hill Center.  The conference committee report ac companying the bill contains language  that clearly states that the conference  agreement includes the $5 million to  endow  the Lister Hill Center.  is  clear that the conference committee  report  intends  that  the Lister Hill  Center be funded in the full amount  of $5 million.  Mr. President, it is important to note  that in as much as the conferees agree  to appropriate sufficient funds for the  Lister Hill Center, it is crystal clear  that it was the intent of Congress in  passing  the  fiscal year 1987 Labor,  HHS and education appropriations bill  to endow the Lister Hill Center.  Certainly, there is ample precedence  for  earmarking  funds  in appropria tions bills to honor outstanding indi viduals and for other purposes. For exIt  ",1986
1780,506,23,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  question is on agreeing to the confer ence report.  I suggest that that document and his  reading of its clear terms should su persede any subsequent informal oral  expressions made by a U.S. official to  Senators or to anyone else and should  lay the issue to rest. In fact, it seems  clear that the United States offer was  not to eliminate all strategic nuclear  weapons. No such offer was or is on  the table. No such offer need be with drawn because in fact no such offer  was ever made.  I also find curious that portion of  the statement of  the Senator  from  Georgia having to do with the wisdom  of an offer  to eliminate all ballistic  missiles. There are several interesting  points.  First, at page 6 of his statement the  Senator  from Georgia states a  fact  that I  think no one can dispute. He  said speaking of Soviet air defenses:  The United States has virtually no air de fense network while the Soviet Union has  made a massive investment in this area. It  has hundreds of air defense radars, thou sands of dedicated air defense interceptors  and tens of thousands of surface-to-air mis siles.  Mr.  President,  his  observations  about Soviet air defenses is absolutely  correct. Indeed, I think he could have  gone much further and said there is a  distinct possibility  that by changing  the radar used in conjunction with ex isting Soviet air defenses,  the entire  network could be converted into a na tionwide network of rather primitive  but effective antiballistic missile de fenses.  Mr. WILSON addressed the Chair.  ",1986
1781,506,23,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from California.  ,1986
1782,506,23,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, I, too,  read with considerable  interest  the  statement of the senior Senator from  Georgia.  Indeed,  it was with more  than with interest. It was with a great  deal of curiosity on several points. The  first of these had to do with the ap parent uncertainty  as  to what  the  actual record was in Iceland. I must  say  that my curiosity was based  in  part upon a colloquy that I had earlier  enjoyed with the senior Senator from  Georgia and the junior Senator from  Tennessee on this very point on what I  believe was Wednesday afternoon, a  day after we had received a briefing  from the Secretary of State on that  very point.  I felt a bit like Yogi Berra must have  felt when he said, ""I am feeling deja  vu all over again,"" because we had, I  thought,  covered  the point  in  the  briefing with the Secretary of State  and when we had our colloquy here on  the floor the next afternoon. At that  time  I  reminded my colleagues that  the Secretary had produced a docu ment which I thought disposed of the  question.  Mr. President,  as  a  distinguished  old-well, not so old, certainly youth ful and experienced trial lawyer, the  Presiding Officer I am sure will recall  from law school days, and from prac tice, something called the ""best evi dence rule."" There is a precept in the  law of evidence that the best evidence  of the contents of a document is the  document itself. And in that briefing  for all Senators explaining what went  on  in  Iceland,  Secretary  of State  Shultz  on Tuesday  afternoon  pro duced  from his pocket a document  which  he  identified  as  that  from  which he had read to the Soviets at  Hofdi House, the United States offer,  even as he was reading it to the assem bled Senators in room S-407.  Another point raised by the Senator  from Georgia had to do with the con ventional  imbalance  in Europe-that  is, inferiority of NATO's conventional  capability as compared with that of  the Warsaw Pact. He cites no less au thority than the Supreme Allied Com mander, General Rogers, who  he  quotes on page 7 of his statement for  the proposition that this inferiority is  so marked that it would necessitate  going  to a nuclear response on the  part of NATO  in days  rather  than  weeks or months.  I do not take issue with the basic  point. It seems to me, though, that it  suggests  a  conclusion  that  can be  fairly inferred from all else that is said  in the Nunn statement: that we have  come to rely long since upon our nu clear capability  in order  to equalize  the odds in the NATO theater against  the conventional  superiority of  the  Warsaw Pact.  However,  in the Senator's ensuing  statement that if we cannot count on  bombers to penetrate those Soviet air  defenses, we are left to the inadequate  capability of artillery, and aircraft-de livered tactical nuclear bombs,  there  is,  strangely.  no  discussion  of our  cruise missiles. Perhaps unwittingly,  and with unintended irony, the Sena tor's expressed concerns point out the  wisdom of the President's announced  intention  to  proceed  to make  the  ALCM  conversions  that will exceed  SALT II limits, and give  the United  States an increased ALCM capability  that would seem even more needed  against  the background and context  that the Senator from Georgia urged  this morning as the true context of  our NATO position.  Mr. President, I fully agree with the  points made about Soviet air defenses  and our lack of them. But I do not see  ",1986

1784,519,23,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, in  the past two Congresses I have voted  against the immigration bills brought  to the Senate primarily because I felt  they did not adequately guard against  discrimination against minority Ameri cans. However,  I believe after much  thought  that  the new version now  before the Senate is a bill which this  Congress should pass.  First, let me say that the problem of  illegal immigration into this country is  growing at an alarming rate. Public  concern about this problem is also on  the rise.  As the public concern about illegal  entry into the United States continues  to grow, I fear that without some leg islative solution now, the future may  bring a more repressive approach than  what we are considering today.  Last year  I  strongly opposed  the  Senate version because it lacked ade quate protections for those American  citizens who, in the eyes of some, do  not ""look American"" or ""sound Ameri can"" -in particular those of Hispanic  descent. While I've always agreed that  some type of limitation on immigra tion is called for, I remained troubled  by the very real possibility of discrimi nation. My interest has been to mini mize that risk and to support a reason able process for redress of grievances  that will  surely  arise. When  this  matter was debated last year I sup ported my colleague  from Colorado  [Mr. HARTl in his amendment to pro vide a recourse for those violations of  constitutional rights arising from em ployer sanctions. However, Mr. HART  withdrew  his  amendment  and  the  Senate never voted on the provision.  Consequently, when the Senate passed  its bill, it did not have the necessary  protections built  in against possible  discrimination and  redress of  those  violations. The version now before us  does include such provisions, and sev eral other changes that strike a fairer  balance between  individual and na tional interests.  First,  the conferees agreed  to  in clude an Office of Special Counsel in  the Department of Justice to investi gate and prosecute claims of employ ment  discrimination.  Sanctions,  in cluding fines and granting of back pay,  may be imposed against offending em ployers. An offending employer may  also be required to keep paperwork on  future  job applicants. There was no  similar provision in the earlier Senate  bill  because  the Hart  amendment,  though debated, was not voted upon. I  believe this is a most important fea ture of the compromise bill and am  pleased it was included.  Second, the conferees agreed to keep  the Senate provision  requiring  the  General Accounting Office to submit  to Congress and to a specially created  task force, an annual report on possi ble patterns of employment discrimi nation based on national origins re sulting  from  employer  sanctions.  Under  the Senate version,  if GAO  finds  such discrimination,  the  task  force would  then  be  required  to  submit its own report, with legislative  recommendations, to Congress. Within  60 days after receiving the task force  report, the Senate and House would  hold hearings. Employer sanctions will  cease if GAO finds discrimination, and  Congress would enact a  joint resolu tion stating that it approves the task  force  report's findings.  In the event  that Congress repeals employer sanc tions by  joint  resolution,  then  the  antidiscrimination provisions will also  expire, since their purpose would have  been removed.  In contrast, the House version pro vided an automatic termination of the  employer sanctions and the Office of  Special Counsel, 6% years after date of  enactment. The compromise, by adopt ing the Senate provision, guarantees  at a minimum that we revisit the issue  of  employer  sanctions.  I  supported  this version when my colleague from  Massachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY] offered  it last year.  Third, my concern that employers  will not hire foreign looking individ uals to avoid sanctions was addressed  in  the  conference  report. The bill  broadens the title VII protections of  the Civil Rights Act to include nation al origin as well as citizenship. I be lieve this further protects against pos sible abuse.  Mr. President, in the 4 years I have  been in this Senate, this is the first  time that the two Houses of this Con gress have been able to agree on legis lation to reform our immigration laws.  There are many criticisms that can be  made of this bill ahd I share many of  those criticisms. However, the choice  before us is not whether we want this  bill or a better bill on this subject. It is  very possible, and even probable, that  this  is  the best  bill  our  complex  system of checks and balances can  come up with at this time. And time is  of  the essence  in dealing with  this  problem.  I  am persuaded  that  the  choice  before us is either this bill or no bill.  Since I believe that action is needed  on this crucial issue at this time and I  believe that genuine effort has been  made to craft a  fair compromise on  this difficult issue, I will support the  bill.  I join with many of my colleagues in  commending the Senator from Wyo ming for his excellent work in fashion ing this compromise.  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.  ",1986

1787,545,23,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, I  wish to provide some additional inter pretive language for a small but im portant provision of the drug bill that  addresses a matter within the jurisdic tion of the Commerce Committee. Sec tion 3451 of that bill deals with com munications. Many drug dealers rely  heavily upon modern communications  methods in their operations. To the  extent that we can make it more diffi cult for them to use these methods for  illegal purposes, we will have taken an  important  step  in our war  against  drugs.  This  amendment would  authorize  the Federal Communications Commis sion to assist in drug law enforcement  in  two ways: First,  the Commission  would be authorized to revoke any pri vate operator's license  issued to any  person under the Communications Act  of 1934 if the person is found, presum ably by a court of law, to have ""will fully used"" the license ""for purpose of  distributing, or assisting in the distri bution of, any controlled substance in  violation of any provision of Federal  law."" The intent of this provision is to  penalize only those persons who are  using an FCC  license  for an  illegal  purpose, for example, a licensed radio  operator soliciting a  sale of a  con trolled substance in violation of Feder al law. This language is not intended,  however,  to penalize  those persons  who hold an operator or station li cense which is being used by others in  the ordinary course of business, but  which  is being used, without the li censee's knowledge,  for  illegal pur poses such as drug dealing.  Second, this amendment would au thorize the Commission to assist ap propriate  Federal  law  enforcement  agencies ""in the enforcement of Feder al law prohibiting the use or distribut ing of any controlled substance where  communications  equipment"" within  the Commission's jurisdiction is ""will fully being used for purposes of dis tributing, or assisting in the distribu tion of, any such substance."" This pro vision would not require the Commis sion to use its own limited resources to  assist other agencies in such drug law  enforcement. Rather, it is contemplat ed that the Commission will enter into  interagency, reimbursable agreements  with the appropriate law enforcement  agencies,  as,  for example, currently  exist between the Commission and the  U.S. Coast Guard.

1789,584,23,Mr.  DOMENICI.," Mr.  President,  when the Congress approved the Bal anced Budget and Emergency Control  Act of 1985, it changed the transmittal  date of the President's budget to the  first Monday after January 3. This  change seemed desirable to us at the  time because it would have given the  Congress about a month longer each  year to review the President's budget.  It is obvious to me now that the date  is unrealistic.  Such an early date would  require  that  the budget precede  the Presi dent's State of the Union by 2 to 3  weeks and, thereby, ensure substantial  inconsistencies between the two. This  would not be fair to the President, and  we should not insist upon it.  This year Congress failed  to com plete its work in time. As a result, the  executive branch must begin now-at  this very late date-to develop a fiscal  year 1987 reference base for the 1988  budget. This will take weeks of inten sive work.  Having been forced by the Congress  to delay its preparation of the 1988  budget,  it is now  literally physically  impossible for the budget process to be  completed in time for transmittal on  January 3.

1792,584,23,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, I am  extremely gratified to be able to rise  today in support of S. 2439, the Feder al Onshore Competitive Leasing Act of  1986, which was reported favorably by  the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources in July. The text of S. 2439  with certain modifications which I will  describe, has been  incorporated  into  the amendment in the nature of a sub stitute to H.R. 4645.  As  every Member  of  this  body  knows,  I have  long fought  for  this  change in our current leasing system,  which I believe is outmoded, suscepti ble to fraud and manipulation, and not  designed  to provide the Government  with a fair return. S. 2439, as reported  by  the  Energy  Committee, would  enact several long overdue changes to  the  Federal  onshore  leasing  laws.  These reforms will establish a leasing  system which is fair and workable and  will enhance our domestic energy situ ation. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.  PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT LEASING SYSTEM  Mr. President, I believe that reform  of the Federal Government's onshore  leasing system is absolutely necessary.  The current system serves neither the  public nor the oil and gas industry's  best interests. For the edification of  my  colleagues who may not have  heard this speech before, and to re fresh the memories of those who have,  I will attempt to summarize the prob lems with the present Federal leasing  system for oil and gas.  Under  existing  law-the Mineral  Leasing Act of 1920-only those lands  with known oil and gas potential those overlying  a  known geological  structure of a producing oil or gas  field [KGSl-may be leased on a com petitive basis. Because of this restric tive test, less than 5 percent of all on shore leases are now offered competi tively. Oil and gas leases not within a  KGS must be leased noncompetitive ly-for a small filing  fee and $1 an  acre.  In addition to the restructive nature  of the KGS test, it is exceedingly diffi cult to apply with any degree of cer tainty.  The  distinguished  Senator  from Wyoming, Senator WALLOP, has  called the KGS system ""Witchcraft, at  best"" and I emphatically agree. Cur rently, the Bureau of Land Manage ment does not profess to make a tech nical  or  professional  decision  on  whether lands overlie a KGS. They  simply determine  that  if a  tract  is  within a mile of producing acreage, it  is presumed to be a KGS. Anything  further than 1 mile from a producing  tract is deemed not to be KGS lands.  The Bureau of Land Management  has often made these determinations  without current information on pro ducing wells and complete, dependable  geologic data. These problems have  been further complicated by staffing  and communications problems within  BLM. As a result of errors in BLM's  KGS determination process,  several  leases, determined by BLM not to be  within a KGS, have been leased on a  noncompetitive  basis,  even  though  there was a high degree of competitive  interest  in  the  leases.  In  these  in stances,  the Federal Government re ceived far less than fair market value.  The most egregious examples of these  occurrences were at Fort Chaffee, AR,  and Amos Draw, WY.  In 1979,  the  Interior Department  issued noncompetitive leases on 33,000  acres near known gas-producing wells  at Fort Chaffee for $1 an acre. Arkla  Gas sued to set the leases aside, claim ing that they were over a KGS and,  under  the  law,  should  have  been  leased  competitively.  The  district  court agreed, ruling that the Interior  Department's decision  to  lease  the  area noncompetitively was arbitrary.  This  decision has been upheld on  appeal. In 1980, 24,000 acres of adjoin ing lands were leased competitively for  $1,705 per acre. So  instead of  the  Treasury  receiving  $24,000  for  the  ",1986
1793,597,23,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President,  the  reconciliation  conference  report  before us addresses many  troubling  health care issues in both the Medi care  and Medicaid  Programs. The  original House and Senate reconcilia tion packages  contained  substantial  differences in their Medicare and Med icaid provisions. The agreement before  us represents compromise by both the  Senate and the House, but I believe it  represents better health care policy  than either of the original bills.  As chairman of the Senate subcon ferees  on Medicare  and Medicaid  issues, I would like to thank Senators  HEINZ, DURENBURGER, MOYNIHAN, and  BAucus for the time and effort they  devoted to achieving this agreement.  I would like to take a few moments  to highlight a few of the provisions in cluded in the conference report.  MEDICARE  One of the most troubling problems  addressed in the conference report in volves  the  part  a  deductible-the  amount a Medicare beneficiary must  pay for the first day in the hospital.  The prospective payment system es tablished a single rate of payment for  hospitals based upon the illness to be  treated-the DRG rate. This new pay ment system has created an incentive  for hospitals to economize, which in  turn has resulted in shorter hospital  stays for Medicare beneficiaries. Cur rently, the part A deductible is based  on the national average cost per day in  the hospital. However, because we now  pay a flat rate per hospital stay and  hospital  stays  on  the  average  are  shorter, the average cost per day for  Medicare beneficiaries has  increased  at a tremendous rate.  Because of this the part A deducti ble increased at about 43 percent over  the past 2 years. Last year alone the  part A deductible  for Medicare  in creased by an unprecedented 23 per cent-from $400 to $492. The project ed increase for 1987 is another $80which would bring the first day de ductible to $572. When Congress en acted the prospective payment system,  this possibility was not foreseen.  The provision agreed to by the con ferees would  reduce  the  increase  in  the part A deductible in 1987 by more  than one-half. Instead of increasing to  the projected rate of $572, the deducti ble will increase to $520. Equally im portant,  the provision will keep  in creases in subsequent years to a rea sonable amount.  Another difficult issue addressed by  the conference was physician  reim bursement under  the Medicare Prowill  gram. The position originally adopted  by the Senate would have lifted the  current reimbursement freeze and al lowed physicians to increase charges  to beneficiaries with no  limits. The  House provisions would have retained  controls on physician charges and im posed an annual cap on the amount a  physician could charge a beneficiary.  This was one of the most contentious  issues in the subconference.  Under the conference agreement, all  physicians will be allowed a 3.2-per cent increase in their Medicare reim bursement. In addition, the amount a  physician  can charge  a  beneficiary  over the Medicare reimbursement rate  be  limited  in  the  following  manner: first, those physicians charg ing above 115 percent of the prevailing  rate will be allowed a  !-percent  in crease per year; and second, those phy sicians charging below 115 percent of  the prevailing will be allowed to in crease up to 115 percent of the prevail ing over 4 years. These caps will be re moved on December 31, 1990 or 1 year  after a study on relative value scales is  completed, whichever is earlier.  I believe the agreement we reached  with the House is a reasonable com promise and good policy. It will save  the Federal Government money, con trol  beneficiary  out-of-pocket  costs  and allow physicians to increase their  charges at a reasonable rate. In addi tion, it will sunset once Congress has  received enough information to devel op a reasonable and fair system of re imbursement for physicians.  The conference report also allows a  1.15-percent increase in hospital reim bursement rates-this is more gener ous than the .5-percent increase rec ommended by the administration. The  agreement cuts back on the amount  Medicare will pay  for capital  reim bursement for hospitals by 3.5 percent  in 1987 and by larger amounts in 1988  and 1989. Understandably, the hospi tal industry  is not pleased with the  capital provision; This provision will  give them a strong incentive to work  with Congress next year to develop a  reform program.  MEDICAID  Mr. President, the conference report  before us today also makes a number  of critical changes  in  the Medicaid  Program.  First, it would expand coverage to  pregnant women and children under  the age of 5 who are beneath the Fed eral poverty level. This provision will  address the serious problem of infant  mortality and low birth weight among  babies. It reflect legislation introduced  in the Senate early this year which I  cosponsored.  Under current law, States that wish  to provide essential health care under  Medicaid to poor women and infants,  can only provide such services to those  who are eligible for cash welfare. As a  result, health  care  services  offered  through Medicaid  reach  fewer  than  one-half of all infants living in pover ty. Under the conference agreement,  States will have the option of provid ing prenatal, delivery, and postpartum  care  to  low-income pregnant women  and medical assistance to low-income  infants and children under 6 years of  age in families living below the Feder al poverty level without requiring that  they also meet the eligibility stand ards for aid to families with dependent  children.  Eleven babies die out of every 1,000  infants born  in  this  country. Few  events are as tragic as the death of a  baby or the birth of a baby with birth  defects-especially when such an out come could have been prevented with  proper prenatal care.  The National Academy of Sciences  estimates a cost-benefit ratio of $3.38  saved in the first year of a child's life  for $1 spent in prenatal care. The con ference  agreement  recognizes  that  even in times of fiscal restraint, it is  good Federal policy to invest in the  health of poor mothers and children.  The  conference  agreement  also  allows States to provide Medicaid cov erage to elderly and disabled individ uals whose  familiy  income  is at or  below the Federal poverty level with out liking such coverage to eligibility  for Federal or State supplemental se curity income payments.  Another provision makes  it  clear  that a State cannot impose any resi dence  requirement which  excludes  from Medicaid an otherwise eligible in dividual who lives in a State regardless  of whether or not such residence is a  permanent address. This provision en sures that ""homeless"" individuals are  not discriminated against.  Finally, the Senate conferees adopt ed a provision in the House reconcilia tion package which would  enact a  piece of S. 2209, the Disabled Person  Act, of which I am a cosponsor. This  provision is a great importance to dis abled Americans who want the oppor tunity  to be productive members of  the work community. By enacting this  provision Congress will  finally  ac knowledge  that individuals with dis abilities should be supported and as sisted in their efforts to join the work  force rather than discouraged because  they cannot afford the high cost of  their  disability-related  health  care  needs without some help from Federal  programs.  I fully support efforts to encourage  disabled individuals who wish to join  the work force to have the chance to  do so. But we must be certain that bar riers that discourage  their participa tion, such as the possible loss of SSI or  Medicaid  benefits,  are  eliminated.  Access to the work community is criti cal in order to assist disabled persons  to pursue full and active lives.  ",1986
1794,610,23,Mr. ABDNOR.," This  is  the  so-called  ability-to-pay  test.  Under this provision, the Secretary of  the Army could modify standard cost sharing requirements in cases of great  financial need.  There are several points to make:  This applies only to projects for con trolling floods and improving agricul tural water supplies. It does not apply  to ports or municipal water supply, or  to any of the other numerous respon sibilities of the Corps of Engineers.  It is anticipated that the Secretary  will only rarely invoke this authority.  And this provision can never be used  to eliminate  the non-Federal share.  Even  the very poorest  jurisdictions  can and should make some contribu tion to the improvement of the com munity. The Secretary might offer  help by adjusting the timing of such  payments to ease the cost burden on  the local community.  5. SEPARABLE ELEMENTS  A key issue affecting harbor develop ment, as well as other types of water  projects, is what is known as separable  elements.  Many, many corps projects contain  an overall plan for improvements to a  harbor or  for  controlling  floods-a  plan with several components. Practi cally every one of these projects will  have componets that can be evaluated  and can be built on their own.  Among the hundreds and hundreds  of  authorized Corps  of Engineers  projects, a great many contain sepa rate components that have never been  initiated. This may  involve a  recreational  component,  and  upstream  levee  that protects one  town  in a  valley of several towns, a flood control  or drainage work on a minor tributary,  ",1986
1795,636,23,Mr. MAT TINGLY.,"  We were convinced  then, and we  remain convinced now, that the cost sharing structure in our bill was equi table and appropriate both for our Na tional Port System and for the Na tion's taxpayers.  It is gratifying to us that the legisla tion before the Senate today incorpo rates many of the major provisions of  the legislation which we introduced 3  years ago.  The Federal  interest  in a modern  harbor system is twofold: To promote  America's trade potential and econom ic strength, as well as to meet our de fense commitments.  The United States must be prepared  to meet  the world demand  for  its  goods by developing a more competi tive port transportation system.  Likewise,  the constitutional obliga tion to provide for  the Nation's de fense demands that the Federal Gov ernment continue  its strong role  in  supplying both our allies' and our own  energy needs.  The quick and efficient deployment  and servicing of troops and equipment  must be assured by modern, well-main tained harbors.  Our National Port System annually  transports in excess of $318 billion in  waterborne foreign commerce and gen erates $7 billion in Customs revenues.  A  strong port  system which  increases our capacity to export reduces  our balance of trade deficit and makes  a positive contribution to employment  in every State in the Nation.  to 1. It  This bill authorizes the deepening of  the Port of Hampton Roads to 55 feet  at an estimated cost of $538 million at  a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3.6  allows the project to be built in opera ble segments.  The Virginia Port Authority has  signed a local cooperative agreement,  or ""221"" with the Corps of Engineers  to construct a 50 foot outbound chan nel at a cost of $46.7 million to be cost  shared by  the Federal Government  and the State.  The Virginia General Assembly has  appropriated the State share and we  are ready to start dredging as soon as  we approve this bill.  Madam President, as this is the first  major water resources bill in nearly 15  years, we know that staff has spent  untold hours to draft this bill.  I personally want to extend by ap preciation to Tom Skirbunt and Mark  Haynes  of  the  Environment  and  Public Works Committee, who have  showed me and my staff every consid eration for the many projects-flood  control,  beach  erosion  protection,  harbor dredging-important to Virgin ia.  Again, Madam President, I support  this conference agreement. I urge my  colleagues to support it as well.  ",1986
1796,636,23,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. Chairman, there  are a couple of points involving the  Santa Ana River Mainstem project  which are not immediately clear upon  first  reading of  the  legislative  lan guage. It is the understanding of the  conferees that upon the completion of  the water  supply  and  conservation  study at Prado Dam, that if that study  recommends water conservation as a  secondary project purpose and upon  completion of the exchange for  the  Santa Ana Project  that such water  conservation will  then be considered  automatically authorized as a second ary project purpose?  ",1986
1797,636,23,Mr. STAFFORD., The Senator from  California is correct. If water supply  and conservation is found to be feasi ble at Prado Dam then such finding  shall automatically become a second ary project purpose of the Santa Ana  project.  ,1986
1798,636,23,Mr. WILSON.,"  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman for that clarification. I have  a second point of inquiry and clarifica tion, as well. It is my understanding  that the reference  in H.R. 6  to the  Water Supply Act of 1958  refers to  any additional water supply and con servation that may be recommended  at Prado Dam. This reference is in no  way meant to be a  limitation on the  corps' existing authority to impound  water at Prado for conservation pur poses.  Is  that  the conferees under standing of this language?  ",1986
1799,636,23,Mr. STAFFORD.," The Senator is cor rect. The language we have adoped is  prospective, and effects additional po tential storage  ",1986
1800,636,23,Mr. STAFFORD., Will  the distin guished manager of the bill yield for  purposes of a colloquy?  ,1986
1801,636,23,Mr. ABDNOR., I would be happy to  yield to the distinguished Chairman of  the Committee on Environment and  Public Works.  ,1986
1802,636,23,Mr. STAFFORD.," I thank the Sena tor. As the Senator knows, new cost sharing requirements are the center piece of  this bill,  and constitute a  major shift in the division of Federal  and non-Federal financial responsibil ities for water resources development  in this country. In addition to simply  reducing the Federal cost of new con struction, what additional objectives  are intended to be achieved by these  new requirements?  ",1986
1803,636,23,Mr. ABDNOR.," The cost-sharing re forms contained in the bill are intend ed to achieve several important objec tives. These include: bringing the ben efits of the water resources develop ment program to more communities;  producing plans with more widespread  local  support;  encouraging  smaller,  more efficient projects, where appro priate; enabling  the marketplace  to  help determine investment priorities,  especially for deep draft ports; reduc ing environmental damages that result  from unneeded or oversized projects;  and helping to assure more cost-effec tive development.  ",1986
1804,636,23,Mr. STAFFORD.," I thank the Sena tor for elaborating on these objectives  and concur with his  remarks.  I am  pleased to note that section 103(b) of  the conference agreement provides en couragement  for nonstructural proj ects to reduce flood damages, includ ing waiving the requirement for cash  contributions  during  construction.  What types of measures are intended  to qualify for this treatment?  ",1986
1805,636,23,Mr. ABDNOR.," A variety of meas ures, either singly or in combination,  are considered to be ""nonstructural.""  These may include flood warning sys tems, flood plain regulation, removal  or relocation of structures or building  contents, flood proofing of structures,  acquisition of  flood plain  lands  for  conversion to compatible uses, and res toration of wetlands for purposes of  flood water retention. Other innova tive approaches may be found in the  future to reduce flood damages with out construction of traditional flood  water retention structures, and these  too  should  qualify  under  section  103(b).  ",1986
1806,636,23,Mr. STAFFORD., Would the  tech niques  for  stream  renovation  and  channel  improvement known as  the  Pallniter Method be considered non structural within the meaning of this  provision?  ,1986
1807,636,23,Mr. ABDNOR., Yes; that is certainly  our intent.  ,1986

1809,649,23,Mr. ZORINSKY.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased that the Senate is taking  final action on the Futures Trading  Act of 1986. The legislation before the  Senate  incorporates  the  agreement  reached by the committee of confer ence on H.R. 4613, except for a provi sion  transferring  certain  National  Forest System land to the Nebraska  Game and Parks Commission.  Under the legislation, appropriations  will be authorized  to carry out the  Commodity  Exchange  Act  during  fiscal years 1987 through 1989. Certain  improvements also will be made in the  current Commodity Futures Regula tory Program.  In addition, the legislation addresses  other matters that are important to  American farmers, ranchers, and con sumers. These matters include: First,  Federal meat inspection; second, extra  long staple cotton; third, 1986 Wheat  Program payments;  fourth, Valencia  peanuts; fifth, acreage eligible for the  Conservation Reserve Program;  and  sixth,  local agricultural stabilization  and conservation committees.  FUTURES TRADING PROVISIONS  The futures markets are an integral  part of the Nation's economy. They  have a direct effect on agricultural  producers, consumers, large and small  investors, financial institutions, manu facturers, Government, and business  of all types. One of the more impor tant roles of the Federal Government  is  to ensure that these markets are  free from fraud and manipulation.  The Commodity Futures Trading  Commission  is  the Federal  agency  charged with the primary responsibil ity of regulating the futures industry.  In addition, the industry's Registered  Futures Association supplements the  activities of  the Federal  regulatory  agency  through  its program of self regulation.  The CFTC was established as an in dependent regulatory agency in 1974.  The authorization of appropriations  for the CFTC was extended in 1978  and 1982. Under  the Senate-passed  bill, appropriations would have been  authorized for an additional 6 years.  Under this legislation, appropriations  would be authorized for 3 years. The  3-year  reauthorization  period  ensure Congress an early opportunity  to examine the changes made by the  pending legislation.  This legislation will make relatively  few changes in the Federal regulatory  program of the CFTC. Most of these  changes were included in the Senate passed amendment to the House bill.  The major provisions of title I of the  legislation involve:  First. Clarification of  the CFTC's  authority to pursue off -exchange oper ators who engage in fraudulent activi ties;  Second.

The PRESIDING OFFICER  laid  before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:  The United States shall not pay any ex pense of establishment of the memorial.  Amend the title so as to read: ""Joint  resolution authorizing establishment  of a memorial to honor the American  Armored Force."".  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, the  Congress has recently approved legis lation (H.R. 4378) which establishes  guidelines for commemorative works  to be located on Federal land in the  District of Columbia and its environs.  That legislation provides that military  memorials shall only be established to  honor branches of the service-that is,  Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,  Coast Guard, and Merchant Marineor wars or major conflicts. Absent  such criteria, there would be a poten tial for hundreds of requests for me morials to subdivisions of the military.  Mr. President, there may be as few  as 50 sites remaining for future com memorative works in Washington, DC.  I believe it is impossible for the Con gress to choose among worthy military  units when we have such a  limited  amount of space remaining in the Na tion's Capital. The National Capital  Memorial Advisory Committee, an advisory panel to the Secretary of the  Interior, recommends that memorials  to military units be  located  in  the  areas where they were headquartered.

1847,740,23,Mr. CHILES.," Mr.  President,  the  State of Missouri has sent some supe rior men  to  the U.S. Senate,  from  Thomas Hart Benton and Carl Shurz,  to  Stuart  Symington,  and  Harry  Truman. To that distinguished roster,  Missouri  added  the name  of ToM  EAGLETON in the autumn of 1968. And,  as he leaves the Senate now, he also  leaves behind him the record of a man  as young in spirit as the 39 year-old  former Missouri attorney general who  took his seat here 18 years ago.  Each person, I believe, possesses two  key qualities. One is a sense of fair ness. The other is the ability to dis cern right from wrong. In ToM EAGLE TON, both those qualities are honed to  a fine edge.  I have seen him toss niceties aside  and cut right to the core of judgment  on some very difficult issues. I have  been with him in hearings where senti ments  and  emotions were  tightly  strung. In those times, while so many  others wrestled with their own preju dice,  I have seen ToM EAGLETON set  down the facts, make the case clear,  and help his Senate colleagues see the  right and the wrong of a question.  TOM  EAGLETON-like  Senator TOM  EAGLETONis true to his own feelings.  In the grain of his life, it is a strong  sense of justice and courage that has  guided him through a career of honor  and good will.  What  it  comes  down  to  is ToM  EAGLETON is a decisive man. There is a  cost in that. We all pay a price for  making UP our minds. But TOM EAGLE TON has not spent his Senate tenure  defending his personal balance sheet.  He has acted out of concern for his  country and personal commitment to  doing what's best.  He has been a champion of older  Americans, an enemy of waste in Gov ernment, and as the former chairman  of the Senate Appropriations Subcom mittee on Agriculture, he has been a  constant friend of farmers throughout  this country.  Senator EAGLETON has always been a  faithful Democrat, a man to look hard  choices straight in the face, and do  what he thought necessary and best  for his country and his party.  TOM EAGLETON returning, now, to the  practice of law teaching and journal ism, is not a man to be still about the  course of his country. He has poured  18 years of his life into this Nation,  but the contributions have many years  yet to flow.  I extend to him and to his family my  best wishes, in friendship and respect,  for a short rest, and a long career as a  Missourian with new youth and plenty  more to give his country.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR GARY HART  ",1986
1848,740,23,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, more  than half a century ago, Antoine de  Saint Exupery wrote ""Night Flight.""  And in it, he said this: ""in life there  are  no  solutions.  There  are  only  motive forces, and our task is to set  them  acting-then  the  solutions  follow.""  In his two terms in the U.S. Senate,  GARY HART has ""set the motive forces  acting."" Across a broad range of na tional issuesfrom better education  to international trade, from clean air,  to  skies  free  of  radioactivity,  to  a  world  free  from  the nuclear  arms  race-he has been an inventive voice  for change in a stubborn world.  I have served with GARY HART on  the Senate Budget Committee, where  his  deliberate,  thoughtful manner  belied the passion of his beliefs. GARY  HART has vision, but he is a practical  man. He knows the kind of America he  wants us to become, but is willing to  immerse himself  in  the hard policy  choices to get us there.  As a candidate for the Democratic  Presidential nomination  in 1984, he  was relentless in the search for fresh  thinking  to shake  the Nation  from  what he saw as a lethargy induced by  dodging one more economic bullet. He  saw the economic recovery as an op portunity  for  the country  to make  plans for the future.  Senator HART  understands  better  than most that this country is on the  seam between what we were and what  we hope to become. His belief is that  the days of comfortable domination in  international affairs are over. We can  no longer depend on our economy as  an automatic savior.  But rather than viewing  these af fairs as a setback or a  loss, he sees  them as the inevitable consequence of  a world which has patterned itself to  so great a degree on the American ex ample. In that respect, these new chal lenges  are an opportunity  for  this  Nation to set a new example and a still  higher standard.  That, it seems to me, is the message  GARY HART leaves as his legacy to the  Senate and to the Nation. None of us  can know the future. But all of us can  influence its direction.  GARY HART knows that, and it's cer tain that his influence will be felt for  many years to come.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER  ",1986
1849,740,23,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, many  years  ago  someone  asked  Harry  Truman  about his habit of giving  people  hell. The  former President  said, ""I never give people hell. I  just  tell them the truth and they think it's  hell.""  In the 30 years BARRY GOLDWATER  has served in the U.S. Senate, he has  dished out a lot of truth to all of us.  and some have left singed in the aftermath.  He is blunt, honest, impatient, wise.  and generally unimpressed with testi monials. A native born son of Arizona,  BARRY GOLDWATER speaks the common  sense  language born of  a  lifetime  among the rivers, canyons. and deserts  of the Southwest.  He ran for President in 1964.  took  his defeat in stride. and 4 years later  returned  to  the Senate where he's  spearheaded  the  reconstruction  of  American defense readiness.  When Major General GoLDWATER re tired from Air Force duty in 1967, he  was a seasoned, hands-on expert in the  frontiers  of military  aviation. He's  been in the cockpit of Thunderbolts  Lightnings, Warhawks, and Mustangs:  He's flown Sabre Jets, Starfighters  and o~  Flying  Fortresses, B-52's,  frontline  helicopters. He made  his  first solo flight in 1929, and has flown  the most modern, high-performance  planes in our inventory.  The aircraft he's flown-too numer ous to list-and the impact he's had on  aviation, led to his induction into the  Aviation Hall of Fame in 1982, and to  the Harmon  Trophy  for  lifetime  achievement in aviation.  BARRY GOLDWATER has been a Vital  part of this country's advance into the  era of high technology. And, perhaps  most important of all, he has been on  the  ramparts  of  national  defense  throughout his years of public service.  His skilled leadership that produced  this year's reorganization of the mili tary, is a tribute to his insight, vision,  and patriotism.  I really can't say enough about the  quality Of BARRY GOLDWATER'S service  to this Nation, but he would probably  protest  that  I've  said more  than  enough already. But it must be said  that he's a man of deep conviction,  and an authentic statesman.  Each of us in this body knows we  sometimes snarl ourselves in bickering  to the neglect of straight-ahead move ment on key  issues. And  in  those  times, we have been able to count on  the Senior Senator from Arizona to  get us back in the saddle.  We will miss that in this body with  the departure of Senator GoLDWATER.  But the record of candor and achieve ment he leaves written on the pages of  our history mark him as a man who  knows America. He knows our genius  and he knows our shortcomings. And  he knows, so much better than most,  the virtue of a stiff push when it's  needed most.  He now leaves the Senate and re turns to Arizona. But his work and  wisdom will influence this Senate and  this Nation for years to come.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR RUSSELL LONG  ",1986

1851,766,23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, it is  an honor to join my colleagues from  both sides of the aisle in paying trib ute to our friend from Maryland, Sen ator CHARLES McC. MATHIAS. For more  than a quarter century, MAc MATHIAS  has been the foremost champion of  civil  rights  in  the  U.S.  Senate.  Throughout his brilliant career in the  Senate and in the House of Represent atives before that, he has been a tire less  and  eloquent  advocate  of  the  rights of minorities, women, the elder ly, and the disabled, and we shall miss  his leadership in the years to come.  to his  I have been proud to stand shoulder  to shoulder with MAc MATHIAS in the  critical civil  rights struggles of  the  past  two decades. His  leadership on  fair housing  legislation dates  freshman year in the Senate and has  continued to the present time. He has  also been in the forefront on the con tinuing battle for equal voting rights  for all our citizens. In 1982, he was a  principal sponsor of the Voting Rights  Act  extension, which has  done  so  much to advance the peaceful revolu tion of civil rights in America and to  transform our society  into one that  more nearly meets the ideal of equal  justice under law.  In addition, MAc worked tirelessly to  assure that Martin Luther King, Jr.  received the recognition he so richly  deserved. As a leader of the long and  successful effort to place a statue of  the great civil rights leader in the Cap itol, and to designate a national holi day  in his honor, MAc,  like Martin  Luther King, Jr., taught us that with  preserverance, we truly can overcome.  MAc's retirement will be felt espe cially deeply by all of us on both sides  of the aisle who worked with him on  the Senate Judiciary Committee. For  years on  that committee, we  have  looked to MAc for the decisive vote on  so many critical issues, not only in the  area of civil rights, but on other issues  as well. As chairman of the Subcom mittee  of Patents, Copyrights  and  Trademarks, he has championed the  rights of creative artists, and has initi ated innovative and important reforms  to bring copyright and patent protec tions into the 20th century. His efforts  to bring the United States into the  Berne Convention have highlighted  the need for international recognition  of  creative  rights. Throughout his  career, in all aspects of our work on  the committee, he has been devoted to  fairness and  justice. All of us who  have been privileged to serve with him  on that committee have learned from  him and admired him, and we shall  miss his leadership, his counsel, and  his friendship.  In addition, MAc  leaves a mark of  high  distinction  in many  different  areas of foreign policy, especially on  nuclear arms control. His skill as a leg islator, his thorough understanding of  complex  issues, and his commitment  to arms control have brought us closer  to that great and overriding goal of  our time. In particular, he has been a  tireless advocate for a comprehensive  nuclear test ban treaty, and we are  closer to that historic goal today be cause of his thoughtful Senate work.  He has also made a lasting contribu tion on numerous other critical issues  in foreign policy. He was one of the  first to warn about the accumulating  danger of the Third World debt. He  played an indispensable role in devel oping and  strengthening  the antia partheid  legislation  that has finally  put America on the side of justice and  a free South Africa.  In these and so many other ways,  MAc MATHIAS has graced this Cham ber with his presence. I wish him well  in the years to come. His retirement is  a loss to the Senate, to Maryland, and  the country. He will rank as one of the  finest Senators  that Maryland has  ever had, and I hope that Presidents  in future years will find ways to use  the enormous  talent,  integrity, and  statesmanship that he brings to every thing he touches.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL  LAXALT  ",1986
1852,766,23,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, to  this  Senator, my  colleague,  PAUL  LAxALT, the strong silent Gary Cooper  of the U.S. Senate is, to a degree, enig matic. This trace of mystery  is per haps in keeping with his Basque herit age, a people whose origins are un known. The Senator  from Nevada  keeps his distance, maintains perspec tive, remains objective.  Thucydides, in the ""History of the  Peloponnesian War"" writes:  the bravest are surely those who have the  clearest vision of what is before them, glory  and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding  go on to meet it.  PAUL has been the President's clos est friend and advisor, and has lead  the Presidential campaign of his party  in the last three elections because his  vision  is clear,  steady, and  reliable.  Last year, PAUL returned from a pri vate retreat in the hill country of his  native Nevada with a decision. He has  seen what lies ahead for him and now  chooses to go on to meet it.  As he does so, I join my colleagues in  congratulating him and wishing him  well.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CHARLES  McC. MATHIAS  ",1986

Yet a  listing of  those things, I do not believe, cannot  begin to convey what MAc means to  me and to the rest of his friends and  colleagues here.  We respect the senior Senator from  Maryland, yes, for the power of his  well-known intellect. We respect him  for his skill as a  legislator.

1854,779,23,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  given the horrendous destructive po tential of the United States and Soviet  nuclear arsenals,  it is not surprising  that the drama of the Iceland summit  has captured the world's attention and imagination.  President Reagan went to Reykjavik  last weekend  apparently hoping  to  achieve agreement on the framework  for a Euromissile accord and a date  certain for a summit meeting in the  United States. But Mr. Gorbachev had  his own agenda-sweeping nuclear dis armament proposals tied to strict limi tations on strategic defense research.  Superpower agreement evidently foun dered in the end over star wars, but  not until President Reagan had agreed  to  eliminate  nuclear missiles  from  Europe and phase out all strategic bal listic missiles-or maybe all nuclear  weapons-within a decade.  Much attention has been given  in  the media to whether Mr. Gorbachev  trapped President Reagan by upping  the ante for agreement at the 11th  hour. There is uncertainty over what  in fact was put on the table at Hofdi  House. The administration has been  engaged all week in putting the best  possible face on the outcome. Pollsters  are avidly engaged in asking the Amer ican people who won. But as the flurry  of activity surrounding the Reykjavik  meeting subsides, the meaning of the  extraordinary events  in  Iceland  last  weekend merits-and will receive-seri ous reflection.  In my view, the Reyhjavik meeting  suggests cause of concern about  the  future of nuclear arms control on two  counts. First, the dubious promise of  theoretical missile defense plan was  considered more important than con crete  nuclear  arms  control  agree ments. Second, the President was ap parently prepared to embrace certain  dramatic-yet potentially dangerous disarmament proposals. The irony of  Reykjavik is that the President's com mitment  to  star wars-troubling  in  itself-may have been all that stood in  the way of some very unsound poten tial arms control agreements.  In order  to  appreciate  fully  the  meaning of Reykjavik, it is necessary  first to revisit the first 3 years of the  Reagan  administration's  nuclear  policy.  The Reagan administration came to  office as avowed opponents of arms  control and committed critics of the  SALT process  conducted under  the  previous  four  administrations. Arms  control was downplayed by  the new  Reagan team as a dangerous soporific  which threatened to dull public sup port for the Reagan military build-up.  But the bellicose rhetoric of the early  Reagan White House soon generated a  wave of nuclear anxiety among Ameri cans and West Europeans. The ""nucle ar freeze"" movement swept America,  and the ""peace movement"" took to the  streets in every West European cap ital. By late 1981, the administration  felt  the need  for a public  relations  effort to appease an increasirigly con cerned public. Accordingly, negotiat ing efforts were begun on two fronts:  strategic arms and intermediate-range  nuclear forces [!NFJ.  The administration embraced initial  proposals  in both strategic and INF  negotiations which  envisioned  very  deep cuts, including the so-called ""zero  option"" calling for complete elimina tion of all Euromissiles. Having op posed SALT II because it did not go  far enough in reducing nuclear arse nals-and  being  pressed  into  the  public diplomacy of arms control-ad ministration officials inevitably main tained that they would only be satis fied with deep cuts. But such propos als, while dramatic, had the virtue to  an administration skeptical of arms  control of being virtually nonnegotia ble. Whatever their short-term value  in convincing the public that efforts to  curb the arms race were underway, the  administration's proposals were nei ther serious arms control nor good se curity policy.  The President's March 1983 speech  outlining his vision of strategic de fenses compounded the confusion of  an already muddled strategic policy.  The strategic defense  inititative was  motivated in large measure by a Presi dential  desire  to  take  the  ""high  ground"" in the nuclear debate by pro viding a vision of a nuclear-free world.  Having  exacerbated  nuclear  fears  through hard-line rhetoric, the admin istration sought to quiet those fears  through rhetorical claims that nuclear  weapons could and should be ""ren dered impotent and obsolete.""  Under  the President's concept of  missile defenses, the mutual threat of  nuclear  retaliation would no  longer  serve as the basis for Western security.  The deterrent policy which had served  to guide American strategic planning  for 3% decades-and which has pre vented major conflict-was suddenly  rejected  in  favor  of  a  Presidential  vision  that  technology could  render  the threat of nuclear weapons meaningless.    Unfortunately, reality must intrude.  Referring to President Reagan's stra tegic defense initiative, former Secre tary of Defense  James Schlesinger  stated in 1984 that:  It would be irresponsible for us to base  our defense posture on rhetoric that may  sell well on the political scene, but <which  has>  little  relationship  to  the underlying  technological, budgetary and strategic reali ties.  And the underlying technological re ality is that star wars is not going to  put  the nuclear genie back  in  the  bottle. The underlying strategic reali ty is that to do so-without concommi tant  reductions  in  conventional  forces-would undermine our security  and that of our allies.  It is profoundly regrettable to all of  us, but nuclear weapons are a fact of  the post-war world. They have also  become a key component of Western  security. They serve to offset the huge  Warsaw Pact conventional superiority  in Europe; and they compensate for a  geopolitical fact: the Soviet Union is a  Eurasian power, while our efforts to  defend allies must rely on ""extended  deterrence.""  The real challenge before us is  to  fashion a framework for the control of  these awesome weapons so that nucle ar  forces  guarantee-rather  than  threaten-our security.  My concern about star wars is this: it  represents both an obstacle  to arms  control and an impediment to strategic  stability. The ability of one side  to  render  itself  invulnerable  to nuclear  attack-while at the same time retain ing the capacity to destroy one's ad versary-would be vastly destabilizing,  a virtual invitation to engage in nucle ar brinkmanship. And common sense  and logic dictate that an attempt on  our part to build such defenses would  likely lead to an offsetting increase in  Soviet offensive missiles  in order to  overcome that defense.  Experience suggests  that offensive  arms limits are possible only with limi tations  on  defensive  systems. We  should recognize the fact of this link age  and  avoid  another  qualitative  spiral in arms competition with the  ",1986
1855,818,23,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, over  the past 6 years there are few areas of  national  policy  that have  suffered  more  than  our  national  housing  policy. After more than four decades  of national commitment to a develop ing decent and affordable housing for  all Americans-rich and poor alike the 1980's have seen a sudden reversal  of that goal. Housing has become the  forgotten stepchild of both Congress  and the administration, and a crisis in  housing is already the result.  The housing crisis is, ironically, felt  most acutely in those few areas of the  country that are currently experienc ing healthy economic growth-growth  that  is  directly  threatened by  the  labor shortages that follow from the  lack of affordable housing.  This linkage-between the supply of  affordable housing and the capacity of  continued economic growth-is a link age  that  is not well understood by  those in Congress and the administra tion who support the rentrenchment  of the Federal role in housing.  Therefore, I would like to call atten tion to a speech delivered this week by  David 0. Maxwell,  the chairman of  the Federal National Mortgage Asso ciation, and  the national expert on  this matter. As noted in today's Wash ington Post, Mr. Maxwell's speech pro vides a ""vivid account of the Nation's  housing dilemma and its implications  for local economies.""  Mr. President, I ask that the article  in today's Washington Post and Mr.  Maxwell's  speech  appear  in  the  RECORD.  The material follows:  HOUSING SHORTAGE CREATING A LABOR ONE  <By Rudolph A. Pyatt Jr.)  Twice during recent conversations, an offi cial from a Washington suburb expressed  deep concern about two potentially trouble some elements in her county's economy. A  scarcity of housing for low-income families  and an apparent labor shortage, the official  noted, have been  largely  ignored as  the  county's economy continues to expand.  The American Automobile Association's  recent disclosure that it is moving its head quarters and 650 jobs from Fairfax County  to another part of the country reinforced  the official's concerns. One of AAA's rea sons for moving, according to AAA officials,  is a shortage of workers.  A local television station highlighted an other concern of the suburban official when  it recently reported the plight of a young  couple from West Virginia. Unable to find  affordable housing after  finding  jobs  in  Northern Virginia, the couple took up resi dence in a camper.  The concerns of the suburban official are  the antitheses, nonetheless, of  the public  statements of several local officials in the  public and private sectors. AAA's decision  and the West Virginia couple's plight are  mere blips on the big screen of a booming  economy in metropolitan Washington.  Unemployment is an incredibly low 3 per cent or less in most suburban areas. Housing  starts remain strong. Commercial construc tion continues to soar. Personal income is at  record levels. Wealth abounds. All's well in  River City, land of prosperity, home of the  affluent. To hell with AAA and the home less, boosterism's leading voices seem to be  saying.  In the meantime, the concerned suburban  official appears to be part of a minority that  worries  about  growing  labor  shortages.  There is, she says, a direct correlation be tween a  shortage of  lowand moderate income housing near employment centers  and the labor shortage in suburban commu nities. The time has come, she implied, for  local officials to consider new housing poli cies.  The evidence suggests that housing poli cies deserve added attention in the private  sector as well. Indeed, transportation prob lems, which currently occupy the attention  of local business leaders, could be alleviated  through more enlightened housing policies.  Why should business leaders care about  housing policies? David 0. Maxwell,  the  chairman and chief executive officer of the  Federal National Mortgage  Association,  spelled out several reasons in a strongly per suasive argument this week. In remarks at a  Greater Washington  Research  Center  luncheon Wednesday, Maxwell called for a  strong national housing policy.  But it was Maxwell's vivid account of the  nation's housing dilemma and its  implica tions  for  local  economies  that suggested  why business should care.  Housing prices &.re  rising again, apart ments are  in short supply and  jobs are  moving to places where housing costs even  more. Maxwell was describing a national di lemma but executives who heard his  re marks must have recognized a very accurate  description of housing problems in metro politan Washington.  Whether they were  intended  to or not,  Maxwell's remarks had the effect of raising  the level of sensitivity among local business  leaders.  ""Our own metropolitan area exemplifies  this trend,"" he declared. ""First-time buyers  can find little affordable housing near these  jobs. They live so far away that transporta tion becomes an expensive and  time-con suming proposition.  ""This movement  of  jobs  creates  even  bigger obstacles for the working poor. New  suburban offices need cleaning; parking lots  need attendants; junk-food emporiums need  servers. How common it is these days, as an  article in The Atlantic Monthly recently ob served, to see affluent suburban executives  motor off to their nearby homes, while their  staffs wait for the first of several buses they  will have to board on their long journeys  home.""  Moreover, Maxwell  reminded  the  audi ence, ""The pernicious persistence of racial  discrimination continues  to  reinforce  the  barriers to accessible housing.""  In dozens of U.S. cities, including Wash ington, Maxwell continued, waiting lists for  public housing grow longer and longer. In  the Greater Washington area, he said, the  number  is  34,000  families.  ""'That's more  than 100,000 people! At any reasonable rate  of construction,  it would take 13 years to  build housing for those families. And there  is no housing being built.""  Working  families on  those waiting  lists  and others who can't afford housing near  their  jobs are  the ones who clean  those  shiny new office buildings, park cars, flip  hamburgers and,  indeed,  type  letters and  stock shelves. But they've having difficulty  that might  getting  from here-wherever  be-to there.  Maxwell's remarks were a timely reminder  to local business leaders that their support  for more enlightened housing policies can  enhance employment opportunities and the  growth of their businesses.  AMERICAN HOUSING: A VICTORY To BE  CELEBRATED ... OR STILL To BE WoN?  <Remarks prepared for delivery by David 0.  Maxwell)  When the Research Center began twenty five years ago, the American mood was one  of exuberant confidence that social prob lems would yield to the efforts of communi ty-mined organizations like yours. That was  a  time of high  idealism.  It's no surprise,  then, that the Center was founded during  that period.  What is surprising  is  that you survived  through the 70's, when the national mood  darkened, and emerged even stronger into  the 80's. Yours is no fair-weather idealism.  I'm convinced that the major factor dis tinguishing you from other public policy or ganizations that have either succumbed to  exhaustion, or trimmed  their views  to fit  current fashions, has been your insistence  on research. Research  is at the center of  your name and your mission.  Your strength has been your recognition  that  ideals without data are empty, and  data without ideals are blind. Your success  has come because you have combined both.  As a citizen of Washington, I am grateful  for your efforts. As a businessman, I depend  on them.  I've recently had a first-hand reminder of  how rigorous you are in searching out infor mation. I received from Atlee Shidler a list  of suggested questions I might answer in my  remarks today. The list runs for a couple of  pages and covers at  least  fifteen highly  challenging  issues. Most of  the questions  have three parts-some have five or six.  Indeed, if I were to try to deal adequately  with Atlee's questions, we'd be here through  the Spring semester.  But one of these questions in particular  caught my eye. It's a threshold question. If  we don't have a good answer for this ques tion, then the other questions become moot.  The question is, ""Why should the audience  care about housing policy?""  Why indeed?  Of course, as individual Americans, we cer tainly care about our own homes. Poll after  poll shows we put home ownership at the  top of the list of what constitutes the good  life"". This American  trait struck a  recent  distinguished visitor here with special force.  After only a  few weeks in America, Soviet  dissident Yelena Bonner wrote a moving ar ticle  this  title: Americans don't want war. Americans  want a house.""  But our own personal concerns aside, why  should we care about housing policy? After  all, American housing has by and large been  a notable success:  The proportion of Americans who own  their own homes was only about two in five  at the time of the Great Depression. Today,  two out of three Americans own their own  homes.  In  1960,  one dwelling  in  eight  lacked  plumbing facilities, by 1980, that ratio was  down to one in forty.  In  the  average dwelling had  rooms per person; today, the average dwell ing has  two  rooms per person, and  the  rooms are larger.  for The Washington Post, with  1950,  1.5  ",1986
1856,831,23,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  wish to submit to the RECORD an arti cle written recently by John Silber,  president of Boston University. I was  most impressed with Dr. Silber's testi mony  this past  summer on South  Africa before the Senate Foreign Rela tions Committee. It was both wise and  insightful.  The article I now commend to my  colleagues' attention concerns the Af rican National Council [the ANCl. Dr.  Silber points out that we would all do  well to look at the organization dispas sionately. We ought not confuse  it  with Martin Luther King's Southern  Christian Leadership Conference that  led our own civil rights struggle in the  1960's. Rather, we ought to listen to  what the leaders of the ANC say about  their view of the struggle, what they  are prepared  to do, and what their  vision of a future South Africa looks  like. It is a chilling article that Dr.  Silber has written, but one all of us  ought to read.  The article follows:  A LOOK AT THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS  <By John Silber>  If we are to find a means of ending apart heid without massive bloodshed along with  economic deprivation and political oppres sion for all South Africans, we must face  squarely  the nature  of  an  organization  widely regarded as the sole voice of black  South African protest: the African National  Congress.  The widespread view of the ANC as the  South African  equivalent of Dr. King's  Southern Christian Leadership Conference  is a  tragic mistake. In recent decades, the  ANC has become dominated by a strident  Leninism, an ideology it has sought to im plement by terrorism and murder-so far,  largely against blacks. If anyone doubts the  accuracy of  this description,  they should  spend some time reading statements of vari ous ANC leaders.  A little over a month ago, ""Radio Free dom,"" the ANC's Ethiopia-based broadcast ing station, carried a statement from Joe  Modise, commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe,  the military wing of the ANC, which makes  quite clear the terrorist orientation of his  organization. Black South Africans, he said  should  ""organise  themselves  into groups,  and policemen  should be ambushed and  their weapons  taken;  bombs  and petrol  bombs should be made from  locally avail able materials."" The people should ""identify  collaborators and enemy agents and deal  with them.""  We should remember that the policemen  being talked about here are mostly blacks,  as are, by definition,  the ""collaborators,""  blacks who do not agree with  the ANC's  program. The ANC's method of ""dealing  with"" such people  is  simplicity  itself. A  rubber tire is soaked in gasoline, placed over  the head of a ""collaborator,'' and set alight.  The device is known as a ""necklace.""  Lest we  think that such tactics are ap proved only by extremists within the mili tary wing of the ANC, we should heed the  words of Winnie Mandela, spoken at Mun sieville on April 13, 1986, and reported by  Agence France-Presse:  ",1986
1857,857,23,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure  to rise before you today to pay special tribute  to a very special organization in my congres sional district of the Bronx. NY. On November  the Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center  will celebrate their 90th anniversary. This spe cial occasion will be observed in grand style.  but  I would  like to  take  this opportunity  to  share with my colleagues how very special I  think the center is to the people of the Bronx.  In my capacity as chairman of the House  Select Committee on Aging's Subcommittee  on Human Services, I have had the opportuni ty to witness firsthand the many different fa cilities available for care of the elderly, espe cially  the  frail elder1y. Daughters of Jacob,  which is recognized as one of the finest geri atric centers in this Nation and rates in the top  ten in New York. is a very unique institution.  Daughters of Jacob. a nonprofit. voluntary  nursing home, offers a positive alternative for  elderly people; it offers high quality. compas sionate medical care. a beautiful and secure  environment. and a stimulating fife with people  of common interests.  Caring for the elderly has been a tradition of  the people of Israel since Biblical days. It was  the motivation,  as well,  of Mrs.  Bertha  Dworsky  in  1896 when  she  founded  the  home. At that time her objective was to pro vide a haven for the elderly from homeless ness, loneliness. and hunger. A house at 40  Gouverneur Street on the Lower East Side of  Manhattan was  the  first establishment and  housed 19 residents. As the reputation of the  home spread. new quarters were opened at  East Broadway. As New York City's Jewish  population grew,  it became apparent  that  larger quarters were a necessity. A plot of  ground was purchased in the Bronx in 1913  and plans for a new home were made.  The new facility was opened in 1920 at a  cost of $1,250,000. In 1938 a floor was added  and the home and hospital of the Daughters  of Jacob was prepared to serve 600 patients  and  residents. The  present Daughters  of  Jacob nursing home was opened in 1973. It  consists of a modem, 13-story, 515-bed struc ture, 305 skilled nursing beds and 210 health  related beds. The  facilities also  include  the  Weintstein-Ratner Pavilion and Rndlay Plaza,  a senior citizen apartment complex designed  for the independent elderly over 65 years of  age.  A dedicated staff of more than 500, includ ing physicians. nurses,  therapists, and aides,  provides the highest standard of care. Some  of the special services available within  the  center  include audiology,  dentistry. dietary.  electrocardiography, occupational therapy, op tometry. pharmacy. physical therapy. podiatry.  pyschiatry, social work services. speech ther apy. and leisure time and recreation activities.  However, in addition to the staff. I would like  to pay special attention to the volunteers at  Daughters of Jacob who bring an additional  human dimension to the lives of the patients  and residents of the center. Among the volun teer services performed by volunteers are  feeding patients.  transporting  them  to clinics  and special events. assisting staff with nursing  occupational  therapy.  reading aloud. writing  letters and managing a gift shop. The volun teers  come  from  varied  backgrounds and  range in age from 14 to 80. Their participation  in  the daily  life of the center enhances  its  entire atmosphere. Of special note is the guild  and the mother's day group. These organiza tions  raise  funds  to provide gifts and such  amenities as art work to brighten the lives of  our elderly patients and residents.  There is no doubt whatsoever that Daugh ters of Jacob  fulfills a special need  in our  community  today.  Its expert staff. services,  and facilities and most importantly, its atmos phere of caring combine  to make  it a  real  horne  for  its patients and residents. At the  center,  it  is possible  for aging men and  women  to regain  their abilities and maintain  activity-in short. to continue life as independ ently as possible, with the greatest dignity and  to enjoy themselves in tho process.  I salute  the Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center,  its  staff, its president. Ms. Claire Vogelman under  whose leadership the center has flourished, its  volunteers, and its residents and patients. For  90 years. the frail elderly have been sustained  and enriched by the creative, meaningful, and  innovative work of this long-term care institu tion and for 90 years the center has helped  lead the effort to ensure quality of care and  continuing opportunity  for an ever-increasing  population of older men and women. May  I  take this opportunity to wish them many more  years of success and humanitarian service.  HONORING A PRO-LIFE  INDIVIDUAL  HON. JOE KOLTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 15, 1986  ",1986
1858,857,23,Mr. KOL TEA.," Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased  and proud to stand before the full U.S. House  of Representatives and honor an outstanding  individual from the 4th Congressional District  of Pennsylvania who has toiled long and hard  to promote  the cause of the Pro-Life move ment and the Catholic Church.  Mr. Ross Cosentino of Beaver County, an  Italian immigrant. has traveled to Washington,  DC. many times over the past 15 years  to  help protect the  life of the  innocent. Ross.  who is now 87 years old. is a fervent spokes man for the unborn and has coordinated over  15 bus trips to this city to bring thousands of  individuals here to support this worthy move ment  In  the last 10 years. Ross Cosentino has  formed one of the strongest Pro-Life organiza tions in Pennsylvania. distributing over 40,000  Pro-Life bumper stickers and selling more  than 20.000 ""Red Rose"" Pro-Life appliques.  His group has  sponsored more  than 250  Right-To-Life billboards and supplied every  Catholic Church in the Beaver Valley area with  a ""Respect-for-Life"" bulletin board.  Mr. Speaker. all of this and more has been  accomplished  through  the strength. energy  and selfless dedication of Ross Cosentino.  who deeply cares for the unborn.  That. sir. is why I am pround to stand here  today and honor  this outstanding  individual  who has committed a lifetime to promoting the  Pro-Life cause. His efforts should not go un noticed because of  the numerous  innocent  lives he has protected.  IN HONOR OF REPRESENTATIVE  JOHN SEIBERLING  HON. JJ. PICKLE  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 8, 1986  ",1986
1859,857,23,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, every now and  then someone comes along who won't be de terred, kept quite. or pushed aside when he is  in pursuit of a good cause. JOHN SEIBERLING  is such a man. No amount of pressure, coer cion, intimidation ever deterred JOHN SEIBER LING from saying his piece.  JOHN SEIBERLING does not go around pick ing  fights  or  causing  trouble. He  always  speaks from principle. with a high sense of in tegrity. His legal training and other high quali ties made him  the perfect  ""watch dog"" of  human dignity.  Whether  the subject was a constitutional  question or about human rights, JOHN SEIBER LING could instantly and eloquently challenge  any statement of prejudice or bigotry.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Public  Lands, he has presided over the preservation  of more Federal  lands and  the creation of  more Federal parks and recreation areas than  anyone in this body-with the possible excep tion of Phil Burton.  Indeed,  I remember a story JOHN SEIBER LING passed along to me about a conversation  he had with Phil Burton. The question was  raised, why stay as chairman of the Subcom mittee on Public Lands. To which, Burton re plied, ""When yoLJ look back over your years of  e This .. bullet'' symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

1860,870,23,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the  continued rise of religious intolerance in Amer ican politics threatens our sense of decency,  of fair play, and indeed, our very way of life.  The nonpartisan organization, People for the  American Way, has investigated a number of  these  incidents,  including some  in my home  State of Texas, and I want to bring these ex amples to  the attention of my colleagues  in  the hope that we can work together to pre vent future outbreaks.  The case-by-case examples follow:  FLORIDA  Bob Plimpton, Freedom Council coordina tor for South Florida, distributed the fol lowing flyer at Palm Beach County church es: ""Wanted Qualified Christian Candidates  for  Palm  Beach  County  School  Board .... if you are willing to pray about  becoming  a  candidate,  please  call Bob  Plimpton.  . . . fear not, we can train you  and get you elected with God's help.""  GEORGIA  In the Seventh District, Democrat BUDDY  DARDEN is being challenged by the Reverend  Joe Morecraft, pastor of the fundamentalist  Chalcedon Presbyterian Church and minis ter of the late Representative Larry McDon ald, a John Bircher who held the seat until  his death in 1983. Two fund-raisers who sup ported Representative Pat Swindall in his  defeat of incumbent Elliott Levitas in 1984,  James Zauderer and Nancy Schaefer, have  sent out a fund-raising letter for Morecraft  in which  they  refer  to Swindall and say  ""God has provided another man who is will ing to serve our Lord in the Halls of Con gress."" In another fund-raising letter, two  Morecraft backers, David and Marlene Goo drum, said ""Imagine what kind of nation  the United States would be if the Senate,  the House of Representatives and the Su preme Court had the commitment to Christ  and the knowledge and dedication to God's  Word that Joe Morecraft has.""  INDIANA  Three Religious Right  candidates who  have come to be known as ""The God Squad""  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  upset party regulars in primaries for three  House seats.  In the First District, State Senator Wil liam Costas ""said that a message from God  was the reason he entered the race in the  heavily Democratic 1st Congressional Dis trict,"" according to the Gary Post-Tribune.  The paper quoted Costas: ""I said Lord, you  have to show me. I was waiting for bright  lights and a voice out of the sky, but that  didn't happen. So I said Lord, show my wife.  And one day, when she was driving home  from  Indianapolis,  she had  the  thought  that God was telling her that 'This thing  with your husband is of me and you should  encourage him to run.' That was the impor tant step.""  In the Second District, Donald Lynch, as sociate minister of the Beech Grove Naza rene Church, upset Jay Wickliff. Lynch had  help from Greg Dixon, head of the Indiana  Moral Majority.  In the Fifth District, State Senator and  lay preacher James Butcher defeated State  Treasurer Julian Ridlen. Butcher received  help  from  Pat Robertson, who  raised  $30,000  for him at a  fund-raiser.  In  the  State Senate, Butcher worked successfully  for legislation barring all state regulation of  church schools, including state attempts to  mandate safety standards such as the pres ence of fire extinguishers.  IOWA  Fundamentalists  organized  by  Steve  Sheffler, a Freedom Council worker, domi nated Republican Party caucuses  in four  counties, including the area of Des Moines.  They tried to purge party regulars: Mary  Louise Smith, former director of the Repub lican National Committee, was only elected  a delegate after five ballots when she con vinced fundamentalists that her experience  would be valuable.  While  party  regulars  retained  control,  they made major concessions to the funda mentalists  on  the  platform. Resolutions  adopted June 21 include a call for the teach ing of creationism in public schools and the  following declaration:  ""We  affirm  the words  'separation  of  church and state' do not appear anywhere  in  the U.S. Constitution,  and Supreme  Court  Justice William  Rehnquist  has  termed the phrase a 'misleading metaphor'  that should be  abandoned, we  sincerely  desire that the First Amendment of the U.S.  Constitution be interpreted and applied ac cording to the intent of the framers, which  provided for religion rather than freedom  from  religion. This phrase  'separation of  church and state' which appears in the Con stitution of the Soviet Union has regularly  been used to exclude Godly principles and  activity from the public sector, and we be lieve this violates the heritage of this nation  and the spirit upon which it was founded.""  NEBRASKA  At the Douglas and Lincoln Republican  county convention, which  include Omaha  and Lincoln,  the Religious Right made  major gains  in electing delegates  to  the  state convention. Freedom Council State  Coordinator Bob Garrett successfully con trolled  delegate  selection  in  Douglas  County.  Unsuccessful GOP gubernatorial  candi date Everett Sileven  sent  a  fundraising  letter asking for donations by saying "" ... I  have God. I know I can count on God. Can I  count on you?"" He closed the same letter  with ""I thank you and God thanks you.""  Sileven, an active fundamentalist minis ter, gained national attention when Jerry  October 17, 1986  Falwell, Tim Dixon and others rallied to his  cause because he was jailed for refusing to  hire state-certified teachers at his Louisville  Faith Baptist church school.  NORTH CAROLINA  In a primary marked by considerable ac tivity by the Religious Right, Representa tive JAMES BROYHILL defeated David Fun derburk for the Republican Senatorial nom ination.  For Jesse Helms' Congressional Club and  its senatorial candidate, David Funderburk,  it was not enough  to have a 100 percent  rating  from  the conservative Citizens  for  Constitutional Action  and  a  67  percent  rating from Christian Voice, as does BRoY HILL, an establishment Republican. Funder burk and other Religious Right activities  said BROYHILL was  too liberal because he  had  once  voted  for  the Equal Rights  Amendment and had voted to make Martin  Luther King's birthday a national holiday.  Funderburk actively courted  fundamen talist groups. Among other efforts, he re sponded to a questionnaire prepared by a  group called Students for Better Govern ment which included these questions: ""Can  you honestly say that you have a personal  relationship with Jesus Christ? How well do  you know him?"" and ""If you answered yes  ... would you, if elected, seek God's guid ance for your decisions? If no, how would  you determine your answers and solutions?""  Funderburk's answers  included:  ""I  think  that only by a strong belief in the Lord can  we  restore  the  foundation values of  the  value of human life,  the family, home &  church <& a fixed right & wrong) as central  to our country's survival . . . I stand for con servative beliefs and  traditional values  to  keep this nation free and one Blessed by  God ... I believe  in Jesus Christ as my  Lord and Savior,  relying on his guidance  first.""  OREGON  Joe  Jutz,  a  35-year-old  fundamentalist  Baptist minister, won a surprising 43 per cent of the vote against Senator BoB PAcK wooD in the Republican primary. Lutz spent  less than $40,000, while PAcKwooD spent $2  million on TV ads and phone banks. Lutz re ceived organizational and other help from  the Freedom Council, the American Coali tion for Traditional Values and Concerned  Women for America and claimed  to have  5,000 church-based volunteers. Lutz' posi tions  included calling for dismantling the  Federal Reserve Board and the Social Secu rity system, withdrawing from the United  Nations, lifting all sanctions against South  Africa, selling off federal lands and phasing  out property and income taxes.  SOUTH CAROLINA  The Religious Right has been active at a  number of  levels  in  the state, and  there  have been fights among different factions in  the movement.  The Religious Rights mounted a strong  challenge to Dr. George Graham, the party  chairman, who was  re-elected only after  promising to give the chairmanship to the  fundamentalists after this year's election.  Representative Thomas Hartnett, who  has strong ties to the Religious Right, is the  Republican nominee for Lieutenant Gover nor.

1861,883,23,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my  colleagues in tribute to a man of the highest  moral character and integrity who will be retir ing at the end of the 99th Congress.  BILL WHITEHURST  came  to Congress  in  1969, not as a politician, but as a respected  member of the academic community. During  his years as a professor and dean of students  at Old Dominion University, BILL WHITEHURST  was one of  the most admired and beloved  members of that facility.  He brought to Washington the insight of a  historian, and he could always be counted to  bring his learned perspective to any debate.  As  neighbors  in  the Rayburn Building,  I  have come to know BILL and his wife, Janie,  as warm and personable people who treat ev eryone with the highest of respect.  And I can tell you that BILL is a man of prin ciple. Earlier this year when this body consid ered  firearms  reform  legislation, BILL was a  strong consistent voice who stood up to the  powerful lobbies trying to weaken our laws.  BILL was one of the first to call for tougher  laws to protect our police officers and our citi zens, and not once did he stray from this con viction.  I know,  too, of BILL's  tireless works on  behalf of his Virginia constituents, and of his  deep commitment to protect the environment.  In every way he epitomizes the heritage of  Jefferson as a true Virginia gentleman whose  independence and  intellect helped better the  country we live in.  After  18  years  in Congress.  BILL  has  chosen to return  to his  first  love, academia.  He will be missed here, and I wish him noth ing but happiness and good health. What is  our loss, will become Norfolk's gain.  And I'm sure that he will continue to enlight en the minds of all those who come in contact  with him.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  CAMDEN DEVELOPS AS ARTS  FLOURISH  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 16, 1986  ",1986
1862,883,23,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, the arts have tra ditionally played a very  important role  in  the  history and culture of my own State of New  Jersey.  In  recent years, however,  there has  been renewed growth and vigor within the arts  community of New Jersey due  largely to the  firm Federal and State support for arts pro grams.  The  artistic  revitalization  taking  place  in  New Jersey has grasped  the  interest of a  number of organizations and  it has not only  received  support  from  arts-oriented groups  and individuals but also from corporate spon sors such as Campbell Soup and RCA. Some  37,000 artists reside  in  the New Jersey and  play an active role  in  furthering New Jersey  talent and culture.  I am especially proud of the attention given  to the city of Camden, which I represent, and  the  transformation Camden  is undergoing  in  terms of historical preservation and a prolif eration of art.  In addition, I was proud to see  the  attention  given  to Camden's  Artistic  Design Program which seeks to elevate com munity pride by placing murals on graffiti-cov ered walls. I commend the efforts of Kimberly  Camp,  the visual-arts coordinator for the city  of Camden. in this area. As a member of the  Congressional Arts Caucus, I had the opportu nity of working with Kimberly as she helped  coordinate the 1985 First Congressional Arts  Caucus competition and was  impressed by  both her commitment to the arts and her mul tifaceted talent.  The  two articles on Camden's revitilization  and on the Artistic Design Program follow:  [From the Horizon, October 1986]  A CULTURAL MOVEMENT  <By Julia Lichtblau)  A grass-roots arts movement has  taken  hold in Camden, New Jersey, and is growing  vigorously in the city's new climate of pride  and determination. Professional artists and  the community both are eagerly participat ing.  There  are  outdoor  performances  throughout  the  summer.  The  Camden  County Cultural and Heritage Commission  sponsors performances, school programs, a  statewide Teen Arts Festival, and an annual  juried exhibition  featuring  the works of  over two hundred local artists. The Artistic  Design Program employs professional art ists to plan murals for the city's graffiti-cov ered walls, and the city's teenagers help to  execute them. Original research in music is  going on at the Rutgers-Camden campus,  while the visual-arts department has a com puter-graphics program  that  is attracting  students from throughout the region. And  in Walt Whitman's chosen city, it is only ap propriate to have an award-winning poetry  magazine-the Mickle Street Review-pub lished on the campus; as well as the Walt  Whitman Center for the Arts and Human ities. <The area code for all Camden loca tions is 609.)  ART AND HISTORY MUSEUMS  Last year,  some  ten  thousand viewers  made their way to the Stedman Art Gallery  33587  <Fourth  and  Linden  Streets,  Fine-Arts  Center of Rutgers, the State University of  New  Jersey, Camden Campus, 757-6245).  The only art museum  in southern New  Jersey, it has been exhibiting, educating the  public, striving for a more national profile,  and nurturing  the  local arts community  since 1975.  ""We  try for an experimental  focus,"" says gallery director Virginia Steel.  ""As a university gallery, we can afford to  take chances and we should."" The Stedman  is nationally known for its biennial works on-paper competition, established in 1975 to  encourage contemporary American artists  using paper in both traditional and experi mental ways. The  last competition drew  twenty-seven  hundred  entries,  of which  eighty-six were selected. The gallery holds  eight changing exhibits a year, including an  interdisciplinary one that focuses on an art  or craft of a different culture. Such exhibits  are often touring to several galleries around  the country and make their only New York/  Philadelphia-area appearances at the Sted man.  The National Endowment for  the Arts funded Visiting-Artist Lecture Series yearly  brings six nationally known artists from dif ferent disciplines to the gallery to discuss  their work. Past  lectures have  included  Philip Glass and Laurie Anderson.  The fall 1986 season opens with a  joint  show of rare works by Andr~ Kert~sz and  Lucien Aigner, on loan from the Polaroid  Corporation. The Kert~sz prints are his first  color series, begun at the age of eighty-four.  Aigner's works are from a collection of fifty  thousand negatives of prewar Paris, found  in an old suitcase in 1970.  Camden is the international headquarters  of  the Campbell Soup Company which  maintains the Campbell Museum <Campbell  Place, 342-6440). The plush, red-velvet inte rior cradles what museum president Ralph  Collier  describes  as  ""the world's most  unique collection of soup tureens"" -which  includes  life-size swans,  rabbits, chickens,  boars' and cows' heads, cauliflowers, and  melons  in  silver,  pewter,  porcelain,  and  earthenware.  The  tureens, which  date  mostly from the early-eighteenth and nine teenth centuries, come from two dozen Eu ropean countries and China. Of particular  note  is  a gilt-and-painted  tureen bearing  images of early-nineteenth-century Berlin part of a 350-piece set for the marriage of  Prince Frederick of  the Netherlands and  Princess Louise of Prussia in 1825. A film,  ""Artistry in Tureens,"" can be shown by ap pointment to groups of up to fifty people.  Not  limited  to  soup-related  objects,  the  Campbell Museum has small changing ex hibits of prints, photographs, and decora tive-art objects.  History buffs will find a rich assortment  of historic sites in the Camden area, dating  from its origins as a Quaker settlement in  the early-eighteenth century through the  Industrial Revolution. Pomona Hall <Park  Boulevard and Euclid Avenue, 964-3333),  home of the Camden County Historical So ciety,  is  an eighteenth-century Georgian  mansion built by  the Coopers-Camden's  founding family and restored for use as a  museum during  the Bicentennial. Eight eenth-century furniture, quilts, farm imple ments, and even clothing-including Wil liam Cooper's vest, which dates to the early eighteenth  century-are on  exhibit. Up stairs, you'll find craft shops for candlemak ing, weaving, and shoemaking.  The museum also contains objects of par ticular significance to Camden-such as lo cally made glass, Campbell Soup artifacts,  ",1986
1863,896,23,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker, on August 23,  1986, President Reagan signed House Joint  Resolution  529,  a  resolution  declaring  the  week of September 21-27, 1986, as ""Emer gency Medical Services Week.""  I was a co sponsor of that resolution.  In Houston, TX,  there  is an exceptional  emergency medical  service  resource called  Life Flight which is operated by Hermann Hos pital, a not-for-profit  teaching hospital.  Life  Flight will celebrate its 1Oth year of service to  southeast Texas and western Louisiana on  November 2, 1986.  Mr. Speaker, Hermann Hospital inaugurated  Life Flight 1 0 years ago as  the  first civilian  emergency air ambulance service in the State  of Texas. The event  is of national historical  importance, because since then more than 50  medical centers throughout the United States  have emulated the Life Flight Program.  Today Life Flight is the Nation's largest hos pital-based airborne emergency medical serv ice. During its first decade of community serv ice, Life Flight has  flown more  than 27,000  missions to the scenes of accidents and trag edies in its service area.  This vital service has provided  the quick  and decisive emergency treatment required to  save lives, thereby sparing patients and their  families  from needless suffering. Life Flight  has improved the chances of survival for vic -tims of serious injuries and illnesses.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Houston is a sprawling city with miles and  miles of freeways that at times are impassable  by emergency ground  transportation. On a  daily basis, airborne Life Flight makes the dif ference between life and death for individuals  injured  in  traffic or other types of accidents.  Additionally, Life Flight serves numerous outly ing rural communities when there is a need for  the specialized medical and surgical services  located in the Texas Medical Center in Hous ton.  Hermann Hospital's  Life  Flight  Program  staffs  its helicopters with  registered nurse/  paramedics and University of Texas Medical  School physicians. These health care profes sionals are competent and compassionate in  their delivery of medical services for any who  require them, on the ground or in the air.  On behalf of the citizens of the Eighth Dis trict of Texas who are served by Life Flight, I  extend our appreciation to Hermann Hospital's  Life Flight Program,  its creators and profes sional staff  for their dedication and commit ment.  I congratulate  the Life Flight Program  on  the occasion of its 1Oth anniversary and  wish its staff many years of continued success  in service to the Houston community.  THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BIG  Y FOODS IN AGAWAM, MA  HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 16, 1986  ",1986
1864,896,23,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, the  D'Amour brothers decided  to stop dreaming  about going into business for themselves and  take action. They started out, as most small  businesses do, on a shoestring budget and a  prayer, but  they had something more  than  most. They had a couple of qualities  that  western Massachusetts  residents know very  well-undying spirit and a die hard work ethic.  Since 1936, they have transformed a small  family grocery business into a $250 million a  year company comprised of 2,000 hard work ing and dedicated employees. Like most of  America's successful businesses, Big Y Foods  has  thrived  not  just on  sweat and  elbow  grease but on unity.  Everyone  I've  talked  to at Big Y Foods  seems to feel a sense of family, and that is a  relationship  that doesn't come easily.  It is a  relationship built on years of mutual  respect  and a common goal of being the very best.  The D'Amour family's dream has spread to  all  its employees and that is a unity that will  continue to thrive here and lead them to even  greater successes in the future. Pride is a very  powerful  force-and pride  in  the quality of  their work,  the quality of  their products and  the quality of their reputation has made Big Y  an outstanding success.  I rise today not just to celebrate 50 years, a  half century, of success but to thank all who  have made  that success possible.  I want  to  thank the D'Amours for their dream, to thank  the produce clerks, check-out clerks, grocery  baggers and all employees  for  their efforts.  And I want to encourage them to look to the  future as an exciting time of growth and fur ther success.  October 17, 1986  Western Massachusetts  is proud of Big Y  Foods and all those who patronize their stores  keep coming back week after week because  they appreciate good service, quality products  and a 50-year tradition of fairness.  Thank you all at Big Y Foods for your ef forts and good luck with the future.  TRIBUTE TO MS. LENA  RUGGIERO  HON. JOHN G. ROWLAND  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 16, 1986  ",1986
1865,896,23,Mr. ROWLAND of Connecticut.," Mr. Speak er, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Lena Rug giero, a constituent of mine who resides in the  Fifth Congressional District in the city of Wa terbury.  Lena has a longstanding record of service  to  the community, going back as  far as  the  1920's. She has been an active participant in  the political process and has served on  the  Waterbury Republican Town Committee con secutively since 1930. As such,  Lena has  served  under  fifteen  separate GOP  town  chairmen.  Lena also has been a candidate for State  representative and has served on the board of  aldermen in Waterbury.  Lena will be moving away from Waterbury  and her many friends will certainly miss her.  So Mr. Speaker,  I do want  to  take note of  Lena's many contributions to the city of Wa terbury as well as wish her the best of luck in  her future endeavors.  TRIBUTE TO PARREN J.  MITCHELL  SPEECH OF  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 14, 1986  ",1986
1866,896,23,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker,  I am honored  today to take this occasion to pay tribute to  an esteemed colleague, a good friend, and a  genuine inspiration, PARREN J. MITCHELL,  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Maryland.  PARREN MITCHELL may be leaving this body in  one sense, but the contributions he has made  to this institution will ensure that he will be a  part of us for years to come.  Members  distinguish  themselves  for  any  number of reasons  in  this House. Some are  noted for their legislative prowess, others for  their records on constituent service.  It stems  from  the dual nature of these positions. We  are  legislators and we are Representatives.  Yet there are some in this House who reach  still another  level-those who serve as  the  consciences for all. PARREN MITCHELL is one  such figure in  this House. PARREN MITCHELL,  from the day he entered this House until the  day we reach sine die in  the 99th Congress,  has served as a conscience in the House of  Representatives. He was not merely an advo cate for causes-he was often the champion,  the  leader. The old expression seems apt:  ",1986

We are slowly losing the  ability to manufacture critical components of  weapons systems  that are essential  for our  ",1986
1868,961,23,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  to the attention of my colleagues the story of  a U.S. military hero who has heretofore been  denied the credit and admiration he richly de serves. The centennial of one of the most in trepid acts of  the Apache wars  in Arizona,  New Mexico, and Northern Mexico, was ob served this past September, and  few people  outside  historians  know  the whole  story  behind the surrender of Geronimo to the U.S.  Army. History books often give credit to Brig.  Gen. Nelson A. Miles, while it was the cour age, hard work, and perseverance of 1st Lt.  Charles Baehr Gatewood  that  led  to Geron imo's bloodless surrender.  Mr. Daniel Thrapp, a respected Arizona his torian  and  author of numerous books on  Southwestern  and  Indian  history  recently  wrote me about this unsung American hero,  Lt. Charles B. Gatewood.  Lieutenant Gatewood, in poor health after 9  years of the most arduous duty and valuable  by Brig. Gen.  field  service, was  directed  Nelson A. Miles  in  the summer of 1886 to  take two Apache scouts, to endeavor to find  Geronimo,  and  talk him  into  surrendering.  Gatewood never gave a thought to declining  this service, although  for health reasons he  would surely have been justified in doing so.  Instead, after an exhausting search he did  locate Geronimo,  though 5,000  troops under  Miles had failed to do so. With his two scouts  and an  interpreter, he entered  the hostile  camp of the feared Apache. Over a period of  a  few days  the surrender was effected, ac complishing  through negotiation what 5,000  men failed to do by force.  33665  Many other soldiers  received Medals of  Honor for their parts  in  the several Apache  wars. Lieutenant Gatewood was denied, due  largely, in the words of one expert, to ""Army  jealousies and  the pettiness and vanity that  marred  the  really great soldierly qualities of  Miles."" Rather he was tucked away on Miles'  staff  in  Los Angeles where he  could  be  reached by neither media nor public.  The following excerpt is from Mr. Thrapp's  definitive  ""Encyclopedia of Frontier Biogra phy"":  Gatewood, Charles Baehr, army officer  <April 6, 1853-May 20, 1896). B. near Wood stock, Va., of a Secessionist family, he at tended West Point. Upon graduation he was  assigned in 1877 to the 6th Cavalry and em barked upon a singular career in the Apache  country as commander of Indian scouts. His  experience  in  the numerous Apache out breaks was perhaps more  extensive and  more indispensable than that of any other  officer. Gatewood took part in many actions  of the Victorio War of 1879-80,  including  the hard pursuit of the hostiles into Chi huahua in 1879; the heavy action in the San  Andres Mountains of New Mexico in 1880,  and several fights in the Black Range. He  accompanied Crook's great expedition into  the Sierra Madre in 1883 after the hostiles,  afterward being assigned to manage some of  the returned Indians on the Fort Apache  Reservation. Gatewood had an  important  role in the Geronimo campaign of 1885-86; .  it was he who was selected by Miles to enter  Mexico, locate the enemy and persuade him  to surrender, and Gatewood performed this  duty to the letter, although in poor physical  health at the time. His intrepid entry into  Geronimo's camp and arguing that Indian  to finally give hiinself up  is perhaps the  highlight of the last southwestern Indian  war, although Gatewood never received any  particular  recognition  for his  intrepidity  and devotion to duty on the part of Miles or  other officers of the Miles faction. This is  not only to Miles' eternal discredit, but also  to that of his country. Gatewood served as  an aide to Miles in Southern California; in  1889 he rejoined his regiment at Fort Win gate, N.M. He went with the 6th Cavalry to  the Dakotas for the 1890-91 Sioux trouble,  was on leave for some months because of  poor health, rejoined his regiment at Fort  McKinney, Wyo., where he was injured se verely in a dynamite explosion coincident to  the so-called Johnson County War. He was  forced  to  retire permanently from active  duty and died, probably at Denver. ""His  reward for services that have often been de scribed as unusual, was like that of many  another soldier who has given his all that  his country might grow and prosper:  for  himself a free plot of ground in Arlington  Cemetery, and to his widow a tardy seven teen dollars a month.""

1885,987,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," If the gentleman  will yield, as far as I can determine,  this deals only with the Immigration  and Nationality Act and it so states  and contains no amendments that are  non-germane.  Unfortunately, the staff is not here  tonight, so there has not been a staff  analysis, but it is a very simple bill and  the gentleman is welcome to look at it.

1890,987,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," If the gentleman  will yield, the change in the fiscal year  references  from  fiscal year 1986  to  1987 is obviously a substantive change.  But as far as I can determine, this has  no other change. It does not change  the amounts of money, and it merely  appears  to be a conforming amend ment which relates to the bill to the  calendar year that we are in.  ",1986

1899,987,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the bill <H.R. 4444)  to amend the Immigration and Nation ality Act, and for other purposes, with  a  Senate  amendment  thereto,  and  concur in the Senate amendment.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The Clerk read the Senate amend ment, as follows:  Page 10, after line 14, insert:  SEC. 22.  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF CITIZEN SHIP FOR CHILDREN ADOPTED BY  UNITED STATES CITIZENS.  Section 341 of the Immigration and Na tionality Act <8 U.S.C. 1452) is amended (!) by inserting ""<a>"" after ""341."", and  <2> by adding at the end the following new  subsection:  ""(b)(l) The adoptive citizen parent or par ents of a child described in paragraph (2)  may apply to the Attorney General for a  certificate of citizenship for the child. Upon  proof to the satisfaction of the Attorney  General that the applicant and spouse, if  married, are citizens of the United States,  whether by birth or by naturalization, and  that the child is described in paragraph (2),  the child shall become a  citizen of  the  United States and shall be furnished by the  Attorney General with a certificate of citi zenship, but only if the child is at the time  within the United States.

1902,987,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding, I will endeavor to  explain this as best I can.  The  Immigration  and Nationality  Act Amendments provided for the is suance of certificates of citizenship for  children that were adopted by United  States citizens. When it went over to  the Senate, they made some amend ments to that provision, which, frank ly, I am unable to determine exactly  what the effect of the amendments  that they made is.  0 2050  As far as I can see, it does not result  in any substantive change to the origi nal intent of the bill.  The apparent difference, as far as I  can determine, is that the other body  added an amendment that the provi sions with respect to citizenship for  adopted children would apply only if  the child is, at the time, within the  United States. That was not in the  House bill.  There may be  some other minor  changes, but as far as I can determine,  that is the only one, and there is noth ing in here that is not germane to the  bill or that relates to any other sub ject matter.

1906,987,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, this  bill was an addition  to  the existing  law. The existing  law did not ade quately cover the question of the issu ance of certificates of citizenship for  children adopted by U.S. citizens, and  this was an effort to correct that pro vision.  This amendment requires that upon  proof of satisfaction by the Attorney  General that the applicant and spouse  are  citizens  of  the United States,  either by birth or by naturalization,  and that then the child become a citi zen of the United States and can re ceive a certificate of citizenship if the  ",1986
1907,1000,23,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Thank you, Mr.  President.  NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE HERE  TO STAY  ",1986
1908,1000,23,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, it is  time some one takes on the myth that  we  can  eliminate  nuclear weapons  from the face of the Earth. Who says  we can? President Reagan has con tended  that SDI or Star Wars will  make nuclear weapons impotent and  obsolete. He contends that with Star  Wars we can live in a world without  nuclear weapons. Secretary General  Gorbachev more recently showed his  flair for public relations when he con tended  that the super powers could  negotiate away nuclear weapons not  some  time  in  the dim and distant  future but by  the year 2000. Both  super power  leaders have predicted  not simply  that their  two countries  could and would abolish nuclear weap ons but that our two countries could  somehow free the entire world of this  terrible threat.  Mr. President, is this possible? Politi cally it is not easy to deny this fond  wish that so many human beings all  over  the Earth share  so  fervently.  Why can we not go back to that world  as it was before Hiroshima? That trip  back-in-time has  to be an especially  happy dream for Americans. Here we  Americans snuggly sit behind two vast  oceans with  the world's mightiest  Navy patrolling and protecting us. On  our north we have a relatively small,  friendly free and democratic Canada.  On our south we have a  relatively  small,  friendly,  free and democratic  Mexico. If we could escape the terrible  threat of a nuclear attack, we could  live in the warm assurance that any  war we fought could be kept from our  shores.  Our  soldiers,  sailors  and  airmen might die in the struggle for  freedom abroad. But Americans could  live in the perpetual serenity of peace  at home.  But no more. Nuclear weapons de stroyed all that. With nuclear weapons  and the intercontinental missiles that  can transport them in a few minutes  from Russia or China to the United  States we could lose all of our major  cities and most of our people within a  single day.  So the most entrancing dream any  American  leader can hold out  is a  dream  that we can somehow,  if we  spend  enough money,  if we  pour  enough of our marvelous  scientific  technology  into  it, protect ourselves  forever. We can go back to that bliss ful period before the dawn of the nu clear weapon age when America was  impregnable-an island of peace and  freedom.  Why is this not possible? It is not  possible  because we  cannot  escape  from reality. Nuclear weapons are a  fact of life. They are a fact of life be cause with American  research, our  country developed and actually used  them in war. They are a fact of life be cause literally thousands of scientists  living all over the world now know pre cisely how to design, fabricate and as semble them. The raw materials, the  plutonium and uranium that provide  the vital  energy  for  these  terrible  weapons are present in abundance in  many parts of the world.  There  is another grim fact of life  that few of us are willing to face. It is  the fact that the super power peace of  the past forty years has been main tained  for  one  surpassing  reason:  Why? Because both super powers have  had  in  their possession  the nuclear  weapons  to devastate,  totally devas tate, the adversary in retaliation for a  nuclear attack. This so called Mutual  Assured Destruction or MAD is a grim  fulfillment of Churchill's insight that  in this nuclear world ""Safety is  the  twin child of terror.""  Let us assume the very best outcome  for the objective expressed by Secre tary  Gorbachev  and  President  Reagan-that we can eradicate nuclear  weapons from the face of the Earth.  Assume that we do exactly that. What  then? In a nuclear free world isn't a  superpower  conventional world war  not of the kind that has taken place so  regularly between  the world's great  powers throughout history much more  likely? The certainty of total double  defeat and the swift and sure end of  civilization would be gone. And if con ventional war began what shape would  that take in the 21st century?  In the past 40 years the devastating  effect of conventional weapons has  enormously  increased. And keep  in  mind that at the end of World War II  the fire bombing of Dresden and Ham burg in a strictly conventional weapon  attack left fatalities and devastation  as terrible as the nuclear attacks on  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since 1945  conventional weapons have become far  more destructive.  It is worse. In a conventional war,  both sides would be tempted to use the  ultimate nuclear weaponsabolished  by  agreement between  the warring  parties, but capable of being quickly  fabricated,  deployed,  and  ignited  within a matter of days. Would nuclear weapons come back? What do you  think?  Mr. President, a  few years ago a  group of brilliant scholars at Harvard  University-the  Harvard  Nuclear  Study Group wrote a book entitled  ""Living With  Nuclear Weapons.""  These scholars concluded: ""Any form  of atomic  escapism  is  a  dead  end.  Living with nuclear weapons  is our  only hope. It requires that we perse vere in reducing the likelihood of war  even  though we cannot remove  the  possibility altogether."" To which this  Senator says-Amen.  MYTH  OF  THE DAY-BUDGET  REFORMS HAVE STREAMLINED  THE CONGRESSIONAL WORK LOAD  ",1986
1909,1000,23,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  myth of the day is the perception that  budget reforms over the past 12 years  have  streamlined  the  congressional  workload. Even though this was the  expectation of the Budget Impound ment and Control Act of 1974,  the  events of the past several days provide  ample  evidence  that  these expecta tions have gone unfulfilled.  What is this evidence? We need look  no further than to what has happened  to the massive continuing resolution.  Continuing  resolutions  historically  were short in length and time period.  They were often only a few lines long  or at most a few pages. Now they are  hundreds of pages long-filled with ex traneous material and even complete  authorization bills.  Combining all the unenacted appro priations bills into one large CR causes  numerous  problems-not  the  least  being the constriction of the congres sional  schedule  into  a  short  time  period at the very end of the session.  Due to the atmosphere at the time of  the end of session CR's, there is little  opportunity to debate the issues in the  depth necessary  to make  informed  judgments. There  is pressure not to  offer amendments in order to recess.  Vital issues go unexplored.  In the past 26 years the Congress  has enacted 90 CR's-1960 through  1985. The number of pages in CR's has  increased dramatically. And with the  increase in pages has come the expect ed increase in complexity. No longer is  the CR a simple document to continue  the operations of the Government for  a limited time period. Now the CR is  the vehicle  for  passing  just about  every  type of  legislation before  the  Congress.  And all of this has come at the ex pense of the congressional  timetable  which has been expanded, overlooked,  dismissed, disregarded, and forgotten.  The promised reforms-to begin our  deliberations earlier and finish earli er-have faded into obscurity, perhaps  never  to be seen again. They held  ",1986

1915,1052,23,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, on No vember 4 and 5, 1985, West Virginia  was devastated by floods. On Novem ber 6, I traveled to West Virginia and I  took officials from the Federal Emer gency Management Agency, the Corps  of Engineers. and the Soil Conserva tion Service with me,  to view  first hand the devastation. Of West Virgin ia's 55 counties, 29 were declared disas ter areas.  After that devastation, many won dered if those towns and small commu nities would ever recover. Many towns  were cutoff  from  their neighboring  communities by  roads, bridges,  and  rail lines which had been destroyed by  the flood. More than 60 bridges were  washed out, and roadways were sev ered  in  innumerable places,  leaving  communities and businesses  isolated.  Families,  in a matter of hours,  lost  their homes, their jobs, and in some  cases, their loved ones.  The legislation before us today reau thorizes  the Disaster Relief Act.  provides the Federal Emergency Man agement Agency with the authority to  respond immediately to disaster situa tions and allows that Agency to task  other Federal  agencies  to  perform  It  emergency work. While  the Federal  Government cannot work miracles, it  does have a vital role in helping its  citizens during times of disaster. West  ",1986
1916,1065,23,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, today we  are attempting to pass legislation deal ing with emergency measures designed  to provide regulators with tools they  need to deal with insolvent depository  institutions. While  the distinguished  Senator from Wisconsin has agreed  that these items are indeed emergency  measures, Senator PRoXMIRE would  extend that categorization to so-called  nonbank banks.  The issue of nonbank banks is not a  new one. It has been characterized by  some as emergency legislation but, as I  have said on many previous occasions,  the nonbank bank issue cannot be ad dressed by itself. That issue is the ""Si amese twin"" of the issue of additional  products and services for banks. While  I would have hoped to deal with those  issues  in comprehensive  legislation which I introduced earlier this year-it  became evident that the limited time  remaining would not permit this  to  occur.  I am encouraged, however that as a  result of this process many of the com peting industries members have begun  discussions  regarding  the  broader  issues of financial services reform.  I  attach as part of the RECORD  a letter  dated August 12 from many financial  service  providers which  indicates  a  commitment  to move  forward with  those broader issues in the lOOth Con gress.  In  addition,  the  administration  through  the Treasury Department  strongly endorses a comprehensive ap proach to dealing with reform of the  financial service industry and opposes  a narrow loophole closing approach.

1917,1078,23,Mr. DENTON.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of H.R. 5560,  the Child  Sexual Abuse and Pornography Act of  1986, a bill to outlaw the advertising of  child pornography and to strengthen  the Mann Act's protection against the  sexual exploitation of minors. I com mend my distinguished colleague from  Delaware [Mr. RoTH]  for his leader ship in the fight against pornography  and for sponsoring S. 2398 the Senate  companion measure.  Mr. President, pornography attacks  human dignity itself at its very core. It  is an epidemic that devastates the per sonal and social well-being of contem porary society. We must remain alert  to  its effects and take countermeas ures to prevent its spread. Pornogra phy encourages  the sexual exploita tion and abuse of men, women, and  children, with tragic consequences.  Testimony  received  in  the Senate  Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile  Justice indicated beyond a doubt that  the effects of pornography are devas tating, both to the individual and to  society. The sex industry abuses and  exploits not only those who engage in  making pornography, and those who  are exposed to it, but also those who  are victimized by its effects on other  people. It uses every means of social  communication: books, magazines, tab loids, films, video cassettes, subscrip tion television, video games, coin-oper ated machines, computers, and erotic  telephone messages.  Pornography  is an offense against  the rights of all people. It is a problem  which victimizes everyone. In order to  deal effectively with the problem we  must recognize that pornography vic timizes all members of society, regard less of sex, age, race, religion, or social  station. Pornography  is  particulary  egregious when children become un willing participants or when children  are sexually abused or exploited as a  result of the pornography.  Mr. President, hearings conducted  by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittees on Juvenile Justice, Criminal Law,  and  the Subcommittee on Security  and Terrorism, which  I  chair, have  demonstrated beyond doubt that there  is a direct link between child pornog raphy and the sexual abuse and ex ploitation of our Nation's children. In  fact, at the Subcommittee on Security  and Terrorism hearing, testimony was  presented by the FBI that pedophiles  make extensive use of child pornogra phy to stimulate and justify their be havior, to lower the child's inhibitions  and reluctance, to blackmail the child  victim and to establish a medium by  which  they  can  communicate with  other like-minded criminals.  Mr. President,  the Congress must  work  to eliminate the production of  child pornography and the sexual ex ploitation and abuse of our children. It  is only through hard work and coop eration  that, we can find a way  to  solve the problem of child sexual ex ploitation which,  because  of  past  errors, has been allowed  to flourish  unabated. The production of child por nography degrades and exploits chil dren in a fundamental, inhumane, un civilized way, and harms all of society  in the process.  Mr.  President,  the Child Sexual  Abuse and Pornography Act of 1986,  provides a  useful  tool  in our  fight  against child pornography. The bill  creates a criminal penalty for advertis ing or  soliciting child pornography  and child sexual abuse,  revises  the  Mann Act  so  that  it will apply  to  males as well as females and outlaws  the ""trading"" of young children by pe dophiles across State lines, regardless  of whether  the activity  is done  for  ""commerical"" purposes.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to support this important piece of leg islation.   ",1986

1928,1104,23,Mr.  CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  H.R. 4531, the wetlands loan extension  bill,  contains  provisions  concerning  the California sea otter that are of  great interest in my State. For this  and other reasons, I support its pas sage.  Almost 10 years ago, the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service listed the Califor nia sea otter, Ehydria lutris nereis, as  a threatened species under the Endan gered Species Act. The decision to list  it as threatened was based upon con cerns over the population's small size  and  limited geographic distribution,  and the risk of a major oil spill from  tanker  traffic  in  the vicinity of  its  range.  But the status of the sea otter has  not improved since its listing in 1977.  In fact, due to additional threats such  as  the  incidental  take of otters  in  coastal gillnet  fisheries and  the oil  spill risk associated with offshore oil  and gas exploration and development,  the California sea otter is more vulner able than it was in 1977. Prior to com mercial exploitation in the 19th centu ry, an estimated 18,000 otters were  found in California. By 1914, the pop ulation had been reduced to about 50.  This small  remnant population was  given protection under State and Fed eral law and was estimated to number  1,800  animals  by  the mid-1970's.  Recent estimates put the population  closer  to  between  1,300  and  1,400  adults. Clearly,  there  is need to act  now  to protect  this  important, but  highly vulnerable, species.  The legislation that we have before  us would facilitate the effort to bring  about the recovery of this threatened  species. As  indicated  in  the Endan gered Species Act recovery plan for  the California sea otter, one of  the  goals that must be achieved to bring  about the restoration of this popula tion  is  the establishment of one or  more sea otter colonies at sufficient  distance  from  the existing range  to  ensure that only a small proportion of  the population could be adversely impacted by any environmental catastro phe. The importance of this step is  highlighted by recent near-misses  the vicinity of the sea otter range.  in  In April 1984, the tanker Sealift Pa cific, carrying over 6 million gallons of  diesel  fuel-twice  the  estimated  volume released during the 1969 Santa  Barbara  oil  platform  blowout-lost  power and drifted to within only 1lh  miles of shore in the midst of the Cali fornia Sea Otter Refuge. Had her  anchor not  held,  she would  have  broken up on  the  rocks. No Coast  Guard vessel or commercial tug could  have reached her in time to prevent  disaster. In November 1984, the tanker  Puerto Rico, crippled by three explo sions, broke in two, spilling over 1 mil lion gallons of oil into the ocean off  San Francisco. Oil spill trajectory pro jections were  180°  off;  spilled  oil  moved 20 miles overnight and washed  ashore as much as 140 miles north of  the spill site. Had the oil gone as far  south-as  originally  prdicted-as  it  went north, it would have soiled the  northern portion of  the  sea otter  range. In February 1986, oil from the  leaking tanker barge Apex HoU8ton en route from San Francisco to Los  Angeles-killed thousands of seabirds  from Marin to San Luis Obispo coun ties-but, fortunately, in this case, re mained far out to sea, thus sparing the  otters' near shore habitat.  The provisions of  this  legislation  would clarify the legal authorities that  apply  to  translocations.  It would  enable the Fish and Wildlife Service to  establish a procedure that would ad dress  the concerns of organizations  and agencies interested in and affected  by sea otter recovery efforts. In fact,  most of the concerned interest groups  have had a hand in drafting this lan guage. It represents a consensus ap proach for proceeding with the pro posed translocation.  The bill contains several key ele ments. First, it requires the Fish and  Wildlife Service to develop a plan for  the establishment of the translocated  population. The purpose of this plan is  to provide both a blueprint for carry ing out the  translocation and a de scription of the protections that will  apply to the population. In addition,  the plan is to discuss, in general terms,  the factors that would be taken into  account in determining the relation ship between a  successful  transloca tion and the status of the California  sea otter under the Endangered Spe cies Act, including how the establish ment of a successful colony would be  considered  in future biological opin ions under section 7(a)(2) of the act.  In this regard, the translocation plan  is viewed as a planning device for the  translocation  itself.  Specifications  with respect to long-term management  of the overall California sea otter population, including recovery goals and  the need for future translocations, are  to be addressed  the Endangered  Species Act recovery plan.  in  ",1986
1929,1117,23,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent for  the consider ation of H.R. 5420, which amends sec tion 3726 of  title 31 of  the United  States Code, relating to payment for  transportation,  to permit repayment  audits for selected transportation bills,  to permanently authorized payment of  transportation audit contractors from  overpayments collected and to author ize net overpayments collected to be  transferred to the Treasury.  The exact Senate companion to this  bill, S. 2630, as amended, was unani mously reported by my Committee on  Governmental Affairs on October 2,  1986.  S. 2630 was initially drafted over a  year ago in response to a recommenda tion of the President's Private Sector  Survey on Cost Control,  otherwise  known as the Grace Commission. The  Grace Commission's study of the Gen eral Services Administration's system  for  transportation audits discovered  that GSA had backlogs in its audits of  transportation and travel charges that  stretched back some 22 months. The  result of these delays was that many  improper  charges  to  the Govern ment-amounting to millions of dol lars each year-were unlikely ever to  be  recovered.  These  findings were  later confirmed by  the General Ac counting Office.  Since some 80 percent of the total  transportation expense to the Govern ment is incurred by the Department of  Defense,  the Grace Commission and  GAO recommended that the transpor tation audit operation for Defense be  transferred to DOD with provision for  contracting out  the bulk of  trans ferred audit operations. Generally  I  would be opposed to having the same  agency that spends  in charge of an  audit of that spending. But the prob lem had gotten  so  large,  that  the  Grace  Commission/GAO  proposal  began to look reasonable. GAO report ed, for example, that transfer of the  Defense Department audit responsibil ity with  contracting-out  provisions  would save $90 million over 3 years.  Since preparation of S. 2630, howev er, I am pleased to report that aggres sive new  leadership  in  the General  Services Administration has responded  positively to the Grace Commission's  findings and has turned around a bad  situation. About a year ago the Sup plemental Appropriations Act for 1985  approved the financing of transporta tion audit contracts from overcharges  collected by GSA. This change, along  with  certain management  improve ments in the program have resulted in  a dramatic  turn-around  in both  the  auditing backlogs and the amounts of  overcharges collected.  Even with its present limited use of  audit contractors, GSA has increased  its net collections for  transportation  overcharges from $5.9 million in fiscal  year 1985 to an estimated $15.4 million  for  fiscal year 1986. With  increased  use of contractors for fiscal year 1987,  net collections are estimated  to  in crease to $23.1 million this year, climb ing to $28 million in fiscal year 1988,  and to $32.2 million in fiscal year 1989  as the audit backlog continues to drop.  The Congressional Budget Office esti mates net savings  in outlays during  the next 3  fiscal years 0987, 1988,  1989) of $15 million; $17 million; and  $17 million respectively.  Now  GSA  proposes,  and  OMB  agrees, that the authority of GSA to  contract out for transportation audits  should be expanded. However,  pay ments to contractors in any 1 fiscal  year should not exceed 40 percent, and  payment for any one contract audit  should not exceed 50 percent of the  overpayment  identified. Net  collec tions are to be transferred to miscella neous receipts of the Treasury. Fur ther, GSA proposes that they be given  limited preaudit authority, subject to  the provisions of the Prompt Payment  Act. This will make protection of the  Government possible where transpor tation firms are teetering on the brink  of bankruptcy.  All of these GSA-proposed measures  are contained in the measure passed  by the House, H.R. 5420, just as they  were  in S. 2630, as reported by the  Senate Committee on Governmental  Affairs.  In addition, this bill provides for a  GSA-Defense  Department-other  agency task force to explore the devel opment of an  integrated, automated  system for the management of trans portation services for the Federal Gov ernment. The technology for such a  system is  in hand but the means of  employing that technology have yet to  be devised.  Finally, H.R.  5420  has  a  section  which will repeal an antiquated proce dure  required  for  the  disposal  of  excess Federal property overseas. The  Departments of Agriculture and Com merce have estimated that this provi sion will eliminate unnecessary regula tory and paperwork burdens on busi nesses dealing in surplus merchandise  and reduce the Commerce and Agri culture workloads.  Mr. President, I am pleased to report  that the Grace Commission, now rep resented by Citizens Against Govern ment Waste, and  the Senate Grace  Caucus as represented by the initial  cosponsors of S. 2630, Senators HuM PHREY, DECONCINI,  PROXMIRE, BRAD LEY,  ZORINSKY, CHILES,  and HATCH,  in  JOin  the Senator  from Delaware  support for H.R. 5420.

I  have  long urged  legislation  to  strengthen and make more coherent  our national response to this rapidly  growing public health problem. Earlier  in this 99th Congress, I introduced two  bills-S. 1835 and S. 2183-to alleviate  the suffering of victims and their fam ilies.  An estimated 2.5 million to 3 million  Americans suffer today from Alzhei mer's disease, and their families suffer  with  them,  physically,  emotionally,  psychologically, financially. The cost  to the Nation is some $40 billion annu ally  for  this devastating disease,  a  killer which turns the ""golden years""  into nightmare years.  When we  relate  the statistics  for  Alzheimer's disease with those for pro jected life expectancy, the nightmare  threatens to overwhelm us along with  our health care  institutions.  It has  been estimated that more than 1 of  every 10 Americans-some 13 percent  of us-will be over 65 by the year 2000,  with the number of victims of severe  dementia  increasing by  60  percent.  The prospect of millions of demented  adults requiring long-term care, cost ing many billions of dollars in a real  and frightening possibility. And I am  not now speaking of the personal indi vidual tragedies underlying those sta tistics.  Medical  science has extended  the  lifespan; but, I believe, given the nec essary resources, medical science, and  health services research can eliminate  the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease, im prove the quality of life in our later  years, and reduce the tremendous fi nancial burden on caregivers and the  health care system.  The  provisions Senator GRASSLEY  and I have drafted today underscore  the critical need for expansion of both  biomedical  and  health  services  re search through the National Institute  of Aging,  the National  Institute of  Mental Health,  and  the National  Center for Health Services Research.

MAC MATHIAS Was  in that class, also, but he came to the  Senate with 8 years of service in the  House behind him. MAc was one of the  experienced members of our group,  which included several of the current  Members of the Senate. BARRY GoLD WATER,  returning after a  6-year ab sence, and BoB DoLE, who also had ex perience in the House, also were part  of that class.

1944,1182,23,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, when  I first came to Washington as a young  law  school graduate, RussELL LoNG  was  already  a well-known Senator.

Yet, Mr. President, despite his se niority and powerful position, RussELL  was most kind and gracious to me, a  junior Member, probably because he  had originally come to the Senate to  serve out the unexpired term of an other Senator as  I  had.

Caro lyn and I have often discussed those  wonderful  post-World War  II days  here in Washington.  RussELL,  you have  left behind a  great legacy for future Senators from  Louisiana and for all Members of the  Senate. Your  record of accomplish ments  in  the Finance Committee  is  known even to those who have just a  passing familiarity with  the Senate,  but  to  those who  really know  the  Senate, your work in the Commerce  Committee and your efforts as assist ant majority  leader are also signifi cant.  And, as I have often remarked here  on the floor of the Senate, Alaskans  remember and are indebted to you as  one of the true leaders of the fight for  Alaska statehood. Your support  for  our efforts to achieve admission to the  Union was critical in the statehood de bates. As one who studied the issues,  your help was invaluable. In addition,  your encouragement of your  fellow  Louisianan, George Lehleitner, father  of the Alaska-Tennessee plan, was an  important contribution to our work to  make Alaska the 49th State.  It has been a pleasure and an honor  to work with you, RussELL. Catherine  and I and all your colleagues wish you  and Carolyn the best possible in your  lives after you leave the Senate. We  know we will see much of you.e  TOM EAGLETON  e ",1986
1945,1182,23,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, ToM  EAGLETON and I spent many hours to gether during the first years of our  service in the Senate. I remember well  our trip to South Vietnam in the early  1970's. Although we did not agree to tally on the question of United States  involvement  in Vietnam, ToM and  I  studied the situation there and met  with  leading  civilian, military,  and  press people to find out the facts, as  well as we could for ourselves.  And, as we  found ourselves  living  rather close  to one another here  in  Washington, we saw each other social ly more than most Members of the  Senate.  As members of  the Governmental  Affairs Committee, we have spent a lot  of time together here in the Senate.  ToM's patience has been sorely tried a  time or two during hearings we have  both participated in, for we  tend to  contradict each other. But, he has pur sued his point of view  in every  in",1986
1946,1234,23,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, on October 17 Con gress approved the conference report on H.R.  6,  the Water Resources Development Act of  1986. Since the passage of that legislation a  matter has come  to my attention which  re quires clarification.  Section 854 modifies the project for beach  erosion control, Sandy Hook to Barnegat Inlet,  NJ. For projects in  the bill  three figures are  shown. One  is  the  total cost of the project  which under section 902 of the bill establishes  the maximum cost of the project. The other  two figures shown-the estimated first Federal  cost and the estimated first non-Federal cost  are informational only, representing presently  estimated costs  to be  incurred during con struction of the project, not including repay ments over time which may be required to be  made to the Federal Government by non-Fed eral  interests. These are only estimates de signed to give a general idea of Federal and  non-Federal responsibilities and have no legal  effect. In the case of section 854, these esti mated costs are inaccurate because they do  not reflect  the specific cost sharing  require ment specified in subsection (b). The control ling language in subsection (b) with regard to  Federal and non-Federal responsibilities pro vides that the non-Federal share of the cost  of construction and maintenance of the ocean  township to Sandy Hook Beach of the project  shall consist of amounts expended by non Federal interests for reconstruction of the sea wall at Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach, NJ.  LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF H.R.  1790, MILITARY LANDS WITH DRAWAL ACT OF 1986  HON. JOHN F. SEIBERLING  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, October 18, 1986  ",1986
1947,1234,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, on October  17, 1986, the House passed H.R. 1790, the  Military  lands Withdrawal Act of 1986, after  adopting my amendment  in  the nature of a  substitute. On October 18,  the Senate also  passed  the bill and cleared  it for  the Presi dent.  H.R. 1790 was originally introduced by Rep resentative BYRON of Maryland on March 28,  1985, and was referred to the Committee on  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Interior and Insular Affairs. Within the commit tee,  responsibility  for  initial consideration of  the measure was assigned to the Subcommit tee on Public lands, which I chaired.  During 1986,  the subcommittee held four  hearings on H.R. 1790, at which we carefully  reviewed its significance with respect to each  of the areas of public lands which the bill pro posed for withdrawal. Members and staff also  visited all the areas.  Based on the information obtained through  the hearing process and inspection visits, the  subcommittee and full committee acted sepa rately on two military withdrawal bills. One of  those bills was H.R. 4351, which dealt with  the  two areas  in Nevada-the  ""Bravo 20""  Area and the Nellis Air Force Range-includ ed  in H.R. 1790. The other was H.R. 5389,  which dealt with  the areas  in Alaska-Fort  Wainwright Maneuver Area, Fort Greely Ma neuver Area, and Fort Greely Air Drop Zone included  in H.R. 1790. Each of  these bills,  after being favorably reported by the Commit tee on Interior and Insular Affairs, passed the  House. However, neither was acted on by the  Senate.  Finally,  through discussions which  involved  both House and Senate representatives, we  were able to arrive at a compromise omnibus  proposal dealing with all the areas addressed  in H.R. 1790. That compromise was embodied  in the amendment in the nature of a substitute  which was adopted on the floor of the House  after the bill was discarded from further com mittee consideration.  Because H.R. 1790 as a whole was never  the subject of a written committee report, I be lieve  it  is  important  that  the  record  reflect  some of the background and the policy con siderations which were reflected in the devel opment of the compromise and the final pas sage of H.R. 1790.  The provisions of H.R.  1790 as passed  which relate to areas in Nevada were based in  large part on the provisions of H.R. 4351 as  earlier passed by  the House of Representa tives. The background and rationale for those  provisions are  set out at  some  length  in  House Report No. 99-689, part I, presented to  the House on July 16, 1986, by Chairman  UDALL  In particular, I believe that the history  of the ""Bravo 20"" Area as set forth  in  that  report will be  important reading  for all  those  interested in the development of H.R. 1790 as  passed by the 99th Congress.  With regard to the Alaska areas dealt with  in H.R. 1790, House Report No. 99-920, part  I, presented to the House by Chairman UDALL  on September 24, 1986, provides  important  background information and an explanation of  the House's position with  regard  to  these  areas, a position largely reflected in H.R. 1790  as passed.  House Report No. 99-689, part  I, should  also be consulted with  regard  to  the provi sions of section 4 of H.R. 1790 as passed relating to the Desert National Wildlife Range  and  the  Cabeza  Prieta  National Wildlife  Refuge. Those provisions were closely mod elled on  the provisions of section 1 04(f) of  H.R. 4351 as passed by the House of Repre sentatives.  Section 6 of H.R. 1790 as passed ""Nevada  Report"" was based on section 105(c) of H.R.  October 18, 1986  4351  as passed by  the House. Again,  the  House reports on that bill should be consulted  with respect to the considerations lying behind  this most important section of the final bill.  The provisions of section 7 and section 8(e)  of H.R. 1790 as passed have no direct ante cedents  in either of the House-passed bills  nor in  the military withdrawal bill-S. 2412considered  by  the  Senate. However,  the  policy considerations which led to inclusion of  these provisions in H.R. 1790 as passed are  discussed  to  some extent  in  the minority  views of Senator METZENBAUM included in the  report on the Senate bill-Senate Report No.  99-514-dated October 1 , 1986. The provi sions of section 7 were the subject of a collo quy  between  Senators METZENBAUM  and  MCCLURE appearing on page 33728 of  the  RECORD (October 18, 1986).  The Senate committee's report should also  be  consulted with  respect  to  sections 1 0  (""water  rights""),  11  (""hunting,  fishing,  and  trapping""), and 12 (""mining and mineral leas ing"") of H.R. 1790. All the provisions of those  sections are generally based on correspond ing sections of S. 2412 as favorably reported  by the Senate Committee on Energy and Nat ural Resources, with the exception of section  12(h). That subsection is identical to section  2(b)(1) of H.R. 5151 as passed by the House  of Representatives on October 6, 1986, and is  discussed in House Report No. 99-946, pre sented  to  the House of Representatives by  Chairman UDALL on October 1, 1986.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  section 16 of H.R.  1790 as passed embodies the provisions of  H.R. 4645, dealing with an adjustment of the  boundary of  the Cuyahoga Valley National  Recreation Area  in Ohio. That bill was  the  subject of House Report No. 99-759, present ed to the House of Representatives by Chair man UDALL on July 30, 1986.  SALUTE TO ED DONLEY-AN  AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADER  HON. DON RIITER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, October 18, 1986  ",1986
1948,1234,23,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, Air Products &  Chemicals, Inc., one of the leading businesses  in the State of Pennsylvania and the Nation,  will soon be  losing  to  retirement  its distin guished chairman and chief executive officer,  Mr. Edward Donley.  Air Products, which  is  headquartered  in  Trexlertown, PA, has  risen  from $15 million  per year in sales in 1957 to nearly $2 billion  today, and achieved a Fortune 500  rank of  205  among  the Nation's  largest  industrial  companies. Ed Donley has overseen virtually  all of this growth, having become president of  the company in 1966, chief executive officer  in 1973, and chairman in 1978.  Ed Donley,  in addition  to guiding  the  for tunes of  this  innovative and  technologically  oriented company, has achieved a well-de served reputation as one of the national busi ness community's most effective and respect ed spokesmen. This is evidenced by Ed Don",1986
1949,1247,23,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to ex press my support for S. 2948, which would au thorize the President to promote, posthumous ly, Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka  to  the grade of  colonel. I had the great honor of knowing Elli son Onizuka-he was a kind and selfless man  who  loved the Air Force and  its Space Pro gram not as a job, but as the culmination of  his life's ambition.  In January 1978, when I was yet a newcom er to Congress,  I had gone to the  island of  Hawaii to inform Ellison's mother that he had  been selected as an astronaut candidate by  NASA. Her jubilant response to the news re flected the fact that this was the materializa tion of his greatest dream.  After 7 years of specialized training, Ellison  became a member of the Discovery mission.  On this flight, he was, among other things, re sponsible for primary payload activities. During  Discovery's 48 orbits around the Earth, Ellison  logged a total of 7 4 hours in space, landing at  Kennedy Space Center on January 27, 1985. I  was fortunate enough to be in attendance at  the launching of that exciting voyage, sharing  with his  family and many other well-wishers  that historic moment.  For the people of Hawaii and especially for  the children, Ellison became a hero. He was  the first Hawaiian astronaut in  the history of  the Space Program. Ellison was an inspiration  to all  those he met, generously donating his  time to speak of his experiences, often visiting  many of our local schools. The children were  in awe of this kind and humble man. His life  stands as a monument to all those who strive  to fulfill their dreams.  Ellison Onizuka was a  valiant American  whose promotion is well-deserved.  I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2948.  WRAP-UP OF AD HOC CONGRES SIONAL  COMMITTEE  FOR  ffiiSH  AFFAIRS WORK  FOR  1986  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, October 18, 1986  ",1986
1950,1247,23,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, I am honored to  be completing my ninth year as chairman of  the bipartisan Ad Hoc Congressional Commit tee for Irish Affairs. At the close of the 99th  Congress,  the membership of the committee  stands at 115, and  I wish  to publicly  thank  each member  for  their participation  in  the  work of the committee this past year.  1986 may be recorded as a watershed year  for the entire Irish question. We began 1986  fresh from the completion of the signing of the  Anglo-Irish Agreement between  the Govern ments of Great Britain and the Republic of Ire land.  I referred to the document at that time  as a ""fragile first step."" Congress saw fit to  adopt a concurrent resolution of support for  the agreement  late  in 1985 and  the accord  had the full support of the President as well.  As we approach the first anniversary of the  signing of  the agreement, one  cannot be  buoyed by the early stages of implementation.  There continues to be strong disagreement to  the agreement from all sides of the political  spectrum in Northern Ireland. In my mind the  greatest  flaw  in  the accord  is  its  failure  to  make any changes in the political status quo  in Northern  Ireland, which  to me seems a  basic prerequisite for any real prospects for a  lasting political solution in Northern Ireland.  The Ad Hoc Committee began 1986 with a  renewed effort to see movement on certain  bills and resolutions related  to Northern  Ire land. On the very first day of the session, I in troduced  two measures, House Concurrent  Resolution 6 and House Concurrent Resolu tion 7. The  first expressed the opposition of  Congress to the indiscriminate use of plastic  bullets by the British security forces in North ern  Ireland. The second measure called on  the President to designate a special envoy for  Northern Ireland.  It became obvious that as we approached  St. Patrick's Day in 1986 that there was clear  and evident  interest on  the part of various  sides on some type of post-Anglo-Irish agree ment  initiative. The most  logical approach  would be some degree of first-time, U.S. eco nomic aid.  I was proud  to have authored,  in  1983, the first legislation calling for such aid.  In the 99th Congress I had authored a new bill  providing $500 million over 5 years  in eco nomic aid subject to the British Government  declaring their intention to withdraw from the  north.  The vaunted St. Patrick's Day initiative was  unveiled on March 5 when the administration  proposed providing $250 million in aid over 5  years  to  Ireland and Northern  Ireland. That  very day I was proud to testify before the Sub committee on Europe and the Middle East to  urge that any U.S. aid proposal contain specif ic guarantees to ensure that the aid benefits  both communities. The administration propos al as originally submitted contained no such  conditions.  In my testimony I urged that there be spe cific  linkage between  the U.S. aid and  the  MacBride principles of fair employment and  nondiscrimination.  I aslo  recommended  that  the aid be provided in full compliance with the  human rights provisions in the Foreign Assist ance Act.  In what proved to be perhaps the most sig nificant action  taken by Congress on  the  Northern Ireland issue, the House Foreign Af fairs Committee under the leadership of Chair man DANTE FASCELL and with the critical as sistance of my colleague BEN GILMAN of New  York, basically rewrote the legislation.  The revised version, H.R. 4329, which I was  proud  to cosponsor, passed  the House on  March 11. The bill maintained the authoriza tion level of $250 million over 5 years but es tablished  the  following conditions:  It guaran teed that the aid would be purely economic.  The bill called on  the President  to make  every effort to ensure that there is U.S. repre. sentation on  the board of  the  International  Economic Support Fund which will distribute  the U.S. aid; it requires the President to certify  to Congress each year that U.S. aid is being  dispersed ""in accordance with the principle of  equality and nondiscrimination in employment  without regard to religious affiliation."" The bill  also  requires  the President  to provide an  annual report to Congress on the degree to  which  the United States aid  ""has  increased  respect for the human rights and fundamental  freedoms of all people in Ireland and Northern  Ireland.""  The importance of this action cannot be un derestimated. The absence of any conditions  associated with United States aid would have  put us in the position of indirectly subsidizing  continued economic discrimination in Northern  Ireland.  Ultimately in terms of the authorization bill,  the final version provided $120 million over 3  years but did maintain  the conditions  in  the  House bill. A separate measure providing $50  million in fiscal year 1986 supplemental appro priations was also adopted by Congress  in  1986.  While  I evaluate  the passage of the eco nomic aid bill with conditions as a positive de velopment, there were other developments in  1986 that were less than positive with respect  to Northern Ireland. Central among these had  to be the ratification of the supplementary ex tradition treaty between the United States and  the United Kingdom  of Great Britain  and  Northern Ireland.  This supplementary  treaty had been pro posed  in  the summer of 1985.  It was sup posed to be given quick consideration in the  other body. Yet there were sufficient enough  concerns to have 55 House Members join me  in a letter to Chairman Lugar of the Foreign  Relations Committee to urge that a full set of  hearings be held. This  request was  in  fact  granted and a total of four hearings were held  on the proposal. I testified at the hearings as  did several other members of the ad hoc com mittee,  including Representatives FISH, and  HUGHES. Following  the hearings,  I also au thored a resolution calling on the committee  to end their consideration of the treaty.  My objections to the treaty were based on  the fact that it was unprecedented and served  ",1986
