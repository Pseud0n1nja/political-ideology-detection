0,House,102,-0.349,15,1,Mr. NAGLE.," Well, I agree with the  majority leader. I was frankly gratified  to hear him say that if the President  presents to us a decent plan, then we,  of course, I  think will stand ready to  endorse, embrace, support and fight for  that plan; but I am afraid that the his tory of  the past  two administration  causes me to be somewhat discouraged  that the President's rescue plan is not  aimed at the people on that chart, but  is aimed at those executives who are  pulling down  salaries annually of $1  million or more and are flying around  the country with him.  I would like to think the President  will come forward, but I am somewhat  skeptical because so far these policies  have not tilted in that direction. They  have tilted toward the people who will  never be shown on an unemployment  chart, and that is our chief executives.  ",1992
1,House,102,-0.416,15,1,Mr. GEPHARDT.,  I understand  the  gentleman's skepticism.  I  think we  agree that trickle-down has been tried  and has been found wanting and that  now we need to figure out how to have  a bubble-up economy where people who  have been crushed have the ability to  get back into the economy and to per form as I believe they can.  ,1992
2,House,102,0.377,15,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I think  our colleagues and citizens may find it  interesting  to read  these  two special  orders back to back because they both  address the need for change. They both  address concerns about  the economy  and concerns about where America is  going.  I am going  to  talk about  the nec essary  revolution,  applying  common  sense to our problems. I want to talk in  a framework that I think is in contrast  to  the statements of  the Democratic  leader, but nonetheless fits  the same  sense of urgency and the same sense of  concern.  I  think America  is at a crossroads  and Americans know it. I  think  that  Americans know we are winning  the  cold war and  losing  the competitive  war. I think they know that we are de feating the Soviet empire, but that we  are  losing  the  domestic  struggle  against drugs, crime,  ignorance, and  welfare. They know we are losing the  world market to Germany, Japan, and  Korea. They know we are losing faith  in our constitutional system, that they  do not see it working. They do not see  their votes mattering. They do not see  their leaders being effective. They do  not see the structures their Founding  Fathers gave them producing results,  and so they are almost in agony.  They see Taiwan with an intelligent  enough system that they have $2 bil lion  to  invest  in McDonnell Douglas  when McDonnell Douglas cannot find  that $2 billion in America, and  they  know that is crazy, and that it means  for their children a desperate struggle  of a declining standard of living. They  turn on the evening news and it resem bles a death watch in virtually every  major city of this country and  they  know that is crazy. You look at there sults of schools and  they know  that  even the best of our American schools  score in the bottom third of Japanese  schools mathematically.  And  they  know  that their children cannot sur vive  in a world where  that remains  true. And yet they do not know what  to do. And so, in desperation, they turn  to  term limitation and a  substantial  percentage  turn to people  like David  Duke.  Because  they are so angry and so  frightened that they believe that an ex Nazi, ex-Klansman is less of a threat to  their future than the established politi cal system. Now that, to me, is a terri fying concept, and condemns the cur rent structure of politics  in America  about as vehemently as you can imag ine.  In that framework, the Sunday after  Thanksgiving  I was  on  ""Meet  the  Press,"" and at the end of it, I stepped  off the set and the three reporters were  chatting. The NBC Washington bureau  chief, Tim Russett said, ""You know,  GINGRICH may be the only true revolu tionary in Washington.""  I thought about it for a while and I  decided he is right at least about my  position. I think there are other folks  who are also revolutionaries.  I am a  revolutionary.  Taking the streets back from violent  crime and drugs, so local TV news is no  longer a death watch would be a revo lution in every major American city.  Replacing welfare with workfare and  ending  a  process  by which  teenage  mothers outside marriage and  igno rant,  irresponsible male children who  have sex but are not fathers would be a  revolution. Having schools that are dis ciplined,  require homework, and beat  the  Japanese  in math  and  science  would be a  revolution. Replacing  the  most  expensive  red-tape-ridden,  liti gious health care system in the world  with a revitalized, health-oriented pri vate system we can afford, and  that  would be available  to everyone would  be a  revolution. Having Government  bureaucracies that are lean, efficient,  ",1992
3,,102,0.351,28,1,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, President Bush  and President Carlos Salinas de Gotari of  Mexico met at Camp David last month to dis cuss  the North American Free-Trade Agree ment [NAFTA] talks. The result was a unani mous commitment  to vigorously pursue  free  trade and all of  its benefits  for all of North  America.  In essence, to paraphrase our U.S.  Trade  Representative,  Ambassador  Carla  Hills,  the two  leaders agreed  to  let the sub stance drive the timing of NAFT A, not the tim ing drive the substance.  As a  result, Congress may consider  the  passage of NAFTA this year. In the past year,  each of us has been inundated with informa tion  regarding  the potential  effects NAFT A  may have on workers and  the environment.  But I believe it is important to also understand  the vision President Salinas has  for Mexico,  and how NAFT A plays a key role in that na tion's  future. Therefore,  I believe  it  fitting  to  recommend to my colleagues the following ad dress given by President Salinas to the mem bership of the Economic Club of New York on  December 13, 1991.  MEXICO-UNITED STATES  (Address by Carlos Salinas de Gortari,  President of Mexico)  Members of  the Economic Club of New  York;  ladies  and  gentlemen:  I  am very  pleased to be here in the great city of New  York, and I  thank the Economic Club for  their invitation. I would like to share some  thoughts with you  this afternoon on my  country's economic development within the  context of a changing world.  The  international  scene  is  increasingly  surprising,  and  increasingly  uncertain  as  well. Only two years ago we were celebrating  the new adventure of freedom and democracy  in Central Europe and also in Latin America.  Today we are witnessing the resurgence of  regional conflicts and war, and the threat ened breakup of nations that just a short  time ago seemed rock-solid. The world eco nomic trend is  toward more  intense inter dependence,  leading more countries  to be come active members of the world economy  and creating growing hopes for a world more  open to trade and to the transfer of tech nology. But we are also seeing rising com petition  for  capital-increasingly  scarce,  given the demands of the onetime socialist  countries and those of Latin America-un certainty in the markets, risks of new forms  of protectionism, and obstacles to the suc cess of GATT agreements.  Mexico,  a  country neighboring on your  own, has been the cradle of magnificent civ ilizations and has a history forged by dint of  determination and love of freedom. It is also  a nation of more than 83 million inhabitants,  whose number grows by an additional 2 mil lion each year. To us,  the pursuit of eco nomic growth and increased opportunities is  not only good policy, but a vital, immediate  need. We recognize that this cannot be done  without making profound changes in our in ternal  life  and without  establishing new  links with other nations and particularly,  given the importance of our trade relations,  with the United States.  Within our borders, we Mexicans are tak ing a new approach in dealing with national  and  global  realities.  Sustained  by  three  thousand years of culture and by our coun try's laws, we  launched a  process of far reaching change in our economic structures  and a renovation of our political practices as  a  society. We have maintained a strategy  aimed at providing growth with stability,  creating new employment opportunities and  taking in-depth measures to combat poverty.  Today we see the results of our joint ef forts. We have gone from the major deficits  registered in the past to surpluses in public  finances, and from  triple-digit inflation to  the current  level of  less  than 20 percent,  which we intend to bring down to less than  10 percent in 1992. We have increased govern ment revenues and we have been carrying  out a privatization process marked by  its  transparency,  the formation of new  indus trial groups and a substantial influx of cash  funds for the government.  In comparison to the past decade, the real  value of our economy is greater and the pub lic debt is smaller: the latter now represents  35 percent of GDP, whereas in previous years  it had risen to twice that level. The reduc tion of our foreign and domestic debt has en abled us  to restructure the distribution of  public spending and channel almost half of  the outlays  into social areas such as  the  rural sector, education, health care, basic in frastructure and environmental protection.  We have recovered growth in the last three  years at rates of almost 4 percent, which is  almost double our population growth. We  have carried out a unilateral trade opening  of great consequence; in just a few years, our  economy has been transformed from one of  the most closed into one of the most open.  We have deregulated and promoted foreign  investment, which can now count on  legal  certainty and access  to more areas of our  economy. We have promoted  technological  innovation,  technology  transfers  and  ex ports.  We have also sought new linkages with the  world to give us access  to markets,  tech nology and capital. We are convinced that  only our own internal efforts can ensure the  country's development, but also that it is es sential for us to participate and broaden our  presence in the world so that those efforts do  not encounter obstacles  in  their path and  will therefore prosper. Hence, we have diver sified our relations with Europe, with  the  countries of the Pacific Rim and with Latin  America. With Chile, we signed the first free trade agreement between two Latin Amer ican  countries and we  are making  solid  progress toward the establishment of similar  agreements with  the countries of Central  America and with Colombia and Venezuela.  We have embarked on important negotia tions with the United States and Canada for  the signing of a Trilateral Free Trade Agree ment,  by means  of which our  countries  would make up the world's largest market  with 360 million potential consumers and a  combined production valued at more than 6  trillion dollars. It is important to clarify its  significance: in Mexico, we want trade, not  economic aid; we want to develop our econ omy by means of stronger and better trade  relations.  The  trilateral  agreement will  achieve  that  end by  benefiting all  three  countries.  Through the agreement we wish to estab lish clear rules that will provide certainty  for investment and job creation, expand spe cialized production  in  the  three countries,  take advantage of economies of scale  to  make companies more efficient and more  productive, ensure access, without barriers,  to the regional market and establish mecha nisms for settling disputes. The agreement  can attain these objectives.  Growth is a central topic in both our coun tries. For many years Mexico followed  the  path of protectionism and was inward-look ing, depending on the domestic market. The  crisis of the eighties showed that this model  was outworn. In order to grow it is necessary  to export and that demands competitiveness,  technology and access to markets. If a pro tectionist view is taken, this does not occur  and any drop in economic activity becomes a  collapse, and recession becomes depression.  For Mexico it took extraordinary efforts to  open up the economy but it would have been  far more serious  to  insist on carrying on  along the old path. We have lived in a pro tected economy and are living today in an  open economy. The results are conclusive.  The only option today is increased trade and  an orientation to exports in order to revive  the economy. It is  therefore surprising  to  hear protectionist voices raised when what is  wanted is to make economic activity more  dynamic. This is what the trilateral agree ment seeks. For Mexicans, it is an instru ment for making more rapid progress and  modernizing  the country. For  the United  States, it is a way to contribute to growth  based on exports and competitiveness.  I am convinced that these negotiations do  not merely  involve adding or subtracting  amounts and  figures. We are also  talking  about a vision for the future of this region at  the end of this century and the beginning of  the twenty-first. We must bring the Agree ment to a satisfactory conclusion because it  is the only means of facing the future, which  we are already witnessing today. Europe has  the resources, the technology and the mar ket needed to become a powerful agent of the  world economy at the end of 1992. Further more, as a result of the Autumn Revolution  of 1989 in Central Europe, the European Com munity now has the possibility of gaining ac cess to abundant skilled labor. Japan has not  only built up a powerful economy, but has  also  entered  into partnership with other  countries of the Asian Pacific, distributing  productive  processes  and  resources  and  thereby generating a great overall capacity  for exports. In addition, the countries of the  Asian Pacific have access, both as consumers  and producers, to a market made up of near ly three billion people in Asia.

4,,102,-0.385,41,1,Mr. KILDEE.,"  I am pleased to introduce the  Work Force Readiness Act which is designed  to provide all students in all schools with the  skills necessary to be effective participants in  the work force.  The United States has entered into a new  era of global economic competition, one  in  which we must compete  for market share  globally as well as  in our own country. Busi nesses increasingly have to contend with an  onslaught of competition from abroad, chang ing consumer demands, and the need to pro vide high quality goods quickly and efficiently.  It is no longer business as usual.  A key element in making sure America can  compete  is a qualified and productive work  force. The Work Force Readiness Act will help  ensure  that  students graduating  from  high  school have  the generic skills necessary  to  enter the work force ready to perform. These  skills are  tools which all students can use  whether they enter the work force immediately  upon graduation from high school or continue  on to some  form of higher education. These  skills also will provide  the  foundation upon  which more occupational specific skills can be  built.  The Work Force Readiness Act will create a  national board of employers and educators  which will work to identify generic skills nec essary to enter the work force and how these  skills can be  incorporated into what students  learn  in grades kindergarten through 12. The  skills the board identifies and the strategies for  integrating  them  into  the  regular school cur riculum would then be available on a voluntary  basis to schools wishing to use them. Building  on  the concept behind  the Secretary's Com mission on  the Achievement of Necessary  Skills  [SCANS] which  is scheduled  to  termi nate  in March,  the national board will be a  more permanent entity able to respond to the  changing needs of the work force over time.  Title II of the bill proposes grants to consor tia of education, business, and  labor for  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  actual implementation of school-to-work transi tion projects. Many of its provisions are mod eled after innovative programs operating in my  congressional district, where consortia of busi ness, education, and  labor are working  to gether to implement projects in schools which  will provide students with the skills necessary  to enter the work force. These projects seek to  provide workplace skills through a comprehen sive approach which  begins  in  elementary  school and continues through graduation from  high school by integrating workplace skills into  the regular school curriculum. Because of pro grams like this, students in my district are bet ter able to understand what it means to work  and what skills are necessary to work.  Hopefully, this bill can provide a focal point  around which serious discussions concerning  workplace skills will continue.  I welcome  the  comments of those concerned about building  the capacity of our students to enter the work  force ready to achieve and to be active partici pants in our economy.  TRIBUTE TO DR.  JAMES CHIPMAN  FLETCHER-TWICE ADMINISTRA TOR OF NASA  HON. DICK SWElT  OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 3, 1992  ",1992
5,,102,-0.144,41,1,Mr. SWETT.," Mr. Speaker, just before Christ mas, our Nation lost one of the great contribu tors  to our Nation's space program. As a  member of  the Science, Space, and Tech nology Committee, I feel keenly the great loss  of Dr. James Chipman Fletcher-scientist, ed ucator, businessman, administrator, and dedi cated public servant.  Dr. Fletcher served twice as Administrator of  the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis tration. He was the only man to head our Na tion's civilian space agency on  two separate  occasions. With a total of 9 years of service  during his two terms in office, he was NASA  Administrator  longer  than any other person,  guiding the space agency under five different  Presidents of the United States.  Mr.  Speaker,  to  do  this,  Jim  Fletcher  unhesitatingly placed service  to his country  above his own personal convenience and fi nancial rewards. His willingness to do so, and  his selfless dedication  to public service pro vides the rest of us with an example we would  do well to follow.  Dr. Fletcher was serving as president of the  University of Utah when he first accepted the  position of NASA Administrator in 1971. Prior  to  this, he had been a research physicist, a  teacher, and an official in several corporations,  one of which he founded. He was well under way  in  the pursuit of his  lifetime goal of  in creasing man's knowledge and understanding  of the universe in which we live.  When asked to leave the university to take  on the sensitive and highly visible position as  head  of our Nation's  space  agency,  Jim  Fletcher answered  the President's call. He  said at the time that he felt it was his duty as  a citizen to serve his country when asked to  do so. From  1971  to 1977, he directed a  space program which saw development of the  39  Apollo manned space  flights and great ad vances in man's exploration of outer space.  After leaving NASA in May 1977 to return to  his family and private life, Dr. Fletcher accept ed a teaching position with  the University of  Pittsburgh and operated a lucrative consulting  business. He was again fulfilling his personal  goals and  receiving substantial  financial  re wards.  In May 1986-4 months after  the space  shuttle  Challenger  exploded,  causing  the  death of all seven astronauts on board-then President Ronald Reagan asked Jim Fletcher  to return as NASA Administrator until the shut tle  program  and  public  confidence  in  the  space agency could be restored.  Reluctantly, but spurred on by duty and a  patriotic obligation  to serve our country, Dr.  Fletcher agreed to return. As he said at that  time, he  ""felt he had an obligation  to help  NASA and  the space program  in a time of  trouble."" From May 1986 until April 1989, he  supervised efforts to restore the manned flight  program as well as  revamp NASA manage ment and safety procedures.  He  submitted  his  final  resignation  from  NASA in a letter to President Bush on March  21, 1989, just 3 days after the third successful  post-Challenger space shuttle  flight. Charac teristically, he told the President that ""the time  has come when the leadership of NASA can  safely be placed in another's hands.""  We  live  in an era where many persons  adopt  the philosophy of me  first. We see  around us all  too many examples of individ uals who accept positions in our Government  for a short time when  the intention of estab lishing connections and contacts which  they  can use when they return to the private sector  to earn rich financial rewards.  Dr. James C. Fletcher twice demonstrated  that he is another kind of individua~ne who  is willing to place service to our country ahead  of personal convenience and financial reward.  Mr. Speaker,  I invite my colleagues to join  me in paying respect to this outstanding sci entist, teacher, NASA Administrator, and pub lic servant. Dr. Fletcher's example is one that  we-and all Americans-should seek to emu late.  SAL UTE TO JAMES ""JIM"" BELL  HON. JOSE E.

9,Senate,102,0.382,93,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr.  President,  both  sides of the aisle can and should work  together to develop a strategy to improve education  in  this country. We  have done it before, and I  think we  should do it again.  On  our  committee,  generally we  agree on education matters before they  come  to  the floor.  In  this particular  case, we have not agreed. I think edu cation should not become a political  issue, at least among ourselves.  My home State of Utah has done  some excellent  things  in the area of  education.  Through  the  years  they  have tried many experiments to try to  improve the education of children, de spite rather limited resources in our  State. Some of these experiments have  been very  successful and have been  adopted by other schools, while others  have not worked as well and have been  terminated.  In most  cases,  these  changes were ideas of individual teach ers working with the children assigned  to  them.  I believe  in  teachers and I  know that by working with them, we  can do what is best for our children.  Last spring, the Bush administration  proposed a bold new strategy  to up grade and reform schools in this coun try. Many of the  ideas presented by  President Bush and Secretary Alexan der are ideas that I strongly endorse. I  also can support many of the ideas out lined by the majority in this particular  bill, S. 2. But I am very sorry that,  after spending many hours  trying  to  work with both the administration and  the majority, we do not have a biparti san bill before us which  incorporates  the  ideas of both  the administration  and the majority.  It seems  that all  that effort went  down the drain and with it went our  hope for  the kind of bipartisan com promise that has been the hallmark of  education policy and the hallmark of  our committee through the years.  Mr. President, this is the son of S. 2.  The committee has reported this bill  out twice, once early last spring when  the bill was developed without input  from the administration or the Repub lican members of the Labor and Human  Resources Committee. The second time  this bill was reported out the Repub licans agreed to vote for the bill with a  commitment that there would be a se rious effort to meet the needs of the  administration  and  the  Republican  members of  the committee. Unfortu nately  the  second S. 2 has met  the  same  fate as  the  first S. 2,  because  there has been no willingness to incor porate any of the major ideas of the  President in the bill.  Let me read to you the concerns of  the minority regarding  the bill after  the initial markup.  We are ready and willing to be full partici pants in a process of developing constructive  legislation which will move toward the com mon goal of a better-educated America.  We all want the best possible education for  the children and adults of our nation. To  make the most effective use of the federal  resources devoted to this cause, it is impor tant that Congress work closely with  the  ",1992

13,Senate,102,-0.387,145,1,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, ac cording  to  the  latest available data  from the Centers for Disease Control,  as of December 31, 1991, 206,392 Ameri cans have been diagnosed with AIDS;  133,232 Americans have died from AIDS;  and 73,160 Americans are currently liv ing with AIDS. As  these figures dem onstrate, the number of AIDS cases is  escalating  dramatically.  It  took  8  years to reach 100,000 cases and just 26  months to double that number. Accord ing to CDC,  the 300,000 mark could be  reached in less than 2 years, perhaps  faster.  ACCESSING THE PRESIDENT  To be a sports star in America is to  have an awesome entree to the media,  the public, and public officials. Magic  Johnson, now a gracious but outspoken  advocate of Federal attention  to  the  AIDS  epidemic,  is wisely using  the  power of his celebrity position to focus  President Bush's  attention  on  the  AIDS crisis.  Magic Johnson  is  the  latest Presi dential appointment  to  the National  Commission on AIDS. He met with the  President last week and has been in vited back next month. Although what  Johnson is saying has been said many  times by many others, perhaps now the  President will  listen, and even more  importantly, act.  Johnson's hand-delivered  letter  to  President Bush echoed the sentiments  of many experts in Federal AIDS ef forts:  ""I don't  feel  you  have  been  there,"" he told the President.  Johnson asked the President to see  to it that his upcoming budget includes  far more spending on AIDS. Specifi cally, he asked $900 million for the Na tional  Institutes of Health  research  programs, $900 million  to fund  treat ment programs under the Ryan White  Act, and $500 million for Medicaid pay ments to people with AIDS.

14,Senate,102,0.495,145,1,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, an assort ment of statements have appeared in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD concerning  the effect of section 471 of the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Im provement Act of 1991 on the pending  lawsuit between Sears, Roebuck and  the VISA credit card organization. For  the most part these statements simply  confirm that the provision was not in tended  to affect  the antitrust  issues  raised in the lawsuit. This point was  discussed at length by the members of  the conference committee that adopted  the provision and was well understood.  However, other statements appearing  in the RECORD, including statements by  some Members who were not even on  the  conference  committee,  reflect  a  misunderstanding of the  intended ef fect of this provision. I want to take  this  opportunity  to  set  the  record  straight, once and for all.  Section 471 of the Federal Deposit In surance Corporation Improvement Act  of 1991 is a simple and straightforward  provision. What it says, without plac ing any gloss whatsoever on its own  words, is that if someone was obligated  to provide services to a  thrift institu tion at the time that it was taken over  by  the Resolution Trust Corporation  [RTC] and  the RTC  then  transferred  the right to receive those services to  someone else after August 9, 1989, then  the service provider is obligated to pro vide those services to the RTC's transferee. There is one exemption: Where  the  transferee fails  to comply with a  material term or condition of the origi nal obligation.  I will not reiterate here the impor tance of this provision for ensuring the  ability of  the RTC  to maximize  the  amount that it can recover from  the  assets of failed thrifts and, thus, to re duce  the ultimate cost of the savings  and  loan crisis  to  the American tax payer. I addressed this in remarks that  appeared in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on December 18. However, I do want to  return to the other point that I made  on the same occasion: The members of  the conference committee who voted  without dissent-and only one absten tion-to include this provision in our  conference report were fully cognizant  that  this provision would apply  to a  dispute  then pending between Sears,  Roebuck and the VISA credit card or ganization,  and  that  this  provision  would have  the effect of permitting  Sears to launch its VISA card program  now.  Some Members  of Congress  have  since  inserted  statements  in  the  RECORD  regarding  the application of  the provision to that dispute. For ex ample, it has been asserted that the re quirements of  the  provision  do not  apply if a service provider is asked to  increase or expand or ""otherwise mod ify"" its services in any way. The lan guage of the statute is clear: The scope  of the service provider's obligation is  defined by what services it was obli gated  to provide  to  the failed  thrift,  not by what services, or what volume  of services, it was actually providing to  the thrift at any point in time. Any  suggestion to the contrary simply con tradicts the terms of the statute, and  finds no support whatsoever in the dis cussions of the conference committee.  A  few  statements have been made  that there was no intention on the con ferees' part to affect the litigation be tween Sears and VISA. Most of those  statements merely confirm  that  the  antitrust  issues were  the  subject of  that litigation are unaffected by this  legislation. With this I agree entirely;  in fact, I made this point myself in a  written colloquy with Senator METZEN BAUM. Whether Sears has valid claims  against VISA, or VISA against Sears,  under  the antitrust  laws  is not ad dressed by this legislation and should  be decided by the courts.  One or two statements appear to go  further, however, and to suggest that  the conferees did not intend this legis lation to provide Sears with the basis  to launch its VISA card program before  those antitrust  issues were  decided.  One 'statement, made by a Member who  was not on the conference committee,  states  that  section  471 was adopted  ""based on assurances made by its spon sor""-a clear reference to me-to this  effect. These assertions are incorrect.  At  the  time when  the  conference  committee was meeting, there was no  ",1992
15,House,102,-0.379,158,1,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  follow  my colleague who has spoken of his  friend, Frank Harrington, whose death  was a loss, I am sure, to the country.  Mr. Speaker, in the past few months,  the National Commission on Children  issued  their report on  children, and stated:  the status of  Today, too many young people seem adrift  without a steady moral compass to (guide]  their daily behavior or to plot a  thoughtful  and responsible course for their lives.  I think many of us would say amen  to that.  The  statistics  supporting  these  claims are everywhere, not just in the  Washington metropolitan area, where  they are rampant, but throughout the  country. The Federal Bureau of Inves tigation estimates that murder,  rape,  and aggravated assault increased by 10  percent last year. Much of the crime is  drug related, and a significant propor tion of it is committed by youthful of fenders  in  their  teens  and  early  twenties. No matter where you go, peo ple are always asking ""What has hap pened  to  the  younger  generation?""  ""Why do  they seem so removed from  their sense of community?"" ""Why do  they think only of their own welfare?""  ""And why are they so irresponsible?""  Perhaps  these  are  questions  we  should have asked of Kenneth Michael  Hedrick. Perhaps Kenneth could have  told us on what he based his commit ment  to  the community in which he  volunteered as a firefighter. Maybe he  could have explained to us what drove  him to look beyond his own welfare to  the welfare of strangers when he ran  into a  burning building  from which  most people were running out. And fi nally, only he could have told us why  his responsibilities  to his community  and his job were so important to him.  Grievously, Kenneth is not here  to  answer our questions. He  lost his life  on January 12 of this year fighting a  residential  fire  in Suitland, MD. As  someone who went  to Suitland High  School, that community is very close  to me. He lost his life at the age of 18.  Unlike  too many of  the  stories  re ported about youthful deaths, Kenneth  did not die over drug money, hip sneak ers, or a careless glance. He died trying  to put out a fire of a family starting a  new life in a new home. He died after  helping  to carry out of  the burning  building a small, 7-year-old boy.  As fire officials have pieced the story  together of the circumstances of the  fire and Kenneth's death, it appears he  had  accompanied  another  firefighter  from  the Morningside Volunteer Fire  Department who was carrying the body  of 7-year-old Shawn Sanchez from the  burning home. They thought him to be  then unconscious; subsequently that 7year-old boy died. However, moments  after helping the other firefighter bring  the boy out, he reentered the house and  was killed when his oxygen mask was  struck and knocked from his face, ex posing him to the fire's deadly gases.  Kenneth's actions embodied the high est principles and values held by civ ilized societies and religions of all na tions and all peoples. Self-sacrifice is  the greatest gift any Human being can  give to another. But it is a gift that is  given by more than one brave individ ual. For When Kenneth gave his life for  others, his family, friends, and fellow  firefighters lost someone very precious  to them all. The community of Prince  George County and the State of Mary land are lesser for having lost Kenneth.  While Kenneth is truly a singular in dividual  whose  actions  cannot  be  overpraised, his death  in  the  line of  duty, unfortunately, was not a singular  occurrence. In Prince George's County,  where Kenneth served, 30  firefighters  have died in the line of duty during the  last  century. Twenty-eight of  those  firefighters were  volunteers. Nation ally, in the last decade, it is estimated  that 12,000 firefighters have died in the  line of duty, a duty to serve their com munities, make for safer communities,  fight fire, and save lives.  As a nation of diverse ethnicity, liv ing standards, and opinions, we must  not forget the lesson that Kenneth and  his family have taught us, and that is  so much a part of the spirit of the fire  services. That lesson  teaches us  that  commitment to our community, care  for  the welfare and dignity of others,  and  responsibility  to  uphold  these  ideals is alive right here in America.  But if we are to keep it alive, and if we  are to overcome  the increasing greed  and selfishness of others, we must all  live by the standards and values that  Kenneth and his family so represent.  Kenneth's dad is the chief of the vol unteer fire department in Morningside.  It was his dad's example that Kenneth  was following.  As a community, Mr. Speaker, we in  Prince George County, the Washington  metropolitan area, and  the State of  Maryland grieve for the loss of one of  the best of us. The loss of a hero is al ways  tragic, and  the loss of a young  man 18 years of age, dedicated to his  family, dedicated to his friends, dedi cated to his community, and dedicated  to his duty is always more than we can  afford.  Mr. Speaker,  I  know  that all  the  Members of this House join me in ex tending our sympathies  to both  the  Hedrick and the Sanchezes, the family  that was burned out,  the family that  lost that 7-year-old child. On behalf of  all of us,  I extend our deepest sym pathies and our earnest prayers as we  share their grief and share their loss.

17,Senate,102,-0.303,171,1,Mr. DASCHLE.,  I  thank  the distin guished Senator from Pennsylvania for  an excellent and very insightful state ment and again welcome him to the de bate and appreciate his most signifi cant  contribution  to  the  discussion  this morning.  The PRESIDENT pro  tempore. The  Senator has 31 minutes remaining.  ,1992
18,Senate,102,-0.293,210,1,Mr. HOLLINGS.," These  letters say,  ""look, do not go along with this so called New America  School  plan.""  Time and again,  these various letters  are dramatic in their opposition. They  have heard about this scheme.  Worst of all, this amendment allows  public money to be siphoned off to pri vate schools. We are going to rob the  poor again. What is it, Robin Hood in  reverse? We are going to rob the poor  to provide for the rich, who are looked  upon as successes, and say: Look, we  have broken the mold.  Nonsense. We  already have  innova tion. There is a booklet, Mr. President,  in New York.  It has 134  choices  for  schools. Go down there in Brooklyn. It  looked like a war zone, but the kids  were there, they were alert, they were  surprising. And what they need is not a  new American  school,  or break  the  mold, what they need is financial sup port.  ",1992
19,Senate,102,0.2,223,1,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  have been involved, as a number of oth ers have, in negotiations here seeing if  there could be some agreement worked  out. But until that is the case, I would  just like to express my strong support  for  the Cochran  amendment which  calls  for  the  establishment  of new  American schools.  There has been some interesting de bate regarding this amendment, but I  think that we must not lose sight of  what this does.  It is important to emphasize that it  entails far more than filling out an ap plication for Federal funds,  that the  America  2000  education  initiative  makes a  strong commitment at  the  community  level  to undertake  inten sive review of what is needed to assure  educational  excellence  and  improve ment.  In order to apply, a community must  adopt the national education goals; es tablish and implement a community wide strategy for achieving the goals;  develop a means for measuring and re porting progress  toward achievement  of the goals; and demonstrate a com mitment to make substantial improve ments in the education of children in  the community.  I do not think anyone would disagree  with those goals.  Obviously,  the notion that up to $1  million may be available  to  improve  one's school is a powerful incentive for  examination and innovation. It is per haps not surprising then that so many  have decided  to  reach  for  the brass  ring. This is obviously a great incen tive to many to look at break-the-mold  schools.  Across the Nation, hundreds of com munities have begun  the process by  committing themselves to being Amer ica  2000  communities.  Likewise,  31  States have  embraced  the  goals  of  America 2000.  Opponents of this amendment have  made  the  argument  that  only  535  schools at most will benefit from this  program. In fact,  I believe the effect  will be far greater, far greater. And we  debated this yesterday because it is ac tually on and above the schools that  would benefit from  the neighborhood  improvement program. But far more  communities and schools will be en gaged in a process of self-examination  and will be actively seeking innovative  ways to improve their schools. Whether  or not  they receive a Federal grant,  many  will  undoubtedly  implement  these ideas on their own, and that is  the part of the creativity and the vital ity of this process that I think is im portant and that President Bush envi sioned when he announced this effort.  Moreover, schools which do  receive  New American Schools grants will offer  ideas and examples  to others which  wish to improve their programs.  Basically, the Cochran amendment is  calling upon communi ties across  the  Nation to undertake a concerted exam ination of what they want from their  schools. In a country as diverse as our  own,  a  variety  of  innovative  and  thoughtful  responses  are  sure  to  emerge. We should give them a chance  by adopting this amendment.  I  think that we should give them a  chance by adopting  this amendment  and see  that  there are  initiatives on  both sides of the aisle to work together  to achieve agreement that will move  this forward.  I yield the floor, Mr. President.  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.  ",1992
20,Senate,102,-0.443,223,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  for  the  benefit  of Members-they  have  been extremely tolerant and patient in  terms  of  the  scheduling  and  the  progress on this legislation during the  afternoon and into the early evening we had indicated on the floor yesterday  and during  the course of the debate  that we would have a certain percent age of resources of this bill that would  be utilized in terms of the authoriza tion for the administrative aspects of  the legislation, given the fact that the  requests are going to come in terms of  the proposal that came out of our com mittee and that there would be some 10  percent that would be reserved for ad ministrative costs. Then we had an ad ditional kind of a 10 percent in terms of  teacher training, other statewide kinds  of activities where  the State  edu cational  agency  and  the Governor  could make a request for a waiver for  purposes outlined  in  the  legislation  that would benefit a wide variety of  different kinds of schools. We were in  agreement on that. And that also in cluded the New American Schools.  It is very clear from the amendment  of Senator COCHRAN that there is a de sire  to have a more expanded effort  with that undertaking. We have been  in the process of negotiations and ex changes during the course of the after noon. We have attempted to keep inter ested Members  informed about  that  matter.  I am going  to speak, after I make  these very brief remarks, about my  own concerns about that approach. But  I do not want  to undermine what  I  think has been a very constructive and  positive and good faith effort by Sen ator  COCHRAN,  Senator KASSEBAUM,  Senator HATCH, and others to see if we  could not find some common ground. I  think  important  progress  has  been  made.  What I would like to do, in the fairly  near future, after consulting with the  majority leader, which I have done in formally, is to try to get his input to  see if we could not continue those ne gotiations. If we are unable to do that,  to vote at a  time certain, with very  brief, continued debate on the amend ment of the Senator from Mississippi,  with the commitment that we will con tinue to try during the latter part of  this afternoon and early evening and  through the evening to see if we cannot  work that out in a way that is going to  accommodate the different interests.  If we are unable  to do  so,  then  I  would urge the leader to set a time to morrow, after brief debate, and fix a  time that we would vote on the amend ment of the Senator. It would be my  hope that we would vote up or down. It  would also be my hope, after talking to  the Senator from Utah,  that  in  the  early morning we could start off the  debate on  the choice  issue, which  is  something the Members feel is of enor mous importance and there is very con",1992
21,,102,-0.404,288,1,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  salute  the many  achievements of a good  friend and an outstanding American, Mack  Powell. Mack was president of  the 124,000  member California Association  of Realtors  [CAR)  in 1991, and was the first president to  come from the Sacramento association since  the 1940's.  Under Mack's  leadership,  the  realtors  fo cused on encouraging the membership to get  back  to  the basics of marketing and selling  homes. In a year which could have been divi sive for the industry, Mack kept the CAR pro ductive by  incorporating  the  concerns and  needs of its members into effective policy ac tions.  Mack's dedication to his staff, his colleagues  and the entire real estate industry made him  an outstanding president. His sensitivity  to  human need and his  fine sense of humor  makes him truly beloved. Indicative of Mack's  wit was a comment he made  last year  for  which he became well known. He said, ""We  are not in a recession. We may be having the  smallest boom we ever had, but we are not in  the midst of a recession.""  Mack never stopped  talking about afford ability. He continually stressed  to  the media  and  the membership that  it was  time  to get  back  to selling people homes as a principle  means of shelter and not necessarily the prin ciple means of wealth. He worked with low in come housing advocates as well as the build ing  industry  to  look  for areas of common  ground to help promote affordable housing. In  an effort to help the membership cope with the  changing real estate market, Mack developed  and held six educational ""Spring Conferences""  around California. Although he has  left his  post, Mack  left the California Association of  Realtors strong and dynamic and in a position  to effectively address the many issues facing  the real estate industry.  January 22, 1992  Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to speak on  behalf of Mack Powell. I know the Sacramento  community and  the  real estate  industry will  continue to look to Mack for the same kind of  inspiration  and  leadership  he  has  always  shown. I ask my colleagues to join me in con gratulating Mack and  in wishing him many  years of continued success.  JIM TOWEY: MIAMI'S NEW HRS  CHIEF  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 22, 1992  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased to recognize Jim Towey, who recently  was featured in the Miami Herald, after he be came the new chief of the Florida Department  of Health and Rehabilitative Services [HRS] in  Dade and Monroe counties. The article ""New  HRS Chief Here To Serve Poor,"" by Adres  Viglucci tells how his varied background as a  congressional aide and worker for Mother T e resa in a Mexican village have helped prepare  him for his new position:  The plainest clue that Jim Towey is not  your typical bureaucrat sits on his desk in  the governor's office  in Tallahassee: a pic ture of him and Mother Teresa.  The portrait was one of the first things to  come out of  the moving boxes Thursday,  when he took over his new office at the state  Department of Health  and Rehabilitative  Services district headquarters in Miami.  Towey,  the  governor's  unconventional  choice as new HRS chief for Dade and Mon roe counties, steps into one of the most im portant-and thorniest-jobs in local govern ment with a reformist's zeal and a mission ary's devotion.  Towey-pronounced Too-ee-shuns bureau cratic euphemisms about ""clients."" His lan guage, tinged with deep religious conviction,  is blunt.  ""We're here to serve the poor,"" he said.  Towey set the tone on his first day, speak ing  to his  top deputies during a morning  meeting about their obligations to taxpayers  and  the people HRS serves. Later, Towey  mixed easily with  the  residents of HRS'  Landmark Learning Center, an  institution  for severely retarded people in North Dade.  Gov. Lawton Chiles named Towey to the  job last month, after HRS district adminis trator John Farie resigned amid criticism of  his work.  Towey's path to HRS followed an unusual  route: from law school at Florida State and  a seven-year stint as a congressional aide to  a detour in Calcutta, India, where a fateful  meeting with Mother Teresa,  the Nobel  Prize-winning Catholic missionary,  trans formed his life.  Burned out on politics, he got rid of every thing he owned, and went to work for Mother  Teresa in a Mexican village with no running  water or electricity.  The experience, he  says, only partly  in  jest, should prepare him well for public serv ice with HRS.  Three years later, at 35, he's taking over a  huge, troubled bureaucracy with a $1 billion  budget and nearly 5,000 employees, despite  little experience in social work administra tion.  Unfazed, Towey  quotes Mother Teresa:  ""God doesn't call me  to be successful. He  calls me to be faithful.""  -~    )_   ,_,  -  P""    '  r --~ . :.  _._  .  --.. .  .    .  ,  J  ...   ",1992
22,,102,0.377,301,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, Mr. Lyle Har ris and Robert Vickers wrote these articles for  the Atlanta Journal/Constitution last December  29.  I urge all of my colleagues to read them  and gain a better understanding why a grow ing number of black Americans who  identify  themselves with conservative values and the  Republican Party.  This was refreshing and enlightening series,  and  I recommend  it to all  those who  follow  American political trends.  Attached are  ""Black Conservatives Wage  Less Lonely Fight,"" ""Black Campuses Are a  Training  Ground  for  Conservatives,""  and  ""Could 11th be Proving Ground?""  from  the  December 29, 1991 Atlanta Journal/Constitu tion:  BLACK CONSERVATIVES WAGE LESS LONELY  FIGHT  (By Lyle V. Harris and Robert J. Vickers)  Since the 1960s, black conservatives have  topped a list of endangered political species.  But earlier this month an invitation-only  who's who of black conservatives packed an  upscale Georgetown house  in honor of the  new Supreme Court justice, Clarence Thom as. Around  him  and  the  tight  network  swarmed  civil  rights  leaders,  GOP  heavyweights and Hollywood's elite.  For some, the party was more than a social  affair, it was the start of a crusade. ""We are  saving souls,"" said Armstrong Williams, 32, a  friend of Justice Thomas's who hosted the  party.  The year 1991 was a watershed for black  conservatives, from Gen. Colin Powell, who  oversaw Operation Desert Storm, to Justice  Thomas's appointment. Even Anita Hill,  whose testimony threatened Justice Thom as's Senate  confirmation, was  a Ronald  Reagan Republican.  Like no time before, the year provided an  unprecedented showcase for a cadre of blacks  who  dominated  the national  stage while  turning political stereotypes upside down.  Though still dismissed as Uncle Toms by  many blacks and political oddities by many  whites, African-Americans declaring  them selves conservative, Republican or both are  no longer a laughing matter.  At the grand old age of 22, Kevin Pritchett  is riding high on the lecture circuit, largely  because of his politics and his race. ""I just  want  show people  that black conserv atives, or whatever you want to call them,  to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  are not strange, are not aliens,"" said Mr.  Pritchett, a  rookie  reporter  for The Wall  Street Journal.  He  recently graduated  from Dartmouth  College, where black peers essentially ac cused him of being a yuppie in blackface and  branded him ""incog-Negro.""  NOT YET A MASS MOVEMENT  It would be premature  to describe  the  growth  of  political  conservatism  among  blacks as a mass movement. In the 1988 pres idential election, 10 percent of black voters  were registered Republicans, a figure not ex pected to change much in 1992. And of the 162  members of the Republican National Com mittee, two are black. No blacks sit in the  U.S. Senate; Rep. Gary Franks of Connecti cut is the only black Republican in Congress.  But consider this:  Once unheard of and unwelcome, Repub lican  student groups  are  cropping up at  black colleges nationwide.  The number of African-Americans voting  for Republicans in congressional campaigns  has risen from 8 percent in 1984 to 22 percent  in 1990. Younger blacks lead the trend.  Tony Brown, perhaps  the nation's best known syndicated black TV broadcaster, re cently cast off his strong ties to the Demo cratic Party and switched to the GOP. He  urges his viewers to re-evaluate  their own  voting habits.  As the nation's economy worsens, affirma tive action and welfare reform have become  issues in the presidential campaigns of main stream candidates-not to mention that of  ex-Klansman David Duke. Black politicians  are among those entering the debate.  ""I'm not praising David Duke, and I'm not  a Republican or a conservative. I'm a realist,  and what I'm saying is that if black leaders  are afraid to talk about these things, David  Duke wins,"" said Julius Sloss, a black coun cilman in Nashville.  ECONOMISTS OFTEN IN VANGUARD  Black conservative thought springs from a  seedbed tended by a long-and often lonely line of thinkers, many professors with eco nomic backgrounds.  Among the vanguard: Robert Woodson, di rector of  the Washington, D.C.-based Na tional Center for Neighborhood Enterprise;  Shelby Steele, a San Jose State University  professor; Thomas Sowell, a Stanford Uni versity  economist; Walter Williams,  a  George Mason University  economist;  and  Glen Loury, a political economist at Boston  University.  Many are bitterly critical of Democrats  and civil rights groups that have shaped the  debate over race and politics.  ""The old order is dead,"" said Mr. Woodson.  ""Just standing up and decrying what white  folks are doing and demanding expansion of  the welfare state is going to be laughed off  the political agenda.""  Although Mr. Woodson bridles at the con servative label, his indictment is especially  stinging: He  is past president of an Urban  League chapter in Pennsylvania.  To  traditional civil rights  leaders, black  conservatives  threaten  the solidarity  that  has made black voters a potent force.  ""If they don't like  the NAACP and  the  Urban League, why don't they start the Na tional Association of Black Conservatives?""  asked Benjamin Hooks, executive director of  the NAACP. ""If they can do  that, fine, I'll  join. But they need to stop taking potshots  while we are out here getting muddy in the  struggle.""  BOOKER WASHINGTON VS. DUBOIS  If black conservatives emphasize economic  independence  over  direct political  power,  299  then 1991 served as the revival of a debate  that has waxed and waned since Booker T.  Washington urged newly freed slaves to ""pull  yourselves up by your bootstraps,"" while  W.E.B. DuBois advocated government leader ship toward a desegregated society.  Particularly  in  the South, blacks were  first loyal to the party of Lincoln-a matter  of philosophy, but also because  they were  banned from the Democratic Party. But the  Depression and  the end of white-only pri maries began a shift toward Democrats that  was cemented by the Kennedy and Johnson  administrations with civil rights legislation.  The current debate is steeped in that his tory, and black Republicans admit they are  likely to remain a minority for a long time.  ""I don't think anything short of an act of  God is going to overcome the bad taste most  black people  have  about  the Republican  Party,"" admitted Mr. Brown, who now calls  himself a moderate Republican. His public  affairs program,  ""Tony Brown's Journal,""  reaches an estimated 5 million viewers.  Nonetheless, while organizations such as  the NAACP and the National Urban League  focus on the role of government in the treat ment of minorities, black conservatives con tend  that most barriers of discrimination  have fallen.  They offer as proof Justice Thomas and  General  Powell-both  of  humble  back grounds. (As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, General Powell has avoided declaring  his party affiliation.)  They denounce  some affirmative action  programs, saying they reinforce a myth of  black inferiority.  Leaders in black America's political estab lishment dismiss that theory as coming from  those who have benefited from plenty of help  themselves.  ""How can somebody say he is pulling him self by his own bootstraps while somebody  else is tying his shoes?"" asked Virginia Gov.  L. Douglas Wilder,  the nation's first black  governor and a 1992 Democratic presidential  candidate. ""That's not a conservative view.  It's a cynical view.""  But even Mr. Wilder is trying to break the  stereotype linking black politicians and so cial progams. He is running as a fiscal con servative who has cut $2.2 billion from his  state's budget.  While ideology is one reason for the rise of  black conservatives, pragmatism is another.  Save for four years of Jimmy Carter, the last  generation of power in Washington has been  purely Republican.  GOP THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN  If the Nixon administration provided a toe hold,  then Mr. Reagan and President Bush  greased the track for a select corps of ambi tious blacks.  ""Anita Hill  is  a  perfect  example  of a  young, upwardly mobile law school graduate  who wanted to work in government, and de cided to take a  lot of bull to get what she  wanted,""  said Ronald Walters of Howard  University.  Her former boss followed the same track although when he was nominated to the high  court, Clarence Thomas sat atop an informal  network of high-ranking black federal bu reaucrats, serving as mentor and counselor  despite his young age, 43.

24,,102,-0.552,314,1,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  wish to bring to the attention of the House the  accomplishments of a distinguished Califor nian, Edward Grogan.  Judge Grogan, born  in 1925 in San Fran cisco, graduated from the University of Califor nia in 1947 and from Hastings School of Law  in 1950. He then worked  in private practice,  specializing  in medical malpractice,  labor,  workers' compensation, and domestic relations  law as a partner in the law firms of Edises &  Treuhaft and Howell & Elson.  After being appointed a workers' compensa tion judge for the State of California in 1978,  Judge Grogan became a staff judge for the  worker's compensation appeals board in 1981.  From 1982 to 1985 he assumed the position  of assistant chief of workers' compensation  judges for the State of California, after which  he  returned  to the position of workers' com pensation judge in Oakland, CA until his retire ment in 1991. Judge Grogan completed many  difficult and complex judicial assignments with in the workers' compensation appeals system,  for which he received the high honor of being  named  ""Judge of  the Year"" by  the bar  in  1988.  His family  includes his wife, Ruth, and two  children, Tracy and Gail. Having many diverse  interests, his hobbies  range  from cultivating  roses to archeology and travel, and he is an  active contributor to the United Negro College  Fund, Appalachian causes, and American  In dian organizations. He was  the president of  the El Cerrito Democratic Club, and is a mem ber of the California State Bar Association, the  Conference of California Workers' Compensa tion Judges, the National Lawyers Guild, Am nesty International, Sierra Club, Audubon So ciety, and the Defenders of Wildlife.

25,Senate,102,-0.395,327,1,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  I  com mend the President pro tempore on his  speech given earlier this week, which I  thought was extraordinarily perceptive  on much of what this economy needs  and does not need.  And  the  speech was  a  courageous  speech that I  thought hit  the  target  relative to whether we should be focus ing on a middle-income tax cut to get  out of our economic doldrums.  We should not be focusing on a  tax  cut the size  they are proposing as a  way of getting out of our economic dol drums because they will not do it. The  public knows it, and I believe that the  President pro  tempore's remarks  in  this regard were highly perceptive and  were welcome as just a breath of fresh  air across  this  land.  I commend  the  President pro tempore for that.   As  I close  I want  to also  just say  hello  to our good  friend,  the Repub lican leader. He looks in absolutely top  health and we are delighted to see him  back in such great health.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDENT pro  tempore. The  Republican leader, ",1992

28,Senate,102,-0.328,327,1,Mr. DODD.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to  a man  re spected  and  loved  throughout Con necticut for his enduring commitment  to his community and his truly noble  character. James Grote's life ended 100  years after it began in Chester, CT, on  January 11, 1992. A good friend to me  and to my family, Jim was the son of  Italian immigrants and the progenitor  of 50 American offspring. At the time  of his death, .Jim had achieved unparal leled stature in his community. His life  was uniquely an American tale, sound ing in patriotism and activism, colored  by devotion and  joy,  rich  in crusty  anecdotes that only a centinarian, who  loved life the way Jim did, could har vest. He died celebrated for these en during qualities and for the countless  ways he touched all of our lives.  Jim was the kind of man we all wish  lived in our hometown. Though he wit nessed a century of American history,  saw two world wars, Korea, Vietnam,  the Great Depression, Jim never lost  his enthusiasm  for  the promise  this  country held.  Indeed, he believed so  much in this promise that a dawn did  not break in Chester without Jim, sil houette against  the eastern sky,  si lently  raising  the Stars and Stripes  near his home. Jim learned early the  responsibility of living and toiling in  an evolving society where a committed  citizen could influence change for the  good. He was known to have said of his  fellows, ""Their lives are my business,""  and thus plainly spoke what became,  from his childhood, the guiding philos ophy of his life.  The lore in Chester, CT. of which Jim  is  frequently  a  central  figure,  at tributes Jim's life-long dedication  to  fire prevention to an incident that oc curred at  the  turn of  the  century.  Transfixed by the sight of a raging fire,  young Jim led a bucket brigade assault  on  the  inferno  until  it was  extin guished. From that moment on, Jim  understood his life's work: to introduce  a fire department to the town of Ches ter. Since its inception in 1912, found ing father Jim Grote was at the helm  of  the Chester Fire Department  as  chief for 46 years and marshali for 69.  He held a leadership position in every  fire  association  in Connecticut  to  which he belonged and rarely missed a  meeting. To  the very end of his life,  Jim stayed on  top of his profession,  making a habit of brushing up on the  latest information relating to fire pre vention by enrolling in courses periodi cally. Ever the pioneer, Jim was quick  to recall his prophetic storming of the  State capital 50 years ago, pleading the  wisdom of  installing water sprinkler  systems  in  public  buildings  and  schools.  ",1992
29,Senate,102,-0.231,340,1,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President,  I am  strongly supportive of the amendment  offered by  the Senator from Oregon.  My concern is that it is too timid, as  currently drafted. The current proposal  would provide for waivers, but would  limit those waivers to 100 school dis tricts  in America. There  are  16,000  school districts in America which vary  geographically, demographically,  eco nomically, in their composition of stu dents.  In  the specific programs  that  they are currently providing they are  in the best tradition of American edu cation which  is decentralized,  locally  based.  We are saying we are prepared to give  100 out of 16,000, under very limited cir cumstances,  the opportunity to apply  for waivers  of Federal  requirements  under  specified Federal  formula-allo cated education programs.  I believe that timidity is inappropri ate  in  the context of  the  reality of  American education in 1992. There are  three aspects of  that  reality. First,  that a certain arrogance towards State  and  local educational  leadership and  administrative capability which in the  past has emanated from Washington is  no  longer appropriate. And  in  large  part, Washington can  take credit for  that. Over a number of years the Fed eral Government has had as one of its  goals  to enhance  the competence of  State and  local educational agencies.  Millions of dollars have been poured  into programs that had that as its ob jective.  Today, Mr. President, I think we can  declare victory. We have substantially  enhanced the human quality as well as  the administrative structure of most  State  and  local  school  agencies  in  America. We have every right,  there fore,  to  take both pride  in what has  been accomplished in this national ef fort at improvement, and to take the  ",1992

33,Senate,102,0.391,379,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr.  President,  I  rise today in support of the amendment  offered by  the distinguished Senator  from Utah, Senator HATCH.  As has previously been mentioned,  this amendment would authorize $30  million  to  create  up  to  six  school  choice demonstration projects nation wide.  It would enable moderateand  low-income  parents  to  select  the  schools-public or private-to which  they wish to send their children. Under  the  amendment,  grants  would  be  awarded to pay the costs of providing  education certificates  to  low-income  parents to pay the tuition and fees for  the school that is chosen by the par ents. In addition,  the certificate may  also  cover  the  reasonable  costs  of  transportation.  Mr. President, according  to  recent  polls, a majority of Americans support  the concept of choice in schools. A May  1991 Gallup poll found that 51 percent  of Americans 18 years and older sup port a  ""program which would allow  parents to send their children to the  public, parochial, or private school of  their choice and use State and local  tax dollars to pay for all or part of it.""  This represented an increase of 7 per cent from a similar poll conducted in  1987. The Wall Street Journal and NBC  News also  conducted a  poll on  this  matter last year. In that poll, 56 per cent of registered voters favored giving  parents tax credits or vouchers for tui tion at the public or private school of  their choice.  In  closing,  the Hatch  amendment  puts decisionmaking  in  the hands of  parents-where  it  should  be.  This  amendment  is narrowly  tailored and  would provide this country with a clear  measure of the workability of school  choice programs.  Accordingly, I am pleased to offer my  strong support.  ",1992
34,Senate,102,-0.37,379,1,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, our  school system is in big trouble. And I  could not agree more with  the basic  premise of this bill-that the best solu tions to the problems schools are fac ing come from the local level, not the  Federal Government.  That is why I support S. 2. It encour ages  innovative flexible  ideas  to  improve our educational system. And it  creates expectations that schools must  be willing  to meet  in educating our  children. It holds schools accountable  for reaching goals that will keep this  country competitive in today's world.  And it provides more support for pro grams we know are working, like Head  Start and Chapter 1.  My own State of Maryland has an in novative education reform plan called  Schools for Success. The support that  Maryland will get from S. 2 will allow  them to implement this plan, aimed at  comprehensive  school  improvement  and reform.  If S. 2 is fully funded, Maryland will  receive $13.8 million. This will allow  the State to set up more regional staff  development centers, award challenge  grants to schools to develop annual im provement plans, and strengthen  the  Maryland  School  Performance  Pro gram. My State needs this help.  Mr. President, I know that there has  been a lot of discussion about the role  of parochial schools in this bill. I am  pleased  that  there are a  number of  ways in which private schools and the  Federal Government have  formed  a  partnership  to  improve  the  services  they  provide.  These  are  programs  where  the  church-State  relationship  has been established by court decision  and by policy.  Parochial  school  students can get  help  through  some of  the best edu cation programs in this country-the  ones we  know work. These include  Head Start, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Fol low-Through, Math and Science Edu cation, and a number of others, includ ing the School Lunch Program.  We also provide help  for parochial  schools to clean up their asbestos prob lems so the air their students breathe  at school will be safe. I am proud to  say that as chair of the Appropriations  S'l,lbcommittee that funds EPA, I have  provided $160 million for this program  in the last 3 years,  though the Presi dent always cuts this program out of  his budget proposal. Many Catholic and  other  nonpublic  schools  have  been  helped by this program.  Mr. President, I would like to say a  few words about religious day schools,  and  the absolutely crucial  role  they  play  in our educational system, par ticularly our inner city neighborhoods.  Mr. President,  I  am a  very proud  product of Catholic schools. From ele mentary school  to college  I went  to  Catholic schools. And so I will speak  from the heart.  I would not have  traded my experi ence  for anything. Everything  I  am  today, I owe  in some measure  to  the  Catholic schools I attended and the sis ters who taught me.  These sisters were terrific role mod els.  They  encouraged me  to  take  chances,  to  think,  to analyze, and  to  form my own opinions.  I  learned  to  speak up and to speak out, and I built  confidence in myself as a person and as  a leader.  And  the values  I  learned  in  these  schools have stayed with me all my  life.  What are the secrets to the success of  these  schools? They  treated all stu dents the same. They assumed all stu dents could  learn. They expected all  students, rich or poor, to try their best,  to work their hardest, and to succeed.  Mr. President, I know this is true of  many  religious day  schools.  I  have  talked about Catholic schools specifi cally because  that is my own experi ence, but I know of many fine religious  day schools in my own State that cre ate  the  same excellent environment  that my schools did for me.  I would like to enter into the RECORD  at the conclusion of my remarks a fine  article from the Evening Sun in Balti more. Although this article mainly ad dresses what Catholic schools offer to  disadvantaged  students,  I  believe  it  captures  the best  of what Catholic  schools have to offer all their students.  As much as I support the tremendous  contribution that religious day schools  have made to our educational system, I  am greatly concerned about  the  in creasing public disinvestment  in our  public  schools. For  this  reason, Mr.  President, I cannot support any amend ment that will take money away from  our public schools.  In  closing, Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to support the bill we are con sidering  today,  and  I  commend  the  Senator from Massachusetts for all his  hard work. I hope we can pass this bill  soon, and add some fuel to the fire we  must light under the educational sys tem in this country.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Evening Sun, Oct. 17, 1991]  THE ASCENDANCY OF BLACK CATHOLICS  (By Seymour P. Lachman and Barry A.  Kosmin)  Clarence Thomas says the nuns who taught  in his parochial school  in Savannah, Ga.,  gave him advantages that many of his white  and black peers did not have-a sense of self respect, discipline and  learning  that gave  him a chance of success denied to many oth ers.  Thomas' rise to the Supreme Court illus trates the remarkable educational achieve ments of the 2.4 million black Catholics, a  minority within a minority.  The City University of New York's na tional survey of religious identification sub stantiates this phenomenon.  These achievements-graduating from high  school and collegeare greater than those of  other blacks, equal to those of other Catho lics and higher  than  the overall American  average regardless of race.  The 1990 survey, in which 113,000 Americans  were interviewed, shows black Catholics are  more likely than all Americans to complete  high school and college.  Among the respondents, only 18 percent of  black Catholics dropped out of high school  compared with 31 percent for the total black  population and 21  percent  for  the overall  white population.

37,Senate,102,-0.256,418,1,Mr. KOHL.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to applaud the effort of a brave  17-year-old student. It has come to my  attention  that on November 6,  1991,  Derek Wishowski  of Ladysmith, WI,  saved a 76-year-old woman whose car  had fallen  into  the Flambeau River.  Mrs. Anderson's car lost control when  it hit an ice path, the car overturned  into the river, leaving the woman help less in the  icy Flambeau. Derek and  two friends were in a car behind the  woman when he saw her lose control.  The  young man  fearlessly  plunged  through the freezing water to the car  15  feet  from  shore. Meanwhile  his  friends, Kim Bishop and Heather Beebe,  went  to get help. Water was rushing  into the car while Derek tried to force  the door open. Derek was able to open  the door wide enough to get Mrs. An derson out and save her. Mrs. Ander son, fortunately, only had minor inju ries. The Rusk County Sheriff's De partment honored Derek Wishowski at  a  Veteran's  Day  ceremony  at  Ladysmith High School.  Derek exemplifies an American hero.  If there are more students  like him,  the United States will be in good shape  for the future. The State of Wisconsin  is lucky to have Derek Wishowski.   A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE  ",1992
38,Senate,102,-0.262,418,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today, following  the 19th anniversary  of  the Supreme Court's Roe  versus  Wade decision, to reaffirm my commit ment to  the protection of a woman's  right  to choose whether  to have an  abortion.  Recently  in Washington, DC,  and  across the Nation, a number of arrests  were made of people blocking abortion  clinics and obstructing  the constitu tional right of others to choose what  they would do with their bodies. Both  the Supreme Court and Congress are  flooded with letters from people chal lenging  the Court's Roe versus Wade  decision.  But I am bolstered by the outpouring  of letters from those who feel as I do;  that the right  to choose  to have an  abortion is a constitutionally guaran teed privacy right, upheld by the Su preme Court and supported by the ma jority of American people.  In Roe versus Wade,  the Supreme  Court recognized a woman's right  to  choose, and defined the boundaries of  that choice. Nineteen years later, the  Court decided the case of Webster ver sus  Reproductive  Health  Services  which gave individual States mofe lee way in deciding whether and how to re strict abortions.  Many State legislatures, recognizing  the constitutionality of the Court's de cision in Roe, did not tamper with the  right  to choose as  recognized under  Roe. A few States, however, Louisiana,  Pennsylvania, and Utah most notably,  used authority under the Webster deci sion to restrict abortion rights.  The Supreme Court has agreed  to  rule  this year on Pennsylvania's re strictive abortion  law. That  law  im poses a mandatory 24 hour waiting pe riod before an abortion can be per formed,  requires parental consent be fore a minor can get an abortion, and  requires spousal consent if. the woman  seeking  an  abortion  is  a married  woman.  In hearing the Pennsylvania case, the  Court will have to address the scope of  constitutional protections for abortion  rights. The Court will have to consider  the key question of whether the fun damental constitutional right  to pri vacy under Roe versus Wade will con tinue to embrace the right to a safe,  legal abortion.  I can only speculate, along with the  rest of the country, on how the Court  will rule on this issue. The Court cur rently consists of only  two Justices  whose support  for abortion  rights  is  known:  Justice Harry A. Blackmun,  who wrote the Roe versus Wade deci sion, and Justice John Paul Stevens.  This country has come a  long way  since the pre-Roe versus Wade days of  back alley abortions. I hope that the  Court will, in its wisdom, rule to keep  abortion safe and legal.   ",1992

41,Senate,102,0.322,509,1,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I have  often stood here on  this side of the  aisle and chatted amiably about var ious issues of the day across this aisle,  with  the senior Senator from Massa chusetts. He  is usually full of energy  and enthusiasm. And I see those same  traits in full, full display today.  I heard  the senior Senator refer  to  the word ""assault"" upon his measure. I  think, perhaps, as he was  traversing  the Capitol grounds,  that he missed  what I said and perhaps staff may have  overestimated to him the comments of  the Senator from Wyoming that took  place while  the Senator from Massa chusetts was not in the Chamber. I was  speaking  in a marvelously calm de meanor about some defects in the com mittee bill, and then suddenly to be ac cused of an assault on his measure leaves me  speechless.  It's almost an  impossible situation. I can hardly pro ceed. However, I shall.  I would earnestly and respectfully re quest that my statement first be read  by the senior Senator from Massachu setts and  then responded  to perhaps,  after that, he will have a better oppor tunity to think about what I have said.  And I also stated that I did support  that compromise on the New American  Schools Initiative.  But the hour is late and it is Friday,  and I did speak my piece, something I  wanted to do. I have watched education  for a  lifetime in public service, and I  think that I may be one of the few Re publicans ever  to  receive a very  re markable award, which I cherish, from  the Wyoming Education Association  for my work for education.  Sometimes education  issues do get  partisan. You will find that partisan ship is the NEA itself, specifically, in  its endorsement policies. If you look at  who they support, there are not many  Republicans. Let us deal with that hon estly. That is just the way it is at the  NEA.  They did not support this President  or former Republican Presidents. They  always have some remarkable reason  for their lack of support. But there are  not many Republicans in the ranks of  those who are supported by the NEA  and some of their affiliates.  But let me say this about specifics  raised by Senator KENNEDY. Let us get  the privatization issue in perspective.  The support of private schools was not  George Bush's idea. The idea was  to  give low-income parents the chance to  give their kids a choice as to the kind  of education they should receive,  the  kind of education the senior Senator  from Massachusetts received, and that  the Senator from Wyoming received,  and all of us privileged people have re ceived. That is what George Bush was  doing. That is the perceived threat to  the special interests.  And it is extraordinary to me to hear  people  of progressive bent  speaking  about the privatization of schools. In  fact, the cry is coming up from minor ity parents who say: ""Our children are  ",1992
42,,102,-0.49,522,1,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to  in sert  for  the RECORD a  recent article  in  the  Washington Post by Douglas Farah that tells  of the tragedies residents of the drug infested  Medellin, Colombia, community must suffer on  a regular basis. I would like my colleagues to  be ever mindful of the fact that drug problems  are not endemic  to  the United States, and  while we are being bombarded constantly by  the  rash of crimes  in our communities, we  must not ever lose sight of the  fact that drug  related terrorism is a worldwide problem.  [From the Washington Post, Dec. 9, 1991]  AWASH IN A TIDE OF VIOLENCE  (By Douglas Farah)  MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA.-Teenage Boy Scouts  and Girl Scouts  in blood-stained uniforms  met  the  taxis  that pulled  in, with horns  blaring, to the small lot in front of the emer gency entrance of the hospital to unload the  wounded and dying.  It was a Saturday night at the San Vicente  de Paul hospital, known in Medellin as La  January 24, 1992  16  Policlinica, where on weekends  the emer gency room averages about 150 gunshot vic tims a night. Because the hospital has no  money  to pay for orderlies,  troops of Boy  Scouts and Girl Scouts volunteer to work 12hour shifts to unload  the wounded. Ambu lances are scarce, so most patients have to  pay for a  taxi. The bleak concrete building  has no waiting room, so relatives, barred by  an iron gate, wait outdoors.  ""The first time I did this, I cried and ev erything,"" said Girl Scout Sandra Patricia  Pulgarin,  as  she  removed  her  rubber  gloves and wiped fresh blood from her uni form after taking one more patient to the  emergency ward. ""Now I just do it.""  While drug-related terrorism has declined  sharply  in Medellin  since  leaders of  the  city's infamous cocaine cartel surrendered to  the government earlier  this year, human  rights and medical workers say the violence  has not declined. And La Policlinica, with  few resources, is fighting for survival in one  of the most violent cities in the world.  A hospital study released last month said  that in Medellin there are 320 homicides a  year per 100,000 inhabitants-about 6,000. In  the United States, the national figure is 12  homicides per 100,000 people, and Washing ton, with 483 homicides last year, has about  80 per 100,000.  Most of those who arrive at the hospital  here are men between 15 and 30 years old  from comunas, the poor neighborhoods that  ring the city. Gang fights, skirmishes with  the police, drunken brawls and fights over  drugs and women all contribute to the flow  of patients.  By 1 a.m. on the recent Saturday night, pa tients waiting to be  treated had filled  the  stretchers, so new arrivals were carried on  whatever the volunteers could find.  Following  the arrival of ""another pack age,"" as the bodies are called, Pulgarin dis appeared behind  the  iron gate  that keeps  visitors from entering the emergency room  and emerged a moment  later, carrying 2year-old Catarina, whose mother had been  shot in the chest by her father.  The child had  refused  to  let go of her  mother's hand  in  the  taxi,  and Pulgarin  pried her loose and hugged the trembling girl  in the parking lot, eventually coaxing her to  drink a cola and eat some chips. Relatives  arrived about an hour  later  to  take her  away.  The dimly lit parking lot was splattered  with dried blood. Relatives and friends wait ing for word on the fate of loved ones sat on  the ground or whatever surface they could  find.  Vendors sold coffee, snacks and cigarettes,  while  late-night  hangers-on,  morticians  hustling  business  and  morgue  workers  lounged against the wall. Occasionally, the  murmurs were interrupted by the sharp cries  of  those being  informed of a death or by  chatter of patients being discharged.  A long hearse-like vehicle was backed up  to the morgue doors, and three bodies were  loaded. Four more were inside awaiting iden tification.  Asked  if  the night was unusually grue some, a morgue worker replied: ""No, this is  Saturday. Seven, 10, 15, 20 dead  is normal  here.""  After discharging  their passengers,  taxi  drivers are often unable to collect the fares,  and they stay for a while, cleaning the blood  off the back seats. The single policeman on  duty asks each driver who arrives with a  gunshot victim  for  the  location and  cir cumstances of how the body was found. Most  give the shortest possible answer to avoid in volvement, then head back into the night.  ",1992
43,Senate,102,0.013,535,1,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of  the Bond amendment on  Parents as first teachers. I cosponsored  this legislation in March of 1990, when  Senator BOND first introduced the bill,  and again when he  reintroduced  the  legislation during this Congress. I be lieved then, as I do now, that parents  must be actively involved in the edu cation of their children if their chil dren are to reach their fullest poten tial.  I am sure that if any of us could re member  the  very  first  thing  we  learned,  there  is  a  high probability  that a parent taught it to us-whether  it was shaking a rattler or reading a  nursery rhyme. Since the parents are  children's first  teachers,  it is  impor tant that parents have  the necessary  knowledge and skills  to ensure  that  their  children's preschool  years  are  spent in a positive and productive edu cational environment.  Numerous studies indicate  that the  first years of a child's life profoundly  affect his  later  learning capabilities.  For example, during  the early years,  children  learn more at a  faster rate  than at other periods of their lives. In  addition, the development of language,  intelligence, and curiosity occur dur ing the first 3 years of life. A child's  personality also is most actively mold ed during this period. Thus, it is impor tant that parents reflect a  loving and  enthusiastic attitude toward the child.  Parents must know:  How to show affection for the child;  How  to express pride in the child's  accomplishments;  How to choose educational toys;  How to answer the child's questions;  and  How to allow the child to explore his  environment freely as long as the ex ploration does not endanger the child's  safety.  Parents who do these things well can  reasonably expect that their children  will grow up emotionally stable and in tellectually prepared for school.  Because the first 3 years of a child's  life are  so  important, we must put  forth our best efforts  to ensure  that  parents know how to teach and care for  their children. While  this  statement  seems clearly obvious to most of us, we  must  realize  that child-rearing  to  a  great extent  in America  is  trial and  error often based on the experiences of  our parents or other adults in our lives.  However, we have an opportunity here  to take advantage of years of research  in  early  childhood  development  to  compensate for some of the experiences  which have been passed on that may  not contribute  to a positive  learning  environment.  It is especially important that par ents be educated to be good parents be cause so many of today's parents are  mere  children  themselves. However,  the Parents as Teachers Program ad dresses the needs of all parents-young  and old, poor and middle class.  The Neighborhood Schools Improve ment Act, that the Senate now is con sidering, has  incorporated  the Presi dent's and Governors' national  edu cation goals that are to be met by the  year 2000. If we are serious about reach ing these goals, we must fund programs  that assist  in early  childhood  edu cation. Although Head Start is an ex tremely  effective  program, which  I  wholeheartedly support, for many chil dren Head Start, which begins at age 3,  is too late.  The Bond amendment would go  a  long way in bridging the gap between  birth and Head Start. The legislation  would provide seed money to States to  fund an early childhood education pro gram for parents. Specifically, the leg islation would authorize a $100 million  competitive grant program over 5 years  for States desiring to begin or expand  Parents as Teachers Programs. Under  the legislation, Federal funding would  decline to 75 percent in the third year,  50 percent in the fourth year, and 25  percent in the fifth year. After the fifth  year, the legislation would require the  States to pick up the cost of the pro gram.  I am pleased  to support  the Bond  amendment because I am familiar with  the success of the Parents as Teachers  Program  in my home State of Ala bama. The Alabama program enrolls  parents when the mother is pregnant,  and the family remains in the program  until  the child's third birthday. The  program provides services such as:  Home  visits  by  parent  educators  trained in child development;  Group meetings to help parents share  experiences;  Periodic health screening of children  to check sensory and educational de velopment; and  Referral  to community and profes sional services if problems are detected  during the screenings.  The Alabama Parents as Teachers  Program is based on a Missouri model  established in 1984. A recent study of  the children who participated  in  the  Missouri program in the early eighties  indicated  that  the children were sig nificantly ahead of other children in  academic performance at the end of the  first grade. In addition, the study also  revealed that the parents in the Mis souri program have continued to play a  more  active  role  in  their children's  education than other parents.  The results of the Missouri study and  the success of the program in Alabama  are enough for me  to know  that the  Bond amendment is worthy of my sup port. We cannot skimp when it comes  to the education of our children. They  ",1992
44,Senate,102,-0.322,587,1,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, you can  walk in Woody's Sherwood Forest most  any day of the week and see scores of  Sherwood  and Pulaski County  resi dents enjoying Jess ""Woody"" Woods'  fare.  You can also find Woody and his staff  at work on Thanksgiving and Christ mas, but it will not be for  the usual  paying customers. For at the holiday  season, Woody prepares a feast for the  area's homeless.  For almost 20 years, Woody has pro vided a holiday uplift to many home less Arkansans, a debt he says he owes  from the days when he, too, depended  upon  the Salvation Army and others  for support.  I would like  to share with my col leagues  articles  from  the Arkansas  Democrat-Gazette about Woody's prep arations during the recent holiday sea son. It is people like Woody Woods who  remind us what the holidays are really  all about.  The articles follow:  [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Nov.  28, 1991]  TABLES TURNED: ONCE-NEEDY BOY FEEDS THE  HUNGRY  (By Olivier Uyttebrouck)  Jess ""Woody"" Woods, who over the years  has served thousands of free meals to  the  needy, said Wednesday that he  is repaying  society for  the free meals he received as a  boy.  Woods will be feeding the homeless again  today when he and his staff will dish out  some 300  free Thanksgiving meals at  the  Union Rescue Mission's Transient Home at  615 Magnolia St. in North Little Rock.  ""I'm just trying to pay a debt back to soci ety,"" Woods said Wednesday in the kitchen  of his sprawling restaurant, Woody's Sher wood Forest in Sherwood.  ""I lived off the Salvation Army when I was  5 and 6 years old,"" said Woods, 67, who was  one of five children in a poor Little Rock  family, ""I said then if I could ever help any body, I'd do it.""  Other agencies that will serve free Thanks giving dinners today include:  The Salvation Army at 1111 W. Markham  St., which is expected to serve as many as  400 people. The Salvation Army has sched uled  two dinners-from noon  to 2 p.m. and  from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Our House a shelter for the homeless at 822  S. Louisiana St, is prepared to feed anyone  who comes  in  the door at about noon,  a  spokesman said Wednesday.  The Wagon Wheel restaurant in Greenbrier  (Faulkner County), will serve a free turkey  dinner from noon to 2 p.m.  Neighbor-to-Neighbor in Pine Bluff plans  to serve about 200 meals.  The Russellville Christian Center plans to  serve as many as 125 meals.  Woods was at work by 5 a.m. Wednesday  preparing food for today's feast. He said he  plans to be up at 5 a.m. again today and will  be serving meals. He said he will be up early  Friday washing dishes and cleaning up his  kitchen.  Woods' son, Bobby Woods, will work with  his father today, as will Betty Bright, an em ployee at Woody's.  ""We cook it all here and take it over there  and serve  it."" Bright said Wednesday. ""It  wouldn't be any fun if we didn't serve it.""  Woods will serve up about 200 pounds of  smoked  turkey,  18  gallons each of green  beans and yams, 20 gallons of coffee, some  600  servings of cranberry sauce and  large  quantities  of  dressing, mashed  potatoes,  corn, salad and rolls.  Leftover from the feast will feed another  200 people at an evening meal at the Rescue  Mission and perhaps additional meals Fri day, he said. Woods also provides much of  the equipment and utensils used for the din ner.  ",1992
45,Senate,102,-0.145,613,1,Mr. NUNN.," Mr.  President,  as we  begin the debate this year on the size  and shape of our military forces for the  future,  I  think  it  is appropriate  to  pause and recognize the vital role that  our men and women  in uniform and  their families have played in bringing  about the successful conclusion of the  cold war.  Debates on defense usually focus on  weapons systems. There  is a certain  glamour associated with airplanes that  can fly at supersonic speeds and deliver  devastating munitions with precision.  There  is a certain glamour in  tanks  that can roar across vast, rugged ex panses and deliver crushing firepower  with pinpoint accuracy. There is a cer tain glamour in submarines that can  operate underwater  for months at a  time and attack undetected. There is a  certain glamour to systems in develop ment  that can  shoot down missiles  from space. And indeed, there is a cer tain glamour in hand-held, smart weap ons that can track down and destroy  moving targets in the air and on the  ground. We saw many of these weapons  in action on live television coverage of  the Persian Gulf conflict. The results  demonstrated  to  the world  the out standing technological achievements of  the American defense industry and the  men and women in the defense indus try.  Yet, none of our weapons would have  been effective without the highly pro fessional, well-trained, dedicated men  and women in uniform who have en dured the sacrifices of military service  with  their families over  the past 40  years-in peacetime and in wartime.  Mr. President, from the end of World  War  II  until  today,  over  23,000,000  Americans have served in our Armed  Forces.  Of  this  number,  16,600,000  served during major conflicts-5,700,000  during  the Korean  conflict; 8,744,000  during  the Vietnam  conflict;  and  2,160,000 during the Persian Gulf con flict. A total of 112,688 Americans made  the ultimate sacrifice for their country  in these three conflicts, and more than  twice that number were wounded:  In the Korean conflict, 54,260 Amer ican soldiers lost their lives, and 103,284  were wounded.  In the Vietnam conflict, 58,135 Amer ican soldiers lost their lives, and 153,303  were wounded.  And most  recently  in  the Persian  Gulf conflict, 293 Americans lost their  lives, and 467 were wounded.  In addition to these major conflicts,  Mr. President, American military men  and women have been called on  to  carry out other military operations in  varying size and intensity all over the  world, most recently in Operation Just  Cause  in Panama. In just the last 12  years, 502 military members have been  killed in these operations and in mind less terrorist bombings and hostage sit uations.  For  example,  268 military  members were killed in Lebanon dur ing peacekeeping operations in 1982-84.  Scores more were killed in operations  in  the Dominican Republic, Grenada,  and Panama. Military personnel  lost  their lives in El Salvador and Guate mala;  in the Sudan and the Sinai; in  both Germanies; and along the Korean  DMZ long after the Korean war armi stice.  Along with these deaths from hostile  actions large and small, 15,158 military  members have died in unavoidable ac cidents of military  life and  training  since 1979,  reminding us that even in  the best  times military service  is a  dangerous profession.  Mr. President, each and every one of  these losses added to the price our Na tion paid to win the cold war.  In the decades since World War II, we  have called on our men and women in  uniform to keep the peace, and to fight  when necessary  to preserve our na tional  security  interests. We  have  called on our men and women in uni form to maintain a formidable forward  presence to deter war in Europe and in  Asia. We have called on our men and  women in uniform to maintain a high  degree  of combat  readiness  through  rigorous training on land, at sea, and  in the air. We have called on our men  and women in uniform to stand alert at  remote  and  isolated  radar  stations,  missile silos, ground outposts, and on  lengthy deployments at sea. And we  have called on the families of military  members to bear unique burdens: long  periods of family separation; frequent  moves  around  the country and  the  world, often to isolated military instal lations; and-in time of conflict-the  numbing anxiety over the fate of their  loved one.  The successful conclusion of the cold  war is a tribute to the skill, the dedica tion, and the patriotism of every single  individual who  responded so magnifi cently to these calls from their Nation.  Mr. President, in addition to carry ing out their responsibilities as war-  riors, military men and women have  served as ambassadors of good will in  countless  humanitarian  missions  around  the world. They have unself ishly transported medical and food sup plies, provided medical aid, evacuated  victims of natural disasters,  restored  needed communications, and repaired  roads and bridges as well as many  other tasks.  These humanitarian efforts by our  military members carried  the Amer ican ideals of freedom and democracy  and humanitarian concerns throughout  the globe. America demonstrated  to  our  adversaries  that we  had  the  strength, resources, and resolve to de fend our interests and our allies mili tarily; but we also showed the world  that we had  the compassion  to help  friends and adversaries alike when nat ural  catastrophes  imperiled  human  lives. And we are doing that again in  our  former  adversarial country,  the  former Soviet Union and the Republics,  and the people there who need assist ance with food and medicine.  In  recent  times, American  service  men and women rushed assistance to  earthquake victims in Armenia in 1988;  assisted  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Kurds in Northern Iraq in 1991; helped  provide  emergency assistance  to al most 2 million people affected by flood ing  in Bangladesh  last year; and re stored order in our own Virgin Islands  after Hurricane Hugo  in 1989. Today,  military members are providing assist ance to thousands of Haitian refugees  at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in  Cuba whom  they helped rescue  from  unseaworthy vessels, and are airlifting  food and medical supplies to the needy  citizens of the newly independent re publics of the Commonwealth of Inde pendent States.  Mr. President, the cold war is over,  but the Nation still relies on our men  and women  in uniform  to keep  the  peace as our former adversaries strug gle to overcome years of economic and  political decay to  join the free world  community. They must do so in an un certain environment as our military  forces become smaller as they will and  must. Our challenge will be to ensure  that we maintain sufficient strength  and resolve over the next 10 years and  in  the years  thereafter  to guarantee  the victory of our men and women in  uniform  that  they sacrificed  to win,  and  that  this victory will  result  in  peace and democracy in the world. Our  military services will be smaller in the  future, but they will still require well trained, well-equipped,  highly moti vated men and women to be fully com bat ready.  At the same time, we must take care  of-and this year we are going to be  discussing this quite a bit because it is  very important-we must take care of  the 300,000 or more people who will be  leaving military service each year over  the next few years as we  reduce  the  size of the Defense Establishment.

46,Senate,102,-0.313,639,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the managers of this bill for ac cepting an amendment  that will  let  this bill serve the purpose for which it  is intended: rebuilding our schools.  While we despair that our Nation's  schools are not up to the task of edu cating kids for a competitive world, we  in Washington are constantly reminded  that the Federal Government's piece of  the Nation's school system amounts to  only 6 percent. To improve schooling  nationwide, we must look for a way to  use  that piece as  the most powerful  lever  for change at the  level of  the  school and the classroom. That means  doing much more than throwing money  into school systems.  The bill before us, the Neighborhood  Schools Improvement Act,  is one  re sponse to the guest for a way  to use  limited Federal resources  to make a  bigger difference in all 85,000 schools in  America.  It  reaches  directly  into  schools with the means for change and  holds schools accountable for results.  But in the bill as drafted unfortunately  constrains the resources available for  change even further because of its ex cessive allowances for administration  and assistance with grant applications.  If this bill were  fully  funded  for 5  years,  fully 32 percent of  the  funds  would go not to schools but to adminis trators and grant application profes sionals. Can we really tell the Amer ican  people  that we  are  improving  American schools when we are putting  more  than a  billion dollars of  their  money into bloated administrative lay ers at the State and local level?  The bill as  reported  allows  every  State to use its entire first year allot ment  to develop a State school  im provement plan and help schools pre pare grant applications. Nearly a dec ade has passed since Secretary Bell re leased ""A Nation at Risk."" Are there  really States that have not yet given  serious  thought  to  systemwide  edu cation reform? If there are such States,  and I doubt  there are,  they need  to  come  to  terms with  their own  eco nomic obligation  to  themselves, and  they should not need a Federal hand out to do that planning. This amend ment will limit the funds available for  first-year planning and grant applica tions to the $100 million already appro priated. It does not affect the special  rule under which States can use first year funds for teacher training or for  public school choice initiatives.  Federal money does not come with out  responsibilities. States must be come partners with the Federal Gov ernment and share our commitment to  reform. The funds provided under this  bill should mesh with the resources for ward-looking States are already devot ing to school improvement so that ev eryone's money goes a  little further.  But as much of this new Federal money  as possible must go  to making  these  in each  school and each  plans  real  classroom.  President,  this  amendment  Mr.  might seem to deal primarily with a  technical aspect of this bill. But I in tend it to be a first step toward a new  principle for the Federal role in edu cation. The principle of accountability  must apply at every level. To use the  Federal Government's 6  percent  of  America's school system as a powerful  lever for change, we must insist that  there will be  no more money until  there is a commitment to reform. We  can use our resources not only as a  means for change, but as an incentive  for determined, responsive change. We  should not use our limited funds for a  year of planning, conferring, preparing  grant applications and in other ways  postponing real reform.  The second step will be a bill I intend  to introduce later this spring, which I  will call ""Rewards-for-Results."" I be lieve we can reach directly into each  classroom with a powerful incentive: If  your school improves student perform ance,  if students stay in school and  come out  ready  for  college or  the  workforce, we can give every teacher in  your school, a $6,000 bonus. This pro posal will take some careful thought,  but I mention it today because I would  like to affirm the principle that we use  money to force real reform in school  systems that fear change but cry out  for  the enthusiasm that only change  can bring.

His  in sight into the repatriation process of  former Contras is very revealing, and I  ask that a series of three articles he  wrote upon his most recent return be  printed in full in the RECORD.  The articles follow:  [From the Las Vegas Sun, Dec. 21, 1991]  BITTERSWEET RETURN TO NICARAGUA  (By Mike O'Callaghan)  JUIGALPA, NICARAGUA.-Returning  to  this  area, where I arrived with three busloads of  wounded Contras after the peace agreement  last year, is both rewarding and depressing.  It reminds me of eating bittersweet choco late, each bite brings a new taste sensation.  Nicaragua Army-supported death squads,  recompas, roam the hills north and east of  Managua. They boldly strike in broad day light with the knowledge that the national  pollee and Sandinista-run army will not pur sue or punish them. More about this bitter  side of Nicaragua tomorrow.  The progress  that many  amputees and  other wounded members of the Nicaraguan  Resistance have made is the sweet side of  what has happened during 1991.  The Organization of American States Com mission, under  the direction  of Santiago  Murray, working with the Nicaraguan Repa triation  Institute,  headed  by  Oscar  Soyalbarro,  who  is  better  known  as  Commandante ""Ruben"" by his Contra fol lowers, has made great progress.  I found my friend Jehu, still confined to a  wheelchair, sitting in from of his own little  home instead of the tent I left him in last  year. Certainly his concrete house with three  small rooms wouldn't pass other sanitary or  engineering standards in our city. Neverthe less, his pride in having a home showed in  his voice and eyes. He wanted me to tell Lus  Vegan Dr. Lonnie Hammargren hello andre assure him he will soon be walking. Lonnie  checked Jehu when he was hospitalized in  Honduras before the ceasefire.  Amputees Cecillo Centeno  (""Alex"")  and  Jose Gregorio Amnador (""Coyote"") are two  of three partners running a tiny store on the  backside of this town. But a stone's throw  away  from  them  is amputee Luis Felipe  Granados (""Punche"") along with three part ners  operating  a  shoe-mendling  shop. A  neighboring carpenter shop is run by Ellos  Miranda who is still recuperating from seri ous war wounds.  Fifteen miles off the main road between  this town and Managua is a newly founded  farming community of 28 wounded Contra  combatants and  their families. Just down  the rutted dirt road from this group of 160  people  is  a  larger,  more  prosperous  Sandinistan-run cooperative. ""We get along  with them just fine,"" one of the men told  me.  Sergio O'Connor and Carlos Garcia, who we  still call ""Chino,"" had taken me to see the  new community. The homes with dirt floors  are shelters the occupants treasure. Chino, a  leg amputee who heads up the wounded vet erans of  the Resistance Forces, gave me  added hope when saying, ""We have talked to  the Sandinista wounded and soon we will  have a gathering."" These men and women  are tired of war and bloodshed.  Closer  to Managua,  near  the  town  of  Tipitapa, I watched former Contra combat ants harvest a bumper crop of millet. Despite  the drought, the hybrid seed brought in from  Texas produced a crop beyond all expecta tions. Standing in the fields ready for har vest  is a heavy sesame crop. The several  dozen  people  involved  in  farming  almost  2,000 acres will pay for the seed, all the ex penses and still have enough  to feed their  families during the coming year.

The President  promised the country he would send to  Congress a significant proposal to im prove America's health care system.  Now we learn the President's budget  is being rewritten and health care re form will be submitted at a later date.  This is like the old ""My dog ate my  homework"" defense. Just as it does not  wash in school, it does not wash here.  This country is calling on its Presi dent to come up with a serious, long term plan to get us through the decade.  Not a short-term Band-Aid to get him  through the election. Health care, jobs,  tax fairness for the middle class, lower ing  the deficit-these are  the  issues  that demand a well thought out State  of the Union speech.  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I hope Presi dent Bush will offer some serious long term plans and not more politically  motivated Band-Aids. If he is serious,  Congress will be more than happy  to  help him. But,  if tonight's speech  is  more of the same Republican help the  rich, soak the rest leftovers, then Con gress will as before fight for the middle  class in this country.

49,House,102,0.338,691,1,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. Speaker,  last  Friday I received a call from one of my  constituents, Jeff Nunes. He was furi ous. Jeff had read a story in one of our  Pittsburgh newspapers  that  reported  approval of $20,000  to put new marble  floors on  three House elevators. Mr.  Speaker,  this  type of spending habit  only serves to reinforce that the slush  fund of the Speaker and some of the  leaders on the other side of the aisle is  being used for  lavish spending, while  many Americans are out of jobs, out of  work, and out of any hope for recovery.  I am not here  just to criticize this  House's leadership, but to question the  process  used  to  authorize  spending  under the legislative branch appropria tions bill. Here's another case where  unspent funds  from congressional ac counts are being used and spent by the  Speaker without  the  consent, much  less even the knowledge of other Mem bers of Congress.  This Speaker's slush fund is an em barrassment to the Congress.  Last fall I sponsored several bills and  amendments  that would  improve  the  handling of such situations to prohibit  the reprogramming of funds and to give  the money  that  is used,  that is not  spent in congressional accounts, back  to the Treasury to reduce the deficit,  not to be spent on marble floors.  I  also  sponsored  legislation  that  would open up books to the American  public. The American public has  a  right to know and see how our money  is being spent.  I would plead with  the Speaker  to  eliminate this slush fund and allow for  that money to be spent to reduce the  deficit.

51,House,102,0.043,691,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to  take  this opportunity  to  congratulate the President on the sub mission of his fourth annual drug con trol strategy.  Over  the past year our Nation has  been  distracted  by  such  dramatic  events as  the collapse of  the Soviet  Union, the freeing of the American hos tages held in Lebanon and, of course,  Operation Desert Storm. Now, Presi dent Bush's fourth strategy reminds us  of the important matters at home-in cluding our Nation's critical antidrug  efforts.  President Bush is commended for the  international attention he has focused  on  the drug war.  In 1988, we  spent  about $4.6 billion in antidrug efforts,  now  the administration is requesting  $13 billion in antidrug funding for fiscal  year 1993, that is a  tripling of Federal  resources in the last 5 years.  But all of these expenditures will be  meaningless unless all of us through out our Nation commit ourselves  to  work  for  a  drug-free nation-in our  homes  and  our  communities. Mr.  Speaker.  I  look  forward  to working  with our President and  the Office of  the National Drug Control Policy  to  make 1993 a victory year in our drug  war and in drug abuse reduction.

In 3  short years the promises of President  Bush have gone from ""Read my lips""  to ""Dial 911."" But the problem with  that, Mr. Speaker, is when the Amer ican taxpayers dial 911  they get a re cording at  the new world order  in structing them to deposit a  few more  yen.  Mr. Speaker,  I  think  the President  would be wise to stop the promises and  start enforcing the laws of America, es pecially the trade laws of this country  as they deal with Japan and China, be fore the President goes down in history  as  the most popular one-term Presi dent of all time.

54,House,102,-0.578,717,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, earlier  today I sent a Dear Colleague letter to  my colleagues in the House expressing  my concern for  the  letters and  tele phone calls which have recently been  generated by media interest and con cern over the records pertaining to the  assassination  of President  John  F.  Kennedy. As  the former chairman of  the House Select Committee on Assas sinations,  I want my  colleagues  to  know my position on this matter.  The House Select Committee on As sassinations was constituted on Sep tember 17, 1976, during the second ses sion of the 94th Congress. Its original  chairman was Thomas N. Downing who  retired at the end of that Congress. The  committee was recreated on February  2, 1977, during the 95th Congress with  Congressman HENRY GONZALEZ  being  appointed as its new chairman. Shortly  thereafter, he resigned the chairman ship and on March 8, 1977,  I was ap pointed to chair this committee.  Under the House resolution creating  this committee, we were  authorized  and directed to: ""* * * conduct a  full  and complete  investigation surround ing  the assassination  and death  of  President John F. Kennedy* * *.""  Our committee completed its inves tigation and on March 29, 1979, filed a  final  report with  the House of Rep resentatives.  In addition to the final report, 12 vol umes of evidentiary material relating  to  this  investigation were  filed with  the House of Representatives, printed  by  the Government Printing Office,  and then made available to the Amer ican public.  Moreover, in our public presentation  of the evidence, we held approximately  18 days of public hearings from August  through December 1978,  as well as 2  days of public policy hearings. During  the public hearings, the committee received evidence on  the  issues we had  identified to fulfill the legislative man date.  Evidence was heard on the following:  First, the facts and circumstances sur rounding the death of President Ken nedy,  and  the connection  if any be tween President Kennedy,  those facts  and circumstances and the accused as sassin, Lee Harvey Oswald; second, the  question of whether there was a con spiracy in the case; and third, the per formance of the various Federal agen cies including the FBI, the CIA, the Se cret Service, the Warren Commission,  and others.  Prior to our committee running out  of both time and money, we released  everything we had  the  time and  re sources  to  release. All of our other  records were placed in the National Ar chives under a House of Representa tives rule requiring such unpublished  records to be sealed for 50 years.  There  is considerable public debate  about these records including accusa tions  that  these  records,  if released,  would contain evidence of Government  coverup or complicity of Government  agencies in the assassination of Presi dent Kennedy.  I can assure my col leagues that nothing could be further  from the truth.  However, I deem it important to not  have the good work of our committee  impugned by  such  accusations. Our  committee attempted  to conduct  its  investigation into the assassination of  the President and  to present  the  re sults of that investigation to the Con gress and  the American people  in a  thorough and dignified manner in keep ing with the memory of this great lead er. Accordingly, I am in the process of  drafting a resolution which will affect  the release of  these and other docu ments now under seal bearing upon the  assassination  of President Kennedy.  Properly drafting such a resolution is  taking  time because it involves both  House and Senate records, as well as  the records of other Government agen cies. This  process  involves  a  fairly  complicated area of record designation.  I am committed to the principle that  Americans are entitled  to know  the  truth about the assassination of Presi dent Kennedy and feel  that Congress  should  totally allay all  fears of  the  American people in this regard.  It is my intention to seek original  cosponsors of my resolution as soon as  it is prepared. I hope that all of my col leagues will provide me with the oppor tunity  to seek  their support at  that  time.  tleman from California [Mr. PANETTA]  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1992

57,,102,0.419,756,1,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker,  the housing  market is a cornerstone of this Nation's eco nomic stability. According to the National As sociation of Home Builders, the total housing  starts in 1991 were under 1 million, the lowest  since 1945.  As my colleagues are certainly aware,  low  interest rates alone will not stimulate the hous ing market. The housing slump is affecting not  only first time home buyers, but many families  as well. Due to the current market, they can not sell their existing residence and thus can not build or move into a larger home. Without  being able to cash in on the equity built up in  their home,  they will not have the assets to  build or purchase a new home. Southern Cali fornia, which contains some of the  least afEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  fordable real estate markets in the Nation has  suffered a great deal as a result of the contin ually soft market.  Therefore, I am introducing legislation which  will allow the use of funds from individual re tirement  accounts,  401 (k)  accounts,  and  403(b) accounts to be used for the purchase  of a primary residence. By waiving the penalty  and tax from withdrawal of money from these  types of accounts, this bill will encourage an  infusion of capital  into the housing market.  It  will open up the first time home buyer market,  and allow growing families to move into larger  residences.  I urge my colleagues to join me in spurring  a strong and extended economic recovery by  providing  incentive to  first time home buyers  and growing families.  TRIBUTE TO GLENN BRENNER  HON. ROMANO L. MAZZOU  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 28, 1992  ",1992
58,,102,-0.186,756,1,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, upon our return  to Washington following the end of the district  work period, we were all saddened to learn of  the death of WUSA-TV sportscaster Glenn  Brenner.  Glenn was quite a character. He was, first  of all, a brilliant sportscaster, but more impor tantly, a genuinely good human being. He's  the kind of guy you would like to have for a  son, a brother, or as a friend-which he was  to all.  He appealed to  the kid  in all of us. Even  those who have no interest in sports whatso ever were drawn to him, and his death is so  personal and deeply  felt by people  from all  walks of life.  Glenn Brenner kept  things  in perspective.  Sports is an important part of most Americans'  lives, but it should not be an overriding pres ence as some would have  it. Glenn Brenner  and his broadcasts  reflected  these sensible  priorities.  With his quick,  incisive wit, Glenn could  puncture  the most self-absorbed egos. But  any criticism he may have delivered was well placed and right on target. The victims of his  barbs could proudly wear  the criticism as a  badge of honor.  I didn't know Glenn Brenner personally, but  feel as  if I did. Everyone felt that way about  him. His personality, warmth, and  inimitable  sense of humor endeared him to this commu nity and everyone he met. The testimonies of  those who knew him best confirm to all of us  that Glenn,  the TV person, was Glenn  the  human being. No disguise; what you saw  is  what you got.  We will miss his familiar back-and-forth, and  the unscripted exchanges with his broadcast  colleagues at channel 9-Sonny Jurgensen,  Gordon  Peterson, Maureen  Bunyan,  Ken  Mease, and so many others. We will remem ber him always with a smile.  I know that I join with all my colleagues in  the House  in expressing our deepest sym pathies and condolences to Glenn's family at  this difficult time.  January 28, 1992  MATTIE  GOODLETT  AND  CLAR ENCE  STEWART;  REFLECTING  THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY 'AC TION  HON. NITA M. LOWEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 28, 1992  ",1992
59,,102,-0.388,756,1,Mrs. LOWEY of New York.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to pay tribute to two people whose  lives  reflect  the spirit of community action.  Mattie W. Goodlett and Clarence A. Stewart of  New Rochelle, NY, exemplify  those qualities  that are best about community service. They  are being honored  for  their many significant  contributions at the Martin Luther King com munity action program breakfast.  It  is appro priate that they should be recognized on Dr.  King's birthday,  for  their actions epitomize  what he believed.  Since the early 1930's, Mattie Goodlett has  been making a difference in New Rochelle by  serving as an example of one whose values  and esteem for education have guided those  around her. Mrs. Goodlett is a living illustration  of one who cares and who has devoted her  time and efforts to improving the  lives of her  neighbors. Her  community  has  responded  generously  to her contributions by citing her  accomplishments  through  numerous  pres tigious community awards, such as  the Cita tion of Distinguished Service and  the Certifi cate of Appreciation from the city of New Ro chelle. Mrs. Goodlett has maintained an active  membership in the NAACP for over 50 years.  She has  received  the  Inter-religious Council  Award and  the United Negro College Fund  Certificate of Appreciation. These honors are  but a few of many. For 30 years, she was de voted  to  the success of  the New Rochelle  Child Care Program. Since her retirement in  1975,  from her position as supervisor of the  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Child Development  Center, Mattie Goodlett has remained an  im portant leader in New Rochelle.  As a professional social worker, Clarence A.  Stewart, Sr., has had a distinguished career.  At the Westchester County Division of Child  Welfare Services, he developed  the special  children's services, currently known as pre ventative and protective services, home maker  services, and the county's first family day care  program. He eventually moved on  from Child  Welfare Services  to continue his career with  the Mount Vernon Board of Education until  1991, when he retired. Although  it is evident  by his career choice that Mr. Stewart has al ways  been  concerned  about  the  cir cumstances of others, he has expanded his  interest in the community by giving of his free  time to many civic activities, including his 1 a year service on the New Rochelle Child Care  Center Commission. In 1986, he completed a  2-year term as a member of the Child Care  Commission of the State of New York. He  is  currently a member of the board of directors of  the Martin Luther King, Jr., Child Development  Center  in New Rochelle. Mr. Stewart  is de voted to his family and has been an inspiration  to many.  I am pleased  to  join many others  in con gratulating and thanking these two dedicated  individuals for all they have meant to our corn",1992
60,,102,-0.355,782,1,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, in 1984,  a California jury ruled for a plaintiff who com plained  that  the manufacturer  of  silicone  breast implants failed to warn of the potential  for severe side effects. Why have so few peo ple heard about what today is a major health  concern for thousands of women?  Because the court issued an order that pro hibited the plaintiff from telling anybody-even  the Food and Drug Administration-what she  learned.  Today, courts can still prohibit the disclosure  of certain information, and they may approve  secrecy agreements  that seal a case's  files  after settlement-even if that information could  save another person's life.  While these orders settle a dispute between  the  two parties,  they also prevent anybody  else  from  seeing  information on  defective  products  that may be  injuring people every  day. The present system,  in essence, con dones the withholding of lifesaving information  from average citizens.  . We must correct this imbalance in our judi cial system.  In April 1991,  I introduced H.R.  2017,  the Federal Litigation  in  the Sunshine  Act. This bill would make it difficult for courts  to conceal information on a public hazard.  The December 1991  issue of a ABA Journal  contains an  interesting article  that reinforces  my argument for disclosure legislation. It is en titled ""Secrecy Versus Safety-Restoring the  Balance.""  I urge my colleagues  to  read  the article,  which follows my comments. If they agree that  at  times  the safety of society overrides  the  need for secrecy, then I hope that they will co sponsor H.R. 2017.  If we do not change the present situation,  then who knows what health problem, known  ",1992
61,House,102,-0.133,795,1,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  last  night was my 15th State of the Union  Message, and while I  found  things in  the President's speech  that  I agreed  with and found things that I disagreed  with, it is always thrilling for me as  the Representative of a half million  Kansans to be in this room at a time of  historic significance, a  time the Con stitution provides  that  the President  shall have the opportunity to address  the people in this Chamber.  Saying that, there is one particular  omission in his State of the Union Mes sage that I feel compelled to talk about  today.  The  President  basically  acknowl edged in his speech that there  is no  fundamental problem with our health  care system. He wants to keep it the  same way.  Oh, yes, he says:  Let's tinker with it a little bit at the sides,  but let's not look at the system and see why  it is so much out of kilter and make that  kind of fundamental change.  Does he not recognize that the spiral ing cost of medical care makes folks  afraid to lose their job? It drains their  resources if they have lost their jobs?  It makes them sick if they have no re sources? Does he not realize that the  cost of health care is draining the abil ity of working American  families  to  provide decent affordable and quality  health care  for  themselves and  their  families?  This country cannot tolerate the sta tus quo on health care. It cannot toler ate  Presidential  tinkering  on  our  health care crisis.  REPEAL THE SOCIAL SECURITY  EARNINGS TEST  (Mr. ALLARD asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1992
62,House,102,0.572,795,1,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  in strong support of repealing  the Social Security earnings test. This  is an issue of basic fairness to millions  of seniors who have worked hard for  many years only to find that their So cial Security benefits are simply not  enough to get by on. Penalizing their  to  their  reward  earnings  is no way  years of service.  Those who support the repeal realize  most people are on the lower end of the  benefits  scale because  they had  low  earnings in their preretirement years.  Those retirees should not be disadvan taged now for those uncontrollable cir cumstances. In fact, it should provide a  strong incentive for Congress to modify  the law and provide them with an op tion currently denied them. The oppor tunity to work and be self-sufficient.  There are not many opportunities like  this where Congress could act and in stantly provide so many people with an  option to help themselves.  Repealing  the earnings limit would  not be a free giveaway. It would be an  option  for many  retired people who  find they need to supplement their in come. It would be fair treatment for an  important group of Americans. Please  join me in working to repeal the Social  Security earnings limit.  CHILDREN ARE STILL HAVING  NIGHTMARES  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her re marks.)  ",1992
63,House,102,-0.491,795,1,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr.  Speaker,  in his  speech last night, President Bush said  that because of the end of the cold war,  children will  not  have  bad  dreams  about nuclear attack that children had  in decades past.  The President should know that chil dren are still having nightmares, and  what  they fear  is closer  to home-if  they have a home.  Because of the Reagan-Bush policies,  children of some jobless Americans go  to sleep hungry, homeless, and without  hope. Federal policies of  the  last 11  years make our country guilty of child  neglect.  How could this happen?  Mr.  Speaker,  I  saw one  clue  last  night in the President's speech. He said  that he had just heard something strik ing from the Nation's mayors, that the  major cause of  the problems of  the  cities is the dissolution of the family.  Striking, he said. It may be news to  the President of the United States, but  it is something that too many Amer ican children know from the day they  are born: Poverty hurts families.  The President's solution? To appoint  a commission. After 11 years, a com mission. We already know the problem.  Let us act now  to end the nightmare  and restore the American dream for all  of America's children.  THE PRESIDENT'S CHALLENGE TO  CONGRESS  (Mr. BROOMFIELD asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1992
64,House,102,0.227,795,1,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr.  Speaker,  when I was looking  through some of  the reaction to the President's State of  the Union Message, I was struck by the  comments of  the chief executives of  America's big three auto makers.  I had. noticed last night that there  was no specific proposals for the auto  industry, but all three auto executives  were genuinely supportive of the Presi dent's message.  Lower personal  income  taxes will  mean more money in the pockets of po tential car buyers;  investment incen tives will mean more new plants and  equipment, greater productivity, and  more jobs.  The great virtue of the President's  program is that it is not pork barrel  for the few but real economic promise  for the many.  The President has offered  a  com prehensive program in a spirit of co operation. His  speech was character ized not by sound bites but by sound  policy.  The ball  is now  in our court. Con gress has  two options:  It can poke  along, postpone, and obstruct, and then  use the recession as a cudgel in the 1992  election; or it can make a good faith  effort to work with the administration  to enact a strong recovery program.  The President had some strong words  for  those who put politics before pol icy. ""When people put their party's for tunes before the public good,"" he said,  ""they court defeat not only for their  country but for themselves.""  In all of my experience in this House,  I know that when Congress wants to  enact legislation quickly, it can. Yes terday, when Ways and Means consid ered the latest extension of unemploy ment benefits, it took less than 15 min utes. But I also know that when Con gress wants to delay, it will.  The American people will not be de ceived. They are hurting,  they want  help, and they are looking to us.  There is no reason Congress cannot  enact the President's entire economic  program before March 20. I urge my fel low Members to act and act now.  HONESTY, PLEASE, MR.

73,Senate,102,-0.123,847,1,Mr. BREAUX.," Of course, that is the  whole  thrust of the bill of the chair man and the ranking minority mem ber-to regulate cable companies. I am  all for a degree of regulation. I think it  is  appropriate. But  the point about  Home Shopping Network not being able  to make it without must-carry, I ask  the Senator, the figures when we had  them before  the  committee  showed  that they had grown from net sales of  $160,000 in net sales in 1986 to nearly $1  billion  in net sales in 1990. They did  that without must-carry.  Before we  start  crying  for Home  Shopping Network not having must carry, they are doing very well. I think  the Senator would have to agree with  those kind of net sale figures. That is  without must-carry.  ",1992
74,Senate,102,0.196,847,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Of course  this  is  disputed in the article that I just read  from. I would simply say that it is an  abuse, in the opinion of this Senator. It  is an abuse for a cable operator to be  able to say we will accept a program  from our affiliate company, QVC, and  run that on our cable, and we will ex clude a competitor.  For those who believe, as I believe,  that competition  is  the  real answer,  not regulation, the point is we should  open  the door  for competition. And  under the present state of affairs, com petition can be precluded by the oper ation of the cable company.  It is not the intention of the sponsors  of this  legislation to regulate for  the  joy of regulation. That is not the in tent. As a matter of fact, under the law  that we have, the ability of a munici pality to regulate rates sunsets if there  is another multichannel provider.  Similarly, the whole reason for pro viding  in  the  legislation what is not  provided in the substitute, namely for  nondiscrimination in the case of verti cal integration, and the case of provid ing some limits on horizontal expansion by  cable companies-the whole  purpose of those provisions which are  in the bill and not in the substitute-is  to increase competition and to provide  for a vital competitive system.  Some people who claim that they are  taking  the  conservative position by  being against any and all regulation, it  seems  to me, myself,  therefore,  say  that what they are for is a competitive  marketplace. But if we end up passing  legislation  that does not further  the  cause  of a  competitive marketplace  and which has a severely stunted regu latory system such as in the proposed  substitute, they are asking for a sys tem which is simply a continuation of  the  status quo,  namely unregulated  monopoly.  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.  ",1992
75,Senate,102,0.213,847,1,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to point out that the letter  sent to me, also, I believe, says that a  subsidiary of TCI owns over 20 percent  of QVC. It is true, as my friend says,  that TCI does carry Home Shopping on  many of its affiliates. But the point is  wherever  they want  to control,  they  can  exercise  their monopoly  power.  They can, and they do.  I  think this is the significant point  that we must remember.  ",1992

There are  a  number of  things  going on. There is a significant amount  of work going on in the committees.  The gentleman has been in Congress  long enough to know that a lot of the  work at the beginning of the session is  in committees, and what will come to  the floor, I imagine, will be dependent  upon what the committees are able to  accomplish.  Of  course,  if  there  is  cooperation  from the gentleman's side as there has  been now on unemployment, we will be  able to move many items to the floor.  ",1992
82,House,102,-0.398,912,1,Mr. ANDREWS of Maine.," Mr. Speak er, we are about to engage in a debate  over  taxes and  tax  fairness  in  this  Chamber in 1992. We have heard a  lot  about how we might be able to effect  our Tax Code and improve our econ omy.  I hope when we get involved in those  discussions  that we  seek  to  restore  confidence  in our  tax system in our  Government.  Working  middle-class  taxpayers  across  this  country have  seen their incomes continue to decline  while their tax burden has continued to  rise.  The IRS reported just a few months  ago, however,  that hundreds of  tax payers with incomes of over $500,000 a  year paid no Federal income taxes last  year whatsoever, while  tens of thou sands of individuals with  incomes of  over $200,000 paid less than 15 percent  of their incomes in Federal taxes.  Mr. Speaker, we owe it to our tax payers to make certain that their tax  money  is spent wisely. We  also owe  them to make certain that their tax  money is spent fairly. We also owe it to  make certain  that  taxation  is based  upon fairness.  It is  time, Mr.  Speaker,  that we  make our tax system based on ability  to pay and not on ability  to exploit  loopholes. Let us establish tax fairness  for all Americans in 1992.  GENERAL LEAVE  ",1992

85,Senate,102,0.375,990,1,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, on Mon day, the Supreme Court upheld an im portant principle in our fight  to pro tect our children from the assault of  sexual obscenity.  Companies marketing  sexually  ex plicit  material  should  not  have  unhindered  access  to  our  children  through the telephone lines.  In refusing  to review Dial Informa tion Services Corporation of New York  versus Barr,  the Supreme Court has  given parents greater ability to protect  their homes and their childrens' envi ronment.  The  fundamental  principle  of  the  dial-a-porn  legislation which  I  coau thored with  the Senator from North  Carolina  is  this: Unless a household  specifically  requests  such  services,  companies have no right to invade our  households with pornography.  This is the same principle for which  the Senator from North Carolina fights  today.  In New York City, leased access cable  provides the following programming:  A program which news article de scribed as ""The Best Strip Joint  in  Town"".  X-rated previews of gay films.  One New Yorker wrote to his cable  provider, ""I want to bring to your at tention the homosexual program aired  last Friday night. Are you crazy? Be yond mere homosexual pornography,  this program  showed blatant  sexual  abuse and what could be classified as  rape. Have you no concern for the so cial, let alone moral, consequences of  such programming?''  It is no secret that early and sus tained exposure  to hard core pornog raphy can result in significant phys ical, psychological, and social damage  to a child.  In addition,  indiscriminate viewing  of pornography  is directly  linked  to  child victimization.  A recent report by the Los Angeles  Police Department states:  Members of the sexually exploited child  unit of the Los Angeles Police Department  have long known that pornography is often  employed by offenders in the extrafamilial  sexual  victimization  of  children.  In  the  unit's 14-year history, pornography has been  documented in case after case.  Dr. Rolf Zillman of Indiana Univer sity conducted a study of the effects of  pornography on college students. He  found that ""there can be no doubt that  pornography, as a  form of primarily  male entertainment, promotes the vic timization of women in particular."" He  documented a more  lenient view of  rape and bestiality among  those who  had greater exposure to pornography.  I firmly believe that every parent in  America has the right to protect his or  her children from the hard core pornog raphy which is now carried on the air waves.  The amendment offered by the Sen ator from North Carolina simply states  that cable companies shall block  the  material from entering homes, unless  that household has specifically con sented to receiving it.  Our homes and our children deserve  no less.  ",1992

87,Senate,102,-0.316,1003,1,Mr. GORE.," Madam President, I wish  to engage the distinguished chairman  of the Communications Subcommittee  in a brief colloquy regarding the access  to programming provisions of Section  640(a) of S. 12. That provision  is  in tended to prevent vertically-integrated  cable companies from locking up pro gramming, thereby denying alternative  multichannel video distributors, such  as DBS, C-Band, or wireless cable, the  ability to compete effectively. I want  to make certain, however,  that  this  language would not have  the  addi tional, undesirable effect of prohibiting  a new entrant into the video market place, such as a wireless cable company  or a  direct broadcast satellite com pany, which is not part of any verti cally  integrated media conglomerate  from entering into any type of lawful  contractual arrangement with a  pro grammer  for programming developed  for distribution over only one of these  alternative technologies. Am I correct  in my understanding that section 640(a)  is in fact targeted at the vertically in tegrated cable companies?  ",1992
88,Senate,102,-0.205,1029,1,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, last  year  I  introduced  a  resolution con gratulating President Ter-Petrossian  for becoming the first democratically  elected president of Armenia and urg ing President Bush to recognize Arme nia and extend to it full diplomatic re lations.  I am pleased  that President  Bush declared his intentions to estab lish diplomatic relations last Decem ber, and I hope that an exchange of am bassadors will  take place as soon as  possible.  Armenia  deserves  full  diplomatic  ties.  In February 1988,  the Armenian  people  led one of  the  first uprisings  against Communist authorities. This  revolt served as an inspiration for the  peoples of Central Europe later in the  year. Armenians have also elected one  of the most impressive leaders to have  emerged from the former Soviet Union  in  the  person  of  President  Ter Petrossian.  Under  President  Ter Petrossian, Armenia has established a  regime based on human rights and eco nomic reform.  I would now like to add a clause to  the original  resolution, which urges  the President to pursue all other politi cal  and  economic  opportunities  to  strengthen the special relationship be tween the United States and Armenia.  The Armenian people have undergone  major suffering in recent years. Five  hundred thousand Armenians lost their  homes in the earthquake on December  7, 1988. As if the earthquake was not  enough, a  second tragedy was visited  upon Armenians living in Azerbaijan,  who have been attacked by militant  Azeri nationalists. As many as 300,000  have been forced  to flee  to Armenia,  thereby adding to the economic depri vation there.  Finally, Azeris have been blocking  the rail, train, and gas lines to Arme nia. This has forced Armenians to at tempt to import goods  through Geor gia, although only modest amounts of  food and gas can be purchased in this  fashion. So while the Berlin Wall has  come down, another wall of ethnic in tolerance has been constructed around  Armenia. We must  increase our shipments of food, medicine, and clothing  to Armenians and intensify our diplo matic efforts to lift the blockade of Ar menia. This resolution, which I am in troducing  today with Senators DOLE,  SIMON, and SEYMOUR is intended to ex press  the Senate's desire  to  take  a  strong stand in support of Armenia.

89,Senate,102,0.219,1042,1,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, my  good friend, K.K. Bigelow, will retire  from  Martin Marietta-the  inter nationally renowned aerospace firm at the end of this month. I am proud to  have the opportunity today to pay trib ute to K.K. for his many achievements.  K.K. has represented Martin Marietta  in one capacity or another since he re tired from the U.S. Marine Corps. When  he first went to work for Martin Mari etta, he had already distinguished him self as a naval aviator with the corps  and had just completed a tour of duty  in  the Federal Republic of Germany.  His knowledge of Germany, its people,  customs, and  language, coupled with  the support of his lovely wife, Marilyn,  and their children, all but guaranteed a  successful  transition to a civilian career.  Back  then, Martin Marietta was a  much different company. Many of its  primary products were not high tech,  but rather materials-rock, gravel, ce ment, and so forth. Over the years the  company has undergone major change  and much growth. K.K. has been much  more  than a witness to these events.  He has played an instrumental role in  shaping  the nature and character of  the major corporation we know today.  As we all know, the relationship be tween government and industry is not  always  smooth.  Confrontations  can  occur that erode trust and confidence.  In all the years that K.K. has worked  in Washington, no one that I know of  has ever had cause  to question his  judgment  or  his  integrity. Martin  Marietta has been lucky to have some one as hard working and dedicated as  K.K. representing it in Washington. He  is the epitome of what a Washington  corporate representative should be.  K.K. is also a gentleman in the finest  sense of the word. He can always be re lied upon to keep a confidence, lend a  helping hand on difficult problems, and  present  his  concerns  in  a  straight forward and honest manner. Further more, he is an absolutely dedicated pa triot with an unshakeable love for our  great Nation.  At the end of this month, K.K. and  Marilyn will enter a new chapter  in  their lives. K.K. will retire from Martin  Marietta after 27 years of loyal and  dedicated service. Fortunately for Mar tin Marietta, K.K. has agreed to retain  a consulting relationship with the com pany.  For those of my colleagues who have  not had the pleasure of working with  K.K.  in  the past, you have missed a  class act-a truly great American.  I  hope  that you will cross paths with  him in the future. It has been an honor  for me to have worked with K.K. over  the years. Catherine and I count K.K.  and Marilyn among our dearest friends.  We wish the two of them all the best.   ",1992
90,,102,-0.225,1055,1,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, on Janu ary 21, 1992, Edward J. Liebman, an out standing public servant, will retire from the De partment of the Navy after serving the Nation  with distinction for 50 years. For nearly 30 of  those years, Mr. Liebman has given tirelessly  of himself in support of the military construc tion budget  for  the men and women of  the  Navy. During that time, his contributions have  been  invaluable to  the members and staff of  the Subcommittee on Military Installations and  Facilities and he will be deeply missed.  After graduating from Brooklyn College with  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  in  1941, Mr.  Liebman  began  his  career  in Government  service as an ensign in the navy. He reported  for duty to the Naval Office of Legislative Af fairs  in 1962, and upon  retiring  from active  duty in 1967, accepted a civilian position as a  legislative specialist.  During the past 30 years, Mr. Liebman has  been a principal player in presenting and sup porting successfully more  than $25 billion  in  Navy military construction projects authorized  by the Congress. A true professional, he has  cheerfully and patiently responded to congres sional  inquiries, and has provided countless  congressional delegations with a firsthand look  at the needs of the Navy shore establishment.  The success that the Navy has enjoyed over  the last three decades is in large measure due  to  Ed's  personal  integrity,  credibility,  and  knowledge.  Mr. Liebman's contributions have been duly  recognized within the Department of Defense  by his receipt of the highest civilian award, the  Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award.  Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere gratitude and  respect that I, on behalf of the members of the  Committee on Armed Services, recognize and  congratulate this fine gentleman on the occa sion of this retirement. He has served the Na tion well and we wish him, his  lovely wife,  Joan, his daughters Amy, Peggy, and Myra,  and his adorable grandchildren, the best of ev erything in his well-deserved retirement.  ASSESSING THE RISKS OF  SUPERFUND SITES  HON. DEAN A. GAllO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 30, 1992  ",1992
91,,102,0.203,1055,1,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  intro ducing  legislation requiring  the Federal Envi ronmental Protection Agency  to  perform a  comprehensive 1-year risk assessment of the  Nation's 1 ,245 Superfund sites so that we can  evaluate the risks to the public and the envi ronment, thereby enabling us all to better unEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  derstand the magnitude of the remaining risks  at these sites.  I have regularly toured the Superfund sites  in my congressional district since I was elect ed to Congress in 1984, and I know from first hand experience  that some of  these  sites  should be receiving more attention than is cur rently being given to the mitigation and clean up.  At least two Superfund sites in my district,  for instance, pose very real potential threats to  the Rockaway River, but these sites are not  among those that have received early mitiga tion under Superfund.  Efforts have been made to put this problem  into a national focus,  including articles written  the Newark Star-Ledger's award-winning envi ronmental writer Gordon Bishop.  When  the Superfund was created  in 1981,  our major priority was to identify specific sites  where potential threats could be identified.  In 1987, we reauthorized and expanded the  Superfund program, because we had discov ered that the problems were bigger and more  complicated than we thought in 1981. The No.  1 priority in 1987 was to get cleanups moving  at as many sites as possible.  The unintended side effect of that decision  was  to slow progress on  the most serious  sites, so  that the number of sites completed  would be increased.  I believe we must now take the third logical  step in the Superfund process-we must rec ognize that a number of serious problems re main unsolved and that we need to set prior ities for site cleanups, based on their potential  for hazard to our health and environment.  The leaders in this effort have been the or ganization Clean Sites, a not-for-profit organi zation  founded by a consortium of environ mental and industrial leaders, as well as sen ior government officials, in 1984 to help solve  the Nation's hazardous waste problem.  Clean Sites' President Thomas Grumbly put  it best,  in testimony before the House Public  Works and Transportation Committee last Oc tober, when he said:  ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND THE PACE  OF CLEANUP  Construction has been completed at only 63  sites, and we must step up that rate, if the  public is to give this program a real chance,  EPA's 30-Day Study called for  tripling the  number of site completions by 1993, mostly  by adding resources to pull sites out of the  construction pipeline. We applaud this ini tiative. Based on a quick analysis of  the  sites under consideration, we think the goal  is challenging but doable if the resources in  the 1992 budget as just approved are clearly  targeted and  the  regions are given clear  marching orders by the Administration.  EPA needs to go much farther. For several  years, it has concentrated on getting a lot of  balls in the air, but not to get them down.  The agency needs to think about the ""end of  the game"" at the beginning. As part of a site  objective-setting process, which  I will de scribe later, there needs to be explicit plans  for expending the resources necessary right  from ""listing""  through ""delisting"". At the  majority of priority sites, the objectives of  the cleanup itself are not clearly stated in  the Record of Decision, in which EPA out lines the method of cleanup required at each  site. Unless we are much more explicit with  ourselves and the public about what we are  trying to achieve at those sites, the public  1053  and the agency will never know when  the  health and environmental ""mark"" has been  achieved.  EPA may also need to establish a new reg ister of sites-after deletion from  the Na tional Priorities List, and visit them on a  regular basis once they have achieved their  objectives. Clearly, the agency needs to alter  its management systems to reward comple tions, as well as starts.  We do not think, however, that it is appro priate to use ""site completions"" as the only  measure  of hazardous waste  cleanup,  al though it is an important measure that the  public can readily deal with.  From  the professional community's per spective, most importantly, we must start  looking at risk reduction as a major indicator  of progress in Superfund overall and at indi vidual  sites. To make  this happen, EPA  needs to undertake an  immediate study of  the risks, both health and environmental,  that already have been remediated at haz ardous waste sites and an examination of re sidual risks. This information would give us  a different and equally important measure of  success as numbers of sites completed. It  also would provide an intellectual basis for a  useful discussion between the technical and  scientific communities and citizens on  the  gap in their understanding of risks posed by  sites.  Mr. Speaker, we need better information on  risks to keep the Superfund Program on track.  I ask my colleagues to join me as cosponsors  of  this  important  legislation  to  restore con fidence in this important program and keep the  important cleanups moving forward.

Through out history the city did not belong  to the Croats. It did not belong to the Serbs.  The city was able to maintain its independ ence from foreign domination since the cru saders marched on  the burial grounds of  Christ  to  liberate  it  from  the  ""infidels"".  Today Dubrovnik belongs to the world as a  historic monument.

93,Senate,102,0.135,1081,1,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be joined by Senators STE VENS,  KERRY, WIRTH,  DOLE,  BURNS,  SHELBY,  RUDMAN,  SIMPSON,  BREAUX,  and FOWLER  in offering  this amend ment.  The  amendment  is  narrowly  crafted  to  address genuine problems  that have arisen in the cable industry  and is intended to offer an alternative  to the more regulatory approach of S.  12. Recognizing that our ultimate goal  should  be  to  enhance,  not  reduce  consumer choice,  the amendment we  are proposing strives to build on  the  Cable Act by enhancing competition  and avoiding unnecessary regulation.  More  specifically,  our  amendment  seeks to achieve the following goals:  First, to build on the substantial suc cess of the Cable Act while addressing  current concerns about the cable indus try's conduct, and trends in the video  marketplace as a whole;  Second, to continue to encourage the  widest possible diversity of  informa tion sources and services to the public  in an efficient and effective manner;  Third, to further the interests of con sumers by enhancing competition  in  the video market by reducing the regu latory burden on the cable industry's  competitors, particularly the broadcast  television industry;  Fourth, to utilize, to the fullest ex tent possible, the expertise of the Fed eral Communications Commission  in  monitoring  ongoing  changes  in  the  video marketplace  and  determining  whether administrative or  legislative  action  is needed  to  respond  to such  changes; and  Fifth,  to avoid  imposing additional  regulation on the cable industry or any  other video programmer or video pro gramming distributor unless such regu lation is clearly necessary  to protect  the public interest.  The  prov1s10ns  of our  amendment  have been carefully drawn to try to en sure people's concerns are addressed  while avoiding stifling the cable indus try with unnecessary regulation. The  amendment also  tries  to  infuse com petition  into  the video marketplace.  For example, in order to enhance com petition, we propose:  First,  to  eliminate  certain  FCC  broadcast multiple  ownership  rules  that restrict the ability of broadcasters  to  take advantatge of economies of  scope and scale;  Second,  to expand  the rural excep tion to  the cable-telephone crossown ership prohibition to permit telephone  companies to provide cable service in  communities with up  to 10,000  resi dents;  Third, to prohibit unreasonable deni als of second franchises and guarantee  that second franchises be given at least  as much  time  to construct their sys tems as was given the initial franchise  recipient;  Fourth, to confirm the right of fran chising authorities to own and operate  cable systems in competition with pri vately owned systems;  Fifth,  to mandate  a  uniform  rate  structure throughout a system's fran chise area,  thereby preventing anti competitive price discrimination;  Sixth, to require the FCC to prepare  a biennial report regarding the level of  competition in the video marketplace.  While  the  principal  goal  of  our  amendment  is  to promote  the  long term  public  good  through  enhanced  competition, we have also recognized  the need for Federal and local officials  to  address  the  short-term  issues  of  rates  and  services.  Therefore,  our  amendment also includes several pro vi sions designed to allow for the respon sible exercise of Federal and local au thority over cable  television. Specifi cally, the amendment:  First, allows local officials  to regu late basic cable rates and the rates for  the installation or rental of equipment,  subject  to FCC oversight,  in  the ab sence of effective competition;  Second, defines effective competition  as  another multichannel  video  pro vider;  Third, repeals the guaranteed 5-per cent annual  rate  increase  to which  cable operators are now entitled;  Fourth, allows the FCC, in determin ing whether basic cable rates are rea sonable, to roll back existing rates;  Fifth, prohibits a cable operator from  charging subscribers who choose basic only cable service discriminatory  in stallation fees or rates for pay services;  Sixth, requires the FCC to adopt cus tomer service standards  to be  imple mented and enforced by local authori ties and allows States to establish cus tomer  service  standards  that exceed  the FCC's standards;  Seventh, requires the FCC  to estab lish new  technical standards designed  to enhance signal quality.

95,Senate,102,-0.332,1107,1,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I support  passage of S. 12,  the Cable  television  bill.  Cable television, in most cases, is a  monopoly  created  by  Government  which gives one selected company  in  each area the right to develop and op erate a cable system. Just as with local  telephone service companies, there are  real public benefits  that come  from  granting these monopolies. But, having  created these monopolies, Government  has a responsibility to assure that the  monopoly powers are not abused.  In the absence of competition, Gov ernment must act through regulations  to  assure  that  the  rates  charged  consumer  subscribers  are  reasonable  and that a high quality of service is  maintained.  In 1984, the Congress deregulated the  cable  television  industry,  largely  to  eliminate  some  forms  of  regulation  which were preventing the full develop ment of cable  systems  to  serve  the  American public.  It is now clear that the 1984 deregula tion went  too  far.  It has permitted  rapid growth in cable  television serv ices, but it has also permitted exces sive increases in rate charges to sub scribers, and has given  the consumer  almost no  recourse when  service  is  poor.  In my view, the legislation before us,  S. 12,  is a balanced effort  to  restore  reasonable  regulation needed  to pro tect cable television subscribers. I am  opposed  to excessive and unnecessary  Government regulation, but the regula tion that would be provided by this leg islation  is moderate and needed.  should  impose no hardships on  those  cable  television systems that operate  responsibly and with due regard for the  rights of their customers, and I would  emphasize  that there are many such  companies across the Nation and in my  own State of Rhode Island.  Action is needed to protect American  subscribers from those companies that  are  inclined  to abuse  the monopoly  power they have been granted. For that  reason, I support this legislation.  ",1992
96,Senate,102,-0.297,1107,1,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, today  I rise to speak in support of S. 12, the  Cable Television Consumer Protection  Act, a bill whose purpose is to promote  competition in the video marketplace  and  to protect cable customers  from  burdensome and onerous cable rate in creases. In 1984, when Congress deregu lated the cable industry, the intent was  to provide much needed competition in  this area. We  failed, and we now are  faced with an unregulated monopoly.  While S. 12  is not a perfect bill, it iJ  one that must be passed. We must not  stand by and allow monopolistic ten dencies to continue in this industry.  It  We must continue to pursue policies  that promote and enhance competition,  for it has been clearly documented that  costs contain  themselves when more  than one multichannel video provider  is available to consumers.  The specific provisions of S. 12 have  been outlined during this debate, and I  do not need  to go over  them again.  However, I would like to touch on a few  specific  points  important  to North  Carolina. S. 12 does provide protection  for rural consumers in my State, spe cifically through sections 640 and 641,  which require video programmers and  satellite carriers to provide access to  programming  at  nondiscriminatory  prices  to all multichannel video pro gramming distributors. These  include  cable companies, home satellite dish  distributors and others. Without objec tion, I will enter into the RECORD at  the  end  of my  remarks  a  letter  I  received  from  the  National  Rural  Telecommunications Cooperative  and  others.  There are other areas in this debate  that  the Congress must continue  to  monitor, and I would like to take an  opportunity to address these.  First, the issue we debated yesterday  while considering  the Breaux amend ment: The assurance that the public in terest  is  served  in  the  issuance  of  broadcast licenses by the Federal Com munications Commission.  I supported  the Breaux amendment yesterday  in  order  to send a message  to  the FCC  that the Congress remains committed  to the ideals embodied in the 1934 Com munications Act, namely the idea that  localism, programming diversity, and  serving the public interest must be a  necessary aspect of a  local broadcast  station. Twenty-one  to  22  hours  of  infomercials will not do. The Congress  must be  aggressive  in  its oversight  function, and we must ensure that our  broadcast spectrum is being protected.  I am pleased that the FCC has been di rected to study this issue.  The other issue that I find particu larly  troublesome  is  related  to hori zontal concentration and vertical inte gration in the video marketplace.  I am also pleased that S. 12 directs  the FCC  to undertake a study of this  issue and  to develop  rules  that will  deal with abuses it finds without de priving the public of the many benefits  derived  from  today's cornucopia  of  video  programming.  Thousands  of  pages of hearings  from  the  last  few  years  conclusively demonstrate  that  the cable  industry has become verti cally  integrated; cable operators and  cable  programs often  have  common  ownership.  In fact, 10 of the 15 most  popular basic cable networks are owned  or controlled by multisystem cable op erators. This has led some operators to  discriminate in favor of programming  in which they have an ownership inter est. This has directly harmed the abil ity of any potential competitors  to  ",1992

99,House,102,0.382,1172,1,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker, as a mem ber of the Select Committee on Narcot ics Abuse and Control, I welcomed last  week's release of the fourth national  drug control strategy, and  applaud  the leadership of President Bush and  Governor Martinez.  Under  this President, overall drug  use has dropped 13 percent, and adoles cent drug use has dropped 27 percent.  Drug use by high school seniors has  dropped  to its lowest  level since  the  senior survey began in 1975.  To ensure further success,  the new  strategy seeks a 6-percent increase in  antidrug funding, which amounts to a  93-percent increase since the President  took office.  Contrary to what some have alleged,  the strategy does not overemphasize  supply reduction. There are certain ac tivities which only the Federal Govern ment can undertake, such as helping  producer nations destroy drug crops,  patrolling our  international borders,  and  taking meaningful  steps against  money  laundering. This is where our  primary responsibilities lie.  Meanwhile,  the strategy  recognizes  the key role of State and local govern ments in drug control, places new em phasis on  the problems of hard-core  drug usage, and undertakes new initia tives to combat teenage drinking. This  is a truly comprehensive package. Let  us enact its legislative elements this  year.  MOVE FORWARD WITH  PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC PROGRAM  (Mr. THOMAS of Wyoming asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1992
100,House,102,0.446,1172,1,Mr. THOMAS of Wyoming.," Mr.  Speaker, I have been in Wyoming near ly constantly since the first part of De cember: People are saying that if there  is  a  role  for  the Government  to  strengthen the economy, let us get on  with  it. This  is a  joint Government.  This is the President. This is the Con gress.  Some of us have been interested in  having a package since November when  we brought one.  The majority party says no,  they  have not had a chance to read it. Let us  wait.  Then they said, no, let us hear what  the President has to say. Let us wait.  Now  the President has laid out his  package. The majority party has been  busy criticizing the President's pack age and they say let us wait.  Now, Mr. Speaker, we have been here  for 3 weeks. The leadership has now to  give leadership. Instead of listening to  Ann Richards' little quips, we ought to  move  forward doing something about  an economic package.  Let us not  let partisan bickering  keep us from doing what we need to be  doing.  Mr. Speaker, it is time that if the  majority does not like the President's  package, they need to say so, but let us  move forward, let us not wait.  0 1210  AMERICA'S VETERANS HAVE LONG  MEMORIES  (Mr. APPLEGATE  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1992
101,House,102,-0.106,1172,1,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker, once  again the administration has failed to  keep its promise to the American vet erans.  Congress, in the 1990 budget, delayed  by 1 month a COLA to its service-con nected disabled American veterans to  be paid on February 1 of 1992. That date  came, and that date went, and there is  no COLA.  I am told by the Veterans' Adminis tration  that  they will not get it in  March and it is only a possibility that  they will get it in April.  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Sub committee on Disability Compensation  of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  I am demanding that the administra tion pay that money  to the disabled  veterans now.  Mr. Speaker, I remind the President  of  the United States  that American  veterans have a  long memory, and so  do  all Americans who  respect what  American veterans have done  to earn  it.  HOUSE SHOULD  INVESTIGATE SE RIOUS  PROBLEMS  WITH  THE  HOUSE POST OFFICE  (Mr. ROBERTS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1992
102,House,102,0.415,1172,1,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. Speaker, over the  last  several  days Members  of  this  Chamber have been aghast at a con tinuing series of news reports regard ing serious problems with  the House  Post Office. The charges include drug  trafficking by staff, embezzlement, and  theft of postal funds. There are allega tions of a slush fund used to provide in terest-free  loans  to Post Office staff  and even Members and  to cover bad  checks.  These charges are serious. They re flect both on this institution's credibil ity and on our ability to carry out our  normal business on behalf of our con stituents.  I am most concerned, Mr.  Speaker, at allegations that some staff  and  even  some Members may have  known about  these problems for sev eral months, yet failed to bring them  to  the attention of committees and  subcommittees of jurisdiction. My own  Personal and Police Subcommittee of  the House Administration Committee,  for example, has never been informed  about these problems. It was only after  reading news accounts of the problems  that we asked for a briefing from post al inspectors.  This morning's Washington Times  made  further  allegations  that  some  staff knew  about  the  problems but  failed to act.  The importance of this mess cannot  be overestimated. There  is a need to  act decisively and quickly  to ensure  that,  first,  any criminal activity  is  prosecuted to the full extent of the law  and, second, that management changes  are made to prevent such a mess in the  future.  Today,  I  urge  that  the  following  steps be taken by the House leadership  with full cooperation and assistance of  the minority:  Appointment of an independent coun sel, with adequate funding and staff, to  investigate  these charges and  report  back to the House.  The U.S. Postal Service be given im mediate  control  over  money  and  stamps at the House of Representatives  facility and that all managers and su pervisors involved be suspended pend ing the independent review.  With completion of the independent  counsel's  review,  a  bipartisan  task  force should be created to address the  longterm  difficulties/structural  inad equacies  found by counsel's inquiry.  Steps should be taken to fully address  the issues raised.  WE NEED TO CREATE MORE JOBS:  AMERICANS ARE NOT LAZY  (Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1992
103,House,102,-0.378,1172,1,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  tomorrow we will take up extension of  benefits for long-term unemployed. Un like last year,  this bill will have  the  President's support.  Why two vetoes last year and support  this year? The answer is in the various  press reports. The President's advisers  told him  that  this was an election  year, it was too risky to oppose exten sion of unemployment benefits.  We welcome the President's support,  but it is important he do more  than  put his finger to the political wind. The  American economy is sick. People are  laid off from all walks of life. They  want more  than gimmicks as an an swer. They want more than proposals  to cut taxes for the rich in the hope it  will  trickle  down  to middle-income  groups.  In Michigan we see the results. The  results are  that employers are facing  extra taxes to replenish the unemploy ment  fund.  Senator CARL  LEVIN  of  Michigan has proposed a way to cush ion the blow for these employers. With  the support of Chairman ROSTENKOW SKI, we were able in the committee to  insert that cushion in the bill coming  before the House tomorrow.  ",1992

The  focus of  the ministry  is  to  foster  the  human dignity of the  farmworkers  in central  Florida, the rural poor, and their families. The  Catholic Diocese of Orlando led the charge to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  establish  the Office of Farmworker Ministry  and it is through their dedication and commit ment  that  the Office of Farmworker Ministry  serves its vital role in our community. In addi tion,  the Office of Farmworker Ministry seeks  to empower workers to become self-sufficient,  to obtain personal and comprehensive health  services, and  to  improve  their quality of life.  Finally, the Office of Farmworker Ministry has  helped low-income people purchase homes. It  has also sought to increase their financial re sponsibility by organizing a credit union.  Mr. Speaker, since  its  inception, the Office  of Farmworker Ministry has provided com prehensive medical and dental care  to more  than 25,000 patients.  It provides critical serv ices  to  the  farmworkers of central Florida.  I  proudly join in this celebration with the Sisters  of  Notre  Dame  de  Namur,  Sisters  Ann  Kendrick, Cathy Gorman, and Gail Grimes,  and congratulate them on the first 20 years of  the Office of Farmworker Ministry.  A TRIBUTE TO SILVERADO SKIES  ART GALLERY  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 3, 1992  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to recognize the Silverado Skies art gal lery, which art fosters the spirit of American In dians and the old Southwest. Roberta Backus  Turner and her husband Lawrence Turner re cently opened the gallery  in The Falls shop ping center in south Florida because of their  passion for the Southwest. In a Miami Herald  article entitled, ""Art Dealers Offer a Taste of  U.S. Southwest,"" Anthony Faiola  reports on  walls and halls of Silverado Skies:  The spirit of American Indians and the old  Southwest  fill  the  walls  and  halls  of  Silverado Skies art gallery at The Falls  shopping center.  The gallery, at 8888 SW 136th St., opened  last month. It offers sculptures, paintings,  prints and jewelry in the rich folklore of In dian tribes of the American West.  The owners-Roberta Backus Turner and  her  husband,  Lawrence Turner-do  their  buying wholesale from artists based mainly  in New Mexico and Arizona to offer the origi nal works at prices not above what one  would pay  to buy  from  the artists  them selves.  Still, with artworks ranging in price from  to $30,000,  the couple expect most of  their customers to be true collectors.  ""Mostly, I expect the serious collectors,""  said Lawrence Turner, who runs an environ mental consulting company. ""We don't sell  inexpensive pieces. We have no posters or  anything  like  that. Our customer will be  someone who knows about art and is looking  for Southwestern works.""  The name Silverado Skies is a whimsical  combination derived from  two loves of the  owners: Silverado wines and the sky of Santa  Fe. They visit the city twice a year and al ways in August for the city's Indian Market  arts festival, where they buy for  their pri vate collection and now for their gallery.  ""I believe in another life I must have been  an Indian,"" said Roberta Turner, who runs  an advertising and marketing firm. ""Indian  art represents the very basic beliefs of re$600  February 3, 1992  spect for animals, nature and the spirits. It's  everything that's important in life.""  The gallery ran its first art show Thursday  through Saturday,  exhibiting works  from  Santa Fe artist Star Liana York.  Many of York's works, featuring sculpture  of American Indians and other people from  the West, are inspired from real people she  has met during her seven years in Santa Fe,  where she moved to after growing up in sub urban Washington, D.C.  One work, depicting two rugged cowgirls.  came out of a meeting with a 90-year-old  New Mexican woman rancher. Another, Med icine Woman, was inspired by a woman York  met while attending an  Indian  ceremony  ushering a girl to womanhood.  I am pleased to recognize Silverado Skies  and  the  owners,  Lawrence  and  Roberta  Backus Turner, and I would like to wish them  much success with the progress of the gallery.  NATIONAL PRAYER VIGIL WEEK  IN MARYLAND  HON. CONSTANCE A. MORELLA  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 3, 1992  ",1992
112,,102,-0.018,1224,1,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Speaker,  the break down of the American family is a concern with  personal, as well as, national  ramifications.  National Prayer Vigil Week provides an oppor tunity  for us to join together to reflect on the  important role of the family and to search for  the means to strengthen our own families and  those of our fellow Americans.  I commend American Mothers,  Inc., and  Janet Umhau, Maryland Mother of the Year,  for their efforts on behalf of American families.  I am also proud of  the State of Maryland,  under the leadership of Governor Schaefer, for  holding a vigil  in Maryland during  the  first  week in February. Maryland's proclamation  is  as follows:  Whereas, throughout the annals of Amer ican history, national days of prayer and  prayer vigils have been celebrated-as our  Continental Congress first established a day  to pray for  this country and its people  in  1775; and  Whereas, history also  tells us  that our  colonists shared in fasting, repentance and  prayer to seek guidance for the future and  prosperity for a burgeoning and blossoming  nation; and  Whereas,  Maryland,  the  great  ""Free  State,"" remains proud of our vibrant tradi tions of religious freedom * * * and we are  equally proud of the valuable  roles which  Maryland mothers have played in strength ening the moral and spiritual foundations of  the family and home; and  Maryland is pleased to join with American  Mothers, Inc. in pausing to reflect upon the  tremendous importance of healthy mothers  and  children  to  the  future  of America  through this special annual National Prayer  Vigil, as everyone participating strives  to  further nurture or rediscover the joy and se curity essential in our daily lives.  Now,  therefore, I, William Schaefer, Gov ernor of the State of Maryland, do hereby  proclaim  February ~. 1992  as National  Prayer Vigil Week in Maryland, and do com mend this observance to all of our citizens.

113,House,102,-0.044,1237,1,Mr. GREEN of New York.," Mr. Speak er, while  reviewing  the President's  budget for 1993,  I was shocked to see  that  the State Department has pro posed eliminating a provision of cur rent law that prohibits the State De partment  from  complying with  the  Arab boycott of Israel. The State De partment  is proposing  to delete  the  ""Prohibition on contracts with firms  complying with Arab League boycott  of Israel or discriminating on basis of  religion,"" and also the ""Prohibition on  issuance of passports for travel to Israel only.""  This message from the State Depart ment could not do more to sanction the  Arab boycott of  Israel  if  the Arab  League had written it itself, and I am  committed to ensuring that the State  Department position does not prevail.  What this says is that the State De partment thinks it is OK to do business  with firms that comply with the Arab  boycott of Israel. Also,  the State De partment is implying that we should  play along with the Arab countries' de nial of entry to anyone with an Israel  stamp on their passport.  Since  the end of  the Persian Gulf  conflict,  the Arab League's central  boycott office in Damascus has added  more  than 100 new companies  to  its  blacklist because of their alleged busi ness associations with Israel, while re moving only 10. If anything, the State  Department should be insisting on an  end  to  the Arab League's economic  boycott of Israel. Instead it has prac tically signed on as a supporter of it.  This is rotten diplomacy in the middle  of the peace talks.  A COMMONSENSE DOMESTIC  ENERGY POLICY IS NEEDED  (Mr. TAUZIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1992
114,House,102,0.03,1237,1,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to predict war. Only 1 short year  since our successful defense of Middle  East oilfields, America  is more  and  more dependent upon  those same oil fields-and, thus, more and more likely  to militarily defend them again when  that becomes necessary-as it surely  will.  On Monday, it was reported that the  United States active  rig count-the  measure of our domestic drilling activ ity-has sunk to the lowest number on  record. On Monday, only 653 drilling  rigs were active-down from 4,530 ac tive rigs in 1981. For Louisiana that has  meant  depression  and  despair.  For  America it means we are hostage again  to foreign oil.  Today one-third of all the world's oil  tankers come to America. Today, two thirds of our trade deficit goes to for eign oil. Soon Americans will  spend  $135 billion per year on oil imports three times the cost of Desert Storm.  Today, as we debate the unemployment  benefit extensions, our jobs continue to  leave for foreign oilfields. Our dollars  go there too, and with them our inde pendence and economic well-being.  How long before we send more Amer ican young lives to die in desert sand?  How long before we wake up and end  this now rapid destruction of our do mestic energy capacity. How long must  we wait for a commonsense domestic  energy policy?

",1992
115,House,102,-0.45,1237,1,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Speaker, George  Bush promised Americans 30 million  new jobs. Since he has been President,  we have lost 300,000 good jobs, and he  still has no jobs plan. So what does he  do? He blames Congress.  Well, if it was not for the Democrats,  George Bush would still be playing golf  in some far-off nation.  He  called our  first  unemployment  compensation bill garbage. His admin istration called  the  recession no big  deal.  Well, it is not a big deal to George  Bush's millionaire  friends, who have  seen their income increase 90 percent  in the past 10 years while the middle  class struggles.  Where is the strategy for the defense  workers and all our workers? They are  frightened, and they should be, because  when our President had a chance  to  present his strategy, he had no strat egy.  He called his plan Operation Domes tic Storm. I call it Operation Domestic  Sprinkle, because he  sprinkles  elec tion-year promises all around.  In California we have lost 500,000 jobs  in the last 18 months. One million peo ple are out of work. Sprinkle down will  not do it. We need to take care of our  own, and we need to do it now.

The brutality in Burma is reaching  new levels of horror and outrage.  The  totalitarians  in Rangoon have  gone berserk. Gens.

Especially disturbing are reports of  Red Chinese advisers among the Bur mese troops. The same regime that our  Government chose  to have high-level  meetings with last week.  On the other side of the country, Bur mese Muslims are being murdered and  brutalized. The twisted and xenophobic  Burmese thugs are pursuing a religious  purification  campaign  against  non Buddhists. Next to be persecuted may  be what  is left of Burma's Christian  community.  It's time  to quarantine  this outlaw  regime. As we honor Aung San Suu Kyi  ",1992
117,House,102,-0.577,1250,1,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  strong support of H.R. 4095, a bill to increase  the number of weeks of emergency unemploy ment benefits compensation. I asked to be an  original cosponsor of this  legislation, as well  as the previous bills which this House passed,  and  I applaud President Bush  for his new found concern for the unemployed workers of  our country.  It's about  time George Bush  realized  that  the workers of western Massachusetts, and of  this Nation, have been hurting through no fault  of their own. The working people of America  did not get the huge tax breaks of the 1980's  which  sent our budget deficit soaring and  weakened  our  economy,  and  it  certainly  wasn't the unemployed workers in my district  who sat on their hands while savings and loan  executives  treated  deposits  like monopoly  money-building useless overpriced hotels ev erywhere.  What is more,  these are not lazy,  illiterate  workers. The people  I hear  from  in western  Massachusetts are highly  trained and edu cated-blueand white-collar workers-who  desperately want to work but simply have not  been able to find jobs in the current recession.  I only wish that we could be sure the Presi dent is not just experiencing an election year,  or a New Hampshire primary season, conver sion. I suggest that those who have any doubt  about his real  intentions should read the fine  print.  In his budget, President Bush proposes to  eliminate  trade adjustment assistance, which  provides benefits to workers who have been  laid off because of  increased  imports of for eign goods. Even as he negotiates  the  free  trade agreement with Mexico, even as he pro fesses  to care  for  the unemployed workers,  President Bush  is  trying  to  remove another  support for people trying to stay afloat in our  economy.  Mr. Speaker, I think we have a responsibility  to help these people. And  instead of  trying,  like George Bush, to eliminate assistance for  displaced workers, I plan to find ways to make  it easier for our workers to get the increased  skills and education  they need  to  find new  jobs.  People in my district, like people across the  country,  need  unemployment  benefits  and  more jobs.

118,House,102,-0.421,1250,1,Mr. PASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, once again we  are  faced with  legislation  to provide relief to  hundreds of thousands of people who are job less in our country.  At  the national  level,  the economic  reces sion is unsettling. The pace of recovery from  our economic ills is slower than past economic  cycles due to slumps in real estate,  financial  services, and spending in the Federal, State,  and local sectors of the .economy.  Unemployment  in December  rose  to  7.1  percent, with 8.9 million  individuals officially  counted as unemployed and nearly 1 .5 million  of those workers having been out of work for  ",1992
119,House,102,-0.569,1289,1,Mr. OWENS of New York.," I thank the  gentleman from New Jersey for his re marks.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from New York [Mr. SERRANO].  ",1992
120,House,102,-0.491,1289,1,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I simply want to  join  the gentleman  from New York  [Mr.  OWENS], the gentleman from New York  [Mr. RANGELL],  and other colleagues,  because I believe that this is the kind  of an  issue where no one  should be  quiet, whether it is a private citizen  writing a  letter, whether it is a  tele phone  call  as  the  gentleman  from  Texas [Mr. WASHINGTON] has suggested,  a telephone call to a Representative, or  whether it is doing it the way we are  doing  it here on  the  floor. No  one  should keep quiet when the real integ rity of this country I believe is at ques tion.  Mr. Speaker, every day we hear Mem bers get up here at this same podium  and speak about how great it is to live  in this country and how great it is to  see the rest of the world going out of  their way in life-risking circumstances  to be more like us.  Even those of us who stand up here  and claim that all is not well under stand that this is a wonderful country  and the world is trying to change to be  like us.  But I  think  in  the process we  run  into a danger. The danger is that if we  are not true to ourselves, if we are not  true to our own ideals, then we run the  risk of speaking out of both sides of  our mouths and eventually losing all  the  good will  that we  either won  through military action in the gulf or  by simply behaving over  the  last 40  years as people who defended peace and  democracy and justice.  And so when we look at the Haitian  situation, I  think it is really, if you  will pardon the expression, larger than  Haiti. It is us. We are in those boats.  We are at risk,  just like  the Haitian  people are. Because if at this moment  in our history, after saying all  the  wonderful things we said about Europeans just a year or two ago who were  hurting,  in danger of being  slaugh tered, who are in danger now of civil  strife, if we said all the things that we  said in favor of their defense and their  freedom and  their dignity, and  then  turn around and push, physically push  out of our borders, people who every one can see are hurting, people who tell  you either in broken English, in perfect  English, or in their own language, that  if they go back they run the risk of  being killed, and yet we say there is no  proof that they will, we have never had  any proof that anyone is going to be  killed all over the world.  Yet we have committed people, com mitted resources, committed the soul  of  this  country  in many  instances  throughout  the world, understanding  that, well, dangers existed.  Every  time  I  see  a Haitian being  given $15 and put on a bus to eventu ally get on a boat to return to Haiti I  feel bad for them, but I feel worse for  us. Because we cannot continue to lie  to ourselves. That is what we are doing  at this point in our history~  This moment, it seems to me,  is a  crucial moment. Everyone has said it  and will keep saying it because it is  wonderful, the world has changed, and  we are  the ones  that are being  imi tated. And what do we do? Well, we  have a war, and that war is supposed to  be part of the new world order.  And then the first instance, interest ingly enough, ironic enough,  the first  instance we have to show a new world  compassion, which is part of that world  order, we  say ""You are not allowed  here. You are not allowed here because  you are not here for political reasons,  you are here for economic reasons.""  As the gentleman from New York has  well stated on so many occasions in the  well of  this House, during  the  time  that the dream of democracy and possi bility of democracy existed  in Haiti,  people were not running to this coun try. Now,  the poverty was  the same.  President Aristide,  as much  as  he  promised he would  in his presidency  and  administration,  did  not  have  enough time to make a change in the  economy of their country. Yet people  did not run here. Why? Because  the  thought of democracy, the thought of  freedom,  the  through of a better  to morrow, kept them at home. So  they  are obviously here for political reasons.  What do we do? We say we have  to  figure our a different way to deal with  you.  In addition to this, as the gentleman  well knows, it creates for us right here  in our own communities, communities  like the ones that we represent, fric tion. We have one island in the Carib bean where nobody wants to come or is  allowed to come. Then we have another  island in the Caribbean where if you  want to come, you cannot come.  Now,  the President,  the administra tion and the Supreme Court, does not  have to go to 138th Street in the Bronx  and deal with the fact there are mem bers of two communities saying, ""Mr.  Congressman, how come he can stay  and I can't stay?""  There  is no  answer,  because  they  both should stay. They are both run ning away  from a  situation that we  condemn, that we say should not exist.  So as the gentleman from Texas sug gested, perhaps it is not within a single  group's power, be it this Congress, be it  someone  else,  to  change  this. But  maybe, just maybe, this is one of those  occasions where  the American people  set foreign policy before government  does. Maybe  this  is  the  time where  American people  stand up and  say,  ""My God, I can see by the look on the  faces of these people that the Haitians  are not here on a vacation. They are  here  to escape  some  thug,""  inciden tally, as has been said in this well, that  we trained militarily, who is going to  kill them.  People do not go back to their coun try and get fingerprinted because they  think it is some guy from Harlem who  just came back from Haiti. This is not  the reason they are fingerprinted. They  are  being  fingerprinted  to  keep  a  record of who dared defy  the govern ment and  leave and make comments  against the government.  0 1640  I would not want to be in their shoes,  but we are. Our soul is in their shoes  because the world is looking at us and,  again, the first chance we get at prov ing that we are the leaders of this new  world order, we  show new vision by  sending people back.  Let us all join together not only in  this House but  let us  join  together  throughout this country, stand up for  what is right and say, ""They are our  brothers and sisters and  they should  stay here with us until we can solve  the situation.""

The policies designed  to  restore constitu tional order  in Haiti must be  reviewed and  their focus must be sharpened.

I say to the major ity leader this is certainly not the plan  of the Senator from Wyoming, having  worked 15 years to get an energy bill to  the point where we can debate it on the  floor. But there are negotiations and  there are things going on which may in  the long run, and I trust they will, save  us some time.  In the meantime, Senator JOHNSTON  and I have suggested  to a couple of  Senators whose amendments we know  of and have been cleared,  that they  send their amendments to the desk and  debate them. But we can take no ac tion on them nor can they be received  from the bill. At least the debate would  be accomplished. We would, I hope and  trust, save a little time by that action.

This agreement  will provide needed help for workers  who have exhausted  their unemploy ment benefits during the current reces sion. I commend all parties for their ef forts and I hope that this legislation  will be the first of a series of bipartisan  agreements to shift our budget prior ities and meet urgent needs at home.  We must continue to work together to  address  the  long-neglected  problems  which have resulted in the loss of jobs  and income decline that threaten the  living standards of our American work  force.  As a result of S. 2173, approximately  5,000 of the 25,000 unemployed workers  in Louisiana now receiving emergency  unemployment compensation will ben efit from the immediate 13-week exten sion. Also, other workers who are ex pected to exhaust their benefits after  June 13 will be eligible  for extended  and much needed benefits through July  4.  Not only in Louisiana, but in every  State a growing number of workers are  exhausting their benefits without find ing suitable employment. This legisla tion will equally assist all States and  is consistent with the Budget Enforce ment Act. It will provide all States 13  additional  weeks  of  unemployment  compensation and. extend the duration  of the current emergency benefit pro gram approved by Congress last year  from June 13 to July 4, 1992.  While  I am pleased with  the  tem porary relief this measure will provide  to so many unemployed Americans, I  also  hope  that we will  act  expedi tiously to develop measures to provide  jobs for the unemployed and permanent  income stability  for  them and  their  families.

CARDISS COWNS  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 4, 1992  ",1992
126,,102,-0.552,1419,1,Mrs. COLLINS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  the  bill we are  introducing  today,  the Trade En hancement Act of 1992, will accomplish what  President Bush tried but failed to do on his re cent trip to Japan. Rather than attempting to  cajole Japan  into buying a few more Amer ican-made automobiles and auto parts,  this  legislation says Japan must either find a way  on  its own  to substantially reduce our huge  trade deficit with Japan in each of the next 5  years, or we will reduce the deficit for them by  strictly  limiting what  they can bring  into our  country.  The future health of our economy cannot be  based on vague commitments made between  President Bush and various Japanese Govern ment officials. Since the President's return, the  pitfalls of relying on such understandings have  become clear. Japan's Prime Minister and the  head of Toyota now say that the agreement to  purchase additional American autos and auto  parts was not at all a commitment as Presi dent Bush described  it.  Instead,  the agree ment simply identified targets that Japan said  it would work toward. And this week, the head  of the Japanese Diet was quoted as saying  that  the United States  is now nothing more  than Japan's subcontractor.  .  It should, therefore, be clear that even the  best  intentions of President Bush and  the  leaders  of Japan  cannot  be  expected  to  change our persistent and unfair trade imbal1417  ance with Japan. Japan will always postpone  taking the action needed, because it benefits  tremendously from the current situation.  We must take charge of our own economic  destiny and be willing to say to Japan that the  ""free ride"" in trade is now over; if Japan wants  to trade with us they may only do so if we are  allowed to trade with them in the same open,  unfair way.  If President Bush is not willing to  put this message to the Japanese in clear, en forceable terms, then the Congress must do it  for him.  The Trade Enhancement Act focuses on the  United  States-Japan  trade  relationship  in  autos and auto parts. Three quarters of our  overall trade deficit with Japan is in autos and  auto parts. Over the last 1 0 years, the United  States has accumulated  trade deficits with  Japan that total $400 billion. In 1990, the Unit ed States trade deficit with Japan was still $41  billion.  Not only is the auto industry the single most  important element of our trade problem with  Japan, but it also accounts for a huge share  of the Nation's economy. Four and a half per cent of the gross national product is directly  attributable to the auto industry; when indirect  economic activity is also considered, the auto  industry accounts  for  121!2 percent of  the  gross national product.  This key American industry has been hit by  repeated assaults of Japanese manufacturers  that have been engaging in unfair trade prac tices. Today, American manufactured autos  account for less than half of retail auto sales.  Yet  in Japan, all  foreign manufacturers ac count  for only 3 percent of their market and  American manufacturers account for less than  1 percent.  The United International Trade Commission  and Commerce Department have already de termined  that Japan auto manufacturers are  not operating according to  fair trade and fair  market principles. We  really,  therefore, have  only two choices: Let our auto industry die, or  impose conditions on  the terms under which  Japan may operate in our market.  The cosponsors of  this  legislation strongly  believe that we cannot afford to let the Amer ican auto  industry die.  If Japan does not re duce  its huge and unjustified  trade surplus  with us in the immediate future, restrictions on  Japanese auto exports  to  the United States  will reduce the surplus for them.  Putting aside  the  issue of whole vehicles,  our auto parts  industry is  fully competitive  in  quality and price with Japan's auto manufac turing  facilities  located here  in  the United  States. But they don't. Of the $31 billion auto  trade deficit with Japan last year, over $10 bil lion is attributable to auto parts, most of which  are imported into the United States by Japan  to supply their auto plants here. Studies have  shown that in just the next few years, that $10  billion parts deficit with Japan will more  than  double. Clearly, Japanese auto manufacturers  ought to buy more American-made auto parts  for their auto plants here in our country.  Japan's keiretsu system, instead, is used to  develop a base of dedicated  suppliers on  which Japan's auto manufacturers almost ex clusively rely. Breaking into this supplier base  has become a virtually  impossible  task  for  American and other foreign auto parts manu facturers. In addition, Japan has protected its  ",1992
127,House,102,-0.186,4,6,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  join my colleague  from  the  First District  in congratulating  the  Kentucky Wildcats for a job well done  and for playing one of the great basket ball games of all time.  Mr. Speaker, the senior Senator from  Missouri from the other body made a  speech  last Thursday on  the Senate  floor which has received wide notice,  and deservedly, because it is a very im portant statement about  the current  state of congressional affairs. I would  urge all my colleagues to read it. It is  reprinted  in  Sunday's Washington  Post.  The Senator makes two, I think, very  important points. One is that the tend ency on the part of the Congress is to  put off the tough issues, to delay tak ing up politically sensitive issues, con troversial  issues. We  temporize. We  avoid and sometimes neglect those is sues.  We are too much concerned about our  own reelections and our own fate and  too little concerned about what is ab solutely necessary for the betterment  of the people.  The second point the Senator makes  is related to the first, and that is in  order  to  justify putting off these  is sues, we have to somehow convince the  American people that they can have it  both ways, that there is such a thing as  a free lunch, that you do not have to  pay the bill, and that, of course, is not  true.  So, Mr. Speaker,  I would urge my  colleagues to read what the senior Sen ator from Missouri has said. It makes a  lot of sense. We can all gain from that  and make better law for the people of  this great Nation.

IKE SKELTON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 30, 1992  ",1992

This year nearly 150,000 secondary school  students participated in the contest competing  for 22 national scholarships totaling $76,500,  which was distributed among the top 22 win ners.  Missouri's winner was 17-year-old Rebecca  Rae Peabody of Harrisonville.  Enclosed  herewith  is  a  copy  of Ms.  Peabody's script entitled ""Meeting America's  Challenge.""  MEETING AMERICA'S CHALLENGE  (By Rebecca R. Peabody)  Meeting America's Challenge: This is, per haps the paragon of Democratic ideals, the  ultimate goal of the collective American, the  vision that our founding fathers saw in their  mind's eye when they were first drafting our  Constitution. But what exactly is America's  Challenge? Is there one specific goal which  we must attain, one  level of achievement  that must be reached before America's Chal lenge has, in truth been met? Will there be a  time somewhere in the future when we can  sit back, take a long look at ourselves, our  lives, our government, and realize in all hon esty that we have met and solved every prob lem? That we have diagnosed and cured all  the  ills of society? That we have,  in fact,  reached a point at which there is no further  improvement to be made?  The answer is no. No for one very simple  reason. America is comprised of a vastly di verse,  constantly  growing  and  changing  group of individuals. These individuals mold  and shape America  into what it is  today  through the constant contribution of their  fears, hopes, dreams, desires and opinions.  Because of the integral role  the individual  has in shaping our country, America is and  will continue to be, in and of itself a multi faceted, growing changing entity. For this  entity, perfection is not the ultimate goal.  The ultimate goal is the ever-present strug gle for perfection.  March 30, 1992  Without  the constant reexamination and  reevaluation of our society by the American  people, our government would cease to grow  and improve. It would become stagnant and  unchanging. it is for this reason that Meet ing America's Challenge  does  not mean  achieving  perfection,  but  instead means  maintaining the constant pursuit of perfec tion, which is an inherent quality of human  nature.  To better explain  this  interpretation of  The Challenge Facing America, I would like  to offer  the following denotative and con notative definitions of the word Challenge.  Webster's third New International Diction ary displayed 16 separate meanings. My per sonal  favorite was  the entry which  read  ""Challenge: To arouse new ideas, new inter est, to stimulate or excite."" The commonly  accepted connotative meaning of the word  ""Challenge"" is the need to overcome an ob stacle, to achieve a goal, to try something  new that tests the boundaries of what is safe  or common.  These two definitions combine to inspire a  composite understanding of what a Chal lenge  is,  and how  it  relates  to America  today. We, as individuals, and collectively as  a country,  face a multitude of challenges  every day. Our ingenuity is tested and re tested, our dedication to our land and to our  country  is constantly under question. But  these challenges aren't problems to be tack led, they are simply the natural result of our  continuing expansion outward. As Ameri cans, we are constantly testing our bound aries, pushing against our limits, exploring  and inventing at a rate which is astonishing  for the rest of the world to watch. It is this  propensity to strive for adventure,  to push  for change and improvement that makes us  who we are. It is also this same quality that  has, over the last 200 years, made America  the most sought after country in which to  live. It is this property, in fact, which de fines the very essence of America and what  is stands for.  We have made our country what it is today  through the inexhaustive efforts of ourselves  and of those who came before us. Now, as our  country grows older and more mature, and  begins to settle comfortably into its role as  ""The Best and The Brightest"" in the world,  we must openly and honestly meet America's  Challenge. We must not, in our security and  successfulness, allow ourselves to lose that  impassioned drive to succeed,  that need to  invent and explore, the need to continue at taining the unattainable, to push beyond the  outer boundaries of what we know as safe  and understood.  Long ago, our forefathers had a dream for  a Democratic America, and today, 200 years  later, we stand as a living monument to that  dream, a dream which was fostered by their  creativity, persistence, preservation, and a  need to succeed, to advance, to press on de spite  the obstacles. This  is  the attitude  which has made America what is it today. In  order to meet our challenge,  . . .  to meet  America's Challenge, we must preserve this  attitude, strengthen it, make it an integral  part of our every day  lives. Only  through  this can America continue to advance at the  rate  it has  in  the  past.

132,House,102,0.52,43,6,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, suddenly  we  see  a movement,  a  stampede  to  deperk the Congress; that is, to reduce  or eliminate certain perks or benefits  that have  traditionally been awarded  to Members of Congress and others.  This proposal is sound because these  perks,  for  the most part, have been  overly generous at best, outrageously  extravagant at worst. Conspicuously  absent in this scenario, however, is any  attention directed to the two most lu crative, most  lavish perks of all.  I  refer, of course,  to  the congressional  pension plan and  to  the Federal em ployees thrift savings plan, each gener ously  subsidized  by American  tax payers.  I suspect most taxpayers are familiar  with neither program. Perhaps plans to  deperk these programs have been con sidered, but I doubt it; perhaps plans  will be considered subsequently, but I  doubt it. Meanwhile, I will be waiting  and listening.

133,House,102,0.464,43,6,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  elections  last November dramatically  underscored that the American people  are angry. They have grown weary of  long-winded  excuses,  sick of broken  promises,  and appalled at  the arro gance of Congress which is controlled  by Democrats. Who can blame  them?  The  recent  fiascoes  involving  the  House bank and House dining estab lishments; a disastrous budget agree ment  in  1990;  shameful  and  under handed pay-raises and the list goes on.  Now you are trying to cover all your  mistakes by  investigating  the White  House.  Congress has betrayed and looted the  trust of the American people.  In  the  elections  this coming November,  the  American people will surely enact the  price for this betrayal of trust.  Today I stand to challenge the abuses  of the Democrat-controlled Congress. I  call on the Democrat leadership to de mand that the GAO release to the pub lic all the details surrounding the scan dal at the House bank and any GAO in vestigation reports or files concerning  the House bank from previous years.  The American people  fired  a  shot  across our bow  in  the elections  last  year across this Nation. It is now time  to return to accountability and send a  message that the Congress is willing to  play by the same rules as the rest of  society.  0 1220  BUDGETS WALLS SHOULD GO THE  SAME WAY AS THE BERLIN WALL  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)

Yet  that is what they are doing. And they  are asking for our help.  For  too many months,  those calls  have  fallen on deaf ears. Too many  leaders have failed to admit that a few  billion spent now can save our country  hundreds of billions later. It took Rich ard Nixon, of all people, to get George  Bush  to  finally  take  off his moral  blinders. But now he has done it, and  the President is about to announce a  strong aid package. A $1 billion ruble  stabilization fund, a $1.2 billion farm  loan credit program, and a previously  proposed $645 million direct aid pack age-these are but a  small downpay ment on world peace and security.  We  can  all  be  thankful  that  the  President is finally facing one of the  great moral challenges of our  time.  The question is now: Where will he find  the resources to meet that challenge?  Members of Congress have proposed the  most  logical  place:  defense  savings.  But the President resists. Mr. Speaker,  the world cannot afford lip service at a  time like this. The only way the cold  war will truly end is if the budget walls  go  the same way as the Berlin Wall.  They must come down, because  they,  too, have become relics of the cold war  in this rapidly changing world.

I urge you  to vote ""yes"" on H.R. 3732, to  achieve an extra $2.6 billion  in deficit reduc tion and to make available over $12 billion for  domestic discretionary spending.  If the budget walls do not come down, do mestic discretionary spending will be slashed  by 12.3 billion in budget authority and $6.4 bil lion in outlays, out of a domestic discretionary  total of $218 billion.  Of particular concern to me as chairman of  the Treasury, Postal Service, and General  Government Subcommittee of the Committee  on Appropriations is the revenue forgone ap propriations to the U.S. Postal Service.  This appropriation permits the Postal Serv ice  to maintain current postal  rates  for pre ferred  rate mailers. Qualified preferred  rate  mailers are defined as religious, educational,  scientific, philanthropic, agricultural, labor, vet: erans, and fraternal organizations, and include  such groups as the American Cancer Society,  the American Heart Association, the National  Easter Society, the March of Dimes, Birth De fects Foundation, the American Association of  Retired Persons, National Wildlife Federation,  the Salvation Army, as well as many, many  others.  These nonprofit groups have long played a  vital role in American life, supplying a consid erable share of  the social services, health  care, education  research, arts, culture, com munity  improvement,  international relief, con servation, environmental protection, and public  advocacy occurring in the United States.

143,House,102,-0.513,95,6,Mrs. MINK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup port of this legislation, and commend the worl'<  of the gentleman from Louisiana in preparing  for  the transfer of the Panama Canal  to  the  Panamanian Government in the year 2000.  However, I also have some concern about  the current operations of the canal, specifically  the claims procedures for vessels damaged in  the canal. As we consider changes  in  the  membership of  the Panama Canal Commis sion and prepare for the transfer of the canal,  we cannot overlook our responsibility  to as sure  the  fair  and  expeditious payment  for  damages incurred by canal pilots.  The process in receiving payment for claims  for which  the  commission  accepts  liability  should not be onerous and should not cost the  shipping companies any more money . than  they have already lost.  This has been the case with a company in  my district.  In April 1988, one of the vessels  owned by the Hawaiian Sugar Transportation  Co. was  involved  in an accident while being  piloted through the canal by a Canal Commis sion  pilot. The  accident  caused  extensive  damage to the vessel which cost $7.5 million  to  repair. And even though,  the Commission  has accepted liability for the damage, almost  4 years later the claim remains unpaid.  Last fall, I engaged in a colloquy with Chair man TAUZIN who was gracious enough to clar ify the claims procedure and I appreciate his  assistance in expediting this claim.  Shortly after our exchange the Commission  offered a settlement to the Hawaiian Transpor tation Co. of only $2.8 million,  less than half  of the cost to repair the ship. Despite repeated  requests by  the Hawaiian Sugar Transpor tation Co.  for a more comprehensive expla nation of reasons for such a  low settlement  offer, the Panama Canal Commission did not  respond.  The company was finally forced to file suit.  They could not afford  to  take such a small  amount for  the $7 .8 million worth of damage  caused to their vessel, not to mention the loss  of money during the time the vessel was out  of service.  I mention this case today to illustrate that as  long as the canal is under our jurisdiction we  must assure its users safe passage and when  accidents do occur we must provide a fair, ex peditious settlement to their claims.  If we do not operate the canal efficiently, we  cannot expect the Government of Panama to  do the same.  I know, Mr. TAUZIN has worked with  the  claims process for many years, and has made  many  improvements over the years. I appre ciate his hard work and diligence and ask that  he continue to investigate ways to improve the  current claims process, to restore its user to  the same financial condition as they were prior  to damage.  ",1992
144,House,102,0.421,95,6,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to congratu late Mr.  FIELDS  for his  introduction of H.R.  1558, the Panama Canal Act amendments of  1991. As the ranking minority member of the  Coast Guard Subcommittee, Mr. FIELDS has  worked effectively to forge a practical biparti san approach with  subcommittee Chairman  TAUZIN and Chairman JONES of the full Mer chant Marine and Fisheries Committee.  H. R. 1558 is the laudable result of that co operative effort and  it  incorporates a wide  range of  input  from  the administration,  the  Government of Panama, the maritime industry,  and other concerned subcommittee members  such as myself.  This has paid a  rich dividend.  It has ad vanced our national economic and security in terests in the effective functioning of the Pan ama Canal, both now and after the waterway's  transfer to full Panamanian control in the year  2000. H.R. 1558 reflects our continuing na tional commitment  to  implementing  the Pan ama Canal Treaties  in a manner  that pro motes a cooperative political, economic, and  diplomatic relationship with a significant treaty  partner.  These amendments are most  timely, par ticularly those that direct the study of possible  administrative changes to the structure of the  canal operating agency,  the Panama Canal  Commission. Even though the Government of  Panama has taken some  initial steps toward  its own post-1999 planning,  it must now fully  engage  in  the process  to guarantee a suc cessful outcome. We in the Congress can do  our part by working with the administration to  mold the Canal Commission in ways that can  serve  as  a  businesslike,  apolitical,  semi autonomous model for consideration by Pan ama.

Millions of people  living under Communist  governments have come  to depend on  the  Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America  as a source of news and information.

148,,102,0.084,303,6,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, today I  rise to introduce, by request, the De partment of the Army's legislative pro gram for the 2d session of the 102d Con gress. The program consists of  two  major pieces of legislation. The first,  the Water Resources Development Act  of 1992 provides for  the conservation  and development of water and related  resources and authorizes the Secretary  of  the Army  to  construct  various  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE  7655  projects for improvements to our rivers  and harbors. The second bill provides  for the appropriation of funds from the  harbor maintenance trust fund to the  Department of the Army for payment  of expenses incur:..~ed in administering  the port use fee and amends the Water  Resources Development Act  of  1986  with respect to the payment of the re habilitation costs of inland and coastal  waterway navigation projects.  The Department of the Army's legis lative proposals in support of the Army  Corps of Engineers Civil Works Pro gram represent a continuation of the  administration's 3ommitment  to  ap prove water resources legislation on a  biennial basis. As you know, Mr. Presi dent, the 1970's and 1980's saw a depar ture from the previous practice of ap proving  omnibus  authorization  bills  and predictable appropriations for the  construction of water projects. In 1986,  however, we broke the logjam. After 16  years  of  legislative-executive  policy  confrontations over the role of the Fed eral Government in water policy,  the  99th Congress approved the Water Re sources Development Act of 1986.  The 1986 act was truly landmark leg islation in the area of water policy and  formed  the basis of the 1988 and 1990  Water Resources Development Acts.  Most  importantly,  the 1986 Act con tains  the  framework  for  local  cost sharing of Army Corps of Engineers  projects.  I  support  that  framework  wholeheartedly, and I might add,  the  intent of cost-sharing is not to prevent  the  construction  of  a  particular  project, but rather  to  recognize our.  limited Federal resources and the fi nancial responsibility of local project  beneficiaries. The 1986 act has brought  a sense of fiscal sanity to the author ization and appropriation process.  As Congress moves forward to enact  legislation this year, we must remain  faithful  to  the provisions of the 1986  Act. After reviewing the Department of  the Army's proposals,  I can see  that  the administration too, views this as a  guiding principle.  Mr. President, the Committee on En vironment and Public Works has held  two  days  of hearings on water  re sources legislation this session and ex pects to report a bill after the Easter  recess. Certainly, the committee needs  to  review  these proposals here more  closely, but I commend the administra tion for laying the groundwork for leg islative action.  I ask that the two bills and the sec tion-by-section analyses be included in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 2500  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

149,,102,0.03,355,6,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  announce that I, along with Mr. BATEMAN, Mr.  JONES of North Carolina, Mr. DAVIS and Mr.  FIELDS have introduced H.R. 4693, a bill pro hibiting the Coast Guard from establishing or  collecting any  fees  for  the  issuance of mer chant mariners' documents, licenses or certifi cates of registry.  H.R. 4693 prevents the Federal Government  from singling out merchant mariners  to pay  what is clearly an employment tax. Other oc cupations  in  transportation  industries  don't  have to pay a Federal fee in order to be law fully employed. Why merchant mariners?  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  1990 singled out merchant mariners by lifting  the 1886 statute which prohibited  the collec tion of fees for mariners' licenses. Train engi neers don't pay Federal licensing fees. Com mercial pilots don't pay Federal licensing fees.  Truck drivers don't pay Federal licensing fees.  The idea of the Federal Government taxing an  individual for the opportunity to work is inherently wrong.    We all benefit  from  the Coast Guard's  li censing and documentation requirements. The  Coast Guard's Marine Safety Program pre vents maritime accidents that could result  in  loss of life or property or harm to the environ ment.  It is not fair to burden one segment of  our society with the expense of supporting a  basic Government service from which we all  benefit.  Additionally, our national security depends  on  a  strong merchant marine.  If  anyone  doubts this fact,  I would only remind them of  our merchant mariners heroic contributions to  the  largest sealift  in maritime history. Desert  Storm was successful because we had a base  of qualified,  licensed merchant mariners who  were ready to respond to the call of duty.  Mariner licensing fees will discourage mer chant mariners who are under employed from  their renewing licenses. In an industry that is  already depressed, licensing fees will discour age potential merchant mariners from entering  the field. At a time when we should be honor7707  ing merchant mariners for their national serv ice, we are instead proposing to tax them for  the license to provide that service.  The merchant mariner  licensing  fees are  bad tax policy. Mariner licensing fees will slow  our economic recovery and are contrary to our  national security interests. I ask you to support  H.R. 4693. Let's prohibit the Federal Govern ment from taxing our merchant mariners' right  to work.  CIVIL RIGHTS CONTINUED  HON. JJ.

The  remarks which I today ask be included in the  RECORD reflect Harry Middleton's efforts along  these lines. Mr. Middleton gave these remarks  upon  his  receipt  of  the  Anti-Defamation  League's Torch of Liberty Award.  Harry Middleton  is wise  to  remind us  that  the brutality and violence which we witness in  society is not something from which we can  turn our heads or for which we can deny re sponsibility. We all need to pause and reflect  about the forces in our society which appeal to  the darker sides of our nature, and pledge to  do something to turn this tide around.  Harry Middleton and  those  like him who  speak out about injustice are cause for hope  that  these elements  in our society can be  overcome. He  is a deserving recipient of the  Torch of Liberty Award, and I commend his re marks to everyone:  REMAR.KS OF HARRY MIDDLETON  Man, William Faulkner tells us in one of  the stirring testaments of our literature, ""is  immortal not because he alone among crea tures has an inexhaustible voice, but because  he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion  and sacrifice and endurance.""

I think we have a responsibility  for  the  long-term  stability of  this  world to take the action of providing  $270 million  for peacekeeping  forces  under the United Nations.  I am sorry that we had to have $21  million for military aid to El Salvador.  I do not like it. It should have all been  humanitarian aid from my perspective.  I do not like the fact we released Ma laysia from  the ban as Malaysia has  not foresworn pushoffs of refugees that  are seeking their shores.  By the same token, I have to recog nize the efforts to help the children of  the world to survive and to help them  survive and to help through the Child  Implementation Act for a world sum mit for children.  I have to vote for this bill because of  the help it gives  to refugees seeking  some home and some kind of new life  fleeing for their lives from the troubled  parts of the world.  So,  in all balance, Mr. President, I  will be voting for this foreign aid bill  to help stabilize the world of today and  tomorrow.  ",1992
155,Senate,102,-0.334,485,6,Mr. WOFFORD.," Mr. President, I am  dismayed that the steel voluntary re straint agreements  [VRA's] have ex pired and  this administration has no  plan for the steel industry.  The President has had 2¥2 years to  negotiate  a multilateral  agreement  that would brin.g ~bout global, market based trade in steel. We have no such  agreement and we have no VRA's-our  only recourse is the trade laws, which  our  trading partners are working  to  dismantle through the GATT negotia tions.  The steel industry is the heart of our  Nation's manufacturing strength. It's  also a model for businesses willing to  rise to meet the challenges of a grow ing global economy. As the New York  Times said yesterday, steel is ""an in dustrial  comeback  story.""  It  is un thinkable that we should send our steel  industry and steelworkers a message  that their hard work was for nothing,  that we in Washington are going to sit  back and watch while subsidized for eign steel is dumped on the U.S. mar ket, capturing the market share they  have worked so hard to regain.  A strong multilateral agreement that  preserves our trade  laws would be in  everybody's best interest, and the steel  industry supports such an agreement. I  encourage  the President  to maintain  the strength of our trade  laws while  continuing  these  negotiations. How ever, until a multilateral agreement is  reached the VRA's should be extended.  I support  this resolution and  I com mend it to my colleagues.

161,House,102,0.141,537,6,Mr. LEACH.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to attempt to put in context the recent  expressions of public dismay about the  operation of  the  congressional bank  and to suggest that compaign reform is  the unfinished business of a Congress  in disrepute.  What is more at issue  than loss of  public  funds  is  loss  of public  con fidence. The public objects above any thing else  to  the establishment of a  new political class, a privileged group  with perks, amenities, and job security  unavailable to the average American.  The public wants a House of Represent atives, not a House of Lords.  The irony is that at the very time  the Russian people want to copy our  system; at the very time they have re belled  against  their  government,  against the privileges of their ruling  party bureaucracy-what they dispar agingly call a nomenklatura or new  clas&-the American people are having  self-doubts about our institutions, es pecially Congress, and our capacity for  change.  A Congress that is unable or unwill ing to change, that serves up the status  quo,  is as vulnerable to citizen rebel lion as King George's Parliament was  two centuries ago.  The issue is not so much the congres sional bank as  the disregard for fair  play,  the refusal of Members to  just  say ""no"" to temptation. Here the big gest temptation is not the right to sign  an overdraft or  two  on  a  personal  checking account;  it is  the  system  which causes Members to sign on the  dotted  line multibillion-dollar  over drafts on the Federal Treasury.  It is the contention of this Member  that the inability of Congress to bal ance its checkbook is a  reflection of  our  inability  to balance  the public's  ",1992
162,House,102,0.253,550,6,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Madam Speaker, I  am pleased  to  introduce  legislation today  to  honor the late Joseph C. Hardin, a highly re spected citizen and former leader in business  and government in Arkansas. The bill would  designate lock and dam No. 3 on the Arkan sas River as the ""Joe Hardin Lock and Dam.""  Mr. Hardin was born in 1898, and died on  March 6, 1992. He grew up in Grady, AR, at tended  Arkansas  schools,  participated  in  World War I, earned a college degree in com merce and finance, and returned to Grady to  work in his family's farming business.  He  then began a distinguished career  in  government  and  business.  Among  other  things, he served in the State legislature, was  comm1ss1oner  for  the State  revenue depart ment, worked  in various businesses and de velopmental associations, and served in many  capacities with the University of Arkansas.  Mr. Hardin was deeply involved in promoting  agricultural and water resources development.  As president of  the Arkansas Farm Bureau  Federation and as vice president of the Amer ican  Farm Bureau  Federation,  he  helped  shape much of the farm  legislation Congress  enacted in the 1940's and 1950's. Other posi tions  included the Arkansas River Basin De velopment  Association  and  the  Arkansas  Water Studies Commission.  He was an active member of the Arkansas  Basin Association from its inception in the late  1920's, championing many efforts to develop  and sustain  the  region's  resources. He  fre quently provided critical  information  to Con gress on  issues  involving  the authorization  and funding of Arkansas water projects-par ticularly the McClellan-Kerr navigation system.  He often spoke and  traveled  throughout the  region seeking support for development of the  river system.  Mr. Hardin also played a prominent role  in  the Arkansas River Basin  Interstate Commit tee. This organization, along with the Arkan sas River Basin Coalition  for Montgomery  Point, has helped spearhead numerous efforts  to ensure the continued viability of the entire  McClellan-Kerr Waterway. These groups, with  the help of outstanding citizens like Joe Har din, strive to promote the economic and envi ronmental health of our region, relying on hard  work,  long-term planning, and dedication  to  public service.  For all of these reasons, Madam Speaker, I  am  introducing  this naming bill as a small  token of appreciation for Joe's many years of  dedication and service.  I urge my colleagues  to support this  fitting  tribute  to such an out standing citizen, Government leader, and busi nessman. In the coming months, I hope to in clude the Joe Hardin lock and dam bill in om nibus legislation for Army Corps of Engineers'  water projects and programs. I look forward to  working with my  colleagues  in  the Public  Works and Transportation Committee and the  House and Senate.  Following is the next of the legislation.  H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.  Lock and dam numbered 3 on the Arkansas  River, Arkansas, constructed as part of the  project for navigation on the Arkansas River  and  tributaries,  shall be known and des ignated as the ""Joe Hardin Lock and Dam"".  SEC. 2. LEGAL REFERENCES.  Any reference in any law, regulation, docu ment,  record, map, or other paper of  the  United States to the lock and dam referred  to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a ref erence to the ""Joe Hardin Lock and Dam"".

163,,102,0.023,563,6,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Speaker, as our Nation  searches  for new approaches h  educating  students for the 21st century, it is well to keep  in mind that a number of our schools are suc ceeding  in  training students  in  the subjects  they will need  to succeed as adults, and  in  preparing them to become productive citizens.  One such public school system is in Cranford,  NJ, under the able leadership of Dr. Robert D.  Paul.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  During the past 15 years that Dr. Paul has  served as superintendent of the Cranford pub lic schools, 70 percent or more of the graduat ing class have gone on to  further their edu cation. They have largely succeeded because  of the fact that they come to school willing to  learn and with a respect for their teachers and  the value of a good education.  Dr. Paul has been the major catalyst in en couraging  this  partnership  between  the  schools and  the  family. He has motivated  teachers to improve their skills and to obtain  advanced degrees. Under his direction,  the  school  curriculum  has  kept pace with  the  times. SAT and HSPT scores  have been  raised and new subjects  introduced. As  the  school age population has declined and budg ets have come under stress,  the Cranford  school board has taken Dr. Paul's advice to  close three township schools and  reorganize  the curriculum.  A music teacher and an accomplished musi cian, Dr. Paul  is a member of the Suburban  Symphony Orchestra and serves on its board  of directors. He also directed the Lady Liberty  Marching Band, coached Little League base ball, and served on  the board of trustees of  the Cranford Public  Library  and Common  Sense.  Numerous organizations in Cranford and in  Union County have benefited from Dr. Paul's  advice and participation. They range from the  Union County Roundtable, where he served  as president,  to developing  the districtwide  science  fair.  Indeed,  the scope of Dr. Paul's  activities and interests is amazing.  The positive  influence  that Dr. Paul has  played  in  the  lives of thousands of Cranford  High School graduates  is  impossible  to cal culate, but it will be passed on from one gen eration to next. During 34 years spent in the  public schools in Connecticut, where he began  in 1958 as a music teacher, and in Massachu setts and Cranford, NJ, Dr. Paul has been a  force for progress and innovation in education.  Mr. Speaker,  I join with  the many  friends,  colleagues, students, school board members,  and graduates of Cranford High School in ex pressing my admiration and appreciation  for  the spirit of learning that Dr. Paul has inspired  in Cranford, and  I wish him a long, healthy,  and interesting retirement.

164,,102,-0.321,563,6,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  it is  that  time of year, once again, when alumni of Tufts  University  gather  to  celebrate  ""Tuftonia's  Week."" Held on April 19, it's a time in which  the more than 65,000 alumni of Tufts turn their  thoughts to their school and get together with  fellow Tuftonians to reminisce with old friends.  Each year, Tuftonia's Week celebrations are  recognized with  official  proclamations  and  greetings from Governors, Mayors, and other  government offices  from around  the country.  In addition to a formal ceremony on the Med ford, MA, campus,  local observances through  the years have ranged from small gatherings  7915  in restaurants to champagne receptions in mu seums, art galleries, and private homes. There  have been block parties to a group trolley ride  to a ride on an elephant in India. Alumni from  Boston to Brunei, from Medford to Melbourne,  from Hartford  to Hong Kong, and  from San  Diego  to Sao Paulo have come  together  to  think Tufts, thank Tufts, and toast Tufts.  In recent years, Tufts graduates have joined  efforts with the Forest Service Division of the  Department of Agriculture in their Plant-A-Tree  program.  In return for a small donation, grad uates  receive  a Forest Service  certificate  showing a tree has been planted in a national  forest in their name or the name of someone  else. The Plant-A-Tree program has received  over $4,000 in Tuftonian donations.  Tufts University was founded 140 years ago  and enrolls more than 8,000 students from 50  States and 109  foreign countries. With over  65,000 alumni, it's quite clear that there will be  considerable celebrating on April 19. I urge my  colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Tufts  University on  its ""Tuftonia's Week"" celebra tions and extend warm wishes  to  the many  alumni who will be participating in these fes tivities.

167,House,102,0.336,602,6,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of  the efforts of our col leagues, Mr. STENHOLM and Mr. MCCOL LUM,  to  implement essential  reforms  for the Legal Services Corporation.  I am particularly supportive of the  provisions directed at problems facing  the agricultural community because of  the activities of Legal Services Cor poration grantees.  While I support the concept behind  the Legal Services Corporation, I be lieve many  legal  services  attorneys  have overstepped their authority in the  past few years and forced many good  farmers to go bankrupt and lose their  farms.  For many, many years,  there has  been a close working relationship be tween farmers in my district and the  migrant workers  they employ. When  the Migrant and Seasonal Worker Pro tection Act became  law,  the farmers  tried their best to comply with the law.  Unfortunately,  not  every  farmer  knew every provision of the law and  minor  infractions  resulted  in  court  cases brought against farmers by attor neys  of Legal  Services Corporation  grantees. These are not,  in most  in stances, flagrant violations. For exam ple, suit has been brought because a  farmer forgot to write the designation  ""U.C.""  for unemployment compensa tion on the wage statement one week.  Every other week the ""U.C."" was writ ten in the appropriate block. The prop er  amount was  deducted  from  the  worker's pay each week; but, because  of a minor oversight one week,  legal  action was  taken. Another  case  in volved a farmer who had not displayed  the required MSPA poster.  Finally,  there was a case where an  unemployed  migrant  family  ap proached a farmer and requested work.  The farmer had no work for the family;  however,  they pleaded for a place  to  stay overnight. They had  two small  children with  runny  noses  and  no  shoes. The farmer, concerned about the  children staying outside at night,  fi nally gave in and told them they could  stay the night. However, the only room  he had left was in a facility he was no  longer using. His only request was that  they leave first thing in the morning.  In the morning, the family refused to  move and continued to plead with him  for employment. He finally acquiesced  and provided the father with a  job. He  then tried to move the family to ac ceptable housing, but they refused to  leave  the  trailer  in which  they had  been staying.  ",1992
168,,102,-0.269,810,6,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, as  I stand  here  today,  one of  this country's greatest  naval  treasurers,  the battleship U.S.S. Mis is being  towed  from  its  true home  in  Long Beach, CA. This  removal  is occurring  despite months of hard work to convince the  U.S. Navy that the Missouri should be perma nently reassigned to Long Beach.  Mr. Speaker, Long Beach  is a Navy town.  For generations, Navy ships and sailors have  been stationed in Long Beach, doing their part  to ensure the security of this country and  its  citizens. I am proud, and I know the people of  Long Beach are proud, of the sacrifices and  contributions they have made over the years.  Now faced with the prospect of losing Ameri ca's  last and most historic battleship,  these  patriotic  citizens have  rallied  together and  voiced strong opposition to the Navy's plans.  I regret to say that our petitions have repeat edly fallen on deaf ears.  I wish to thank the citizens of Long Beach,  and throughout California, for their tremendous  efforts  to keep  the U.S.S. Missouri in Long  Beach. We have  taken our struggle  to  the  Navy. We have taken it to the highest office in  the land. Our arguments have been made in  good faith, and I refuse to accept that our ef forts have been in vain.  I pledge to continue  pursuing all available avenues  to bring  the  ""Mighty Mo"" back home.  PRIDE IN BEING AN AMERICAN  INDIAN  HON. ENI F.H.

169,,102,-0.254,862,6,Mr. CARR.," Mr. Speaker, since  I was  first  elected to Congress in 1974,  I have had the  privilege of representing Michigan State Uni versity in East Lansing, Ml. During that time I  have come  to know numerous distinguished  individuals associated with that institution. And  as the years have passed on,  I have regret fully come to see a number of them retire. And  few of them have had as much personal  im pact on me as Gordon Guyer.  The individual I rise to honor today has an  association with Michigan State University  both long and distinguished. It was 194 7 when  Gordon Guyer first came to East Lansing as a  student. He earned  three degrees  from  the  university-has baccalaureate, masters, and  doctoral degrees  in entomology-and served  in a variety of leadership roles.  As an entomologist, he focused on develop ing safe methods of limiting insect damage to  crops, and was among the first American sci entists to visit China in the mid-1970's. Work ing with  the U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Dr. Guyer has  served  in Australia, China,  Brazil, and Africa. Author of more than 70 sci entific papers, he has ranged widely over the  subjects  of  international  agriculture  policy,  aquatic ecology, as well as his area of great est expertise,  integrated pest control  tech nology.  As he was conducting a research project in  Africa in 1973, he was first tapped for an ad ministrative  post:  director of  the Michigan  State University Cooperative Extension Serv ice. He served in that post until 1984, ""putting  the land-grant university to work in every one  of Michigan's 83 counties,"" as he told the LanEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  sing State-Journal recently. One of the high lights of his service to CES was development  of a successful 4-H program  into urban De troit.  When Gordon left his post at CES, he  in tended to give his full attention to entomology,  as director of  the Kellogg biological station  from 1982  to 1985. But  then Gov. James  Blanchard tapped Guyer to direct the State's  Department of Natural Resources. Anxious to  return to science, he left that post only to be  called upon again by Michigan State, to lead  the university's governmental affairs unit after  his  long-time  colleague  and  friend  Jack  Breslin, passed on.  Now Gordon is once again ready to move  on, but this time to devote more time to W .K.  Kellogg  Foundation  education  projects  in  Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.  And personally, he has provided a positive  example. The way he treats everyone with re spect and kindness has earned him a universe  of friends and admirers-of which  I'm a par ticular fan--and few, if any, enemies.  I take  this opportunity  to add  to  the hun dreds of awards and citations Gordon has re ceived with the deepest gratitude of the peo ple of Michigan for his service. I want to wish  Gordon and his lovely wife Norma every pos sible joy in his retirement. He will be missed  by those of us who had the privilege to work  with him.

On Satur day, April 4, 1992, the Daily Cardinal will cele brate the 1 Oath anniversary of its first publica tion. I am honored to have this opportunity to  pay  tribute  to one of  the  finest and oldest  campus dailies in the country.  Throughout  the years,  the Daily Cardinal  has distinguished  itself as a student news paper determined to bringing a level of profes sionalism  to  journalism that  is unmatched at  the collegiate level. The Cardinal not only re ports on a wide array of campuswide topics,  but has prided itself on educating the Univer sity of Wisconsin-Madison campus on world wide events and their implications locally.  The Daily Cardinal first broke onto the na tional scene during the 1960's and played an  active and courageous  role  in opposing  the  war  in Vietnam. The Cardinal has continued  its activist theme by often focusing  its efforts  on controversial topics such as racism, sexual  abuse, and an ongoing battle  for a diverse  and peaceful multicultural society. The opinion  page tackles all debatable subjects and any one  or anything  considered  the  establish ment-beware. When  I was a graduate stu dent at the university, I always looked forward  to the paper's next edition.  Happy Birthday Daily Cardinal. Best of luck  in your next 100 years.

England & Sons, a  truckload motor carrier  headquartered in Salt Lake City was awarded  the prestigious grand prize trophy in the 1991  fleet safety contest. The trophy was given by  the Interstate Truckload Carriers Conference.  The conference represents the truckload, ir regular  route,  common, and contract motor  carriers of the United States and  is affiliated  with the American Trucking Associations.  Mr. Daniel England, chief executive officer  of C.R. England & Sons, was presented this  award at  the  conference's annual meeting.  The annual fleet safety contest is a competi tion between the 575 carrier members of the  conference to determine which company has  the best safety  record and safety program  from the preceding year. C.R. England & Sons  drivers log more than 100 million miles annu ally, and  to be  judged the best from among  their peers  in  the  important  field of highway  safety is a great tribute.  All the more significant is the fact that this  is  the second  time  in  the past 3 years  that  C.R. England & Sons has been given this tro phy. For years the company has been active  in promoting highway safety in Utah.  It is fit ting that C.R. England & Sons has been na tionally  recognized once again  for  its exem plary achievements.

While I do not intend to oppose  this bill before us  today,  I must say  that I have two basic concerns with the  measure. The first concern relates to  the basic underlying premise of  this  bill  that because  a  relatively small  portion of this area contains resources  of national  significance,  the  proper  course of action  is  for Congress  to  enact legislation creating a new Fed eral area. The second concern I have  relates to what I believe is an unprece dented authorization  for a State-run  concessions operation within a unit of  the park system.  It is somewhat  ironic  that we are  considering this bill on the floor on the  same day that we are also considering  ",1992
174,House,102,-0.685,888,6,Mr. DYMALLY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today, we will consider  Senate Joint Resolution 271, a bill to  permit limited assistance to Liberia by  way of a waiver of the Brooke-Alexan der prohibition.  Specifically, this bill is designed to  provide nonpartisan election and de mocracy-building assistance to support  the democratic process in Liberia, and  assistance for the resettlement of refu gees, the demobilization and retraining  of troops, and that provision of other  appropriate  assistance  to  implement  the Yamoussoukro peace accord, pend ing the President's certification.  The civil war in Liberia, which began  in December 1989, has killed thousands  of innocent Liberians, completely dis mantled  the  agricultural  infrastruc ture of the nation and totally collapsed  the political system.  Through the efforts of the economic  community of west African states, sev eral  agreements  have  been  signed  which were designed to lead the coun try toward free and fair elections.  Mr. Speaker,  this  leigislation does  not ask for any additional funds. This  bill simply lifts  the prohibitions pre venting  assistance  and  requires  the  President to make  the determination  that  Liberia  has made  significant  progress  toward  democratization.  further stipulates that a separate de termination and certification shall be  required for each fiscal year in which  such assistance is to be provided.  This action on the part of the House  will send the message to the two main  parties in Liberia that if they are will ing and prepared to settle the political  dispute peacefully, the United States is  prepared to remove the barriers which  prohibit assisting the democratic proc ess in Liberia.  Mr. Speaker, we have rewarded na tions around the globe for their sincere  and consistent movement towards de mocratization. We are pleased to lend  our support and encouragement to the  people of Liberia-who are now scat tered around the globe.  This  legislation speaks directly  to  our commitment to democracy on the  continent of Africa. The Liberian peo ple need to know that our devotion to  the democratic process is not limited  to  lip service, but  includes concrete  deeds of support and encouragement.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, I applaud the House  for acting exeditiously on  this most  important piece of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1992
175,House,102,-0.4,888,6,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of Senate Joint Resolution 271, which  ex presses the sense of Congress regarding the  peace process in Liberia and authorizes  lim ited assistance to support this process.  I would like to commend my colleague, Mr.  DYMALL Y of California, for bringing this matter  to the attention of the House and for his long standing concern about conditions in Liberia.  Mr. Speaker, Senate Joint Resolution 271  is  a noncontroversial  resolution  that recognizes  the efforts by the parties of Liberia for moving  toward a peaceful  resolution of 2 years of  bloody warfare that has led this small African  nation to the brink of economic and social dis solution. Under the auspices of the Economic  Community  of  West  African  States  [ECOWAS], the Interim Government of Liberia,  and  the National Patriotic Front  of Liberia  [NPFL] have begun  implementing the break through agreement reached in Yamoussoukro,  Ivory Coast, on October 30, 1991. This agree ment calls for democratic elections  in 1992.  While a number of obstacles still remain be fore elections can be held, not  the  least of  which is the large number of Liberian refugees  and displaced persons that still must be at tended to,  the West African nations and the  leaders of the Liberian parties remain commit ted to the process.  As part of the effort to implement the terms  of the accords, the Liberian Elections Commis sion was constituted  in early January and  is  made up of members of both major political  parties. The elections commission has issued  an appeal  for external support  to help pre serve its impartiality. In addition, the West Afri can heads of state and the various Liberian  parties have unanimously  invited  the Carter  Center to help organize and monitor the elec tions.  However, because of  the mismanagement  and widespread corruption  of  the previous  Doe government, Liberia is ineligible for devel opment assistance under the Brooke amend ment (section 620q) of the Foreign Assistance  Act. Senate Joint Resolution 271 would pro vide relief from  the Brooke sanctions, subject  to a Presidential determination that the country  of Liberia has made significant progress to ward democratization and that it is in the Unit ed States national interest to provide such as sistance.  Mr. Speaker, the nations of Liberia and the  United States have enjoyed a special relation ship for the past 150 years. In spite of the re cent hardships that the nation of Liberia has  endured, most Liberians continue to believe in  the special bond between our  two nations.  Senate Joint Resolution 271 rightly affirms that  the United States will and should continue to  play  the  leading  role  in  Liberia's's trans formation to peace and democracy in view of  our strong historic relationship with Liberia, our  strong support of the regional peace plan, and  the major role that United States NGO's will  play in rebuilding this country.  In closing, I urge the speedy adoption of this  timely, important, and noncontroversial resolu tion.  ",1992
176,House,102,-0.058,901,6,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr:  Speaker,  I  am  very  pleased to rise in strong support of H.R. 4712,  the Child Abuse Prevention and Family Serv ices  Act.  This  important  bill  authorizes,  through fiscal year 1995, programs under the  Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act,  The  Family  Violence  Prevention  Act,  the  Adoption Opportunities Act,  and  the Tem porary Child Care for Children With Disabilities  and Crisis Nurseries Act.  The measure provides much needed sup port  for  these programs, and significantly  in creases authorized levels of funding, providing  fiscal year 1992 authorizations of $186 million  for the Child Abuse Prevention Programs, $93  million  for Family Violence Prevention Pro grams, and $30 million for Adoption Opportu nities Programs.  These programs have many essential func tions and are vital to the ongoing efforts in the  Third Congressional District of Tennessee  to  address the growing problem of child abuse.  The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment  Act provides assistance for State and local ef forts to prevent child abuse and to identify and  treat its victims.  It finances a national center  on child abuse and neglect  to oversee  re search on  the problem, coordinates Federal  child abuse prevention efforts, and acts as an  information clearinghouse on prevention and  treatment programs.  The Family Violence Prevention and Serv ices Act provides assistance for programs to  prevent family violence, train law enforcement  officers  in dealing with  family violence, pro mote cooperation between  law enforcement  and social service providers, and operate a  national  information  and  research  clearing house.  The Adoption Opportunities Act provides as sistance to help place otherwise hard-to-place  children  in adoptive homes,  including older  children, minority children, and children with  disabilities.  The Temporary Child Care for Children With  Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act provides  funding for temporary respite care for children  with disabilities, and temporary crisis nurseries  for children who have been, or are in danger  of, being abused.  Passage of the Child Abuse Prevention and  Family Services Act  today,  to  reauthorize  funding for these programs, couldn't be more  timely. Over  the past decade,  the problems  facing  at-risk  children  and  families  has  reached crisis proportions as reports of child  abuse and neglect have more than doubled to  2.5 million in 1990, the number of children en'.""'  tering  foster care has  risen, and substance  abuse among women has  increased. These  and other factors such as homelessness and  teen pregnancy have begun to overwhelm pro grams intended to help such children and their  families. Clearly, steps must be taken to assist  those providers who are offering these essen tial services.  I am very pleased that in my own commu nity there are many caring individuals involved  in  this  issue who are a beacon of hope  for  children and families in crisis. I salute them for  their outstanding work. This past Saturday,  April 4,  I was privileged  to have  the oppor tunity to attend, with my granddaughter Mere dith, Chattanooga's first Children's March  for  Children,  sponsored  by  the Altrusa  Inter national Club of Chattanooga, to raise money  for the Children's Advocacy Center of Hamilton County.    The Altrusa  International Club  of Chat tanooga  is  recognized within our community  for numerous achievements. Many of  their  worthy projects benefit  the  children  in  the  community.  The Children's Advocacy Center  [CAC] of  Hamilton County is a private, not-for-profit, or ganization which works on behalf of children  within the system of public and private agen cies to provide a team approach for children  and their families involved in child abuse. The  Children's Advocacy Center will offer a com fortable, homelike setting where children feel  safe and their families can. regain their ability  to  function. The Children's Advocacy Center  serves  the community  through education of  child abuse and offers staff training and devel opment.  The importance of the Children's Advocacy  Center  in Hamilton County cannot be over stated. This group of  representatives  from  area service providers are working together as  a team  for the benefit of children  in need of  support. The active  involvement of different  agencies demonstrates  the broad  interest  in  the success of this project. These agencies in clude:  T.C.  Thompson Children's Hospital,  Chattanooga Police Department, and mental  health and counseling agencies among others.  Obviously, this program means a lot to many  people.  In 1990 alone,  in Hamilton County  there were  1,722 cases  of  reported  child  abuse. This problem plaques not only Hamil ton County but  the Nation as well, and we  must be supportive of any efforts to ease the  suffering.  I have been working with the center to help  them secure assistance for their efforts and I'll  continue to do whatever I can on their behalf.  They are looking for staff assistance and vol unteer help and I've also encouraged others to  join with them in working for the benefit of chil dren who desperately need support.  I am very proud of all the members of my  community, particularly those involved with the  Children's Advocacy Center of Chattanooga,  who have taken it upon themselves to address  this  issue in a loving, caring, and  thoughtful  manner. They are people who are interested  in working to better children's lives.  I am proud to salute the dedicated individ uals  in connection with  the Children's Advo cacy Center  in Hamilton County, TN and  I  hope that other groups across the Nation will  emulate their efforts.

177,House,102,0.238,927,6,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman from Utah for yielding  to me.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that  we have been provided with this forum,  and I thank the gentleman from Utah  who called me on  the  telephone  just  the other day and suggested that we  cooperate and do  this  special order.  The issue of loan guarantees for Israeli  housing or perhaps better said Soviet  Jewish family housing in Israel, I be lieve, is one of the most misunderstood  topics that this House has attempted  to deal with since I have been here dur ing the last 8 years.  We are being asked to guarantee, the  word is ""guarantee,"" not to loan, not  to appropriate money to the foreign aid  account to give to Israel. We are asked  to guarantee or cosign a loan with the  State of Israel to afford them the op portunity to borrow from someone else  at a little bit less rate, at a little bit  lower rate; loan guarantees, therefore,  that cost us  little or nothing;  loan  guarantees to our best ally and to our  best friend in the Middle East.  They are loan guarantees to a friend  who has never missed a  loan payment  ever.  There is confusion over this issue on  many fronts. There is confusion in the  American Jewish community. There is  confusion in Israel. There is confusion  in the Israeli government and there is  confusion and misunderstanding in the  general populace all across our coun try.  This, again, is not a loan. This is not  foreign aid. This is a guarantee.  John Adams once said, ""Facts are  stubborn  things."" When you  look at  the facts, it is clear that American pol icy toward Israel and toward the inter national Jewish community as a whole  has been very inconsistent.  Let us look at some of the facts. It is  a fact that for years the United States  has  put  political  pressure  on  the  former Soviet Union to let Jews emi grate  from  their Communist oppres sors. Past administrations, Republican.  and Democrat alike, as well as the Con gress have spent much time and effort  encouraging Soviet leadership, encour aging  them,  asking  them  and,  yes,  sometimes threatening the Soviet lead ership until  their immigration policy  was  dramatically  changed  toward  Jews.    We have a moral obligation today to  these people. Jewish families are still  leaving the Soviet Union in large num bers, and while the limit of immigrants  to our country is quite limited, Jews  are fleeing  to Israel,  their homeland,  by the hundreds of thousands to escape  anti-Semitism in former Soviet coun tries.  There is a way for us to help these  people without it costing us a nickel  and, yes, as the gentleman from Utah  [Mr. OWENS]  just a  few minutes ago  suggested, a way that will benefit our  country as well. And that is with this  program of loan guarantees.  Let us turn to another fact. During  Operation Desert Storm, Saddam Hus sein wanted to divide the coalition of  forces in the Middle East and embroil  the region in an Arab-Israeli conflict  and, in so doing, he launched Scud mis siles by the dozens. And they attacked  Israel.  Israel showed an  incredible amount  of  restraint by absorbing  those  at tacks. This prevented Iraq from entan gling the entire region in an Arab-Is rael conflict, and that is exactly what  Saddam Hussein wanted. And it was be cause of the Israelis that we were able  to hold the coalition together. And it is  also a  fact that over the years Israel  has supported U.S. policy in the Middle  East and has helped us in many ways.  Israel has been our friend, a  friend  that destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in  1981. And I think we will all agree that  the Persian Gulf War would have been  a lot different if the madman had had  atomic weapons at his disposal during ,  Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  D 1640  It is also a fact, at least according to  the New York Times it is, that Amer ica made a loan of $500 million to Iraq  as recently as 1989 and Iraq recently  defaulted on that loan. The American  taxpayer is left with the $500 million  bill from what is today and has been  for the last year and a half an enemy.  We find our position today a very un usual one in denying guarantees to a  ",1992

180,,102,-0.631,1057,6,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, we need national  health care  insurance  reform. Anyone who  questions that statement should read the fol lowing excellent article by Jayne Garrison  in  the Sunday, April 5, 1992 San Francisco Ex aminer and Chronicle:  HEALTH CARE CRISIS: FIRMS ARE DUMPING  SICK PEOPLE  (By Jayne Garrison)  Helen Konowitz was newly married and  contemplating children when she first won dered whether her Kaiser health plan would  satisfy a growing family.  A friend told her about a terrific insurance  policy  offered  through  the UC-Berkeley  alumni association: reasonably priced, a safe  group policy, offering a wide choice of doc tors. Helen and Gary Konowitz bought.  Several years  later,  their baby son, Mi chael, had a  stroke-and  their reasonably  priced policy became one of their most cost ly investments ever.  Today their heal th insurance costs $13,020  a year.  ""If we want any  insurance of Michael,  we're stuck,"" she said, watching her boy  play with toys on the floor of their Marin  County  home.  ""But at some point we're  going to throw up our hands and say, how  much  longer  can we  pay  this  type  of  money?""  The Konowitzes are caught in a practice  that is stripping health insurance from fami lies across America. Some insurers are sepa rating the sick from the healthy, then rais ing rates until the sick can no longer afford  their coverage.  The practice  is expanding  to people on  larger policies, once thought to be more se cure  than  individual  insurance. And  it is  being applied  to people with  less serious,  though chronic, illnesses.  Critics dub this trend ""divide and dump.""  ""Insurers are trying to segment everyone  who needs insurance the most and get them  off the policies,"" said Dr. Philip Lee, direc tor of the Institute of Health Policy Studies  at UC-San Francisco.  ""It's widespread. It's getting worse. And  it's undermining the whole health insurance  system.""  No one knows exactly how many Ameri cans risk being dumped off their health in surance policies. The Heal th Insurance Asso ciation of America says such creaming of the  healthy from the sick is ""atypical.""  But  university  researchers  believe  the  number  is rising dramatically. Economists  say 34 million to 37 million Americans have  no health insurance.  Now, a new national survey by the Kaiser  Family Foundation found that 5 percent of  working adults--6.8 million people-say they  have been denied health coverage because of  a medical condition in the last two years.  And 6 percentr-8.2 million people-said at  least one member of their family has been  dropped by their insurer in that period.  Even for those who can pay the spiraling  premiums, health insurance is becoming ""no  more than a credit card,"" warns Alan Katz,  head of the California Association of Health  Underwriters, which advocates legal reform.  In essence, he said, some  insurances are  saying, ""'You go into the hospital, we'll pay  your bills. But come  renewal  time, we'll  raise  your premiums  to  cover  that bill.  You'll pay us back in installments.' It's no  longer insurance.""  Health  economists  say  the  practice  of  weeding the sick from the well began, on a  tiny scale, back in the 1950s when some com mercial  insurances  started  rejecting  less heal thy people from individual policies.  It spread to larger group policies offered by  associations  in  the  late 1980s, when rising  medical costs led many major corporations  to self-insure their own workers, and caused  others to switch in droves to cheaper health  maintenance organizations such as Kaiser or  Bay Pacific.  Those who remained behind on traditional  commercial insurance plans were, often, less  healthy, with a history of medical problems.  No other insurer would take them. For fami lies such as the Konowitzes,  the choice  is  simple and grim: Pay high premiums or risk  going without health insurance altogether.  AN AMERICAN TALE  The Konowitzes are being slowly squeezed  off their policy because Michael, now 5, had  two strokes as a toddler: one when he was 18  months old and one when he was 3.  His therapy bills topped $80,000, treatment  that could have bankrupted the family. His  neurologists cannot explain why he had the  strokes. Nor can  they guarantee he will  never have another stroke. But they do say  the odds are even that he will not suffer a re peat.  He enters kindergarten this fall as a bright  boy who has had only the normal  tumbles  and colds for the past two years. He has just  started ski lessons. But his medical history  renders him uninsurable in today's market.  The policy the Konowitzes bought in 1983  was advertised as a group plan available to  UC alumni who weren't getting  insurance  through their jobs. The price: about $700 a  year.  Gary Konowi tz was just beginning his own  business as an accountant. Helen Konowitz,  who worked as an accountant, wanted  to  stay home after she had children. The policy  seemed designed for families like theirs, she  recalls.  In 1988,  the premium escalated about 40  percent. The administrators of the plan, As sociation Consultants Inc. of Chicago,  told  members it was having trouble finding an in surance company that would take the group.  ACI invited members to reapply for a new,  cheaper policy.  ""MEDICALLY UNDERWRITING""  But when Helen Konowitz phoned  to  in quire, she was told the insurer of the cheaper  plan was ""medically underwriting,"" a  term  that means people with medical problems  are excluded.  ""Without  ever directly  saying,  'No, we  won't accept you,' they made it very clear  there was no hope of our ever being put in  that group,"" she said.  She called other insurers and brokers. One  told her they might insure Michael as a teen ager if he had no medical bills for 10 years.  Gary Konowitz  considered abandoning his  own business and going to work for a cor porate client-until he  learned  that  they,  too,  required medical underwriting before  accepting employees on their policy.  In 1990,  the Konowitzes  received notice  that their premiums were rising to $14,000 a  year. Gary Konowitz dropped off the policy,  bringing  the premium down  to $9,068-but  only temporarily.  Today  the Konowitzes pay $11,400 a year  just  to  insure Helen  and Michael. Gary  Konowitz has a  separate policy  through  different company for $1,620 a year, bringing  their total annual health insurance expenses  to $13,000.  Helen Konowitz said she doesn't know how  long they can afford the policy, particularly  if rates keep rising. In search of some safety,  she said her husband may find a  job with a  large corporation, if he can find one that will  take Michael on their insurance plan.  a.  IN THE END, LESS DESIRABLF:  Herbert Barker, director of the California  Alumni Association at UC-Berkeley, said the  Konowitzes' plan changed  insurers several  times, yet kept getting hit with increases be cause members of  the group were getting  older. Most members, thousands of graduates  from throughout the UC system, had joined  in the 1970s.  In a desperate attempt to help some alum ni, he said, the associations allowed ACI to  offer a new cheaper group plan to those who  could qualify. But  in  the end,  that  tactic  simply made the original group even less de sirable  to insurers and far more costly  to  this diminishing membership.  ""We felt the insurer was in fact, doing a  detriment to our group,"" Barker said. ""But  some of our members can't go anywhere else.  We can't drop the policy and risk cutting  them off.""  NO LEGAL PROTECTION  The practice of creaming the healthy from  the sick on group plans ""is not ethical, not  acceptable, but perfectly legal and done all  the  time,"" said Walter Zelman, health ad viser to California Insurance Commissioner  John Garamendi.  Zelman explained that state law forbids in surers from setting different rates for people  on  the same group plan. But insurers can  easily circumvent the law by offoring a new  policy to gToup members. Only the healthy  are accepted. Soon  the original group has  been divided into two, three or four gToups.  ""When only the sick or bad risks are left  on the original policy, the price goes through  the roof."" he said  This has happened with so many policies  offered  by  associations  that  brokers  no  longer call  insurance sponsored by anyone  other than a big employer group plan. Today  those policies are called ""association insur ance"" or ""franchise insurance"" and they are  among the riskiest of policies.

181,,102,-0.374,1070,6,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay trib ute  to  two  constituents  and  very  special  friends of mine, Ors. Edward and Ruth Heinig,  both distinguished faculty members at West ern Michigan University. On April 11, Ed and  Ruth will be honored by their friends and col leagues on their retirement from almost three  decades of teaching, scholarship, and public  service.  Both Ed and Ruth arrived at Western Michi gan University in the early sixties, only a few  years  before  I  joined Western's  political  science faculty. Ed became a member of the  department of education and professional de velopment, where he quickly established him self as an outstanding teacher and scholar. He  made particularly significant contributions  in  the areas of multicultural education and health  education, and was repeatedly recognized for  his  impact in  the classroom.  In 1972, he re ceived  the WMU Alumni Award  for Teaching  Excellence;  in 1973 he was  listed  in  ""Out standing Educators of America""; and in 1979  he was named  the outstanding professor  in  graduate education  by Western's Graduate  Student Association.  Ruth Heinig's tenure at Western has been  no  less distinguished  than  that of her hus band's. A member of the university's commu nications  department,  Ruth  has  published  widely and taught courses in the areas of cre ative drama,  communications,  and  speech.  She has centered much of her work on cre ative drama for children, and the wide variety  of her contributions led to Ruth's listing in The atre News as one of the American Theatre As sociation's  11 O most distinguished women.  Ruth  has  also  been  repeatedly  listed  in  ""Who's Who  in  the Midwest,"" ""World Who's  Who  in Women,""  ""Who's Who  in Entertain ment,"" and  ""Who's Who  in Education.""  In  1985,  Indiana University presented Ruth with  the key  to the city of Indianapolis in recogni tion of her outstanding work in creative drama.  The contributions of  the Heinigs over  the  past three decades have extended far beyond  the classroom. They have both been deeply  involved in all facets of the university commu nity and have also given generously of their  time and energies to a wide variety of off-cam pus  volunteer enterprises. How  they  have  found time to do it all is rather a mystery, but  countless  numbers  of  people  have  been  touched by their service.  I feel privileged to have known Ed and Ruth  Heinig. They are two remarkable people, and  the dinner  that  is being organized  in  their  honor is eloquent testimony to the love and re spect  their  friends and colleagues hold  for  them.  Mr. Speaker,  I am  certain  that my  col leagues will want to join me  in paying tribute  to Ed and Ruth for their multiple contributions  to public education and  to  their community.  We congratulate them on  their well-deserved  retirement, and wish  them both all possible  happiness in the years ahead.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  A TRIBUTE TO THE CUBAN  RAFTERS EXHIBIT  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday. April 7, 1992  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  proud to pay tribute to the exhibit at the Haci enda Mardenpaz by the Cuban American Na tional Foundation. Mr. Ruben Abella has led in  the organization of the exhibition, which hon ors  the  freedom-seeking  lancheros who  left  Cuba on homemade  rafts, hoping  to  realize  their dreams in a free  land. Manny Garcia of  the Miami Herald reports:  Oneida Delgado fought back tears Tuesday  morning as she toured several rafts used by  refugees to flee Cuba, and models of the is land's most notorious prisons.  Although it has been 32 years since she fled  Cuba, Delgado said the replicas of seven pris ons and the sun-dried purse she found in one  innertube were too much.  ""This is so emotional,"" Delgado said, ""My  children need to see this-the world needs to  see this.""  That's the message of the Cuban American  National  Foundation's  exhibition  that  opened last weekend and closes Sunday at  Hacienda Mardenpaz, a 20-acre ranch at 12240  SW 72nd St. in West Kendall.  Foundation member Ruben Abella said the  jails were designed, painted and built by  former political prisoners, many of whom  spent years crammed into child-sized cells.  Abella said the exhibit was planned to coin cide with the United Nations meeting in Ge neva on human rights violations in Cuba.  ""We have to honor political prisoners, and  the best way is to build this tribute,"" Abella  said. ""Cuba today is one big prison.""  Abella said organizers came up with the  idea last year when they heard former politi cal prisoners speak about their experiences  in jail.  Visitors agreed  the most dramatic sights  were the rafts, some made from Styrofoam,  wood or  innertubes, and a  cell called  the  ""drawer."" The drawer, located in Tres Macio  prison in Oriente province, is an eight-foot  high, 20-inch wide cubicle lined with glass  shards on two walls.  Five prisoners were usually crammed into  the cell.  Kendall resident Bill Paschal called the ex hibit a gut-wrenching experience.  ""I think every American should see it,""  Paschal said. ""It opens your eyes to what the  Cuban people have suffered through. We are  born with freedom here, but the average per son has no  idea what  living under  com munism is like.""  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to acknowledge  the work of the foundation in constructing this  exhibit. This display of  rafts and  innertubes  has given  the people of our community an  idea of what these people have gone through.  It is a tribute to the men and women who have  given  their  lives  for  the  sake of  freedom.  Theirs is a desperate journey.  But Castro's communism will not last, and  men and women will no longer have to  leave  their families behind in search of the liberties  they are denied.  This exhibit stands in order that we under stand and  that we never forget what Cuba's  people have suffered.  April 7, 1992  NEW MEXICO MAGAZINE  HON.

I  think that the Congress is very fortu nate  that  the gentleman  from New  York [Mr. SCHEUER] will be represent ing us in Brazil at this international  . conference. I hope that when he travels  to Brazil he will be able to tell the par liamentarians around  the world  that  we are taking action in our own Con gress to protect our resources, and only  when we recognize and we take appro priate action to protect our forests can  we  really ask other countries, which  are much less prepared from a stand point of their understanding perhaps of  the science of forestry, and also from  the standpoint of the resources  they  have available to them, and it is very  awkward  for us  to be asking other  countries to do what we are not willing  to do ourselves,  so  I appreciate  the  comments of the gentleman from New  York.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased also to be  joined this evening in this special order  by a  colleague,  the gentleman  from  South Carolina  [Mr.  RAVENEL].  The  .'gentleman from South Carolina  [Mr.  RAVENEL]  is a member of the Commit tee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries,  which has important jurisdiction over  many issues relating to our natural re sources, such as the Endangered Spe cies Act.  The gentleman from South Carolina  [Mr. RAVENEL]  is a cosponsor of H.R.  842, the Ancient Forest Protection Act,  as are 137 other Members of our House.  I would like to thank the gentleman  from South Carolina for his steadfast  support for our legislation and for his  articulate voice on behalf of protecting  our fores ts.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from South Carolina  to add his con tribution  to  our  special  order  this  evening on the subject of our Nation's  forests.  ",1992
187,House,102,0.162,1161,6,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  [Mr.  JONTZ] and my good neighbor, the gen tleman from Georgia.  I stand here today as an original co sponsor of Congressman  JONTZ's An cient Forest Protection Act. This bill  offers us a chance to preserve one of  the last remnants of our magnificent  natural heritage, our precious ancient  forests in the Pacific Northwest.  As the gentleman from Indiana [Mr.  JONTZ] knows, I went out there about a  year ago and toured the Olympic Pe ninsula. Of course, we flew around the  Olympic  National  Park,  which  of  course is protected. We looked at some  State forests and then we saw the dev astation that is going on out there in  the national  forests adjacent  to  the  park. It really just tore me up to see  what was going on out there.  As  the gentleman knows, because I  know he has been out there, there is  timber  in  those  slopes,  very  severe  slopes. They go in there and they cut  all  those magnificent trees down and  then whatever  is  left  they  just burn  and  the rains come,  the heavy rains  and the red clay and the dirt is washed  down into the little streams and just  chokes them up. It looks like the area  around Mount Helen's actually right  after  the devastation  there of  that  eruption of the volcano.  In Charleston the other night, there  was a group there and there were some  people representing the timber indus try. We were discussing the situation,  and  I  remarked  that I had been out  there and seen the devastation going  on in the Olympic National Forest and  how upset I was about it.  You know,  that many told me that  what I saw with my own eyes, I had not  seen. He said, ""That situation does not  exist, does not exist.""'  So I said, ""Well, I know the Sun is  going to reverse itself in its orbit now  and water is going to start to run up hill.""  Some of these ancient forests have  trees that were full grown when Colum bus first set his foot on American soil.  Of course,  the anniversary of that is  right this year.  These forest ecosystems remind me  of natural cathedrals. We have a few of  them there in South Carolina. We do  not have a great many, but we prob ably have 25,000 or 30,000 acres.  There is one tract there that was pre served by a Chicago  industrialist by  the name of Beidler. The Audubon So ciety was able to buy it from his fam ily.  0 1740  It is the Beidler Forest not far from  Charleston, SC. They have bald cypress  trees there. They have  trees in there  nothing of the height of the Pacific  Northwest but these magnificent bald  cypress trees, some of them reputed to  be as old as 2,000 years old, if you can  imagine  that; Audubon  has built  a  boardwalk out into this swamp. It is  the Four Hole Swamp in  the Beidler  Forest.  Mr. Speaker,  I have a Down's syn drome son who  is pretty severely re tarded. He is educable, with an IQ of  only 17. Of course, his  social  IQ  is  about 140.  Well, Mr. Speaker, I took him down  into that swamp one day on the board walk, real cold New Year's Day, prob ably about 35 degrees, not a breath of  air moving, bright sunshine. We got  down to the end of that boardwalk and  we looked around, and there we were in  this magnificent ancient forest of bald  cypress trees.  I  said,  ""William, where are you?""  And he says, ""Church."" Man, that just  had a telling effect on me.  When I was out in the Olympic Pe ninsula, I thought of that day that Wil liam and I had down there in our own  little piece of the ancient forest that  we have not far from Charleston.  As I said, these forest ecosystems re mind me of natural cathedrals. Now,  when I wrote that, I thought of the day  that we spent down  there with these  trees that tower hundreds of feet over  your  head  while  sunlight  peeks  through the canopy and a quiet seren ity envelops all who enter.  For those of you who have not been,  you need to go  to our Northwest an cient forests and see for yourself. Un like any other experience you will ever  have.  This is exactly how I felt when I first  saw  these magnificent  forests.  The  trees we have in the South are very  young trees by comparison with those  in the Pacific Northwest. How someone  could even think or imagine going in  there with  a  chainsaw  and  cutting  down a tree that is almost a thousand  years old, 300 feet tall, and one that we  measured, 42 feet in circumference, is  just beyond my comprehension. They  are almost  4112  times older  than our  country. Mr. Speaker,  the Jontz bill  recognizes  that you  cannot protect  only a part of these ecosystems, you  have  to  protect  them  in  their  entireties, trees, plants, streams, ani mals, all of which contribute  to  the  ecosystem as a whole.  What we have are other interests who  are seeking only to look at individual  parts of this ancient forest ecosystem.  The timber industry and many of the  Federal agencies, and I hate to say it  but it is  true, many of the Federal  agencies involved have tried to charac terize this issue in just that light. In  their  view,  protecting  the northern  ",1992

231,Senate,102,0.466,1278,6,Mr. MACK.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce legislation to pay  tribute to the noble service and costly  sacrifices of the men and women of the  U.S. military who are former prisoners  of war,  those who might still be held  against their will, and  those who  re main missing in action. This  legisla tion is also a tribute to the families of  these men and women, many of whom  spend every day wondering if a  loved  one is still alive overseas.  I am today introducing legislation to  establish a  living memorial  to  these  men and women by designating  two  interconnecting,  transcontinental sys tems of existing U.S.  interstate high ways as the ""POW/MIA Memorial High way."" One system will run from key  West, FL, northwest  to Bellingham,  WA, at the Canadian border. The other  will run southwest from Hulton, ME, to  Cabrillo National Monument at San  Diego, CA.  The idea of establishing a POW /MIA  Memorial Highway came as a sugges tion from one of my constituents, Jose  N. Proenza-Sanfiel, of St. Cloud, FL. A  Cuban refugee and former U.S. marine,  Mr. Proenza-Sanfiel has unselfishly de voted his  time,  talent, and effort  to  this cause for a number of years. He  has never accepted a penny of com pensation for his efforts, saying he is  not a patriot for profit. He has been  successful in gaining passage of legisla tion in Florida to designate U.S. 1 from  Key West to the Georgia border as the  POW/MIA Blue Star Memorial High way. His next vision is to establish a  pathway of honor across  this great  country.  Mr.  President,  it horrifies me  to  think  that American  soldiers might  still be held against their will in lands  abroad. A recent issue of Newsweek in dicates that as many as 2,300 United  States military personnel might still  be held in Vietnam, Laos, and Cam bodia. More than 8,000 Korean war vet erans  remain unaccounted  for. And,  shockingly,  there  are  approximately  79,000 MIA's from World War II.  Couple  these  figures with  the  an guish, heartache, and uncertainty of  the families and friends of POW's and  MIA's and  the need  to focus on  this  issue becomes even more compelling.  That is why the establishment of a  POW/MIA Memorial Highway is so im portant. By enacting this legislation, it  will call attention  to  the plight of  these brave men and women and their  families. It will also serve as a tribute  to all farmer prisoners of war. I urge  my colleagues to join me in this effort.  . Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill afong with  the article ""Help Sanfiel Get His Drive  on the Road To Honor POW's/MIA's""  from the February 24, 1989, issue of the  Orlando Sentinel be  inserted  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  immediately  following my remarks.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 2546  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,    SECTION 1.

This excel lence can be attributed to many  factors, but  foremost among them is the quality of its per sonnel stationed here and abroad.  It is an honor and a pleasure for me to re port to you today about the exemplary service  of Air Force S. Sgt. Robert D. Hilleary, a con stituent  from Seminole, FL, who symbolizes  the professionalism, skill, and  training of Air  Force personnel that have made them one of  our Nation's greatest assets.  Sergeant Hilleary was recently awarded the  U.S. Air Forces  in Europe Professional Per former Award in recognition of his special at tention to detail when he noticed a taxiing air craft had one of  its  right main  landing gear  tires blown. Upon noticing this hazard, the air craft was prevented from taking off, and after  further investigation it was discovered that the  landing gear strut had a severe hydraulic leak.  Sergeant Hilleary's quick response to this seri ous mechanical problem prevented a cata strophic loss of life and equipment. His actions  exemplify the quality of U.S. servicemen who  have  volunteered  to  represent  our Nation  abroad and do so with tremendous honor.  Mr. Speaker,  for his devotion to his duties  and particular attention  to detail,  I commend  Sergeant Hilleary, and call  to your attention  his outstanding service to the U.S. Air Force  and our Nation.

If we do not do this, we do  not do anything. The problem I have  with that is the principle embodied in  this legislation which is if a small town  decides to go out and cut a deal with  some company,  that is it. They have  made the decision. They have made a  decision that can affect thousands of  people, and  there  is  little or no  re course.  That is the problem I have.  I am happy to yield to the Senator  from Montana.  ",1992

235,House,102,-0.478,114,14,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Jontz amendment.  This amendment will  reduce  funding  for Federal timber sales by 10 percent,  thereby saving  the U.S. Government  close to Sl 7 million.  For too long the Forest Service has  been selling timber from American for ests at too low a price. Lumber from  our nation's forest is sold at 35 percent  below market value, costing U.S. tax payers billions of dollars. In 1991 alone  the Forest service lost more than $500  million.  Reasonable people will differ about  to what extent we should allow logging  in our national forests, but if we are  going to allow logging, we ought to get  a fair price for our timber.  Paying people  to come in and con tribute to the degradation of our public  lands  is absurd. We  should not sub sidize the cutting down of our national  forests.  The Jontz amendment will put an  end to this absurd practice and ensure  that we get fair market value for our  timber. This amendment will protect  our fores ts and help reduce the budget  deficit.  Environmentalists and the National  Taxpayers Union probably don't agree  on many issues, but they agree that we  should not subsidize the destruction of  our national forests.

237,House,102,0.551,114,14,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong opposition to this amendment,  which  further  reduces  timber  sales  from  the national  forests.  Just  last  week, it was announced that two more  sawmills in my northern California dis trict will close because of lack of tim ber supply, bringing the statewide mill  closure total to 25 in the last 21h years.  The author of this amendment claims  it will reduce Federal spending, but in  fact it will decrease Federal revenues  and add to the deficit. It would reduce  Federal timber sale revenues by an es timated S27 million,  income tax reve nues by $41 million, and payments to  counties by $6.6 million. The unem ployment benefits for  the 5,400 addi tional workers who would  lose  their  jobs would cost $14 million. By at tempting  to  save $16.8 million,  this  amendment actually would cost  tax payers an additional $82 million-I urge  my colleagues to defeat it.  ",1992
238,House,102,-0.084,114,14,Mr. STALLINGS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in strong opposition to the Jontz  amendment. It would devastate Idaho's  timber communities.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in opposition  to  the  Jontz  amendment which would  cut  $16.8 million, or 1 O percent, from the Forest  Service timber sale program.  This amendment will only cloud the exist ence of many rural, timber dependent commu nities of my State. And,  if  the  impacts on  these communities aren't enough, the amend ment will further stall our efforts to ensure the  health of Idaho forests.  If  approved,  the Jontz amendment would  further slash the  timber sale program which  has already seen a major cutback. Both the  administration and  the House Appropriations  Committee have reduced timber sale program  funding by $30 million, and timber related for est road construction by $39 million.  These cuts will result in a 24-percent reduc tion  in timber sale volume levels from the fis cal year 1992 levels. An additional 1 0-percent  cut in funding would jeopardize jobs and de crease Federal revenues without justification.  Even  in  these difficult fiscal  times, the Jontz  amendment  goes  beyond  all  reasonable  standards of frugality.  For my own State of Idaho, we have already  closed several mills  in  the past few years.  These closures cost nearly 300 industry jobs  and hundreds more  throughout many  local  communities. The proposed cuts will mean the  loss of 1,800 more jobs. In addition, the cuts  will cost us another $3.3 million  in Federal  payments for local schools and counties.  Mr. Jontz has tried to link this cut in the tim ber sale program to the  issue of below-cost  timber sales on national forests. Report  lan guage already accompanying H.R. 5503 al ready directs the Forest Service to implement  its below-cost sales policy. This directive is in  step with  the recent recommendation of the  House Agriculture Committee which has con ducted extensive hearings on this issue in the  past year.  The Federal  timber sale program provides  thousands of jobs in every region of the coun try and affordable wood products for all Ameri cans. The program further returns tens of mil lions of dollars to the Federal treasury in tim ber sale  revenues and  income  taxes every  year.  The Jontz amendment is an unjustified as sault on a program whose belt has already  been tightened. Again, I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.  ",1992

I rise in opposi tion to the Jontz amendment and in  support of the substitute that will be  offered  by  our  colleague,  the  gen tleman from Washington [Mr. DICKS].  The important thing is that, as the  subcommittee attempts to find an an swer in dealing with below-cost sales  that, in fact, we do not short circuit  that process by dealing with, attempt ing to deal with, this on the floor in an  ari bi tary manner.  So I will support the gentleman from  Washington  [Mr. DICKS],  in his  sub stitute and oppose the gentleman from  Indiana [Mr. JONTZ].  PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  ",1992

242,House,102,0.256,127,14,Ms. MOLINARI.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise today  in support of the bill H.R. 5503 and commend  the chairman and the ranking member for their  work on this appropriations bill.  Specifically,  I want to thank the committee  for  their  inclusion of a desperately needed  project in my district. A project that the Na tional Park Service made their No. 2 construc tion priority nationwide.  I am speaking of the  Great Kills Bathhouse at the Great Kills unit of  Gate Way National Park, a facility that has lit erally been washed out to sea.  The Great Kills Bathhouse was built in 1951  on reclaimed land. The facility is now in immi nent danger of collapse because  the  soft  coastal ground has been seriously undermined  by erosion. Nearly half the bathhouse stands  on 20 feet of exposed pilings.  The  term bathhouse  is misleading. Until  OSHA closed the building earlier this year, the  bathhouse  contained  the  park  police  sub station, maintenance shop and garage,  food  concession  facilities, public restrooms, visitor  center, environmental education classrooms,  and other essential services. Some of these  services have moved to makeshift structures,  others have been curtailed altogether.  The $7.9 million  included in the committee  bill will help the Park Service complete design  and start construction of replacement facilities.  For the more than 1 .2 million yearly visitors to  Great Kills,  this project  is essential. Without  these new  facilities,  the potential of this na tional treasure in our urban setting cannot be  realized.  I appreciate all the committee has done to  provide for the Great Kills facility, and I again  commend you for your work on this legislation.  ",1992

245,House,102,-0.43,140,14,Mr. SWIFT.," Mr. Speaker, there is a  quality here of a high school debate in  which you get points for misdirecting.  You get points for using lots of rhetori cal tricks.  We must not lose sight of the basic  points. I have made them, and I have  made them before. Let me make a cou ple more.  Someone referred to the Ethics Com mittee. Let me tell you what the Eth ics Committee does. Their committee  records are only made public if charges  are filed, and only such records as the  committee authorizes. That is rule 10.  The committee's policy has not been to  release depositions and raw investiga tive details. This  is consistent with  House rule XI(k)(s) providing that tes timony  tending  to  defame  shall  be  taken in executive session.  The task force, in fact, was function ing on a parallel course with what the  Ethics Committee does, not like every  other committee of the House as has  been charged.  One  last point,  the gentleman over  there  raised  the Justice Department  investigation  into  this  issue, and  it  just occurred to me, not being a  law yer, I did not think of it before, but I  suspect that if we just take all of this  stuff and dump it on the street, there is  going to be something in there the Jus tice Department would like very much  to not have made public. We could be  jeopardizing the Justice Department's  case by this rash action.  ",1992
246,House,102,0.371,140,14,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  find  it amazing  that  the  gentleman from Washington is now so  sensitive at this point about the De partment of Justice's concern about  raw information when, once again, the  Democrats' report contains investiga tive data that the Department of Jus tice asked not to be released.  I would ask the chairman of the com mittee, in your report, you have a por tion of the Chief Kerrigan testimony  which  is  stamped  exhibit 2,  and  it  starts on line 10, omitting the first 10  lines of testimony and in addition all  of  the pages have been whited out.  Could the gentleman assist me and tell  me what page exhibit 2 is on  in the  Kerrigan testimony, and what has been  whited out in the first 10  lines? The  second sheet is similar in that it has  the last 18 through 25 lines whited out,  and also the pages number whited out.  ",1992
247,House,102,-0.322,140,14,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker, as a  member  of  the  task  force  which  brought forth the report yesterday, it  was my hope that when we not only  adopted the reports at the full commit tee, but also brought forth a privileged  resolution sending the report and tran script  to  the Ethics Committee and  also to making them available to the  Justice Department, that we had put  the issue behind us, and hopefully, it  was my remarks yesterday,  that we  could move forward and do the business  of the people.

249,House,102,-0.502,153,14,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlemen very much,  the gen tleman from California  [Mr. DREIER]  and my good  friend,  colleague,  and  leader, the gentleman from Massachu setts [Mr. MOAKLEY].  And I thank the Committee on Rules  for their rule, and I think that it has  helped to shape this debate so that the  major issues, with the exception of the  retransmission issue, will be out here  on the floor, and I know  that many  Members  are  disappointed  that  the  transmission issue will not be out here  today. But I think most of us believe  that it is absolutely essential that a re transmission consent provision be  in  the bill that is sent to the President  for signature, and I can guarantee the  Members that we are going to work to[Mr.  ward that effort. I especially say those  words to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  ECKART] and the gentleman from Texas  [Mr. FIELDS] who have dedicated a good  part of the last year toward that effort.  The gentleman from Michigan  DINGELL] and I have worked with our  staffs over the last year to shape this  bill. We have worked as closely as pos sible with the minority, with my good  friend, the gentleman from New Jersey  [Mr. RINALDO] and the gentleman from  New York [Mr. LENT]  to bring a piece  of legislation to our colleagues.  Now  there are disagreements;  there  is no question about it. The Lent sub stitute, to a very large extent, is going  to frame  those choices for this body.  Now whether it be blockage of foreign  ownership of the cable system of our  country,  tougher regulations,  tougher  consumer protections,  increased com petition, which this bill has, the must carry provision which protects  tele vision  stations against being moved  around  indiscriminately  or  just  bounced completely off the cable net work completely;  this bill has a  long  list of provisions which contrast sharp ly with the minority substitute which  the gentleman  from New York  [Mr.  LENT] will be making. It is my hope  that since 1984, Members in this body  understand  that, although, with  the  best of intentions, there was a deregu lation of the cable industry. It was for  the purpose of getting the technology  out as quickly as possible,  into  the  hands of as many Americans as pos sible. Right now cable goes past 90 per cent of the homes in America and 65  percent of all Americans subscribe to  it. So,  the  technological benefits are  out there now.  Now  the question is: Do we return  and clean up some of the unintended  consequences which have manifested  themselves over the last several years?  We  think that the proposal which we  bring to our colleagues here today does  that, and it does so in a judicious way.  The  issues that were unresolved, pri marily this issue of access which the  amendment  of  the  gentleman  from  Louisiana [Mr. TAUZIN] brings out here  to the floor,  is one which ultimately  will be determined in the course of the  debate today.  Mr. Speaker, I think the chairman of  the Committee on Rules and the mem bers on our committee have done a  good job in framing those issues for the  body. I think by the close of the day  today we will be well on our way to  constituting  a  telecommunications  policy for the 1990's, and I would hope  that this body would give some respect  to  the product which came out by a  vote of 31  to 12 out of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce. We worked  long and hard on this bill, and at the  end of the day today I think we will be  completing the House procedure  that  will then allow us to go to conference  and to put a bill on the desk of the  President.  It  is highly controversial  and highly technical, but in the end we  are protecting consumers, we have aug mented competition, we are protected  against  the  foreign  takeover of  this  vital communications network in our  country and, we think, produced a good  bill for consideration today.

The gentleman is a  fine  and valued member of the committee  and a great Member of this body.  However,  the gentleman has offered  the House a very bad amendment, and  I urge the House to reject it. This is es sentially a Potemkin Village which is  offered to us, all facade and nothing be hind.  First of all, what the gentleman does  is offer an amendment which does not  really  afford  any  requirement  that  there be any regulations to protect the  viewers of cable television. But beyond  that,  the gentleman very specifically  and emphatically strips the bill  in a  way which  is  interesting  to behold.  Some 19 pages of legislation are  re duced to 4. The parts which are dropped  are interesting.  First, the gentleman eliminates the  bill's protection of the viewer with re gard to remote controls. The bill re quires that remote controls be charged  for  fairly;  the gentleman eliminates  that. The same with  regard  to con verter boxes.

Mr.  Chairman,  the  Manton-Rose  amendment offers  the House a  clear  choice between our reasonable and bal anced approach to program access and  the  far  reaching,  radical  approach  taken by my  friend,  the gentleman  from Louisiana, [Mr. TAUZIN].  The Manton-Rose  amendment  is  a  strong but reasonable access  to pro gramming amendment that recognizes  the need to promote competition in the  multichannel video marketplace with out abusing  the  legitimate rights of  video programmers.  Our amendment is virtually identical  to  the program access provision con tained in the cable reregulation legis lation  that unanimously passed  the  House during the lOlst Congress.

During consideration of  this resolution, all time yielded is for  the purpose of debate only.  Mr. Speaker, as we have heard read  by the Clerk, House Resolution 522 is a  modified open rule providing the con sideration  of H.R.  4312,  the Voting  Rights Language Assistance Act  of  1992. The rule provides for 1 hour of  general debate,  to be equally divided  between the chairman and ranking mi nority member of  the Committee on  the Judiciary.  The rule makes in order the Judici ary Committee amendment in the na ture of a substitute as an original bill  for the purpose of amendment.  Only  those amendments printed  in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  prior  to  today will be in order and will be de batable for 20 minutes each.  The  resolution  also waives  clause  2(1)( 4) of rule XI, requiring an inflation  impact statement in the committee re port, against consideration of the bill.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  the rule pro vides for one motion to recommit with  or without instructions.  H.R. 4312 amends section 203 of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 and reauthor izes it for 15 years. Section 203, which  expires on August 6, provides for bilin gual voting assistance in jurisdictions  where a  language minority is at least  10,000 persons or 5 percent of the popu lation and  is of limited-English pro ficiency.  Recognizing  that  language barriers  to voting still exist, H.R. 4312 was introduced by the Hispanic caucus, and,  under the excellent leadership of Chair men BROOKS and EDWARDS of the Judi ciary Committee, is before us today.  Mr. Speaker, the right to vote is so  fundamental  to  our  citizenship,  so  vital, that we as Members of Congress  must make every effort to ensure that  this right is a reality across the length  and breadth of this great Nation.  Last month we approved legislation  to increase voter participation. Today  we have before us reauthorization of  the bilingual language assistance sec tion of the Voting Rights Act. Later we  are scheduled to consider  the Voting  Rights Extension Act.  We have a responsibility to the peo ple of America to remove as many bar riers as possible to effective voter par ticipation. The lack of proficiency in  the English language is one such bar rier which has been addressed in the  Voting Rights Act  since  1975  and  should not be forgotten or ignored now.  Bilingual voting assistance is still des perately needed.  ",1992
256,House,102,-0.407,231,14,Mr. BROOKS.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in support of the rule making in order  the consideration of the bill H.R. 4312.  As we will discuss at greater length in  the Committee of the Whole, H.R. 4312  reauthorizes an important provision of  the Voting Rights Act of 1965 providing  for assistance to citizens who speak a  language other than English.  The bill extends the language assist ance section of the Voting Rights Act  for 15 years. Currently, a  jurisdiction  must provide  targeted voting assist ance-including  registration  informa tion, ballots and instructions-if 5 per cent of its voting age citizens belong to  a  language minority and are not pro ficient in English.  I am pleased that the rule makes in  order all amendments printed  in  the  RECORD before the House begins consid eration of H.R. 4312. I believe the Rules  Committee has crafted a fair and work able rule for the consideration of this  important bill, and I urge adoption of  the rule.  ",1992
257,,102,-0.256,257,14,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, the Wall Street  Journal recently ran an article describing the  Central  and East European  Law  Initiative  [CEELI], a program which is sponsored by the  American Bar Association. CEELI  provides  United  States  legal  expertise  to  nations  throughout Eastern Europe and the former So viet Union as  these nations restructure  their  legal systems. Critical to the success of CEELI  is the principle that lasting political reform de pends on a stable, respected, and well-func tioning system of law.  CEELI attorneys have already helped to ad vise nations  in  the  redrafting of commercial  codes, judicial procedural rules, and even na tional constitutions. Even though CEELI does  receive a modest amount of Federal funding,  the cost to taxpayers  is very small since all  the American attorneys who participate in the  program do so without compensation. CEELI  is an excellent example of a public and private  partnership providing an  important service to  new democracies.  I support programs of this  type which maintain America's  role as  the  leader of the free world, and I encourage my  colleagues to learn more about CEELI.  [From the Wall Street Journal, June 12, 1992)  UNITED STATES LAWYERS ARE WELCOMED BY  RUSSIA  (By Jonathan M. Moses)  American lawyers, often reviled at home,  are getting a warm reception in Russia. Not  to mention Romania, Lithuania and Bul garia.  Increasingly, U.S. lawyers, judges and law  teachers are offering their services to help  write laws and constitutions for the newly  emerging democracies of the former Soviet  bloc. While many in the U.S. contend that  U.S. lawyers have made a mess of their own  legal system, novice lawmakers in countries  with leftover Marxist legal systems appar ently  think American and West European  lawyers have something to offer.  ""Perhaps we're on a continuum, and the  reputation of  lawyers here  in  the U.S.  is  well-deserved,""  said U.S.  Appeals Court  Judge Richard L. Nygaard, who has advised  constitution writers in Romania, Lithuania  and Bulgaria. ""But there, it's quite the oppo site. They really, truly need more lawyers.""  And the lawyers are coming. From com mittees sanctioned by the American Bar As sociation  to  law  professors  independently  dispensing  legal  advice  as  they  travel  through Central and Eastern Europe,  the  source is as varied as the issues that need  confronting.  Much of the work so far has been in such  non-commercial areas as constitution writ ing. The topics are broad. Civil rights, the  structure of the judiciary and the power of  the legislative and executive branches are all  on the constitutional agenda. Other efforts  have  included criminal and administrative  law reform, as well as a  sister-law school  program  involving at  least  90 U.S.  law  schools and nascent schools in Central and  Eastern Europe.  Andras Sajo, a Hungarian scholar special izing in international law and comparative  59--059  0-97 Vol. 138 (Pt. 14) 9  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  constitutions, says that the U.S.  legal sys tem also has been  influential in technical  areas such as environmental  law, banking  law and securities  regulation.  ""These are  systems that have never been seen before,""  said Prof. Sajo, who will be teaching at the  newly created Central European University  in Budapest.  Prof. Sajo, who was trained as a lawyer in  Hungary, said that other, broader U.S. legal  ideas are more difficult to transfer since the  European Continental tradition has roots in  Central and Eastern Europe. For example, he  said, it is unlikely that the new republics  will give up  the European  judicial system  that limits the power of most judges in favor  of a U.S.-style  judiciary  that gives most  judges a crack at determining the constitu tionality of laws.  One of the most active of the U.S. groups  providing  legal advice  is  the Central and  East European Law Initiative, CEELI, of the  American Bar Association. With  a  pres tigious board that includes Associate Justice  of the U.S. Supreme Court Sandra Day O'Con nor, CEELI has been able to call on the elite  of the American legal profession to partici pate in its programs.  Most of the legal advice is being provided  without charge. To guard against conflicts of  interest, CEELI requires participants in its  programs to disclose any work that they or  their law partners are doing in these coun tries and to agree not to promote their law  firms in the course of providing advice. But  many of the same firms also are looking to ward  the  region  to generate  commercial  business once  the  legal and political  cli mates are ripe.  Often  participants  in CEELI  programs  offer line-by-line critiques of proposed laws  or constitutions. Lawyers and legal scholars  participating in these programs agree that  some of the best advice  they can offer  is  based on the experience they've had at home  about what works and what doesn't. The U.S.  experience shows up in suggestions such as  those made by a  legal counsel to the U.S.  Senate that strict ethical rules be set up for  legislators,  and  those made by  a  federal  judge that women's rights be codified.  But the participants quickly reject the no tion that they're pushing  the U.S. system  over others. ""Frankly, I don't think our con stitutional model  is a very good model.  I  don't push it at all,"" says Herman Schwartz,  a  professor at American University Law  School and a member of CEELI's advisory  board.  Laurence Tribe,  professor at Harvard  Law  School  who  independently  advises  Central and East European nations, says it  would be  the height of ""hubris""  for U.S.  legal scholars to view themselves as ""wan dering James Madisons."" He adds that past  experiences of  legal  scholars writing con stitutions in new republics have proven to be  a failure precisely because the U.S. authors  imposed their own ideas over all others.  Indeed,  the Central  and East European  lawmakers feel free to pick and choose from  the varied choices on the world's constitu tional menu. For example, most of the new  republics appear to favor  the specific  lan guage  in Western European  treaties  on  human rights, as opposed to the more gen eral U.S. Bill of Rights. But it is the U.S.  system of separation of powers, as opposed to  the parliamentary systems of some West Eu ropean countries, that is favored.  Even with the best legal advice the U.S.  has to offer, there's no guarantee that a new  constitution, or law, will be approved. Even  Czechoslovakia, which has strong links with  a  19247  Western intellectuals and which is viewed as  one of the more constitutionally advanced of  the Central  and East European  nations,  hasn't approved its constitution because of  disputes between Czechs and Slovaks over  power sharing.  As for the feeling U.S.  lawyers and legal  scholars have  that they're getting  the re spect  in Central and Eastern Europe  that  they no longer get at home, Prof. Sajo says  that his U.S. colleagues shouldn't let it go to  their heads.  ""They  talk  to other  lawyers  there, that's where that idea is getting rein forced.  They're not  talking  to  ordinary  folks.""

He tries to justify subjective selection of the  other 45 percent of its students as an attempt  to encompass a broad diversity. He claims this  is culturally sound. He asks if this is fair and  answers: ""We think so, and in that sense it is  fair.""  On July 16,  the Los Angeles Times pub lished a letter to the editor from our colleague  DANA  ROHRABACHER  that  demolishes  this  sophistry.  I insert in the RECORD Chancellor lien's arti cle and Congressman ROHRABACHER's letter to  the editor.  I also ask permission to insert another letter  published  the same day  from apparently an  Asian-American high school student denied  admission who tells what he thinks of Chan cellor lien's fairness.  Mr. Speaker, I also insert a letter from Con gressman ROHRABACHER  to Education Sec retary Alexander setting forth the slowness of  the Department  in  investigating Asian-Amer ican discrimination complaints pending at the  Department.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is a continuing problem  that  the Department ought  to act on  imme diately.

263,House,102,-0.487,348,14,Mr. TORRES.," Madam Chairman, this Con gress has had the honor to enact some very  important civil rights  laws, the American with  Disabilities Act and  the Civil Rights Act of  1991 . I ask you, how can we make laws that  prevent gender, skin color, and physical dis ability discrimination for jobs and housing, yet  continue to alienate and discriminate against  half the citizens of this country by depriving  them of one of the most fundamental rights of  democracy,  the  right  to vote? We have a  chance today to correct some horrendous mis takes made to our voting rights laws, to guar antee that all of our citizens are able to exer cise their right to vote.  In  1975, section 203,  together with  two  other  language  assistance  provisions was  added to the Voting Rights Act. Section 203  was added  to  increase  the participation of  American citizens who have problems voting  in English. Section 203 was based upon the  congressional  finding  that  the unequal edu cational opportunities commonly suffered by  limited English citizens often prevent  these  citizens from exercising their right to vote.  The intent of section 203 was to stop a dis criminatory voting practice which violates the  equal protection clause of the 14th amend ment and the 15th amendment's guarantee to  all eligible citizens of their right to vote. The  practice in question is the failure of a jurisdic tion to print ballots in a language other than  English when another language is more fully  understood by a significant number of voting  age citizens. It is unrealistic and illogical to as sume  that people,  regardless of color, have  automatically learned English in school, when  1 in 5 adults in the United States are illiterate.  In the late seventies Los Angeles County was  required to print ballots in Spanish, but that re quirement was  lifted during  the Reagan ad ministration.  Section 203 was amended in 1982 to pro vide new guidelines for language assistance,  this was suppose to ensure that those really  needing language assistance received  it. Un fortunately,  the  formula now used  to decide  who meets the language assistance criteria is  seriously  flawed. Now bilingual assistance  is  determined by an  ill-conceived census ques tion.  A county only has to provide bilingual help  if the census shows that 5 percent of the lim ited English citizenry does not speak English  well enough to make an  informed vote. As a  result, some highly populated areas are no  longer covered because  the  total population  overshadows  the minority communities. For  example, my own county of Los Angeles is no  longer covered.  Even  though Los Angeles County has ap proximately 8 million people which  includes  over 3 million Hispanics, Los Angeles  is not  covered by section 203. According to the cen sus,  the 200,000 voting age Hispanics who  speak English poorly comprise  less  than 5  percent of the Los Angeles County's total pop ulation.  Ballots in Los Angeles County used to also  be printed in Spanish, now ballots in the Los  Angeles area are printed only in English. And,  for the 200,000 Hispanic voters who are U.S.  citizens,  the Los Angeles County ballots are  unintelligible--200,000  people,  that's  four  packed RFK Stadiums; or 4,445 busloads of  people;  it's also half the population of Wyo ming.  All U.S. citizens have a right to be equally  informed, and if need be, ballots need to be  translated in order for them to cast a proper  vote, that is just common sense. Consequen tially, the right to vote has effectively been de nied to a large portion of limited and non-Eng lish speaking U.S. citizens.  The Voting Rights Improvement Act of 1992  would  reauthorize and expand  the bilingual  provisions of  the Voting Rights Act, section  203,  to  require  jurisdictions with  large  lan guage minority populations to provide both bi lingual assistance and material to voters. Sec tion 203 is due to expire on August 6, 1992,  at which  time 68 counties that are currently  covered only by section 203---3 of which pro vide assistance  in  two  languages other than  English-will no longer be required to provide  bilingual voting assistance. The Voting Rights  Improvement Act of 1992 will give all citizens,  including non-English speaking citizens,  the  right  to cast an  independent,  informed vote.  The amendment would also recognize native  American reservation boundaries when deter mining bilingual voting assistance.  Non-English speaking voters need  to be  guaranteed the same assistance and explana tory materials as English-speaking voters.  The Voting Rights  Improvement Act is not  about  immigration or patriotism. The bill  is  about the right of every citizen to be able to  participate fully in their rights of citizenship.  Don't you think that we have a fundamental  responsibility  to ensure  that all citizens have  the opportunity to be part of the voting proc ess and cast an informed vote? We, as legis lators, should do everything  in our power  to  ensure that all citizens of this country will be  guaranteed their right to be part of the elec toral process regardless of nationality or race.

268,House,102,-0.135,387,14,Mr. ANDREWS of Texas.," Mr. Speak er, I oppose this legislation, and I do so  respectfully. We are here today because  the Internal Revenue Service made a  decision. The Treasury Department de cided  that  the bowls have gone over  whatever ill-defined line there is and  should not be entitled to the kind of  tax break they have gotten in the past.  Let me be very clear, the Treasury is  not saying that county fairs, that fund raising activities for cultural events,  that the Olympics in Atlanta, should  not be entitled  to special  tax  treat ment. What they are saying is that the  college bowl system has changed dra matically in the last 10 or 15 years, and  in fact it has changed.  The question from a tax policy stand point is are the bowls given a special  advantage  in  the marketplace  that  their competition might not be  al lowed?  I  think it is a valid question  that our committee has had no hear ings on and that Treasury intends to  have hearings on to try to define for  every organization around the country  what the appropriate standards should  be.  Mr. Speaker,  it is clear  to anyone  with an objective view that what was a  college bowl game has changed dra matically, and in fact the bowls have  moved to be small superbowls as op posed to the bowl system that we have  all grown up to know and care about.  In fact, it is no longer the Sun Bowl  in El Paso  that features  teams from  that part of the country; it is now the  John Hancock, Inc., Bowl. It is not just  the Cotton Bowl anymore;  it  is  the  Mobil Cotton Bowl, and Mobil is writ ten across the field and players have  Mobil insignias on their uniforms. And  in fact other companies have gotten  into the business.  Now we have the Poulon Weedeater  Bowl and the Blockbuster Video Bowl.  These organizations know full well ex actly what they are getting for  their  money.  College athletics in some cases have  become  too  commercialized.  In  the  bowls  it has gone way beyond any  bounds of what is appropriate for edu cation. This has led, unfortunately, to  some very embarrassing situations.  The University of Oregon, the Ducks,  played in the Freedom Bowl and earned  $600,000 for that participation. The uni versity  itself netted $5,000 after  the  bowl game. That is just wrong. That is  not what the bowls should be set up to  accomplish.  The Washington Times reported this  morning that the John Hancock Insur ance Co. bragged  that by sponsoring  the John Hancock, Inc., Bowl, they got  $5.1 million worth of advertising  for  only a $1.6 million investment. That is  not the goal of the college bowl games.  That  is  not what  our  universities  should be all about.  Now, I understand that this bill will  likely pass on the floor tomorrow, and  I understand that it may become law.  Should it not, however, I would hope  that the NCAA,  that the bowls them selves, that the Congress, and that the  Treasury Department,  take a  second  look at what these bowls are about and  see if we can define some guidelines  that would bring them within the gam bit of what  their goals should have  been and have been in the past. I think  that is the only important thing that  we can do.  Mr. Speaker, finally, we learned just  in the last few days how this provision  is paid  for. As  the gentleman  from  Georgia [Mr. JENKINS] stated earlier, it  is paid  for by  taxing affinity cards.  This  is  a  very  important  revenue  source  for many nonprofit organiza tions  across  this country,  including  colleges and universities. The Amer ican Heart Association,  the  Sierra  Club, the National Wildlife Federation,  and the American Rivers Conservation  Council all oppose this bill, and they do  so because of the way the bill is paid  for.  Mr. Speaker, I think we should defeat  this legislation. I think we should go  back to the drawing board. We should  respectively try to make  these bowls  the best that they can be, what they  ought to be, and let us try to make tax  policy that is driven by tax policy con siderations, and not by the fact that all  of us like golf or all of us like college  football, and let us try to make some  decisions that make good sense for the  tax policy and taxpayers of this coun try.

269,House,102,-0.254,387,14,Mr. ANTHONY.," Mr. Speaker, today, we are  considering a proposal  that will  insure  that  countless works of charity undertaken by non profit organizations  in our districts are pro tected from the long reach of the I RS. As you  know, the IRS recently issued audit guidelines  that  for  good  reason  have  sent  a  panic  through the local nonprofit community.  The audit guidelines propose  to  tax cor porate  sponsorship  payments  received  by  local charities. For  instance  if a soft drink  manufacturer sponsors signage or other pro motional material, your local county  fair may  be subject to the new guidelines.  If a charity  is subject to tax, 34 percent of the money re ceived from the sponsor will be diverted from  community service in your hometown and sent  to Washington  in  the  form of taxes. This all  from an administration that prides itself with its  vision of 1,000 points of light as a way to deal  with the mounting social problems facing our  already strapped local communities. How can  these 1,000 points of light work if 34 percent  of their funds are being used to pay Federal  income taxes?  I have joined with ED JENKINS, ROD CHAN DLER, and JIM MCDERMOTT in seeking a solu tion  that merely codifies a U.S. circuit court  case  that the  IRS has chosen not to  follow.  Our solution does not change current law, but  merely provides more certainty to a gray area  of the  Internal Revenue Code. Our bill says  that an event is not ""regularly carried on"" if an  event is held only once a year by the nonprofit  entity and that event does not transpire over  a period  that exceeds 30 consecutive days.  Under current law, if an event is not ""regularly  carried on"",  its  income  is not subject to the  unrelated business income tax.  All of us have a festival, a county  fair, or  other charitable event that benefits the people  back home.  I have a charitable golf  tour nament in my district that has generated sig nificant assistance for Opportunities, Inc. over  the past 3 years.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the full statement of Richard  Neely be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the testi mony was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  TESTIMONY BY JUSTICE RICHARD NEELY, WEST  VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS  (Before  the House of Representatives Com mittee on the District of Columbia, Sep tember 12, 1991)  Thank you Mr. Chairman and  the other  distinguished members of the committee for  the invitation to discuss the impact on the  national law of products liability of the As sault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability  Act of 1990.  For those of us who favor a national law of  products liability, and particularly for those  of us who favor S640 currently under consid eration  in  the United States Senate, D.C.  Act 8-289 is, perhaps, a Godsend. This statute  makes such a mockery of what are generally  thought to be ""legitimate""  tort principles  that D.C. Act 8-289 may succeed in forcing  the Supreme Court of the United States even in the absence of Congressional action to create a new, national common  law of  products liability.  Current American  tort  law, particularly  the law of products liability, rests on three  pillars. D.C. Act 8-289 burdens each and every  one of these pillars to the breaking point.  The first tort law pillar is the constitu tionality of state long arm statutes that per mit plaintiffs to sue out-of-state defendants  in  local courts when  the defendants have  some  ""minimum contact,""  such as doing  business or advertising for customers, in the  plaintiff's home  state. The U.S. Supreme  Court has been surpassingly liberal towards  plaintiffs of late  in  its determinations of  what is sufficient to constitute a  jurisdic tion-giving ""minimum contact.""  The second pillar of modern tort law is the  constitution's full  faith and credit clause  which requires all other state courts to en force  judgments entered under  jurisdiction  conferred by virtue of a long arm statute.  The  third pillar  is substantive  tort law.  Today's tort law is increasingly based on in surance  principles,  so  that  theories  like  strict liability and comparative fault (which  were  thought  unacceptably  radical  just  twenty years ago) are now accepted by the  courts everywhere. These theories,  in turn,  are  premised  on  risk-spreading  insurance  principles and, as a practical matter, tort li ability  is  something against which  every  company with assets insures.  D.C. Act 8-289  is, at late last, an official  codification of what have previously been ei ther thickly veiled or entirely unconscious  schemes that redistribute wealth from out of-state  defendants  to  in-state  plaintiffs  ",1992
273,Senate,102,0.301,504,14,Mr. RUDMAN.," Let me also offer the  Senator  from Kentucky my commit ment that his reservations will be ad dressed before any funding is approved  for this program.  Mr. McCONNELL.  I appreciate  the  chairman and ranking member taking  the  time  to engage  in this exchange.  With their assurances, I am confident  we will find and fund the most reason able, well thought out, and successful  counternarcotics programs for  the re gion  .  Mr: BIDEN. Mr.  President,  I  rise  today in strong support for this bill, in  particular the provisions providing ap propriations  for  the  Federal  effort  against the epidemic of crime and vio lence. As every American knows, a ris ing tide of unprecedented violence con tinues to sweep our Nation. Murders,  rapes, muggings, and criminal assaults  each soared to the greatest-and most  horrible-toll in America's history in  1990. And, the murderous violent crime  toll grew even worse in 1991.  Combating  this  violence must  be  among our Nation's highest priorities.  And, the bill before the Senate today,  makes great strides in that direction.  Let me be clear, the credit for this ef fort must go  to  the Appropriations  Committee,  in  particular, Chairman  BYRD,  Subcommittee Chairman HOL LINGS and Senator RUDMAN.  Because of their efforts, the Senate  has the chance to boost funding to the  FBI by more than $145 million; to boost  funding to the DEA by more than $35  million; to boost funding for organized  crime drug enforcement task forces; to  add 261 more assistant U.S. attorneys  to the fight against violent crime; and  to add $70 million to the President's re quest  for prison  construction  funds.  The Appropriations  Committee  has  found  the dollars  to  fully  fund  the  President's request, and every Senator  should vote in support of this effort.  I would also like to recognize Chair man HOLLINGS' efforts  in a  few key  areas-crime fighting initiatives which  will make a real difference on the front  lines of the national fight against vio lent crime.  Chairman HOLLINGS and the Appro priations  Committee  have  reversed  what I believe  is  the single-most de structive decision  called  for by  the  President's crime budget-his proposal  to slash more than $80 million from the  Justice Department's effort to support  State and local law enforcement.  As every Senator knows, I have long  believed that the Federal Government  must do much more for  the Nation's  State and local law enforcement offi cials-the police officers who do most  of the fighting, and most of the dying,  in  the war against violent criminals.  Because of Chairman HOLLINGS' efforts,  the Senate-by passing  this bill-has  the chance to restore the more than $80  million cut by the President.  In  another high-priority area-the  Weed  and  Seed  Program-Chairman  HOLLINGS and the Appropriations Com mittee have boosted funding to $23 mil lion. This will ensure the second-year  funding for every weed and seed dem onstration site-to $1.5 million-as well  as allow more sites to  join this pro gram.  Earlier this year I introduced legisla tion  to combat one of the most de structive areas of white collar crime the scourge of health care fraud that is  estimated to be robbing the American  consumer  of more  than  $70  billion  every year.  This bill will boost the effort to com bat health care fraud by about 30 per cent-adding $13 million to the FBI ef fort  to  fight  those who would  rob  America's health care system at a time  when a  lean, efficient system is a na tional imperative.

274,Senate,102,-0.2,530,14,Mr. ROBB.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to join my senior colleague, Sen ator WARNER, in introducing a bill to  transfer  title of certain lands  in  the  Shenandoah National Park [SNP] from  the Federal Government to  the Com monweal th of Virginia.  Mr. President, in 1928,  the Common wealth of Virginia authorized the State  Commission on Conservation and De velopment to acquire land for donation  to  the Federal Government  to help  form  the Shenandoah National Park.  With a  few exceptions,  the Common wealth did not retain highway rights of-way.  For  years,  in  recognition  of  the  park's origin, the Park Service allowed  ",1992
275,,102,-0.472,556,14,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, we now have in  writing  from  President Bush's  handpicked  Chief Executive Officer [CEO] of the Resolu tion Trust Corporation [RTC], Albert Casey, a  document  recognizing  that  funding  for  the  RTC would result  in  the embarrassing situa tion that would increase the deficit before the  election. RCT CEO Casey, a man who serves  at the pleasure of the President, has cynically  set the spin that the administration should en gage in at the week's meeting of the Thrift De positor Oversight Protection Board.  Mr. Casey  is  suggesting  that Congress  should be  ignored and that he be allowed to  borrow money  to cover estimated  losses  in  order to shift thrifts from conservatorship to re ceivership.  Appropriately,  Secretary  Brady  rebuffed Mr. Casey's suggestion, ostensibly to  keep faith with a promise he made in the fall  of 1989. I would suggest that Secretary Brady  has made a half-hearted effort to obtain loss  funds, or Secretary Brady would have surely  moved  this  issue  to a priority on  the Presi dent's agenda.  Mr. Speaker, we now have a smoking gun.  The Bush administration is more interested in  the political blame game than the goal of ap propriating funds  for the RTC. The only con cern during this election year is that additional  loss  funds would  increase  the 1992 deficit.  The Bush administration isn't working with the  Congress to address the serious questions of  the RTC operation and the soaring costs.  In stead  there  is public proclamations by RTC  CEO Casey and Office of Thrift Supervision  [OTS] Director, Timothy Ryan,  that the S&L bank crisis is over and finished. The tune they  are happily singing is a forbearance program  for troubled S&L-banks. These lyrics sing the  blues  about Congress-because Congress  didn't provide the Bush administration an addi tional $42 billion in loss funds. The fact of the  matter is that it was Mr. Casey and Mr. Ryan  who would not provide credible answers to the  questions Congress asked to order to change  the tune and the lyrics of the song.  I ask that Mr. Casey's letter and memo and  Mr. Brady's reply be placed in the RECORD.  RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION,  Washington, DC, July 7, 1992.  Hon. NICHOLAS F. HARDY,  Secretary of the Treasury,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. SECRETARY: There is enclosed a  memorandum regarding a possible solution  to  effect  resolutions despite our  lack of  ""less"" funds.  We strongly urge that you call a special  meeting of the Thrift Depositor Protection  Oversight Board for the purpose of discussing  and authorizing  the suggested action. The  preferable dates for this meeting are July 27  and 28 as we shall be appearing with you be fore the Banking Cammi ttees of the House  and Senate on July 29 and August 5. Also,  the afternoon of August 3 is the next regu larly  scheduled meeting of  the Oversight  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  July 27, 1992  Board. I propose to meet individually with  the members of the Board to acquaint them  with the need for this action.  As a separate initiative, we are considering  using part of our $2.5 billion that we have  held for emergencies to receive Home Fed eral in late September.  Sincerely,  ALBERT V. CASEY,  President and CEO.  Enclosure.  RTC has been considering alternative fund ing strategies given  the situation  in Con gress. Every alternative we have been atile to  construct has  resulted  in  the  inescapable  fact that the RTC would obligate the United  States. For example;  If we use notes, no matter how we do so,  the notes will be obligations of the U.S. Gov ernment.  If we draw funds from the Federal Financ ing Bank in excess of our ability to repay, we  will obligate the U.S. Government.  If we buy assets  from our  receiverships  (pay with notes) to advance funds for future  transactions we will not be able to repay the  Federal Financing Bank and again would  create an obligation for  the U.S. Govern ment.  Given the foregoing we would recommend  the following strategy for dealing with the  Congressional impasse. The Oversight Board  in concert with the Department of Treasury  will notify the Congress to the effect:  That the preferred and correct process for  funding the RTC is the U.S. Congress.  That the prospects of congressional fund ing before early next year (late February) is  not  likely  and becomes  less  so  as  time  passes.  As joint custodians of the public welfare,  the Executive and the Congress need to move  the S&L Cleanup forward; it is costing the  taxpayer $2.5 million a day. Since the Con gress is at an impasse the Executive finds  that it must move the process forward not  withstanding the fact  that we believe  the  Congress should provide funding.  Accordingly we are instructing the Federal  Financing Bank to provide less funds to the  RTC so that it may continue the timely res olutions of failed thrifts and a prompt under taking of the obligations of the U.S. Govern ment to insured depositors.  In taking the foregoing action, it is criti cal  that we  are  able  to  take  the  ""high  ground"" with respect to the use of FFB funds  for losses. The key to our position is that it  is clearly the responsibility of Congress and  we have on 1 separate occasion stood by that  belief, but the situation today is unconscion able and we are therefore going forward fully  aware that Congress may seek to prevent our  initiative. We are clearly taking risks:  Deficit increases (before election)  If we can do  this now, why have we on  three occasions not done so?  The deficit increase speaks for itself. The  second risk will be addressed by  the Bill,  that is why we must take the ""high ground""  again, at the outset admit that we are of the  belief that Congress should provide the need ed funds but the administration cannot sit  by and allow  the S&L cleanup to founder.  (We will of course have to demonstrate that  what we are going is legal and not a viola tion of the Constitution i.e. Congress must  appropriate.)  It should be clearly understood that this  initiative will only produce about $12 billion  in loss funds as we will run up against the  debt cap. More funds could become available  as we sell assets. But, $10 billion is the real istic number.  THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,  Hon. ALBERT v. CASEY,  Washington, July 10, 1992.  President and CEO, Resolution Trust Corpora tion, Washington, DC.  DEAR AL: Thank you for your July 7 letter  in which you urge the Oversight Board to au thorize  the Resolution Trust Corporation  (RTC) to borrow loss funds from the Federal  Financing Bank (FFB). This proposal would  allow the RTC to use FFB borrowing to ex ceed the amount specifically appropriated by  Congress  to pay  for permanent  losses  in curred in resolving failed thrifts. As the two  enclosed letters show,  the Oversight Board  has consistently stated, and Congress has re peatedly confirmed, that borrowing from the  FFB  should not be  used  to  expand  the  amount available for losses.  I appreciate your efforts to consider every  possible alternative that will allow the thrift  cleanup to continue. However, I continue to  believe that the best way to do this is to con tinue to urge Congress to provide adequate  funds to the RTC so that the cost to the tax payers can be held to a minimum.  I would be happy  to discuss  this matter  further with you, either upon my return or  at the Oversight Board meeting on August 5.  Sincerely,  NICHOLAS F. BRADY.  TRIBUTE TO MRS. MARGARET  WONG LIM  HON. ROBERT T. MATSUI  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 27, 1992  ",1992
276,House,102,-0.288,569,14,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. ROYBAL].  ",1992
277,House,102,0.12,569,14,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  2 minutes  to  the gentlewoman  from  Maryland [Mrs. MORELLA].  ",1992
278,House,102,0.325,582,14,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of this legislation today and to say  that given our subcommittee allocation it was  the most difficult bill our subcommittee has  ever had  to consider and bring before  the  House. As Chairman NATCHER has noted, our  1993 budget allocation actually allows for 2percent less in outlays than our 1992 bill.  This  forced our committee  to  take a hard  look at evaluating our priorities  for 1993.  In  most cases,  I believe, we made  the  right  choices, especially in emphasizing the need to  provide  for  the health and education of our  children.  Included  in  the bill  is $29 billion  for pro grams at the Department of Education. This  represents  a  6-percent  increase  over  the  amount provided  in 1992. With  these  funds,  the Department provides our local school dis tricts with support for educationally disadvan taged children,  for vocational and  technical  education programs, for special education for  the  handicapped,  for  adult  education  pro grams, and for financial assistance to students  attending college.  For the Department of Health and Human  Services, our committee has provided $9.2 bil lion for biomedical research at the National In stitutes of Health. This  includes special  re search initiatives into breast, cervical, and tes ticular cancer; diabetes and juvenile diabetes;  sudden  infant death syndrome; Alzheimer's  disease,  osteoporosis,  heart  attack,  and  stroke.  The committee also recommends $1.98 bil lion for research, education, and other activi ties directed at the prevention and  treatment  of AIDS,  the greatest health epidemic facing  our Nation and the world. Included in this re quest is $327 million to fund the Ryan White  AIDS care programs to assist highly impacted  communities,  including  the  St.  Petersburg/  Tampa area of Florida which  I represent,  in  providing  treatment and counseling  for AIDS  patients and at risk populations. This is a $50  million, or almost 20 percent,  increase over  the amount available for 1992. It is interesting  to note that 12 years ago, the committee pro vided the first $200,000 for AIDS research.  Continuing  on  ongoing  commitment,  our  committee provided $346 million for childhood  vaccine programs, an  increase of $49 million  or 16 percent over the amount available in the  current year. These  funds are  to help State  and local public health programs to vaccinate  more  schoolage  children  against measles,  mumps, and whooping cough which are totally  preventable diseases  if only we can deliver  the vaccines to children in a timely manner.  To better prepare our children  to begin  school  ready  to  learn, our committee  recommends  funding of $2.7 billion  for Head  Start, a 24-percent or $519 million  increase  over the 1992 level. This will enable an addi tional 90,000 children to be served by the pro gram.  If  the  funding  is enacted at our  rec ommended level, our committee will have  in creased funding for Head Start by $1 .5 billion,  or 120 percent, over the past 4 years.  Finally, the bill provides the funding required  to administer the Social Security and Medicare  Programs. This  includes a $101 million  in crease  in payments to the Medicare contrac tors to meet the anticipated growth in claims  filed by beneficiaries and providers.  Throughout the process of drafting this bill  with such difficult budgetary constraints,  the  members of our committee had to compromise  in a number of areas which made none of us  happy. This  is a bill, Mr. Chairman, which  could use twice the budget allocation we had  to fund all the worthwhile programs within our  jurisdiction.  One of the programs on which  there was  uniform agreement among the members of our  committee was  funding  for the National Mar row Donor Program. Included in this bill for the  National Heart,  Lung,  and Blood  Institute,  which along with the U.S. Navy does an excel lent job administering  this program,  is $26. 7  million  for the operation of  the program,  for  marrow donor recruitment especially in minor ity communities, and for a number of important  research initiatives to improve the rate of suc cess  for marrow transplantation and  to con tinue to expand  the number of diseases  for  which it is a life-saving cure.  Mr. Chairman,  last year  I shared with my  colleagues  two charts showing  the dramatic  growth of this program which should make  every Member of this House proud for the role  they have played in its support. Today, I want  to update those charts to show you  that the  rapid growth and enthusiasm for this program  continues unabated. As you will note, at the  end of June, 642,370 Americans had  taken  the quick and simple blood test required to be  listed in the national registry. This is a 77-per cent  increase  in  the number of volunteers  since I showed you these charts last year. In  fact, during the last quarter, the registry grew  by an average of 33,000 potential donors per  month. Great progress continues to be made  in providing ethnic diversity to the national reg istry. The number of minority donors has  in creased four fold in the past year.  The funds provided by this committee and  the Defense  Appropriations Committee  on  which  I serve, have enabled 46,800 minority  volunteers to be tissue typed and added to the  national registry. In fact, almost one-fifth of the  donors added to the  registry during the past  18 months are from minority populations.  The purpose of this program, and the result  of the hard work of so many heros who have  dedicated their lives to this program, is told in  the growing number of patients who are find ing matched, unrelated donors  through our  registry. They are given hope  in  their battle  against leukemia and more than 60 otherwise  fatal blood disorders. As  the charts  indicate,  through June 30, 1,259 transplants have been  completed utilizing donors  through our  reg istry. Currently, 40 to 50 matched donors and  patients  are  being  brought  together  each  month.  ",1992
279,House,102,0.096,595,14,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise to make a point of order against  the bill under House rule XXI(2)(b).  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will  state his point of order.  ",1992
280,House,102,-0.631,595,14,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Chairman,  I,  too,  rise  reluctantly  to make a  point of  order that  the provision on page 31,  line 19 through line 21, constitutes leg islation on an appropriations bill and  therefore violates rule XXI, clause 2(b)  of the House rules.  This provision would require the De partment of Health and Human Serv ices  to delay payments  to hospitals,  physicians, and other health care pro viders.  This provision would supersede ex plicit statutory requirements  regard ing  timeliness of payments by Medi care provided by sections 1816(c) and  1842(c) of the Social Security Act.  I understand the problems faced by  our colleagues on  the Committee on  Appropriations and  share  their con cerns. The delay of payments to provid ers by Medicare is not, unfortunately,  an appropriate response to this situa tion.  ",1992
281,House,102,-0.346,595,14,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  make a point of order against the pro vision of the bill beginning on page 36,  line 18, relating to the supplementation  of SSI payments which changes exist ing law and constitutes legislation on  an appropriation bill,  in violation of  rule XX!, clause 2(b).  Mr. Chairman, this provision requires  the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to assess a fee on each State  for which HHS administers the State  SSI supplement. The fee would equal  1.67 percent of  the State's total SSI  supplements and would be imposed for  fiscal year 1993. The Social Security  Act permits, and  in  some cases  re quires, States to supplement the Fed eral SSI benefit. States may admin ister  these  supplements or pass  the  funds on to HHS, which then pays them  out with the regular SSI benefit. The  act does not permit HHS to charge a  fee  for this service. Any modification  of existing policy clearly falls within  the jurisdiction of the Committee on  Ways and Means and is a  legislative  matter.  ",1992

286,House,102,-0.385,673,14,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 4  minutes to the CHAIRMAN of the Select  Committee on Hunger, the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. HALL].  ",1992
287,House,102,-0.28,673,14,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I  want to thank the distinguished chair man of  the  subcommittee,  the gen tleman  from Michigan  [Mr. KILDEE],  and I want to thank the distinguished  chairmen and members of the Commit tees on Education and Labor, and Agri culture for  their support in bringing  House Concurrent Resolution 302 to the  floor so quickly. It was only on April 1,  that Representatives  BILL  EMERSON  and ROBIN TALLON  joined 'me in intro ducing this proposal, originally incor porated  in  the Freedom From Want  Act, as a freestanding bill.  We have a pretty grave hunger situa tion in America. One in ten people re lies of food stamps and every month  thousands more  file  applications  for  benefits. The U.S. Conference of May ors reported a 26-percent  increase  in  the demand  for emergency  food  last  year and the situation promises to be  even more dire this year. Only 55-per cent of the low-income women, infants,  and children eligible for WIC actually  get benefits. One in five children live in  poverty-stricken  households. And  28  percent of all poor people get no Fed eral help at all.  These facts clearly show that despite  the many aid programs out there, we  have still got some serious gaps.  I really wish that Federal anti-hun ger policy worked better. But even if it  did; even if it was the model of perfec tion; and even if we had all the money  in the world; that policy, alone, would  not be enough to solve the problem.  We need to forge a partnership with  community leaders. We need the help  of private citizens. And, we need  the  support of individual communities be cause the war on hunger can only be  won on their turf.  The hunger-free communities bill be fore us today is designed to stimulate  local  involvement. It proposes a com prehensive, coordinated plan of action  for  combatting  community  hunger  problems and provides a yardstick  to  measure achievement.  I am not saying  that Federal and  State  governments  should  abdicate  their responsibility to help needy citi zens. And  I am not advocating  that  communities go the fight alone. But, I  do believe that we need a partnership  between the Government and the com munity.  The  hunger-free  communities plan  seeks to put the different resources of  communities to better use.  I applaud  the work currently in progress at the  grassroots level. But, in my travels as  chairman of the Select Committee on  Hunger, I have seen where we can im prove  these  efforts. Each  individual  group is performing well in providing  59-059  0-97 Vol. 138 (Pt. 14) 22  its own services. But, in many cases,  they have never considered their poten tial as a unified front. United together,  they can do more  than change  their  comm uni ties,  they  can  become  the  constituency  that  makes  existing  antihunger services more effective and  more responsive.  I also know that communities want  greater  involvement  in  the  fight  against hunger, but  they need some  guidance. I can say this with some au thority because  to date, more  than  1,500  community  leaders,  activists,  elected officials, and nonprofit organi zations  have  contacted  the Hunger  Committee requesting the hunger-free  community guidelines proposed in this  bill.  By passing House Concurrent Resolu tion 302 today, we will confirm our in terest  in  their efforts and  let  them  know that we support what they are  trying to do.  ",1992
288,House,102,-0.386,673,14,Mr. ESPY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in strong support of House Concurrent  Resolution 302,  legislation which will  play an  important  role  in  the  fight  against hunger.  The emphasis of this bill is on stimu lating local concern, and on shifting  that concern  into action. It involves  everyone-local government, churches,  community groups, charitable groups- everyone who has a stake in their com munity and wants to make their com munity a better place for all to live.  Mr.  Speaker,  hunger  is  a  serious  problem  in  this Nation. One  in  ten  Americans now  receives food stamps.  Eighty precent of all food stamp benefits go to families with children. About  14 percent of Americans live below the  poverty  line-but  that  rate  is much  higher  in my  home State  of Mis sissippi,  the poorest State in the Na tion, where 26 percent of our residents  live in poverty.  I believe.that the grassroots-level ap proach  contained  in  this  legislation  can be successful. When surveyed  in  January of 1992, 6 out of 10 Americans  stated that hunger in America is a very  serious  problem. Even more  impor tantly, 7 out of 10 Americans reported  volunteering  time  or  contributing  money or food  to programs that feed  the hungry.  So the motivation is out there. The  concern is out there. The commitment  is out there. The hunger-free commu nities legislation will act as the vehicle  to bring all of these elements together  into an effective coalition  to attack  hunger at the local level.  Mr. Speaker, we know that this legis lation will not end hunger in America.  The Federal Government still has a  major obligation to the disadvantaged  in this country. But despite  the fact  that  there  exists  a  vast  array  of  Federal-and State-sponsored programs  to respond to this problem, hunger still  exists in America. This legislation will  act as a blueprint for community ac tion. Through 14 specific steps, such as  setting up gleaning programs and pro viding nutrition education programs,  communities can comprehensively ad dress local hunger problems and take  action on them. I believe that this ap proach deserves a place  in  the fight  against  hunger.  I  strongly  support  House Concurrent Resolution 302.  ",1992

",1992
291,House,102,-0.044,699,14,Mr. GREEN.," I  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my  colleague, the gentleman from Florida  [Mr. BILIRAKIS]  in holding this special  order today to mark with pain the 18th  anniversary of the Turkish invasion of  Cyprus.  As is well known, on July 20, 1974,  tens of thousands of Turkish troops in vaded the independent Republic of Cy prus, resulting in the displacement of  nearly 200,000 Greek Cypriots. Today,  some 35,000 Turkish troops remain ille gally on Cyprus, prohibiting that na tion from finding a political solution  to its problems. As a result of the inva sion, nearly 40 percent of the total ter ritory of the Republic of Cyprus came  under Turkish military  occupation,  territory which accounts for 70 percent  of the economic potential of the island.  For years, Congress has been united  in deploring the continued division of  Cyprus. Despite our best efforts, how ever, the crisis for that island nation  remains unresolved. With the cold war  over, the United States must truly step  up the pressure to reach a solution to  outstanding regional problems such as  this. Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish,  deserve to be free of the hostilities that  have plagued their land for nearly two  decades.  Turkish troop presence on Cyprus is  unjust and in violation of international  law. The situation has dragged on for  18 years without resolution, leaving a  nation divided and a population embat tled. The international community has  repeatedly condemned the Turkish occupation of Cyprus, and several U.N.  resolutions have called for the imme diate withdrawal of those troops. Cur rently,  the U.N. Secretary General is  conducting peace talks to attempt to  bridge  the differences between Greek  and Turkish Cypriots in hopes of fi nally resolving the conflict. I commend  the U .N. Secretary General for his good  faith efforts and his commitment  to  achieving progress on the Cyprus prob lem, and I urge the United States to  continue its strong support of the U.N.  effort.  Unfortunately, Turkey has consist ently refused to say whether it is will ing to withdraw from territories it has  occupied since its 1974 military inva sion and  to allow  the Greek Cypriot  refugees to return to their homes. Tur key  is a major beneficiary of United  States aid, receiving over $800 million  in fiscal year 1991 alone. We must use  that aid as leverage to achieve a Turk ish withdrawal from Cyprus. Since the  1974  invasion of Cyprus by Turkish  troops, the United States has provided  over $6 billion in military aid to Tur key, and yet virtually no progress has  been made in convincing the Turks to  cease their occupation of Cyprus. Be cause I find this situation so disturb ing, earlier this year I introduced legis lation, H.R. 4399, to withhold all United  States military and economic aid  to  Turkey so long as that nation contin ues to occupy Cyprus illegally. I take  this opportunity to encourage my col leagues who have not already done so  to join as cosponsors of H.R. 4399.  A  deeply  troubling  humanitarian  issue remains unresolved as well. 1,619  individuals, including 5 Americans, re main missing  and  unaccounted  for  since the 1974 invasion, and Turkey has  so far, failed to provide any evidence  on  their fate. Those individuals were  known to be alive and in the custody of  the Turks after the cessation of hos tilities, but remain unaccounted for to  this day. The painful problem of Cyp riots disappearing must be solved.  In short, our message is simple-Tur key must  remove  its  troops  imme diately, so that all parties may work  toward a peaceful resolution of the Cy prus problem. We must let the Turkish  Government know loud and clear that  finding a solution to the division of Cy prus is paramount in defining the fu ture of United States relations with  Turkey.  Let me close by expressing the hope  that next year Congress can convene a  special order at this time not to decry  the ongoing problem of a divided Cy prus, but rather to celebrate Cyprus'  unity,  independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity.  Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gen tleman  from Florida  [Mr. BILIRAKIS]  for his leadership on this issue.  ",1992

",1992
295,Senate,102,0.551,1102,14,Mr. GRAMM.,"  I  thank  the  distin guished chairman of the Finance Com mittee.  Mr. President, I always enjoy listen ing to our colleague from New Jersey.  I have to say the last time I looked we  were not short of NBA players and  since the candidate of the party of our  colleague  from New Jersey wants  to  cut defense  intelligence by a  billion  dollars, I submit we are not short of  people who can or would work at the  CIA. But the provision that we are de bating today is about the fact that we  are short of oil and gas in America pro duced at home at a price consumers,  industry and farmers can afford to pay.  Second, I want to correct one point,  and that is, we are not adding a billion  dollars to the deficit. There is a cor responding revenue increase to pay for  this  tax change. The bill before us  would be subject to a 60-vote point of  order if it were not revenue neutral,  and while we are talking about chang ing  tax policy, we  are not  talking  about raising the deficit.  Let me say a little bit about the al ternative minimum  tax because our  dear colleague from New Jersey and I  are 180 degrees apart on this issue.  I do not believe  that we ought  to  have an AMT.  I agree with our col league that our Tax Code contains pref erential  treatment.  I  think we give  people tax benefits for a lot of things  we ought not to give it to them for. I  The  from  would very much like to see us change  some of these things and lower rates.  But the problem with AMT is that we  provide incentives with one hand and  then we come back in under the table  and take them back. We say the Fed eral Government  ought not  to  tax  cities by taxing interest paid on munic ipal bonds and,  therefore, municipal  bonds sell at a discount because their  interest is tax free. But then we come  in through the backdoor with AMT and  try to seize some of the benefits we  have given the cities. If we are going to  give them the benefit, let them have it,  and let it encourage people to buy mu nicipal bonds. But we ought not to be  coming in through the backdoor. I sub mit that while AMT may be good polit ical policy, it is not good tax policy.  I wish the day would come when we  could debate tax policy in terms of en couraging people  to pull  the wagon  rather than lamenting the fact that if  America is saved it is going to be saved  at a profit.  Quite frankly, I do not think Amer ica is going to be saved unless it is at  a profit, and I do not understand people  who  love  investment but-to  para phrase  a Democratic  candidate  for  President-hate the people who engage  in investing.  I do not hate poor people. I do not  hate rich people. I want more people to  be rich, and I want the people who have  money to put it to work, and that is  what the debate is about.  Let me talk about energy. If we were  talking about a program-and we have  thousands  of  them-to  spend  tax payers' money to help some industry,  very few people would be talking about  unfairness. But somehow  the concept  of incentives, a concept that is accept ed in all the world-is rejected only in  Cuba and North Korea and here  in  Washington-is somehow wrong.  Here is the problem in a nutshell. If  you look at this chart, you see what  has happened  to exploration expendi tures on discovery and development of  new natural gas and oil by our inde pendent producers.  Well, what has happened is that in  the last 10 years our expenditures have  fallen by three-fourths.  If you look at what has happened to  drilling for oil and for natural gas is  that both have fallen through the floor.  What we are trying to do is very sim ply this: We want more energy from re liable domestic  sources  to  turn  the  wheels of industry and agriculture. We  can provide a very strong incentive for  a very modest change in the Tax Code  by exempting a portion of the expendi tures for drilling from the alternative  minimum tax. We do it only for inde pendent producers with a very minor  benefit for the larger companies. Quite  frankly, I wish we could do it across  the board. This is a change that needs  to be made  because America needs  more oil and gas produced at home.  ",1992

299,House,102,-0.292,1219,14,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  commend our chairman, the gentleman  from Michigan, on the outstanding job  he has done as chairman of our sub committee and in putting together this  bill.  Since assuming his position in Janu ary  1989,  he  has made  some  hard  choices  in developing priorities, and  this year has certainly been no excep tion. It has been my honor to serve on  the  subcommittee of  the gentleman  from Michigan, Chairman  TRAXLER,  and to benefit from his guidance and  his leadership. He has always been fair  and open minded  in all his dealings,  and his manner and conduct set an ex ample for all public officials.  But he is also a strong chairman, and  he has wrestled with a stringent do mestic discretionary allocation to suc cessfully bring to the floor a balanced,  responsible menu of budget priorities.  Our outlay allocation was $447 mil lion less than the President's request,  and the outlay increase we did receive  was predominantly consumed by prior  year outlays, leaving only $350 million  for program increases to take care of  burgeoning  veterans  medical  care  costs, HUD programs, the environment  and vital technological investments.  It is only our chairman's knowledge  of all the programs in our jurisdiction  and his sincere respect and apprecia tion for the mission and work of this  committee that has allowed us to meet  the most dire needs of this country  while maintaining budget discipline.  Mr. Chairman, the House will be los ing  a  tremendous asset  in  January  when  the gentleman  from Michigan,  Chairman TRAXLER  retires. But I can  assure  the chairman  that his knowl edge and handling of his responsibil ities will have a positive, lasting influ ence on  this subcommittee and  this  House  for many, many years, and  I  wish him well.  ",1992
300,House,102,0.351,1219,14,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today to talk about this appropriations  bill.  I am not a member of the sub committee but I am a member of the  full committee. During the course of  the last couple of years I have become  involved with people at  the Depart ment of Housing and Urban Develop ment and others in some aspects of this  bill.  Today I want to concentrate on two  issues: First, which was discussed  in  the rule, but I think deserves more dis cussion, is the adequacy or inadequacy  of  funding  for home ownership pro grams; second, I want to talk about the  funding  for  programs  for  environ mental cleanup along the border.  Taking the first issue,  there was an  amendment Mr. ESPY and I asked to be  made in order. But, the Committee on  Rules decided not to make it in order.  This body agreed it should not be made  in order. That amendment was to in crease funding for the home ownership  program.  HOPE  is a program which permits  low-income minority people to have an  opportunity to share in the American  dream, to own just a little piece of eq uity in the American dream, by owning  their own home. That was turned down,  and so  today we have a freeze at last  year's level.  Now, we are going to hear from mem bers of the subcommittee and others  how grateful, how grateful this admin istration and those who believe in this  program should be  that the program  got frozen at last year's amount. But  HOPE is authorized at nearly 3 times  this amount by the Congress. Now, we  are told we should be grateful that it is  being  funded  at  one-third  of  that  amount.  This  is a program of the  future.  I  think everybody  in  this body knows  this. We can stand here and hold our  hand up against the tide of water, but  we really cannot stop what is clearly  the way we will go with housing pro grams in the future.  The Democratic  Party  recognized  that. It is in their platform, the plat form  they adopted  in New York.  It  says, home ownership opportunities for  poor people, for minorities, should be  increased. And that is all we are ask ing, a chance to enact one piece of the  Democratic  platform,  by  increasing  those opportunities  for home owner ship. We do not take a dollar from any  other funding. We do not reduce any  other program by any  amount, but  simply by  taking money from carry over funds to add to the home owner ship program.  That is what this body ought to do,  and that is one of the reasons why I  think this bill is so poorly structured.  ",1992
301,House,102,-0.35,1219,14,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to commend the chairman of the sub committee, the gentleman from Michi gan [Mr. TRAXLER] and the gentleman  from New York [Mr. GREEN]  for their  leadership  in bringing a  bill  to  the  floor which  is $4.2 billion under  the  President's request and falls within the  budget caps, which is the real issue for  us, certainly, on this subcommittee.  I want to say to the gentleman from  Michigan, our distinguished chairman,  how very much we appreciate his work,  not just this year but in prior years as  chair of  this  subcommittee. We  are  going to miss him very, very much. I  think that the people of this country  who have been benefited from his care ful work will also miss him.  D 1350  For those of us who are junior mem bers on the subcommittee, he has al ways treated us with respect, with at tention, and with courtesy, and taught  us much about how  to serve  in  this  Congress. I think this particular bill is  a last tribute to his efforts.  I commend the chairman of the sub committee, the gentleman from Michi gan [Mr. TRAXLER] and gentleman from  New York [Mr. GREEN] for their leader ship  in bringing a  bill  to  the  floor  which is $4.2 billion under the Presi dent's request  and  falls within  the  budget caps. Having received only a 5  percent increase for fiscal year 1993, we  are barely keeping up with  inflation  over last year's discretionary spending.  Mr. Chairman, we are all well aware of  the  tough choices  the Appropriations  Committee has had to make; I believe  that  the VA, HUD,  and  Independent  Agencies Appropriations Subcommit tee, because of the diverse interests we  serve, has to make some of the hardest  decisions with respect to our Nation's  priorities.  As the chairman mentioned, because  of a lack of outlays the subcommittee  was left with only $350 million for any  increases  for all programs. The sub committee has given VA medical care  the  highest  priority-a  decision  I  wholeheartedly support. There are few  that can argue against adequate fund ing for our Nation's veterans. By pro viding for the President's full request  for medical care, it was necessary to  hold some programs to fiscal year 1992  levels  or  the  President's  request,  whichever was lower, as well as provide  additional  funding  through  outlay  enhancers  in  the VA  and HUD  ac counts. These actions were not ones  that the subcommittee wanted to take  but became necessary in our attempt  to prioritize programs.  Mr. Chairman, we will later take up  an amendment  to delete  funding  for  the space station and I hope to address  the House later on that issue. However,  ",1992
302,House,102,-0.218,1232,14,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Chairman,  I support  the  committee's  recommended appropriation  for  the hazardous substance Superfund. The ap propriation of $1.416 billion represents a re duction of $200 million-12 percent-from last  year's appropriation and a reduction of $334  million-19  percent-from  the  President's  budget request.  I support the basic goals of the Superfund  Program, and  I believe  that  it  is  imperative  that we move swiftly to clean up the Nation's  most hazardous toxic waste sites. As it is cur rently  functioning,  however,  the Superfund  Program  is not moving swiftly, and  the only  ones cleaning up are lawyers and the contrac tors hired by EPA, who take 2 to 3 years to  complete studies of Superfund sites and an other year or 2 to restudy them.  On June 11, 1992,  the Subcommittee on  Oversight, Committee on Ways and Means,  held a hearing on  the Superfund Program.  What we learned at this hearing  is most dis couraging. The Superfund Program is just not  working.  The costs of this program are staggering.  The average cost to clean up a Superfund site  is $25 million, and this figure could  increase  as more complex sites are readied for clean up. At the hearing, the General Accounting Of fice testified that the revenue to be raised by  the Superfund taxes authorized through 1995  is  only  a downpayment on  an  enormous  cleanup bill, and will not come close to paying  for  the cleanup costs of  the Nation's  toxic  waste  sites.  The  Environmental Protection  Agency has estimated  that  its share of  the  cleanup costs of the current Superfund sites  could approach $40 billion. Others have esti mated that this figure could reach $300 billion.  Meanwhile, more sites are continually being  added to the national priorities list. By the end  of  the decade,  there could be as many as  2,000 Superfund sites.  In my view, we haven't gotten much cleanup  for the $1 O billion that has been spent so far  on the Superfund Program. During the first 11  years of the Superfund Program, only about  80 sites have been cleaned up. The remaining  1, 195 sites on  the national priorities  list are  stuck  in  the Superfund pipeline, and years  pass while the sites are studied and restudied,  and evaluated and reevaluated. The majority  of sites are  in the earlier stages of the pipe line.  The Congressional Budget Office  testified  that, on average, over 9 years elapse between  the  time a remedial  investigation  is  first per formed at a Superfund site and the time the  site is finally cleaned up. Despite the fact that  EPA has now had 11 years of experience in  dealing with Superfund sites,  the CBO  indi cated that the average time taken to clean up  a site is on the increase. Part of this delay is  due to the  fact that EPA takes an  inordinate  amount of time to review documents.  In one  case  in Michigan,  involving  contaminated  drinking water, it took EPA over half a year to  review a work plan, another 3 months to ap prove revisions to the work plan and another  8 months to approve a quality assurance plan.  When EPA  takes so much  time,  the health  risks posed by the sites may worsen as pollut ants seep  into groundwater and contaminate  the surrounding environment.  Four Superfund sites visited by  the sub committee-BROS, GEMS, Clarmount Poly technic,  and Paoli Railroad Yard-illustrate  how operation of the Superfund Program re sults in inordinate amounts of studying, litiga tion, and delays-with questionable benefits to  the public. For example, the BROS site was  one of the  first sites  listed on  the NPL, but  cleanup started only last year. The GEMS site  has over 500 parties involved in litigation.  I am very concerned  that  the Superfund  Program  has  been  poorly managed. The  Superfund Program was based on  the prin ciple that the polluter should pay for cleanup  costs, and the trust fund was  intended to be  a sort of revolving fund that would be replen ished by recoveries of trust fund expenditures  from the parties responsible for the pollution.  Of the $10 billion  in  total trust fund  receipts  through  fiscal year 1991,  less  than 5 per cent-about $400 million-have resulted from  recoveries from responsible parties.  Moreover, EPA has done a poor job manag ing its accounts receivable. The inspector gen eral testified that 90 percent of the receivables  were delinquent. After sampling 300  trans actions, the inspector general found that in 51  instances, totaling more than $5 million, EPA  did not even know it was owed money until it  received a check.  In addition, the IG testified that EPA treats  the network of contractors used to carry out  the Superfund Program as part of  the EPA  family. Contractors lucky enough to be a part  of this buddy system are frequently given ex tensions to complete tasks, are rarely subject  to penalties, and are sometimes given bo nuses even though work performed may have  been substandard.  In Pennsylvania, a contractor authorized an  employee  to begin welding operations even  though explosive gases were present at  the  site. Despite this instance of deficient perform ance,  this contractor was  rated satisfactory,  and given an award fee of $15,000. The GAO  testified that EPA has also picked up the tab  for such nonallowable indirect contractor costs  as alcohol at company parties and travel ex penses for spouses of contractor employees.  On the basis of the testimony at our hear ing, I have concluded that the Superfund Pro gram, as it is currently structured, hasn't been  successful. I support the Appropriations Com mittee's $200 million cut in the Superfund Pro gram. Let us hope that this action will make it  clear that the Congress demands more for its  money.  It's unconscionable to continue to  increase  Superfund appropriation  levels when we can  show the public so  little in return.  It's time to  take a good hard look at exactly what we're  getting for our money, and whether this pro gram  itself  is even worthwhile.  If EPA can't  make the Superfund Program work efficiently  and effectively  to eliminate  the health  risks  posed to the public, maybe we need to scrap  the program and start all over.  ",1992

305,House,102,0.591,1297,14,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this seems like small  potatoes compared  to  the billions of  dollars we have been talking about this  evening. But I do think there is a prin ciple involved here that I would like to  speak to in a moment.  This amendment would delete $1.8  million which  is earmarked  for  the  continued support of the Classroom of  the Future at Wheeling Jesuit College  in West Virginia. Distinguished  col leagues, give me a break. When $7.5  million for  this project  turned up  in  last year's budget, neither NASA nor  the Jesuit college had any idea what  the intended purpose was. The Jesuit  college allegedly had just two comput ers on  the campus at that time, yet  they were being asked to be the show place for computerized education.  Since  then NASA has worked with  the Jesuit college and has reportedly  worked this classroom into something  that it can support. I am not sure, how ever, given  its other needs  it would  support an endowment of $1.8 million  for  the Classroom of the Future. As  with CIESIN,  this appropriation was  not subject to any hearings, was not  authorized by an authorizing commit tee, and was not asked for by NASA. It  just appeared, and I do not think it is  any surprise that it appeared in West  Virginia.  Let  me  quote  from  Chairman  BROWN'S statement on October 2, 1991,  when we were discussing  this. Chair man BROWN of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee said,  It includes $7.5 million in continued fund ing for the Wheeling, West Virginia Jesuit  College. I do not believe anyone in Congress  or in NASA knows what this will be used for.  Therefore,  I move  the amendment  and ask that my colleagues support the  deletion of these funds.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  The CHAIRMAN. Does any Member  seek recognition in opposition to the  amendment?  ",1992
306,House,102,-0.656,1310,14,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  oppose the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in  representing  to  this House  that  the  HOPE Program  is,  indeed,  a  sham.  There are any number of questions you  can raise about this program.  First of all, we need to question why  we give Jack Kemp the opportunity to  use a lot of discretionary money, run ning around this country talking about  an experimental program when, in fact,  it is more a political program than it is  a home ownership program.  We need also  to question, after we  have given money  to  those  in public  housing projects to purchase these pro grams, after 5 years who is going to re pair the roof? Who is going to take care  of the plumbing?  Mr. Speaker and Members, it would  make good sense  to me  if we  talked  about assisting people with  jobs and  job  training. It does not make good  sense  to me  to  talk about giving a  grant to own a home to people who do  not have a job ..  This program is, indeed, a sham, and  I would say to ali of you that you need  not support this motion to recommit if  we want to talk about how we empower  people in America; we will talk about  how we will have an infrastructure pro gram, public works program, and pro grams that will get people johs so that  they can, indeed, buy their own homes.  And guess what, Mr. Speaker? If we do  that, maybe  the  same people would  want to buy a home next door to Jack  Kemp instead of the housing project.  ",1992
307,,102,0.739,1323,14,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  a  moment  to  congratulate  Mayor  O'Malley and the residents of Hoffman Estates  on the completion of the Children's Advocacy  Center. The center is a shining example of un selfish dedication toward improving the lives of  our children. The community of Hoffman Es tates has worked very hard to create a safe  place  for sexually molested children so  that  their special needs can be met.  The completion of this project is credited to  the many different groups who rallied together  for its success. Under the direction of Mayor  O'Malley, government, unions, and local busi nesses worked together. Hoffman Estates offi cials have agreed to rent the facility to the Ad vocacy Center for $1 a year which will allow  the social service agency to hire an additional  full-time social worker. Laborers from the var ious Cook County building trades have volun teered their time to work on the center free of  charge while  local businesses have donated  the necessary materials.  The center provides services  for children  and other family members when .sexual and  physical abuse has been suspected. In addi tion, the center also helps obtain evidence for  the police and court officials  through  inter views coordinated between the child and a so cial worker that can be viewed through  two way mirrors. This allows  for  the child  to  tell  their story only once and thus avoid the stress  of interviewing with multiple strangers.  I commend Hoffman Estates  for  their ac complishment and applaud  their generosity  and dedication to this worthy cause.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  CONGRATULATIONS TO WILLIAM  ""BILL"" GOODE  HON.

Bill Goode began serving his country with  the 40th Infantry in Korea from 1952-53. For  30 years, Bill has been a dedicated member  of the Petersilge-Velock Post 809 VFW in Lit tle Ferry. As post commander in 1987, he at tained the title of all State post commander. In  addition to receiving the high title of all Amer ican district commander, Bill was named the  co-captain of  the all American district com manders team in 1990. He was also elected to  the office of judge advocate of the Department  of New Jersey VFW  in June 1991. Just e  months ago, Bill was chosen by acclamation  at  the State convention  in Wildwood  to  the  prestigious position of State junior vice com mander.  Bill Geode's tireless efforts  toward helping  his fellow veterans have been admirable and  inspirational. He has  exhibited  tremendous  leadership  qualities  and  great  dedication  throughout all of his endeavors. Not only has  Bill shown a strong commitment to his fellow  veterans, but he has also displayed an ever lasting commitment to his country.  I am proud to join  in paying tribute to Bill  Goode. I am sure he will continue to provide  invaluable service to his community and truly  make a difference in society. l extend my best  wishes to him on this most special occasion.

309,House,102,0.443,1336,14,Mr. HASTERT.," Mr.  Speaker,  last  night we stayed here to extraordinary  hours  to  spend money on programs  that sometimes are in doubt but yet to  deny  the American people  the Amer ican dream  to own  their own home.  That was done under the cloud of the  midnight hours so today we can stand  before this House and carry on the po litical chicanery that goes on and on  and on in this body. And we have heard  words like ""chutzpah,"" from the other  side.  That is a  term, I guess, that says a  person has audacity.  I  think  there  is audacity when we  start to talk about family values and  the Year of the Children and what we  have  to do  for  the American  family  when  that  same  group  of Members  want to take away the viability of the  life of a child before he  is born. The  very basis of families. It is chutzpah  when we talk about trying to balance  the budget over here but yet deny the  line-item veto and the balanced budget  amendment.  I think it is time that we get down to  business and pass  legislation  that  is  good for  the American people and let  us leave the politics out of it.  CONGRESS MUST ACT ON  CHILDREN'S INITIATIVE  (Mr. DE LA GARZA asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr.  DE  LA GARZA. Mr.  Speaker,  nothing is more important to fulfill the  American dream than to have a job for  the breadwinner in the family. Nothing  can more strengthen values  than for  the breadwinner  to have a  job. They  cannot buy a house unless they have a  job. But nothing is more important for  our future than our children.  I believe our Nation cannot afford to  delay action on proposals to deal with  the problems of childhood, childhood  hunger, child abuse and neglect, and  family disintegration. That  is why  I  support H.R. 5600, the children's initia tive.  I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port this legislation. The scope of the  Mickey Leland bill which was approved  by  the House Committee  on Agri culture has been  reduced and  incor porated into H.R. 5600, which has the  needed revenues to address the issue.  I  thank my colleagues, and  I urge  them to support H.R. 5600.

315,,102,-0.429,1531,14,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor a distinguished pioneer of genetic bi ology, Dr. Barbara McClintock. Dr. McClintock  recently celebrated her 50 year of affiliation  with  the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and  her 90th birthday.  Although Dr. McClintock modestly avoids  the  fame which her work might easily have  brought her, there is nothing modest about her  achievements. She worked alone, in a field of  corn,  for decades, and revolutionized genetic  science by providing that individual genes can  jump,  rather  than being rigidly placed within  the genetic code. This discovery was so far  ahead of  its  time as  to predate Dr. James  Watson's discovery of the structure of DNA.  Dr. Mcclintock was awarded the Nobel Prize  for Physiology or Medicine in 1983.  Dr. McClintock also pioneered the very par ticipation of women in genetic science, enter ing the field at a time when most women were  not allowed to major in it. Genetics was a field  so misunderstood at the  time of her discov eries  that  they brought questions about her  sanity long before she received her due credit.  Her perseverance against obstacles both of  social  convention  and  of  scientific  theory  stands as a model to us all.  [From The New York Times, July 26, 1992)  ABOUT LONG ISLAND: A VERY PRIVATE  LEGEND  (By Diane Ketcham)  Her colleagues rank her with Galileo and  Mendel. Yet few Long Islanders know of the  living legend in their midst.  Dr. Barbara McClintock is the Greta Garbo  of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The  outside world rarely sees her or hears about  her. That suits her fine. She may share a  place  in history with Marie Curie, having  won the Nobel Prize single-handedly, but you  will not hear the story from her. This Long  Islander shies away from publicity.  In a field of corn she changed the science of  genetics. A few hundred yards from that field  she still lives and works. Quietly, assumedly.  With nary a word to Barbara Walters or The  National Enquirer.  ""Dr. McClintock is a very private person,""  Nathaniel Comfort of the  laboratory said.  ""But reporters leap from private to her being  lonely and not having any friends. That's not  true. She has loads of friends.""  They just don't happen to be reporters. So  the  public m'ay  not  be  aware  that Dr.  McClintock  recently  celebrated her  90th  birthday and 50th year at Cold Spring Har bor.  ""It was a very quiet  intimate birthday  party,"" said a friend and nextdoor neighbor  at the lab, Joan Pesek. ""We could have in vited 600 people, but Barbara would have  hated it. So there was about 30 people. But it  was such a special party, because she got the  book.""  For her birthday a  collection of essays  from her friends and colleagues was put to gether in ""The Dynamic Genome."" The 400page book, a mixture of science and senti ment, is heavy on science, which is how Dr.  McClintock's life has been.  ",1992

320,,102,0.103,360,18,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, in the after math of the devastation caused by Hurricane  Andrew, The New York Times published a  very thoughtful article on Sunday, September  13, 1992, airing concerns about the impact of  an even worse potential natural disaster, a  giant earthquake.  Titled  ""How Big a Disaster Can  Insurers  Survive?"",  the piece carried comments  from  leading experts making a very strong case for  Federal action before  the  fact. As  the noted  scholar, Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the  Brookings  Institution was quoted as saying:  ""The key question is whether we are going to  prefund these disasters.""  If we do not act ahead of time and the ex pected catastrophic earthquake strikes a major  urban area, the ramifications will extend well  beyond the locale of the quake, as the Times  article  illustrated. Prudence and  logic dictate  the necessity  for a social  insurance mecha nism that puts money aside for a rainy day, as  Mr. Litan so aptly described it.  Mr. Speaker, such a proposal already ex ists. It is H.R. 2806 which is currently pending  in the House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee. Similar  legislation  (S. 2533) has  been introduced in the Senate. The legislation  would make earthquake insurance more wide ly available and affordable to homeowners in  seismically active areas  than  it  is now.  It  would also create a Federal earthquake haz ard reduction program, the first of its kind ever  considered on a national basis, that will save  lives and  reduce  injuries.  In  addition,  the  measures contain provisions that would speed  the economic recovery of earthquake-stricken  communities.  As a principal cosponsor of the bill, which  had a hearing as  recently as August 11,  I  strongly urge my colleagues to consider join ing the more than 60 Members of the House  who already have signed on  to the bill and,  more importantly, carefully consider doing the  same when a  revised version  is  introduced  early in the next Congress.  Hurricane Andrew was a terrible calamity for  south Florida. But a catastrophic earthquake not if but when it comes-will make the impact  and cost of Andrew pale  in comparison. We  simply cannot wait until matters become worse  before we act.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask to insert at this point in  the RECORD  the referenced New York Times  article and a sidebar accompanying it for the  information of my colleagues.  [From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 1992]  HOW BIG A DISASTER CAN INSURERS SURVIVE?  (By Peter Kerr)  As insurers add up the damage wrought by  Hurricane Andrew, what  is striking is not  only the unprecedented size of the losses but  also  the frightening  thought that  the  toll  could have been much worse. Now American  insurance companies and regulators are ask ing troubling questions: Just how big a natu ral disaster is possible? And is the insurance  system strong enough to endure it?  For more than a decade, some large insur ers say, they have been horrified by the pros pect of a giant earthquake in a major city perhaps  the size of the quake that struck  San Francisco in 1906. Such an event. some  economists argue, could result in insurance  claims of $40 billion or more, and it could re sult in widespread insolvencies and a disrup tion of insurance markets across the coun try.  Now, even as it appears that claims from  Andrew's damage may climb above $8 billion,  many industry leaders say the private insur ance system can easily survive a beating  from the most expensive storms.  But one executive, Maurice R. Greenberg,  chairman  of  the American  International  Group, recently voiced his dissent. ""If An drew had hit the south coast of Long Island,""  he  said,  ""you would no  longer have  the  strongest  insurance  industry,  you would  have  the  longest insurance industry-some  companies would be flat on their backs.""  Less than two weeks before Andrew struck  Florida, Congress held hearings on a bill that  would make the Federal Government a rein surer to the insurance industry in the case of  giant earthquakes.  As bad as Andrew was, the insurance com panies involved appear equipped to pay their  policyholders.  The  companies  that  an nounced  the  largest  losses-State  Farm,  with an estimated $1.5 billion in claims, and  Allstate, with $1.2 billion-have plenty of  capital on hand, analysts say. The worldwide  system of catastrophe reinsurance, in which  insurance companies pass on a certain part  of their losses to reinsurers who in turn pass  on some of their losses to their own reinsur ers, appears to have worked well.  But a study last year prepared by Howard  Kunreuther and Neil Doherty, two professors  at the Wharton School of the University of  Pennsylvania,  found  that in  the case of a  very severe earthquake,  the  insurance sys tem would not fare so well. The study made  projections about the impact of a quake of  8.3 on the Richter scale occurring at midday  in San Francisco  and assumed  insurance  losses in 1987 dollars of $40.3 billion. Of 18  companies studied, five would become insol vent and all would experience  losses of 10  percent or more of their surplus, or capital.  Based on limited data, the authors said they  believed  the reinsurance market would be  hit even more heavily.  Perhaps the most significant  impact for  the nation would be a sudden reduction in  the availability of insurance after such an  earthquake, said Robert E. Litan, a senior  fellow at the Brookings Ifistitute in Wash ington, who has also studied the issue. Insur ance companies are limited in the amount of  new insurance they can write by their levels  of surplus: a company can write no more  than $3 of insurance for every $1 of surplus.  ""The real big one comes and lops off $40  billion or $50 billion in capital from an in dustry with a capitalization of $159 billion,""  Mr. Litan said. ""You are going to see a na tional cutback in coverage. Many people, a  lot of smaller businesses, nonprofit concerns  just wouldn't be able to buy insurance.""  Other industry-sponsored studies have esti mated that insured damage from a very large  earthquake in Los Angeles would be $40 bil lion or more, and similar losses might be ex pected in some of the 30 other states that  seismologists say are vulnerable  to earth quakes. A severe quake along the New Ma drid fault in the Midwest, as happened in the  last century, for example, could be particu larly damaging  to  a  city  like Memphis,  where building codes have not been adapted  for earthquakes as they have in California.  In California,  the anxiety of scientists is  growing. Four years ago the United States  Geological Survey said there was a 60 per cent probability  that a huge quake would  strike the southern end of the San Andreas  fault within 30 years. But after a quake of 7.4  in southern California in June, some experts  expect a big earthquake much sooner.  Until recently, insurance industry studies  indicated  that  the  largest  likely damages  from  severe  hurricanes would be  signifi cantly  smaller  than  those  from  a  severe  quake. One reason earthquakes are more ex pensive is that large commercial buildings  like high-rise office towers can be destroyed  by earthquakes but survive high winds.  Nonetheless, coastal development between  1980 and 1988 alone increased insured value  along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts by an es timated  70  percent.  Last  year,  D.G.  Freidman, who heads  the Natural Hazards  Research Program for  the Travelers Insur ance Company, presented a paper in which he  estimated  that Hurricane  Hugo,  which  caused $4.2 billion in insured damages when  it hit offshore islands and the Carolinas in  1989, would have cost insurers roughly $20  billion if it had hit New York City.  Even if the private insurance market could  withstand such a blow without insolvencies,  Andrew is likely to make safety experts con sider including hurricane damage in a Fed eral insurance program, said James L. Tay lor, the assistant administrator of the Fed eral Insurance Administration, a part of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency. A  hurricane or earthquake program, he said,  would require localities to set standards for  making houses more resistant to disasters.  To deal with the insurance consequences of  the largest earthquakes, a House bill backed  by  insurance companies and sponsored by  more  than 60 members of Congress would  create a national program of earthquake in surance for homeowners, sold  through pri vate  insurance agents. Like  the national  flood insurance program, an earthquake pro gram would  establish  ""mitigation  stand ards"" to improve building codes around the  country.  The bill would also create a  reinsurance  pool for insurers to pay part of the losses on  a big quake. If the pool were exhausted, in This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

321,,102,-0.436,373,18,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday six of my colleagues and  I introduced  a resolution of disapproval of the President's  proposal to sell 72 F-15's to Saudi Arabia.  I am deeply disappointed by the President's  action. The planes he proposes to sell to the  Saudis are  the most sophisticated ever ex ported by  the United States. Their sale will  amost certainly set off a new round in the Mid dle East arms race.  Indeed, according to the New York Times,  the United States and Israel are already talk ing about an arms package to offset the F15's. Israel clearly will require an offset pack age to ensure that it retains a qualitative edge  in  the region. Thus  the arms race  is perpet uated.  I had hoped that the President had learned  from his disastrous experience with  Iraq that  the path to peace in the region lies through a  commitment to arms control, not unrestrained  arms sales. Lasting peace in the Middle East  will  come  through negotiation, not  through  arms sales.  That is certainly the lesson the President in dicated that he had learned when he pledged  to halt the flow of arms to the region following  the war. Then-Secretary of State James Baker  even told Congress that:  The time has come to try to change the de structive pattern of military competition  and proliferation * * * and  to  reduce  the  arms flow into an area that is already over militarized.  However, since  the Gulf War alone, we  have  sold more  than $16 billion worth of  weapons to the nations of the Middle East.  The President has chosen  to subordinate  our national security interests to his own politi cal  interests.  In doing so, not only does he  make the Middle East a more dangerous and  volatile place, but he also  forfeits any moral  leadership the United States might be able to  exert on other arms suppliers  to halt  their  sales of weapons to the region.  How can we possibly go to Britain, France,  Russia, or China and pressure  them  to halt  their arms sales if we are not willing to do so  ourselves?  Proponents of the sale will argue  that this  sale does not upset the balance of power in  the  region or heighten  the danger of war.  Taken  in  isolation  they may be correct. The  problem, however, is that none of these sales  are occurring in a vacuum.  They are,  instead, part of a headlong rush  by the nations of the region to buy and deploy  newer, more sophisticated, and more deadly  weapons systems. Viewed as a whole  this  postwar arms race undoubtedly increases the  danger of war and the prospect that the next  Middle East conflict will be more deadly and  catastrophic than the last.  This is not an easy sale for me to oppose.  Thousands of my constituents have lost their  jobs as the aerospace  industry has following  the end of the cold war. Approval of the sale  could save 1 ,000 jobs in my State.  ",1992
322,House,102,0.398,386,18,Mr. NICHOLS.," Mr. Speaker, yester day, Congress took action to stop price  gouging by  the Nation's  only unre stricted monopoly-the cable compa nies which overcharge subscribers an  estimated $6 billion a year. The result  was  one  of  the  most  important  consumer measures in years.  The cable companies waged a war of  scare tactics to derail this legislation.  Why? Because it will set limits on rate  increases. They've risen at a  rate of  more than three times the rate of infla tion since 1986.  The best way to lower cable rates is  through  competition. With  competi tion, cable rates are an average of 30  percent  less  than where  there  is no  competition.  Without  competition,  cable  companies have been  able  to  raise rates in order to increase profits.  In Congress, we are sent here to rep resent the ordinary people, not the spe cial interest groups. We have heard the  cries of consumers all across America.  Thanks to our actions yesterday,  the  cable subscribers of America now have  a voice.  this  And what have we gotten for  taste of the good life?  A few minor convictions.

324,House,102,-0.32,386,18,Mr. WISE.," Mr. Speaker, I listened to  a discussion a  little while ago in the  Committee on the Budget on what is  called the present economic situation.  It is not quite a recession, so is it stag nation? Is it contained growth? Is it a  growth recession? Somebody called it a  contained depression.  My answer is, in commonsense terms:  ""It's in a rut, and it's in a  long-term  rut. It's the lowest growth record since  Herbert Hoover, has the worst job cre ation record since World War II"".  The President bashes Congress  for  deficit spending, but never points out  that Congress  presently  has  appro priated $12 million less than what he  has asked for. The gross private invest ment in this Nation is the lowest since  the Depression. We  are  investing 12  percent. The Japanese, even  in  their  doldrums,  are  investing  30  percent.

I bring this event to your atten tion because this unit is located in the shadow  of our Nation's Capitol in Riverdale, MD. Mem bers of the unit come  from  the surrounding  metropolitan area and  include our own staffs  and the Congressional Research Service.  The  outstanding  accomplishments of  the  354th Civil Affairs Brigade  in  the gulf war  earned  them  the  coveted Joint Meritorious  Unit Citation and numerous other commenda tions.  The brigade had major  roles and  respon sibilities during the defense of Saudi Arabia in  Operation Desert Shield and the liberation and  restoration of Kuwait during Operation Desert  Storm, and  in providing humanitarian assist ance to Kurdish refugees  in  Iraq and Turkey  during Operation Provide Comfort.  Beginning  in December 1, 1990, brigade  members began working with Kuwaiti ministry  officials in Washington, DC, as part of the Ku wait Task Force  in planning for the provision  of emergency and restoration services follow ing the liberation Kuwait. On December 11 an  advance party was deployed to Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia,  in support of HQ, Central Command  Air Forces. On January 20, 1991  the main  body arrived in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, to sup port the VII Corps. Within hours of the allied  sweep through Kuwait, members of the Kuwait  Task Force began arriving with convoys of re lief supplies to begin relief and restoration ac tivities. On April 28, 1991  the Brigade began  to redeploy to lncirlik, Turkey, in support of the  Kurdish  refugees  in Operation Provide Com fort.  The brigade performed a full range of civil military  operations  activities  throughout  the  theater: minimizing civilian  interference with  military operations; providing host nation sup port and purchasing of goods and services  from  the  local economy;  functioning as  local  government liaison while negotiating for  local  water sources; planning for and stockpiling hu manitarian relief supplies; planning for and ad ministering dislocated civilian  [DC] camps  in  southern  Iraq  and Saudi Arabia,  including  camp construction, food distribution, and medi cal care of DC's; assisting military police  in  enemy prisoner of war [EPW] screening, intel ligence gathering and analysis;  targeting and  overlay development;  reestablishing security  and public services  in allied occupied areas;  directing port support activities,  including co ordination of the off-loading of cargo vessels  and  forwarding of equipment and supplies to  the VII Corps beddown  location  in Dhahran  and AI Khobar, Saudi Arabia.  In Turkey and northern  Iraq  the brigade  worked directly with  the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], USAID  Disaster Assistance Response Teams, allied  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  forces and many private voluntary relief orga nizations, in bringing refugees out of their high  mountain  retreats where  they could be pro vided with access  to humanitarian  relief and  security arrangements  in  temporary camps,  and eventually  returned  to  their homes. The  brigade engaged in developing an  infrastruc ture for forward bases and distribution of relief  supplies and in establishing security arrange ments  in  coordination with  local  Iraqi and  Turkish military  commanders  and  govern mental authorities.  The men and women of the 354th Civil Af fairs Brigade can justifiably take great pride in  their gulf war accomplishments.  SSG Alston, Patricia.  SPC Andrew, Benita.  SGT Arroyo, Nancy.

340,,102,-0.174,1179,18,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay tribute to an exceptional and caring orga nization that has been working for 40 years to  better  the  lives of  the developmentally dis abled  and  other  handicapped  persons  in  Schuylkill, Carbon, and Northumberland Coun ties, PA.  I am glad to tell my colleagues that  United Cerebral Palsy of Schuylkill, Carbon,  and Northumberland Counties [UCP] will cele brate its 40th anniversary of serving on Sep tember 26, 1992.  In 1952, Mrs. Mal Bartram and other par ents in and around Pottsville, PA, were deeply  concerned about the lack of services and op portunities for their handicapped and disabled  children. They recognized a need to unite and  bring their talents and  resources  together  in  order to help their disabled children live more  productive and rewarding lives. Through dedi cation  and  perseverance,  these  concerned  parents formed an organization that eventually  grew into the United Cerebral Palsy of Schuyl kill, Carbon, and Northumberland Counties. In  October 1953 UCP held  its  first diagnostic  clinic, and 1 year later the first class for handi capped children  in  the Pottsville School Dis trict met at Mount Hope School.  Mr. Speaker, in 1962 Habilitation, Inc., was  founded to serve as the vocational rehabilita tion program of UCP. Habilitation's first focus  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  was on arts and crafts, but within 1 0 years  participants  in Habilitation's programs were  serving as a key supplier for many businesses  in the community and across the country.  UCP and Habilitation are committed to pro moting the general welfare of the developmen tally disabled and other handicapped  individ uals  in Schuylkill, Carbon, and Northumber land Counties. UCP and Habilitation operate  training  centers,  sponsor and  promote  re search, and mount an educational campaign  to keep all citizens aware of the needs of the  disabled and handicapped  in  their commu nities.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to come  before the House of Representatives and con gratulate UCP and Habilitation on its 40 years  of proud, effective, and compassionate serv ice. I also know that my colleagues join me in  saying thank you to the many remarkable peo ple who have made UCP and Habilitation into  the outstanding organization it is today.  THE FAMILY INVESTMENT ACT  HON. PATRICIA SCHROEDER  OF COLORADO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 21, 1992  ",1992
341,Senate,102,-0.142,1257,18,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, one of  the purposes of this defense bill is to  appropriate money  for  programs  to  ease  the economic and social disloca tion associated with the conversion of  the defense sector of our economy  to  civilian purposes. A provision  in  the  Defense authorization bill is designed  to allow retired or discharged military  servicepersons  the opportunity  to  in still in our Nation's youth a commit ment to national service.  We have two pools of immense, and  largely untapped, human resources in  this country: the talented service men  and women whose skills are no longer  needed in the military, and the enthu siasm  and  promise  of our Nation's  youths who are seeking for a way to  contribute to their society. A few gen erations ago, the country faced a simi lar situation. During the Great Depres sion, we  had  scores  of unemployed  adults with knowledge and skills that  they wan ted to share, and we had a new  generation eager to learn. We therefore  addressed an economic and social crisis  with  a  straight-forward,  action-ori ented approach  that used both  these  groups:  the  Civilian  Conservation  Corps.  Our current proposal builds on this  idea and establishes a new CCC. We es tablish a Civilian Community Corps,  designed  to  revitalize  our  commu nities, many of which are suffering eco nomically and socially from  the clos ing of military bases or other aspects  of the downsizing of our Armed Forces,  and designed to serve as an alternative  route for young people  to serve  their  country. This provision enjoys broad  bipartisan support; Senators KENNEDY,  NUNN, DOLE, WARNER, WOFFORD, MI KULSKI, SIMON, DOMENICI, REID, DIXON,  McCAIN, and SEYMOUR cosponsored the  amendment  that was  accepted  last  week on  the authorization bill. It is  based on S. 2373, the Community Works  Progress Act, which has several addi tional cosponsors,  including Senators  INOUYE,  DASCHLE,  LEVIN,  BENTSEN,  PRYOR,  ROBB,  HOLLINGS,  BINGAMAN,  DECONCINI, SPECTER, and CRANSTON.  I  particularly  appreciate  Senator  INOUYE's support of this provision. It is  my understanding from  the chairman  of  the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Defense that some of the money ap propriated for programs designed to fa cilitate the defense conversion will be  used  to  establish  a  demonstration  project of  the Civilian Conservation  Corps-a  federally  run,  residential  youth  service program-and  to  fund  nonresidential youth service corps that  will be administered by  the Commis sion on National and Community Serv ice.  I  look  forward  to working with  Senator INOUYE and the other cospon sors of this provision to ensure that the  CCC and the other youth service pro grams play a role in decreasing the dif ficulties associated with the changes in  the military sector of our economy.  The federally run, residential compo nent of this program is based on the Ci vilian Conservation Corps established  during the Great Depression. The CCC  of the 1930's took 3 million young peo ple, supervised or joined by 250,000 vet erans of World War I, and put them to  work on  the  land. They became  the  innovators of the largest conservation  and  natural  resource  revitalization  program in the history of the United  States, working in the Nation's parks,  forests, national monuments, wilder ness and private lands. In the space of  9 years, the CCC developed more than  800 State and National parks, 4,000 his torical  structures,  60,000  buildings,  38,500 bridges, and 97,000 miles of roads.  They planted 4 billion trees, stocked 2  billion fish, stopped erosion on 200 mil lion acres of land, and spent 4 million  man-days fighting fire and floods.  Similarly, the new CCC is designed to  offer our Nation's youth a chance  to  develop  their sense of national pride  and to allow military personnel a vital  role  in  this process as mentors and  teachers. We expect that enough fund ing will be appropriated  to establish  several CCC  camps  throughout  the  country, each one housing and teaching  200  to 300  young people. These  camps will be located at military bases  that either are closed or have excess  capacity as a result of the defense con version.  The CCC offers those talented mili tary people who are being forced into  early retirement because of changes in  the world to take up leadership roles  again. The CCC will be led by a retired  military officer and other professionals  who can provide leadership to the cadre  of teachers, many drawn from a pool of  retired, discharged or inactive service persons,  and  to  the  young  corps members. The Director will receive ad vice and resources from a variety of  Federal entities, including the Depart ment of Defense and the Department of  Labor.  In addition,  the Director will  draw on the advice and experience of  many who have been  involved in the  youth service movement on the local  level.  Moreover, the National Guard will be  involved in the CCC,  in part because  the CCC will provide an opportunity for  participants  in  the National Guard  Military Youth Corps to continue their  national service. As Senator NUNN ob served last week, this program reincor porates  and builds on  the National  Guard Youth Opportunities Pilot Pro gram that is going to be tested in two  States and that is targeted at youth at  risk-unemployed,  high  school  drop outs between the ages of 16 and 18.  Although I am convinced that a fed erally  run,  residential program pro vides our young people a significant op portunity  to contribute  their  talents  and enthusiasm to the country, I also  believe that there are other ways to en courage national service. The Commis sion on National and Community Serv ice currently grants money  to  fund  youth  service  programs  through  schools,  through full-time youth serv ice corps, and  through demonstration  projects.  The  service  opportunities  funded by the Commission develop dis cipline,  responsibility,  teamwork,  problem-solving skills, and self-esteem.  The Commission  is  therefore  the  ideal entity  to oversee  the develop ment and  implementation of another  demonstration project. This program  would establish several nonresidential  youth corps  that would allow young  people, who had received  training ei ther  in  the National Guard Civilian  Youth Opportunities Program or in the  CCC,  to return  to  their communities  and participate in service projects. Im portantly,  these projects must serve  additional,  defense-related  purposes.  The Commission is instructed to fund  projects that will also assist in the eco nomic transition of localities affected  by  the defense conversion. The Com mission will particularly consider pro grams that rely on retired, inactive, or  discharged military personnel  to pro vide training, teaching, and mentoring  for the young corpsmembers.

342,House,102,0.739,1348,18,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to our  colleague,  the  gen tleman from New Jersey [Mr. SMITH].  ",1992
343,House,102,0.16,1348,18,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding  me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Con gressman FRANK WOLF  for his superb  leadership on pushing  for  this with drawal of MFN from  the Federal Re public of Yugoslavia. We all know Ser bia over  the  last year has been en gaged, despite its repeated denials, in  an effort to create a greater Serbia.  As the gentleman from Virginia [Mr.  WOLF]  pointed out, over a year ago  when we were  in Serbia and Croatia,  and met President Milosevic, he denied  having any designs on a greater Serbia.  The  facts  over  this  last year, Mr.  Speaker, clearly contradict those kinds  of statements.  This has been a war of aggression. It  has been a bloody war. There have been  tens of thousands of people who have  died or have been maimed, hundreds of  thousands who have been left homeless.  I would suggest that this kind of sanc tion bill is a good first step. It puts the  House again on record as being against  such terrible atrocities.  I would also  remind my colleagues  that much more has to be done. The  United Nations for its part is trying to  broker peace. The EC has tried repeat edly with cease-fires, only to fail in the  end when the war would erupt again.  It has been  largely one  sided,  al though  there  is blame, as has been  pointed out,  to go  all  around. But  again,  the aggressor clearly has been  Serbia, with Milosevic at the helm.  I ask Members to vote yes on this im portant bill.  I  think it sends a very  clear message that aggression will not  be tolerated by this body. Hopefully we  will see  that war come  to an end as  quickly as possible.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  H.R. 5258. Introduced in response to the  expansionist actions of Serbian leader,  Slobodan Milosevic, H.R.  5258 would  deny MFN status to the Federal Repub lic of Yugoslavia, which consists solely  of Serbia and Montenegro.  While  Milosevic's  atrocities  in  Bosnia have received  the spotlight of  world attention, Franjo Tudjman,  the  current dictator of Croatia and former  Communist, continues to conduct him self in an equally lawless and despica ble manner. He, too, controls military  units which  have  been moving  on  Bosnia in an attempt to persecute eth nic Serbs and Moslems  living  there,  and to carve out areas to incorporate  under Croatia's control.  Indeed, I submit for the RECORD edi torials from the New York Times and  Washington  Post  condemning  Tudjman's role  in  the devastation of  Bosnia and endorsing the extension of  the  same  sanctions  to Croatia cur rently imposed against Serbia.  Not only is this legislation an inap propriate use of the most-favored-na tion  trade status,  it will have abso lutely no effect on  trade with Yugo slavia. The United States has already  imposed a  trade embargo against the  Milosevic  regime. This  bill  unfairly  singles out Serbia with no other pur pose than to politicize an already trag ic and gruesome war.  Last week in committee, I offered an  amendment, which received bipartisan  support, to expand this bill to include a  denial of MFN for the products of Cro atia.  In my view, Croatia also bears  significant responsibility for  the bla tant denial of democratic principles  and the loss of innumerable innocent  lives  in  the  Republic  of  Bosnia Hercegovina.  If Milosevic is to be internationally  deplored for his aggression, Tudjman's  wanton disrespect  for  the  territorial  and political integrity of Bosnia, and  for the rights of ethnic minorities must  also be condemned by this body. Law less aggression should be severely sanc tioned wherever it occurs  in Eastern  Europe. This  legislation fails  in that  objective when Croatia  is  excluded.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote  ""no"" on H.R. 5258.  ",1992
344,House,102,-0.084,1374,18,Mr. VALENTINE.,"  I do, Mr. Chair man.  The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman  wish to be heard on the point of order?  ",1992
345,House,102,0.264,1387,18,Mr. HENRY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I am reminded of the  words of the late Senator Everett Dirk sen:  On this issue I have friends for it, I have  friends against it. When I vote, I  intend to  stick with my friends.  I have to admit, Mr. Chairman, that  I rise with some degree of reluctance  because of the respect I have for my  ranking member on the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology and be cause  I  share his  sense of outrage,  quite frankly, at the inability of the  minority to have an opportunity to put  forth its amendments to  this  legisla tion, as it had hoped to do, and have an  opportunity  for straight up or down  votes on those amendments. But I do  want to say that I do think that this  amendment in particular really guts a  very important part of the bill, legisla tion which,  in my  judgment,  is very  much needed by way of protecting and  promoting the manufacturing and in dustrial infrastructure of this Nation's  economy.  I want  to remind my colleagues of  James Baker's parting words when he  left  the Department of State.  In his  farewell address to his employees there  among other things he said:  We need to support civilian R&D, and lead ing edge sectors and a  research extension  network to make our discoveries available to  entrepreneurial business.  What this legislation seeks to do  is  to establish a network of manufactur ing centers that will serve to reach out  and service leading edge  technologies  in our economy.  Now, when we talk about whether or  not  this  is Government  subsidy  or  whether or not this is the right kind of  competition, we have to consider what  our economic competition is in itself  doing. For example, the United States  devotes  two-tenths of 1 percent,  two tenths of 1 percent, of its Federal R&D  budget  to  industry  technology while  Japan devotes 4.8  percent,  and Ger many 14.5 percent. Now the administra tion  in  its budget proposals  for 1993  proposed to invest $17.8 million to sup port 7 manufacturing technology cen ters while Japanese expenditures for a  similar program  totaled nearly $500  million for 169 such centers in 1988.  Mr. Chairman,  that  is competition  that we are competing against, an alli ance of Government in terms of trying  to enable manufacturing to adapt to a  very rapidly changing technology, and  of course the next section in this bill is  technology  extension  centers  across  the Nation  to  do  in manufacturing  what we have  so  ably done  in  this  country by way of agricultural exten sion, outreach, education, and support ive services in agriculture.  So, I see nothing insidious in the bill.  Quite  frankly, Mr. Chairman,  I urge  my colleagues  to support the  legisla tion and use some  independent  judg ment  in  terms of reflecting on what  they are hearing from manufacturers  in their districts. I have to tell my col leagues that in my district my manu facturers have been calling  for  this  kind of assistance and partnership with  the Government.  ",1992

My friend, the gentleman from Kan sas [Mr. ROBERTS], has alluded to the  fact that I have had more than a pass ing interest in this bill, which is true.  If I might relate a few instances, just  to refresh my colleagues' recollection,  just a very few months ago, during this  year, Senator RICHARD SHELBY had a  staffer killed, a young fellow, all my  staff and he were very friendly.  He lived in Tuscaloosa. He was leav ing his home, going to the corner store  for a pack of cigarettes. A fellow came  up to him and put a gun to his face, to  his head and killed him for no apparent  reason, wanted to get his money. And  then decided, well, he would just kill  him anyway, and he did. He shot him.  Then Gray Liddell, a young fellow at tending a staff party up here on  the  Hill, one of my staffers was there, Bill  Stiers, and he had a new Blazer he was  proud of, and so he went out to check  on it, four-wheel drive, red Blazer, and  he saw some fellow messing with his  car.  And he went on up and he said, ""Hey,  what  are you  doing,  leave my  car  alone.""  One of them just pulled out a gun and  shot and killed him right there. This is  all right here on the Capitol Hill com plex.  I think we all know the story of our  colleague,  the gentleman from Michi gan [Mr. TRAXLER], who was just walk ing down the street leaving the hotel  over here, within a stone's throw of the  Capitol. Walking to his car, fairly well lighted  place,  fellow  came  up  and  mugged him, hit him with some instru ment,  left him unconscious,  lying in  the street. And it was the Capitol Hill  Police  that  found him  lying  in  the  street.  They are the ones that came to his  rescue and saw to it that he got to a  hospital and medical attention, and he  spent several days, as we all know, in  the hospital.  Let me tell one little anecdote that I  think tells the whole story. Most of us  here remember our former colleague,  Bob Wilson from California, who is now  retired. But Bob lived up on the Hill,  and he had a code with his wife. He  would call home.  If things were not  right, she could indicate so.  A  fellow had broken  in  the home,  midday, got her butcher knife and was  ",1992
349,House,102,-0.552,1491,18,Mrs. COLLINS of Illinois.," Mr. Speak er, I thank the gentleman for yielding  me this time.  Let me say that we have worked tire lessly and for a very long time on this  piece of legislation. I especially want  to thank the chairman of the Commit tee on  the Judiciary,  the gentleman  from Texas  [Mr. BROOKS], and of the  subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  New Jersey [Mr. HUGHES], and the gen tleman  from California  [Mr. MOOR HEAD],  the ranking minority member,  and  the gentleman from North Caro lina  [Mr. MCMILLAN],  the  ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Com merce, Consumer Protection, and Com petitiveness of the Committee on En ergy and Commerce, for all the work  that they have done on this in a spirit  of comity. This is a piece of legislation  that certainly needs to be done. I think  it is a wonderful thing that we are able  to move it now.  Mr. Speaker, digital audio recording  technology  is not new and neither is  the bitter debate that persists between  the recording industry, electronic  in dustry and consumers regarding the legality of home taping. The Audio Home  Recording Act of 1992 is designed to put  an end to these debates and facilitates  the wide scale introduction of digital  audio  recording  technology  to  the  American  consumer. The  substitute  amendment to H.R. 3204 is a reflection  of the work of the Energy and Com merce, Judiciary, and Ways and Means  Committees on this important issue. I  support the final passage of this legis lation and urge the support of my col leagues.  Compact  discs  and  compact  disc  players are examples of digital  tech nology.  In  the mid-1980's, consumer  electronics companies decided to mar ket a new wave of digital audio tech nology  to American  consumers-the  digital audio recorder. Unlike  the fa miliar analog audio recorder, the digi tal audio recorder is capable of making  virtually  perfect  copies  of  source  music. With analog recorders, as one  continues to make copies from copies,  the sound quality deteriorates. With  digital audio  recorders, on  the other  hand, multigenerational copies-from  the 1st generation to the 15th genera tion-maintain virtually perfect sound  quality.  This remarkable,  innovative digital  audio technology was showcased in my  district at the 1992 International Sum mer Consumer Electronics Show.  Due to the precision of digital audio  recording  technology,  the  recording  companies, music publishers, artists,  musicians and others in the recording  industry have been afraid that the digi tal audio recorders will increase copy ing by consumers and  illegal bootleg  companies and  thereby  reduce  sales  and royal ties. For this reason, the re cording  industry has  threatened  law suits against manufacturers that con sider making digital audio  recorders  available to American consumers. The  music publishers and songwriters even tually did sue a manufacturer. This has  had a chilling effect on the manufac turers, who  have  not made  digital  audio  recording  technology  widely  available to American consumers.  Of course, the ultimate loser in this  standoff  has  been  the  American  consumer, having been denied wide ac cess to revolutionary digital audio re cording technology. This year, for the  first  time,  the  consumer electronics  show was open to the public. To dem onstrate their desire to have access to  this  technology,  scores of consumers  signed petitions at the show in support  of the three song solution to the stale mate, which is embodied in this bill.  This  compromise  solution  was  reached through difficult negotiations  by a coalition of the recording indus try; songwriters and music publishers;  electronics  industry and groups  that  want consumers to continue to enjoy  the benefits of private home taping.  There are  three basic provisions of  the  legislation. First,  it guarantees  ",1992
350,House,102,0.278,1530,18,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker,  I very  reluctantly rise in opposition to H.R. 5419 and  urge its defeat by the House.  I regret that I have to take this position be cause  the sponsor of  this bill, my colleague  GERRY STUDDS, has done a great deal to pro tect dolphins while  still  trying  to meet  the  needs of U.S. fishermen. Unfortunately, in my  view,  this bill does more  for dolphins than  it  does  for people, and on  that basis  I cannot  support it.  Our American  tuna fleet has come a long  way  from  the days when  they killed  tens of  thousands of dolphins on the high seas. Amer ican fishermen have complied with every rule  and regulation that we have imposed on them.  The problem is not with American  fleets, but  with foreign tuna fleets that do not observe the  same environmental rules. Unfortunately,  the  U.S. House of Representatives has no  juris diction over foreign  fleets, so  it is our fisher men who are being punished.  Under  this bill, U.S.  tuna  fishermen are  being put out of business during  the next 2  years. At the same time, while we have a lot  of big talk about import embargoes and inter national agreements, we are still going to see  foreign fleets killing dolphins in their tuna nets  while American  fishermen sit on  the beach  and collect unemployment checks.  Mr. Speaker, again, I want to commend Mr.  STUDDS  for what he  is  trying  to do. He  is a  strong  conservationist who believes  in  the  sound management of  fish and wildlife. He  has bent over backward to try to protect dol phins and protect American fishermen. Unfor tunately,  in this case,  the  fishermen still  lose  and I cannot support the bill.  ",1992
351,House,102,0.091,1543,18,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, and Mem bers of the House, I would like to ex press my strong support for the legisla tion before you that grants consent of  the Congress to the Maine-New Hamp shire interstate school compact. Such a  compact will  allow Maine  and New  Hampshire to explore the formation of  an interstate school compact between  neighboring  towns in Maine and New  Hampshire.  Currently  the  town of Acton, ME,  tuitions its secondary students to the  Wells-Ogunquit  Community  School  District,  but  the  distance  between  these two towns has led to long hours  of  travel, high  transportation costs,  and difficulty for students to take part  in extracurricular activities.  As a result of these concerns and oth ers, Acton has participated with  the  surrounding districts, including towns  in New Hampshire, to explore options  for  the education of  their secondary  students. By providing congressional  ratification of  the  interstate  school  compact, Maine and New Hampshire  will have an additional, and very prom ising, option  to evaluate  in  this  re spect. I kindly request your support for  this  legislation, H.R. 4841, which en ables Maine  and New Hampshire  to  choose from  the best educational op tions available.  ",1992
352,House,102,-0.404,1556,18,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, none of us  wants to see Fidel Castro in power a moment  longer. The  totalitarian nature of the regime,  the absence of democracy in Cuba, and the  credible allegations of human rights violations  suggest that the Cuban people would be well  rid of him. However, I am not sure that this bill  will accomplish his fall from power. While I in tend to vote for this bill, I am quite simply not  persuaded  that  this bill's provisions weaken  the regime's grip on the economy or the gov ernment.  I will vote  for this bill because  its authors  have partially addressed some concerns that I  had with the bill as it was originally drafted. In  its original  form,  section 1 O(c), establishing  substantial new civil penalties under the Trad ing With  the Enemy Act, would have signifi cantly hampered  the  freedoms of Americans  to travel abroad, to carry the message of de mocracy and individualism to captive peoples  desperate for contact with Americans, and to  learn about international events so as to par ticipate meaningfully in the setting of our for eign policy, as  is  their democratic right. The  reach of section 1 O(c) would far transcend our  relations with Cuba. It would affect activities in  relationship to any country embargoed under  the Trading With  the Enemy Act  [lWEA].  I  have long been concerned that, even without  the new penalties provided by H.R. 5323, the  penalties  presently  available  under TWEA  have been used by  the administration  to  in timidate United States scholars, prohibit at tendance by Americans at scholarly and pro fessional  conferences,  prevent purchase of  news wire  feeds and broadcasts of events of  public interest, and to prevent Americans from  communicating with people  in Cuba and  in  other countries. Since the new civil penalties  provided by H.R. 5323 would allow imposition  of penalties at the unilateral decision of an ad ministrative enforcement agency,  there  is a  heightened concern about  the  repetition of  such abuses.  Not only  is  this quite unnecessary  for our  national security, and a violation of the rights  of Americans,  it  is counter-productive of our  foreign policy. Experience suggests that con tact with Americans has hastened rather than  hampered  the process of democratization  in  the former Soviet bloc, and that isolation has  allowed repressive regimes elsewhere to flour ish.  As a partial response  to my concerns,  the  authors of H.R. 5323  included compromise  language, exempting some activities from the  new penalties. Under  this compromise  lan guage several  important activities would be  protected  from  the  imposition of  these civil  penalties. While  the export,  import, or trans mission of information or  informational mate rials are absolutely exempt from all regulation  and prohibition under section 5(b)(4) of  the  Trading With the Enemy Act, the Treasury de partment has attempted to restrict them never theless. The present provision would prohibit  Treasury  from using its new more easily  im posed powers  to  further attempt  to  restrict  these entirely legal activities. The present pro vision would also ensure  that Treasury does  not impose these new penalties for activities  that do not correspond to its excessively nar row definitions of what constitutes news gath ering or research. Educational,  religious, and  human rights activities would also be exempt  from the new penalties and forfeiture powers  simply  because  the  Treasury  Department  ought not  to be  in the business of deciding  when Americans should and should not en gage  in such activities.  I trust  that Treasury  will follow the clear intent of this provision, and  that it will not attempt to use these new pow ers against any such activities.  The bill's authors also agreed to reduce the  fines that may be imposed from an original fig ure of $1 00,000 to $50,000, in order to reduce  the chilling effect on protected activities, and  included administrative due process protec tions to provide additional protections.  For these reasons, I am reluctantly support ing this legislation. Given the broad support it  enjoyed in the House, I considered it the bet ter course  to seek  to mitigate some of  its  worst features.  ",1992
353,House,102,0.316,1556,18,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr.  Speaker, while  the  Cuban Democracy Act  is a well-intentioned  measure,  our  colleagues  should  note  the  harmful effects it coulq have on  foreign sub sidiaries of United States companies.  In fact, the certain cost of this legislation for  United States businesses and  their ability to  compete  in  the  international  marketplace  largely outweighs the uncertain benefits of the  impact it would have on  the Cuban Govern ment and its economy.  At  this  time of economic stagnation, our  Government 'cannot afford to burden American  businesses . with  restrictive  laws  that do  little  for the cause of promoting Cuban democracy  and prevent them from carrying out their trade  operations.  If the United States unilaterally prohibits for eign-owned subsidiaries of United States firms  from trading with Cuba, the end result will be  the loss of United States competitiveness. Our  purpose should be to  increase the economic  hardship of Cuba in order to force as change  in Government, not to increase the economic  hardship for United States companies.  In addition, since many countries prohibit  engaging  in an embargo against Cuba,  this  legislation would make subsidiaries of United  State companies choose between the laws of  their host country and the laws of the United  States.  For example,  the Canadian Government's  blocking law was designed to prevent the Unit ed States from applying a law like the Cuban  Democracy Act.  If a United States company's  subsidiary  in Canada  refuses  to  trade with  Cuba, it could face penalties of up to 5 years  in jail and $10,000 in fines.  Under current United States  law,  foreign  subsidiaries of United States companies are  permitted to trade nonstrategic goods between  Cuba and third-party countries only under the  strict licensing requirements prescribed by the  Office of Foreign Assets Control. This system  has allowed  the preservation of  the delicate  balance between U.S.  competitiveness and  astute foreign policy.  Furthermore, our Nation's Trading partners  have stated their strong opposition to this type  of measure, saying  it would constitute a bla tant violation of their right to control  the ac tions of companies doing business within their  borders. Their opposition and concerns are  understandable. If one of our trading partners  were to impose its will on businesses operat ing  inside our borders, Members of this body  would be outraged.  Given these facts, I believe that this well-in tentioned, but dangerous measure will  not  ",1992

356,,102,-0.004,1634,18,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I am introducing at the request  of the Bush administration, the Federal Credit  and Debt Management Act of 1992. Enact ment of this proposal would improve the col lection of delinquent debt and establish poli cies to prevent new delinquencies.  This bill represents another in a long line of  good government measures proposed or im plemented by the Bush administration. Follow ing enactment of the Chief Financial Officers  Act of 1990, the new OMB Deputy Director  Frank Hodsoll  and  the  new  controller  at  OMS's Office of Federal Financial Manage ment Ed Mazur have worked hard to get the  Federal Government's  financial management  house in order. They have done a fine job and  I appreciate  their assistance  in crafting  this  legislation.  The measures proposed  in  this  bill are  much needed. At the end of fiscal year 1991,  non-tax debt owed  the Federal Government  totaled about $230 billion; of this amount, $46  billion was delinquent. Outstanding Federal  guarantees totaled $653 billion.  To increase Federal agencies' ability to col lect delinquent debt, this proposal would:  First, require agencies to use aggressively  all available debt collection  techniques  in a  cost-effective manner.  Second, require agencies to refer all delin quent debt, including corporate debt, to the In ternal Revenue Service [IRS] for offset against  income tax refunds due the delinquent debt ors.  Third, simplify the assessment of late fees  on delinquent debt and authorize agencies to  retain a portion of any increase in late fees re covered as a result of the new fee structure.  Fourth, permanently authorize the Attorney  General to use private counsel to supplement  Justice Department resources  to  litigate and  collect Federal debts.  Fifth, clarify the authority of Federal agen cies to use I AS address information in the col lection of delinquent debt.  Sixth,  require  IRS  to determine annually  whether any Federal employees are delin quent on tax debt, in order to facilitate collec tion of the delinquent debt.  Seventh, clarify  that agencies are not  re quired  to  follow cumbersome administrative  offset procedures when they have a common  law right to offset in Contract disputes.  Eighth, prohibit an  individual or business  currently delinquent on a debt to the Federal  Government from receiving additional Federal  financial assistance.  Ninth, establish government  requirements  for the management of guaranteed loans,  ineluding  the use of agreements with private  lenders and loan servicers.  Tenth, allow the reporting of nondelinquent  consumer debt owed to the Federal Govern ment to credit bureaus.  A much more detailed summary is attached  to the end of these statements.  The Federal Credit and Debt Management  Act of 1992 would  increase receipts by $94  billion in fiscal year 1992, the fiscal year 1992  increase represents  the net present value  in  1992 of cash collections that will occur over  several years, and by $10 million annually  from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1997.  I certainly understand that Congress  is not  likely to focus on the measure at this late date  in the year.  I do urge my colleagues on the  Government Operations Committee  to give  this matter  their earliest attention during the  next Congress.  FEDERAL CREDIT AND DEBT MANAGEMENT ACT  OF 1992  SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS  This bill,  the ""Federal Credit and Debt  Management Act of 1992""  (the ""Act""), will  improve the collection of delinquent Federal  debt and establish policies to prevent new  delinquencies. The analysis below  summa rizes and explains the key provisions of the  Act.  Section 1, which amends 31 U.S.C. 3711, sets  forth  that Federal agencies,  including  the  Department of Justice, for debt referred by  other agencies, should be aggressive in pur suing the collection of delinquent debt owed  to the United States. Agencies would be re quired to use each available debt collection  tool  in  an  appropriate  and  cost-effective  manner.  Section 2, which amends 31 U.S.C. 3720A,  provides  that all business and  individual  Federal debt (other than child and spousal  support (see 42 U.S.C. 664)) is eligible for re ferral  to the tax refund offset program, in cluding,  in  the case of the Department of  Education, debt held by guarantee agencies  on which reimbursement or reinsurance pay ments have been made by the Federal Gov ernment. In addition, debt is to be consid ered for referral to the refund offset program  annually.  This section would authorize agency heads  to certify to the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) that all reasonable efforts have been  made to collect the debt being referred to  IRS for offset. This change will allow par ticipation in the offset program by agencies  such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor poration and the Resolution Trust Corpora tion.  A definition of ""person""  is added to this  section solely for purposes of clarity. The ad dition of this definition is not intended to  suggest that the term ""person"" in Section  3720A (or in other sections in Chapter 37 of  Title 31) does not presently include the enti ties named in the definition.  Finally, this section provides for  two ex ceptions to the effective date of the Act as  defined in Section 14. First, offsets may not  be made  to an individual's refund payable  prior to January 1, 1994,  if the agency  to  which the debt is owed has not participated  in the tax refund offset program prior to en actment. Second, offsets may not be made to  refunds for business associations if the re funds are payable prior to January 1, 1995.  Section 3, which further amends 31 U.S.C.  3720A,  clarifies that Federal agencies may  use the mailing address of a delinquent debt or obtained from the IRS (as part of the re fund offset program) for Federal-agency ad ministered debt collection purposes, includ ing referral of debt  to  the Department of  Justice for litigation. Referral of debt to pri vate collection agencies is not covered.  Section 4 adds section 3720B  to Title 31 of  the U.S. Code. This section prohibits any in dividual or business currently delinquent on  a Federal debt, including a tax debt, from ob taining additional Federal financial assist ance in the form of a loan or loan guarantee  until the delinquent debt becomes current.  Price support loans of the Commodity Credit  Corporation are excepted from  this provi sion. Only  the head of the agency or  the  agency Chief Financial Officer can waive a  debtor from the requirements of this section  upon determining that such a waiver is in  the best  interests of  the Federal Govern ment. Agencies are expected to develop pro cedures to notify delinquent debtors of the  provisions of this section.  Each agency with delinquent debts must  develop a data base of debts originated at  that agency which are delinquent, and share  that data with other Federal agencies. Such  a data base can be developed by several agen cies working together. Any pre-existing data  base that provides data on delinquent debt  may be used to serve  the purposes of this  section. Because  data  on  delinquent  tax  debts are confidential  return  information,  the  Internal Revenue Service  is only  re quired to make the information available to  the extent provided in the Internal Revenue  Code or authorities thereunder.  Finally,  loan applicants are  required  to  certify that they are not delinquent on any  Federal debt, with the prospect of criminal  penal ties  for  applicants who  knowingly  make false statements.  Section 5 adds section 3720C  to Title 31 of  the United States Code. This section expands  the authority of agencies to require the col lection of taxpayer identifying numbers from  individuals or businesses participating in di rect and guaranteed loan programs. Entities  doing business generally with  the Federal  Government  (including  those entities who  receive grants, contracts,  insurance, or  li censes from the Federal Government) are in cluded. This expansion of authority ensures  that taxpayer identifying numbers are avail able if the entity becomes delinquent on a  Federal debt in the future,  thus increasing  the effectiveness of the administrative offset  program and the tax refund offset program,  both of which are previously authorized pro grams.  Section 6, which adds section 3720D to Title  31 of the U.S. Code, establishes minimum  Governmentwide requirements for the man agement of guaranteed loan programs to pro tect  the  financial  interest of  the Federal  Government. Subsection (a) of section 3720D  requires Federal agencies to establish stand This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on. the floor.

357,Senate,102,0.687,155,23,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, our col leagues have heard me speak repeat edly about Thomas Paine. Sometimes  my mission has been to generate sup port for  the Thomas Paine Memorial  Project, other times it has been to give  a status report on our project.  Mr. President,  today,  I  rise with a  very special mission, and  that  is  to  bring to the attention of the Congress  the extraordinary generosity of the pri vate sector's support of a very memo rable and important facet of this effort.  As many of our colleagues recall, on  the evening of Thursday, September 24,  we  joined in  the Presidents Room of  the Capitol Building, EF-100, for a won derful evening of great  food and  re freshments as we honored the lifelong  contributions  to  the study of history  by Dr. Thomas Clark, of Lexington,  KY.  Dr. Clark  is known  throughout  the  Nation as a  result of his work, and  leadership as past president of the Or ganization of American Historians. In  Kentucky, Dr. Clark is nearly beatified  for his diligence as a  teacher, author,  editor. and friendI have heard only  secondhand  reports  about  his  golf  game, however.  Many of our colleagues were joined in  honoring Dr.  Clark  by  Prof.  Fred  Friendly  and  his wife Ruth;  Felix  DeWeldon, who sculpted  the magnifi cent Iwo Jima among others and Flor ence Stapleton,  the past president of  the Thomas Paine Association among  others.  Mr. President, I want to remind our  colleagues of the fact that the wonder ful evening would not have been pos sible  if  the  private  sector had not  reached deep into its pockets and do nated to the worthy cause of honoring  Dr. Clark and Thomas Paine.  These donors are: the Bingham Fund,  a  charitable organization established  by Kentucky's Bingham family which  was  joined by Toyota, U.S.A. of Ken tucky, Humana,  Inc., Long John Sil vers, and Texas Gas & Transmission in  giving generously of their financial re sources along with the Keith Stein Co.  of Boise,  ID,  and one of my  truest  friends and my historian/ophthalmol ogist, Dr. Chuck Howarth.  Additionally, we were very fortunate  to  receive generous  in-kind,  support  from  the Henley Park Hotel here  in  Washington, Hiram Walker &  Sons,  Walton Thomas International of Wash ington,  Schneider's of Capitol Hill,  Broadbent Meats who  supplied  that  wonderful ham all the way from Cadiz,  KY, Premier Beverage of Tampa, FL,  and  of  course Kentucky's Maker's  Mark Distillery.  Mr. President, without generosity of  these people and the hard work of peo ple like Shirley Felix of the Capitol Ca tering Office, Karen Portik and Celeste  Farmer of the Senate Republican Con ference, and Jeremy Chou and Trevor  Norris of my staff,  this very memo rable evening would not have  taken  place.  Mr. President, with an expression of  my deep appreciation to each of these  people, I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the supportive letter regard ing Thomas Paine expressing the will  of the Rules Committee be printed in  the RECORD for the benefit of our col leagues and researchers in the future.

358,,102,0.346,558,23,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr.  President,  today we will vote to invoke cloture on  the National Energy Policy Act of 1992.  I do not believe the legislation before  this body  represents  a  balanced  ap proach  to a national energy strategy  and therefore I cannot support the mo tion to invoke cloture.  This  legislation does not offer any  major  incentives for  the domestic oil  and gas  industry, an  industry strug gling for survival in America.  This legislation does not include lan guage  that; would authorize environ mentally sound exploration and devel opment on the coastal plain of the Arc tic National Wildlife Refuge.  During  the conference negotiations  of the so-called national energy strat egy almost all of the provisions impor tant  to Alaskans were stripped from  the bill.  Cancellation and buyback of North  Aleutian Basin oil and gas leases was  passed out of the Senate but stripped  from the bill before us.

The bill provides that  the study shall be conducted  in con junction with the State of Hawaii.  As  the chairman knows,  there are  considerable  differences between  the  State of Hawaii  and FERO  on  this  issue, and it is quite possible that these  differences will remain unresolved at  the time that the final report is issued.  Should this turn out to be the case, it  seems only reasonable that the State  of Hawaii should be permitted to have  its contrary views represented in  the  final report.

But it is impossible to  craft a  bill designed  to achieve  the  goals in questionassistance for eco nomically distressed parts of the coun try, and economic growth for the whole  country-without making  some com promises.

While  this  tax bill does have many  worthy initiatives, I am upset that the  conferees did not see fit to include an  extension of the section 29 credit for  nonconventional fuels in the final bill.  This body heard a balanced and inform ative debate on section 29,  and sup ported it with its vote. Unfortunately,  because the President boxed himself in  with his latest no new taxes pledge, we  did not have  the revenue  to pay  for  worthy initiatives like section 29. But I  ",1992
364,,102,-0.095,753,23,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of  the Jackson Farm Credit  District compromise  legislation  that  we have included in the bill before us  at this time. This provision is  the re sult of the cooperation and hard work  of many dedicated people,  including  my colleague  the Senator  from Mis sissippi, [Mr. COCHRAN], my colleagues  on the Committee on Agriculture, Nu trition, and Forestry, and in the other  body, Mr.  Chairman  DE  LA  GARZA, Chairman WHITTEN, and many  others. I was pleased to join these gen tlemen in this important effort; and I  must also salute  the outstanding ef forts of the staff of all the Members for  their work and contributions  to put ting this particular legislative package  together.  This compromise will put to rest the  long-standing and divisive controversy  surrounding the status and lending au thorities of the Farm Credit System in stitutions in the Jackson district. The  compromise here is fair. It upholds the  principles  of  local  control  while  streamlining  loan  operations  in  the  district,  in fulfillment of the district  merger provisions in the 1987 Agricul tural Credit Act.  It also  gives  the  Texas Farm Credit Bank statutory as surances about the validity of its long term  lending charter in  the Jackson  district.  BACKGROUND  The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987,  in section 410, mandated  the merger,  within 6 months after enactment-that  is, by July 6, 1988-of the Federal Inter mediate Credit Bank  [FICB] and  the  Federal Land Bank [FLB]  in each of  the 12 Farm Credit districts through out the United States. The banks cre ated by section 410 mergers are called  Farm Credit Banks [FCB's] and handle  both short-term and long-term lending  to  farmers  and  ranchers within  the  Farm Credit System.  The 1987 act did not, however, include  the mandated consolidation of the 12  Farm Credit districts called for in the  earlier House version of the legislation.  The whole  issue of local control and  consolidation of districts was a conten tious matter during the 1987 congres sional debate; and the middle ground  position  reached by Congress was  a  finely balanced compromise.  In 11 of the 12 Farm Credit districts,  the merger/creation of FCB's under sec tion 410 of the 1987 act took place on  schedule. However,  the FCA failed  to  charter an FCB in the Jackson district  because FCA had decided to place the  Jackson FLB into receivership rather  than allow comprehensive assistance  under the 1987 act to be provided to the  district.  The Jackson FICB. nonetheless, tried  to remedy the situation during 1988 and  1989 by looking for a FCB to be a vol untary merger partner.  Meanwhile, early in 1989. the FCA ap proved a sale of a number of long-term  loans of the Jackson FLB in receiver ship  to  the Texas FCB, at  the same  time amending the Texas bank's char ter to permit it to make new long-term  loans in the Jackson district. In issu ing that charter extension, the FCA for  the first time in history split the long term and short-term lending authority  in  a  Farm Credit District  between  banks based in different districts.  Then, in  the spring of 1989, FCA in terrupted  the  Jackson  FICB's  vol untary merger process by instructing  it to merge with the Texas FCB under  section 410-using the legal theory that  the Texas  bank was  the  functional  equivalent of a FLB in the Jackson dis trict. The FICB successfully appealed  this FCA decision  to  the courts.  In  February 1991,  the U.S. Court of Ap peals for the Fourth Circuit ruled de finitively that section 410 did not give  FCA authority to force the merger and  consolidation of districts.  After the court decision, things in a  sense came to a stand-still as to the fu ture of the Jackson district; and this  legislation  is designed  to get  things  moving toward a final resolution of the  status of the district that retains the  rights the courts have given the FICB  and its associations to determine their  own destiny.  WHAT THE LEG!Sl,A'l'ION DOES  The language in this legislation puts  in  place  a  carefully  tuned,  orderly  mechanism to resolve the situation in  the Jackson district by facilitating a  merger of the Jackson FICB with an other Farm Credit Bank after a vote of  the  farm-borrowers and share-holders  in the three States of Alabama, Louisi ana, and Mississippi.  If that merger  process fails,  the legislation then pro vides  for  a mandated but arbitrated  merger with  the Texas Farm Credit  Bank.  I support the compromise included in  this  legislation based on my under standing of how it will work to accom plish the merger of the FICB of Jack son with a Farm Credit Bank.  First,  the Jackson FICB will have  until  June 30,  1993,  to  find  its own  merger partner from among any of the  other Farm Credit Banks in the Farm  Credit System.  Under the provisions of the bill, the  FCA will not be able to interfere with  the Jackson bank's merger efforts dur ing this window of opportunity, lasting  until June 30, 1993, except to the extent  that the regulator must exercise its duties under the Farm Credit Act to bar  unsafe and unsound practices. In that  regard, the FCA under this bill has ex actly the sameno more and no less- supervisory powers over  the Jackson  bank  than  it would  otherwise  have  under the other provisions of the Farm  Credit Act  to ensure  the safety and  soundness  of  system  institutions.  Moreover,  those  powers  are  limited  under  the same administrative stand ard as in the rest of the Farm Credit  Act.  Nor will  the Farm Credit Bank of  Texas have any authority under  the  statute to interfere with  the Jackson  bank's merger efforts during this time.  Another key provision of this bill is  that the Jackson FICB and its intended  merger partner may request a one-time  extension  if they need a  little more  time  to work out  the details of  the  merger.  If Jackson and  its  intended  merger partner submit a  letter of in tent to the FCA,  the FCA has the re sponsibility  to  extend  the  deadline.  The FCA cannot deny or revoke the ex tension except for  the most clear sig nals that the deal has actually fallen  through.  During  this window of opportunity,  under the authorities that the Jackson  district production credit associations  have  under  current  law  to  affiliate  with any Farm Credit Bank, if North west Louisiana PCA does not agree  with the deal it may opt out and affili ate with a different bank. After  the  merger of  the  Jackson district,  the  Jackson production credit associations  are free to reaffiliate with another dis trict bank under the usual procedures  already set up elsewhere in the Farm  Credit Act. Again, principles of local  control are upheld  for  the benefit of  the farmers and ranchers  in  the dis trict.  Only if the Jackson bank fails to find  a merger partner in the time period al lowed in the bill will it be mandated to  merge with  the Texas Farm Credit  Bank. Even then, the bill protects the  farmer-borrowers and shareholders of  both banks. The whole matter will be  put to an arbitrator to decide the best  terms of merger for both banks and the  System as a whole.  To ensure  that  the  rights of both  sides are fully protected and to ensure  that both districts are  treated with  equal respect and deference, the bill is  constructed to give the arbitrator-not  one bank or the other, nor the FCA broad power  to  initiate  the develop ment of, and refine, the merger terms.  Both banks  involved  in  the man dated, arbitrated merger will be able to  present their own plans for structuring  the new bank  for  the combined dis tricts, and they may present whatever  information that would support  their  preferred plan. Their assets will be set  at book value.  Whichever  way  the  merger  is  reached, when the merger is completed,  ",1992
365,Senate,102,-0.314,1208,23,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, yesterday  the Senate passed H.R. 5716, a bill to  reauthorize the Office of Justice Pro grams [OJP]. This Program forms the  sole link between the Federal Govern ment and the State and local law en forcement  agencies  that  fight  the  scourge of crime everyday.  This bill  reauthorizes  these offices  for 2 years.  While this bill has only the necessary  interim effect  to keep these valuable  programs going for the next 2 years, it  is clear to me that the office is in need  of many  improvements. This  office  should be beholden only to the needs of  the front lines and not subject to inside  the beltway political bickering. Earlier  this year I held hearings on the reau thorization of the Office of Justice Pro grams which were helpful and insight ful; yet  they yielded one undeniable  fact-the Office needs  to be more re sponsive to the needs of law enforce ment.  During this Congress, I had intended  to introduce a reauthorization package  for the Office of Justice Programs. But  the gridlock over the crime bill hin dered any attempt to restructure this  office and better aid law enforcement  throughout the country.  During the 103d Congress I plan to in troduce a  reauthorization bill-based  on the hearings held by the Judiciary  Committee-that will ensure that the  Office of Justice Programs rises above  politics and helps  the Nation's crime  fighters  in the most efficient manner  possible.

366,Senate,102,0.014,1286,23,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Pre13ident, I rise  to make a  few comments concerning  USIA's Exchange Visitor Au Pair Pro gram.  In 1986, at the request of USIA, World  Learning,  then known as  the Experi ment in International Living, I agreed  to participate in a 2-year pilot au pair  exchange visitor program. The purpose  of  this pilot program was  twofoldfirst, to experiment with programs de signed to stem the declining participa tion of American host families in for eign exchange programs; and second, to  develop an exchange visitor au pair  program that met USIA's standards for  quality exchange experiences.  In 1988, after a change in personnel in  USIA's Office of General Counsel,  the  first  question was  raised  regarding  USIA's authority to administer an ex change visitor program containing a  child care component of up to 45 hours  a week. Senators LEAHY and STAFFORD  among others in Congress, challenged  this question and asked the American  Law Division of the Congressional Re search Service to analyze USIA's au thority. CRS concluded that USIA was  fully authorized to administer this pro gram as  formulated  in  the original  pilot proposal.  I want to underline the fact that the  hours of the child care component were  not  ""discovered""  or ""found""  by  an  oversight panel but were contained in  the  original  proposal  approved  by  USIA's Office of General Counsel. The  purpose of the oversight panel was to  evaluate the quality of the overall ex change program,  including questions  pertaining to the quality of the host  family selection process,  the orienta tion process for families and exchange  students,  the availability of support,  cultural programs and program over sight. The panel's findings  on  these  substantive matters were very positive.  In addition to the evidence provided  by CRS,  the U.S. Congress has now  twice prohibited USIA from terminat ing the program. This highly unusual  action reflects the view that this pro gram meets a critical need for private  exchange programs and that USIA  is  clearly within  its authority  to  con tinue administration of this excellent  program.   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR ALAN  DIXON  ",1992
367,,102,-0.388,1325,23,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of this legislation to regulate our Nation's pay per-call  industry.  I would  like  to commend  Chairmen SWIFT and MARKEY  for  their hard  work on this bill, and I thank them for including  my provision  to stop pay-per-call companies  from taking advantage of our Nation's senior  citizens.  Some time ago a constituent contacted me  to share her frustration at having been the vic tim of a 1-900 scam. She spent more than 5  minutes, at $2 a minute, trying to get informa tion about Medicare from a private company  that tried to create the impression that it was  run by the Federal Government.  Although  the 900  telephone  line  industry  has brought many services to Americans, we  cannot let private companies defraud unknow ing citizens.  My amendment will ensure that private com panies do not trick consumers  into believing  they are government-run or government-spon sored. It requires that 900 lines that appear as  if they may be government programs or serv ices  contain  a message  in  their  opening  audiotext specifying that their services are not  approved or endorsed by the Federal Govern ment.  Our Nation's senior citizens deserve  the  most accurate and helpful  information about  the programs they rely on. Passing this bill is  an important step in preventing unscrupulous  companies from profiting by deceiving them. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  DEPARTURE OF REPRESENTATIVE  SID MORRISON  HON. NORMAN D. DICKS  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 8, 1992  ",1992
368,,102,-0.312,1325,23,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Speaker,  I am addressing  the House today on behalf of the entire Wash ington State congressional delegation in order  to pay tribute to Congressman SID MORRISON,  who will not be with us for the 1 03d Congress.  SID was  first elected in 1980 and since  that  time has been a Representative in the truest  sense of  the word. He has diligently  rep resented the views and concerns of the peo ple of the fourth district of Washington, includ ing the agricultural interests, small businesses,  and the high technology community in the Tri Cities. And most recently, he has served as a  mediator, a broker of ideas and, at times, a  referee on the contentious spotted owl/timber  crisis situation that has  impacted  the Pacific  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Northwest. As we wish him well, I wanted the  Members of the House to see a copy of a let ter that our Washington State delegation in the  House has sent to SID,  thanking him for his  significant contributions to the success of our  collective efforts. I am enclosing a copy of that  letter for the RECORD.  CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, October 10, 1992.  DEAR SID: We are taking this opportunity,  as the 102nd Congress comes to an end,  to  send a special note of thanks to you for the  diligence, persistence and perseverance you  demonstrated in guiding our delegation's ef forts to achieve a balance solution to the Pa cific Northwest timber supply crisis. It is fit ting and necessary at this point, we believe,  to recognize officially the difficult task you  accepted and  the conscientious work  that  you did in keeping our collective view fixed  upon a national and reasonable solution to  the Northwest's most urgent natural  re source  conflict. As  the  ""convener"" of an  unending  series  of  (unending)  delegation  meetings in 1434 Longworth, you have dis played the valuable trait of a marathon run ner: an awareness that this is a long-distance  race with no easy sprint to victory. It has  been that recognition on your part, most es pecially, that has kept us moving forward  through the most difficult periods of impasse  and disagreement and which has resulted in  significant strides  toward the development  of a cogent  timber strategy  in  this 102nd  Congress.  All of us owe a great debt to you, Sid, for  your vision and for your strength. We will  miss you for you insight and for your persist ence as a convener, but most of all we will  miss you as a friend. Best wishes in all your  future endeavors.  Sincerely,  TOM FOLEY.

TAYLOR  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 8, 1992  ",1992
369,,102,0.488,1325,23,Mr. TAYLOR of North Carolina.," Mr. Speak er, I am here to inform this House and the Na tion about an upcoming event  in Cleveland  County, NC, on October 17. Our  individual  communities are steeped in culture, traditions,  and special foods that represent the diversity  and richness of our heritage. And so, on Octo ber 17,  the people of the Cleveland County  area will be celebrating Livermush Expo 1992.  Livermush  is made by combining some of  the  ""finer"" parts of  the  pig,  including  the  ""snoots,"" together with spices and cornmeal.  This wonderful cuisine was first sold commer cially in the 1920's and became a staple dur ing the Depression. Its virtues were first cele brated  in October 1987 when  the Cleveland  County Commissioners and  the Shelby City  Council passed  resolutions proclaiming  that  ""livermush  is  the most delicious, most eco nomical, and most versatile of meats."" Well,  that made what most people of the area al34795  ready know official. There was nothing left to  do but proclaim the first Livermush Exposition.  I have sent invitations to our national lead ers,  including both Presidential  candidates,  and some word about the excitement of the  occasion is beginning to drift in.  President Bush has indicated that while he  does not care  for broccoli, he  is certain he  would love livermush. After all, pork rinds are  one of his  favorite  foods. And  if you  look  under the skin of any pork rind eater, you will  find the makings of a livermush lover.  It has been said that Presidential candidate  Bill Clinton has tried livermush but swears he  didn't swallow.  Its certain he would  like  it  though, since the University of Arkansas has  a few ""Hawgs.""  Vice President Quayle must love livermush  because when asked  to spell  it, he wrote  down ""G-0-0-D-E.""  And Senator AL GORE said that he may in clude the story of livermush in his next book  on the environment since livermush is the best  example of recycling he knows.  Some of you may  think  that  this  is much  ado about nothing, but as this t-shirt says, the  Livermush Expo  92  is  ""Mush Ado About  Something.""  Mack's Livermush of Shelby, NC, Hunter  Livermush of Marion, NC, and others will be  displaying their products on the 17th. Harriet  Holton will  demonstrate  several  uses  of  livermush,  perhaps  a  livermush Christmas  tree. They will be serving  livermush at  the  Shelby Cafe on Main Street, and Harley Hog  and the Rockers will be playing. Kids will be  entertained by pot belly pigs and events at the  piglet pen. Elvis is expected to make an ap pearance.  Everyone may not make it to Hog Heaven  but it's a sow certainty that everyone will be  welcomed at the October 17 Livermush Expo  in Shelby, NC.  THE  LOWER MISSISSIPPI DELTA  DEVELOPMENT FINANCING COR PORATION ACT  HON. Bill EMERSON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 8, 1992  ",1992
370,,102,0.332,1325,23,Mr. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to join with my friend and colleague from Mis sissippi, Mr. ESPY,  in  introducing  the Lower  Mississippi Delta Development Financing Cor poration Act. Today represents the culmination  of years of hard work, and we have an excel lent product as a result. I commend Mr. ESPY  and others who have worked on this project  for all of their fine work.  The  lower Mississippi Delta  region of  the  country consists of 219 counties and parishes  that are among  the Nation's poorest. When  the  Lower Mississippi Delta Development  Commission issued its report in May 1990, the  statistics were eye opening. Substantial pov erty, poor health, high infant mortality, lack of  education, and  lack of suitable  infrastructure  are among the factors which have limited the  opportunities available to residents of the delta  region.  Despite these adverse conditions, the peo ple of the delta prefer hope to despair. They  ",1992
371,,102,0.017,1351,23,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, Senator  ALAN CRANSTON has been a genuine friend to  veterans and their families throughout his dis tinguished career.  I just want to take this op portunity to thank him for his work in the Sen34821  ate and  for our friendship. Our two commit tees, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, have al ways worked together very closely under his  leadership. Because of that, we've been able  to get a lot of important legislation through the  Congress.  Many of the programs administered by the  VA are healthy and successful because of  ALAN'S efforts. There's no way I could cover all  of his achievements, but many are landmark.  He's the architect of the Veterans Readjust ment Counseling Program, which has grown  to almost 200 vet centers since ALAN'S legisla tion was enacted in 1979. Vietnam veterans in  particular owe a great debt of gratitude  to  ALAN for his labors in their behalf.  He has  led efforts  to provide  responsible  education, rehabilitation, and employment ben efits  to veterans; he's worked  to strengthen  the housing program; he was  instrumental  in  the establishment of the Court of Veterans Ap peals and  in getting  the VA upgraded  to a  Cabinet Department.  As the principal Senate author of all veter ans' health care  legislation enacted since he  came to Congress, he's been a watchdog over  health care benefits. ALAN played a major role  in helping thousands more veterans gain ac cess to VA health care by increasing the em phasis on outpatient treatment, which  is  less  costly.  His efforts were crucial  in making certain  that  the proposal  to  tax veterans' disability  compensation never saw the light of day, and  he's been especially outspoken on budget  matters and has taken OMB to task for its irre sponsible proposals.  This brief summary doesn't do  justice  to  ALAN's accomplishments. Suffice it to say that  not once  in his 24-year Senate career has  ALAN CRANSTON ever let our veterans down.  ALAN, as you head back to California, rest as sured that we're going to keep watch over all  your good works. Thank you for a job excep tionally well done.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JAKE GARN  HON.

372,,102,0.238,1390,23,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, today  I rise  in  honor of the late chairman, Walter B. Jones,  under whose  leadership  the Committee on  Merchant Marine and Fisheries established it self as one of  the most bipartisan and dy namic organizations within Congress.  As a member of the minority party, I began  my first term in 1984 and was granted my re quest to serve on Merchant Marine and Fish eries.  In a very short period of time, I began  to realize that behind the committee's success  and vitality was the fairness Walter Jones ex tended to all the committee members-regard less of their partisan loyalties.  Issues were examined with factual integrity,  regional sensitivity, and national need. The de gree of expertise on committee staff is excep tional and the cooperation extended to Mem bers has been a characteristic unique in my 8  year~ experience here in Congress.  However, Walter Jones will not only be  missed for his fairness  in leadership but also  for his quick wit and sense of humor which  characterized his style of southern charm and  diplomacy.  It was an honor to serve with him.  MINNESOTA  STATE  UNIVERSITY  STUDENT  ASSOCIATION  CELE BRATES ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. TIMOTIIY J.

373,,102,-0.051,1390,23,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Speaker, while a student at  Winona State University  I participated  in  the  Minnesota State University Student Associa tion  [MSUSA] as an officer and a concerned  student. My experience in MSUSA helped pre pare me for future leadership positions includ ing being  the  first student on  the Minnesota  State University Board, a member of the Min nesota State Senate, and a Member of Con gress. On November 6, 1992, MSUSA will cel ebrate its 25th anniversary representing Min nesota State University students at its annual  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  fall conference. I will be addressing MSUSA at  a dinner to recognize both this occasion and  the fifth anniversary of the Penny Fellowship,  which was created by MSUSA to encourage  students to take a leadership role  in serving  their communities.  MSUSA was formed in 1967 as an informal  coalition of student leaders to represent their  peers at the seven State universities in Min nesota-Bemidji, Mankato, Metropolitan (Twin  Cities), Moorhead, St. Cloud, Southwest (Mar shall) and Winona. A branch campus in Akita,  Japan opened in 1990. Today the association  has evolved  into an  independent, nonprofit  corporation, funded and operated by students,  serving more than 66,000 students.  MSUSA has encouraged students  to be come active participants in the decisions that  affect them, working on behalf of many valued  causes over the years. State university stu dents have worked to establish child care fa cilities and stabilize State  tuition. They have  advocated  increased work-study wages, sim plified transfer between State universities, im proved  cultural  diversity,  and made  great  strides toward fairer State and Federal finan cial aid programs, including the recently com pleted Higher Education Act reauthorization.  There are many admirable programs spon sored by  this student association. MSUSA's  various legislative liaisons have given students  the opportunity to voice their concerns at criti cal points, in the decisionmaking process. The  Monitor, the association's newspaper, has the  largest circulation of any State system news paper, and the MSUSA Federal Credit Union,  based at Mankato State University, is the only  systemwide student credit union in the coun try.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to finally recognize  the current officers of MSUSA: Steven B.  Carswell, State chair from Winona State Uni versity; Leroy L. McClelland, State vice chair  from Mankato State University; Jill F. Peter son, State treasurer from St. Cloud State Uni versity; and Frank X. Viggiano, executive di rector from Metropolitan State University. I ex tend my congratulations and wish  them all  success on this occasion.  A TRIBUTE TO NORMA L. COW ART  HON. CARROil HUBBARD, JR.

A native of Sebree, in Webster County, KY,  Norma  L. Cowart was valedictorian of  the  Sebree High School class of 1955. She at tended Western Kentucky University in Bowl ing Green, KY, and St. Louis School of Nurs ing in St. Louis, MO.  Marriage took Norma to San Diego, CA, in  1968.  From 1985 until her death Norma L. Cowart  served as administrative assistant at the Cali fornia School of Professional Psychology  in  San Diego. She was an expert in the field of  mental health. Norma L. Cowart was of much  October 9, 1992  ill in  in Kentucky  help to  thousands of people with whom she  came in contact.  She was known and admired  and California.  The session on March 16 of the 1992 Ken tucky General Assembly was adjourned  in  honor of Norma L. Cowart upon a motion by  State Senator Henry Lackey of Henderson,  KY.  On February 4  this year, at a memorial  service honoring the life of Norma L. Cowart,  Dr. Thomas F. McGee, director of the Califor nia School of Professional Psychology, said at  All Saints Episcopal Church in San Diego:  When Norma Cowart became  the  summer of 1989 she was beset by considerable  pain and uncertainty. Yet she performed her  work admirably and also remained available  to others. As Norma grappled with a  life  threatening illness she taught us profound  lessons  about dignity,  determination  and  quiet courage.  An active member of the California Demo cratic Party, Norma L. Cowart was a delegate  to  the California Democratic Convention  in  1988 and served several years as treasurer of  the Clairemont-Mesa Democratic Club in San  Diego.  Norma Cowart's mother, Martine Mccurry  Wise of Sebree, KY, is one of my favorite con stituents, a dear friend and always has been  very active in my election campaigns. Martine  Wise  is a beloved, outstanding Kentuckian  who was always so proud of her only child.  Norma Cowart's father  is highly  respected  Herbert Melton of Sebree, who  is naturally  also very proud of his daughter's accomplish ments.  Other survivors  include Norma's husband,  Richard  Lee Cowart of San Diego;  three  sons-Mark Wheetley and Jeff Wheetley, both  of Oakland, CA, and Greg Wheetley, of Hud son, FL; and two stepdaughters-Lisa Lucas  of San Diego and Sue MacBride of Carlsbad,  CA.
